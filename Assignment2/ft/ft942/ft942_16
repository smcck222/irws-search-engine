FT  06 JUN 94 / Consumer credit 'shows fall but 31% up on year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers took out 8 per cent less credit in April than in March, according
to figures released by the Finance and Leasing Association today.
The figures are not seasonally adjusted, however, and may reflect the
restricted number of trading days in April because of the Easter holidays.
Compared with April 1993 consumer credit showed a 31 per cent increase at
Pounds 1.34bn, the association said.
Economists have been watching for evidence that consumer behaviour has been
affected by the impact of April's tax increases on pay packets.
The seasonal effects on the association's figures makes it difficult to draw
firm conclusions. Official figures for April's consumer credit are published
today.
There was further evidence of a diverging trend between credit on store
cards and credit for larger items such as personal loans or car finance.
Store-card credit fell just 3 per cent between March and April and was still
46 per cent higher than a year ago. Both personal loans and motor finance
saw a 12 per cent fall between March and April, and are respectively only 19
per cent and 25 per cent higher than a year ago.
Business finance showed a fall in the rate of growth, with April's leasing
total 17 per cent lower than a year ago. Hire purchase was up 25 per cent
year-on-year.
Mr David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, said: 'Although there are
indications of an economic upturn, there seems to be a wait and see attitude
among businesses. They still need to be convinced that the recovery will
last before making investment commitments.'
Figures from Infolink, the credit information group, show that credit
applications in the retail sector in April were 10.7 per cent higher than in
April last year.
The annual rate of increase for home-loan applications, and for new-car
loans, fell between March and April.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Benefits plan for lottery system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Lottery's computer system could be used to pay out pensions and
social security benefits, says G-Tech, a member of the Camelot consortium
which will operate the UK lottery.
The company uses a system based on the technology it has developed for
running state lotteries to pay social security benefits in parts of the US.
The end of the traditional pension and benefit books was signalled last
month when Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told sub-postmasters
that he hoped to introduce computer terminals in every post office to
replace the 57m order books used to pay Pounds 80bn of benefits every year.
G-Tech has confirmed a report in the magazine Electronics Times that
benefits payments could be integrated into the network of terminals it will
install to record entries for the weekly draw. Post offices would have two
swipe-card terminals: one for the lottery and one for benefit payments.
Mr Lilley said that all benefit recipients could be issued with a social
security payment card to be swiped through a terminal to authorise the
payment and specify the amount. The aim would be to save on the Pounds
550m-a-year bill for paying through order books, and to reduce losses
through fraud estimated at Pounds 120m a year.
Mr Craig Watson, vice-president for public affairs at G-Tech, said the
system could be run on the same network as the lottery.
The Camelot consortium plans to install 35,000 terminals in post offices,
shops and garages to record lottery entries, connected to a central computer
at Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire.
G-Tech pays benefits to 700,000 people in New York city, and has won a
contract to set up an electronic benefit transfer system for Texas.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Industry image set for another battering: Employers and
ex-sales agents are preparing for battles in the courtroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arcane phrase 'commission clawback' will soon start reverberating
through the courts as part of an extraordinary battle between some of
Britain's biggest insurers and hundreds of their former sales agents.
At stake are several tens of millions of pounds in lost earnings and fees
which an estimated 400 to 1,000 agents claim they are owed by their former
companies. In many of these cases the agents have themselves been issued
with writs from their former companies, arguing that they should repay large
sums of commission paid on insurance policies that have lapsed.
The courtroom recriminations - assuming enough cases reach trial rather than
being settled privately - are likely further to harm the image of the
insurance industry.
By concentrating on the often complex and contentious relationship between
companies and their sales staffs, the court cases will shed more light on
the patchy nature of the controls over sales agents which has been a factor
behind recent allegations of mis-selling of life products such as pensions.
They may also lead, however unlikely this appears, to a surge of public
sympathy for life insurance agents - who are generally portrayed as sharks
attempting to extort money out of unsuspecting consumers.
Mr Tony Whiteley of the MSF general technical union said: 'A lot of these
people are not villains but victims.' The union is co-ordinating legal help
for several hundred former agents.
In the late 1980s the life industry expanded enormously, taking on tens of
thousands of sales agents to sell products such as life insurance and
private pensions to cash-rich consumers.
However, the recession and tougher regulations introduced by the industry's
regulator Lautro, which have raised the quality threshold for sales staff,
have encouraged insurers to shed agents. The number of registered agents has
shrunk by half since 1990 to about 100,000.
Many of the agents who have lost their jobs, most of whom were
self-employed, had their contracts terminated.
Partly because of the complexity of these contracts and the way insurance
companies stage commission payments to sales representatives over a long
period, the parting has often been acrimonious.
A crucial area of dispute concerns the repayment of loans, often amounting
to tens of thousands of pounds, which many companies handed to sales people
 -particularly 'tied agents' working at arms-length - during the 1980s
expansion.
Even more contentious have been altercations over commission clawback -
efforts by insurance companies to reclaim commission paid to sales agents on
life products that lapsed after the client stopped paying premiums.
An insidious part of the clawback practice - as far as many former sales
people are concerned - is that under Lautro rules once they have run up a
debt of more than Pounds 1,000 on clawback they are not allowed to work for
other insurance companies. In some cases this has severely limited their
chances of finding alternative employment.
Take Mr Vojislav (Joe) Sujdovic, who sold insurance and pensions for
Guardian Royal Exchange between 1988 and 1990. According to Mr Sujdovic GRE
is claiming Pounds 53,000 from him on the basis of 'clawback'. He says that
because of the debt he has been unable to get another insurance job. He now
works as a Pounds 100-a-week garage attendant, earning a tenth of what he
made at GRE.
In Mr Sujdovic's case - which has yet to come to court and which GRE did not
want to comment on - he has countered the clawback claim with a writ
alleging that GRE owes him Pounds 69,000 on unpaid commission and lost
earnings.
The sums of money involved in this case are dwarfed by some of the amounts
in other disputes.
Mr Chris Price, a former Legal &amp; General agent, is pursuing his former
company for about Pounds 100,000 in loss of income and commission payments.
Mr Joseph Meade, a former Pounds 75,000-a-year Colonial Mutual salesman who
is now seeking work in Thailand, has a claim for damages and wrongful
termination of contract against his company for Pounds 500,000.
In both these cases the companies involved also have claims against the two
men - of about Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 91,000 respectively.
While Legal &amp; General said it pursued legal action only after thinking 'long
and hard' and did not want to discuss individual cases, Colonial Mutual said
there had been a 'breakdown in the relationship' with Mr Meade. It felt it
was pursuing the matter fairly.
Probably the biggest claim is that being made through a writ by Mr Hugh
Beaumont, a former GRE agent who reckons the company owes him Pounds 2.5m
due to loss of earnings and commission. In this case GRE has a counter-claim
calling for repayment of Pounds 119,000 on a repayable development grant and
commission.
Assuming the case gets to a High Court trial - which is unlikely before the
middle of next year at the earliest - critics and supporters of the
insurance industry alike will be packing the aisles. The public image of the
industry will be in for another battering.

FT  06 JUN 94 / City prosperity boosts pay in finance sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managerial pay increases in the finance sector averaged 3.7 per cent in the
first quarter compared with 2.9 per cent in the final three months of last
year, says the latest survey of managerial pay published today by Incomes
Data Services, the independent research body.
The return of economic prosperity in the City of London was one of the
factors explaining the upturn, IDS said.
Of the top five managerial pay awards in the first quarter of the year in
the sector, three were paid by City institutions. However, increases were
mainly based on merit and performance payments.
'The basic salary budget increases for these employers ranged from 5.9 per
cent to 7 per cent,' the report said. It added: 'Because these pay-bill
figures include support staff, they tend to understate the actual salary
rises paid to 'front office' professionals such as dealers.'
IDS added that the high City pay rises were 'not simply driven by an upturn
in economic activity' but also reflected 'the re-emergence of recruitment
and retention problems'.
Overall, private-sector managerial pay awards averaged 3.1 per cent over the
first quarter. Manufacturing averaged 2.8 per cent.
In a separate report on overall pay trends, IDS says there is a 'gentle
upswing' in the level of pay settlements with nearly half the 129 wage
settlements reported to it in April running at 3 per cent and above. But the
survey suggests there are 'few signs of an inflationary spiral developing'.
However, Industrial Relations Services, another independent research
organisation, suggests there has been 'no further pick-up in the level of
pay settlements since annual pay awards moved upward' at the start of 1994.
In its latest pay survey, IRS suggests basic wage increases in the private
sector were 'holding steady at 2.5 per cent' in the three months to the end
of April.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Ruling on Gibraltar killings welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission of Human Rights' ruling that Special Air Service
soldiers did not use unnecessary force in killing three IRA members in
Gibraltar was welcomed by the government yesterday.
The families of Daniel McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage, who brought
the case, were heartened by the decision to refer it to the European Court
of Human Rights, which will make the final decision.
The Foreign Office said: 'The government naturally welcomes the commission's
findings. We will continue vigorously to defend our actions in the
forthcoming court proceedings.'
The Strasbourg-based commission advises the European Court - but the final
ruling rests with the court. The case is not expected to be heard until next
year.
The relatives said the 1988 shootings were a breach of the European
Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards 'the right to life', but the
commission decided that the SAS was justified in opening fire because of the
risk that the IRA members could have been armed or about to detonate a bomb.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Gibraltar killings referred to Euro-court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Relatives of the three IRA members killed by Special Air Service troops in
Gibraltar six years ago yesterday welcomed the decision to refer the case to
the European Court of Human Rights.
The relatives said in a joint statement: 'This means that the case will be
finally decided by the court, in a full and public judicial hearing.'
The decision to refer the case was taken by the European Commission on Human
Rights, which also decided that SAS men who killed unarmed IRA members
Daniel McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage did not use excessive
violence.
The Strasbourg-based commission advises the European Court of Human Rights -
but the final ruling still rests with the court.
The relatives appealed to the commission after losing their fight against
the government in the British courts, saying the March 1988 shootings were a
breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
But the commission decided that the SAS soldiers were justified in opening
fire because of the risk that the IRA members were armed or could be about
to detonate a bomb.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Insurers face rush of unfair dismissal claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of Britain's leading insurers, already under fire after allegations of
large-scale mis-selling of life policies, face legal claims estimated at
tens of millions of pounds from hundreds of their former sales agents who
are claiming unfair dismissal or loss of earnings.
About 100,000 sales agents have lost their jobs during the past four years
and more than 400 are believed to have filed claims through solicitors, with
possibly hundreds more in the pipeline.
Many of the former representatives are also being sued by their former
companies because of claims for repayment of loans or commission paid out on
policies that have lapsed. The amount at stake in these claims is put at up
to Pounds 20m.
According to Mr Witold Pawlak, a barrister involved with 40 cases, none of
which has yet come to a trial, those cases which have been filed 'represent
the tip of the problem' facing the life industry.
While the insurance industry is playing down the problem, evidence of such a
large-scale breakdown in relations between the companies and their former
representatives is a further blow to the business after revelations of poor
control of sales activities and a series of big fines handed out to leading
companies by Lautro, the industry regulator.
Legal &amp; General, Guardian Royal Exchange and the UK arm of Australian
insurer Colonial Mutual are believed to be involved with substantial numbers
of disputes, although none wanted to specify a figure. Royal Insurance,
Allied Dunbar and Sun Alliance also face claims.
Legal &amp; General declined to discuss the number of cases or how much money
was involved because 'we don't want to hang up our dirty washing in public',
while GRE said it was 'behaving reasonably' in trying to recover commission
on lapsed policies. Colonial Mutual would not discuss the number of cases,
saying it preferred 'to let legal proceedings run their course'.
In most instances the former sales people were self-employed or working
through arms-length 'tied agents'. Few of the disputes, being handled by a
network of about 40 firms of solicitors around Britain, have come to trial,
so their eventual outcome is unclear. Mr Alex Bevan, of Bristol solicitors
Bevans, said there were probably between 400 and 1,000 individual disputes,
with hundreds of thousands of pounds at issue in some cases.
Mr Robin Bloom, a partner in Middlesbrough legal firm Jacksons, said: 'It
would not be fanciful to think that up to Pounds 100m (in disputed claims)
might be involved. No one seems to have analysed the consequences for the
companies.'

<TEXT>
Taiwan's Environment Ministry has launched an investigation into allegations
that France's Thomson Consumer Electronics and US-based RCA dumped organic
wastes near factory sites, polluting soil and groundwater over 20 years.
Chinese New party legislator Jaw Shau-Kong, former head of the Environmental
Protection Administration, had accused Thomson, which bought the two
factories south of Taipei in late 1987, of covering up the extent of the
damage. The EPA promised legal action against the companies involved if the
water supply had been contaminated and proof of a cover-up found.
RCA built the factories in 1970, and they became the property of General
Electric of the US in 1986 when GE took over RCA, according to Mr William
Betke, Taiwan general manager of General Electric Technical Services.
A spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics said from Paris: 'To the best
of our knowledge, Thomson did not violate any environmental laws or
regulations during the time the company owned the properties.'
Thomson sold the sites in 1991 and 1992 to local conglomerates, which
apparently plan to use them for commercial and residential purposes.
An EPA spokesman said the results of the investigation would be made public
next week.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Coup for Russia's arms salesdrive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An agreement to be signed in Malaysia tomorrow for the purchase of 18 MiG-29
fighter aircraft is a success for Russia's drive to break into the most
lucrative sectors of the international arms market.
Malaysia will be the first country in the strongly anti-communist region to
buy MiGs, but it cannot be accused of leaving itself dependent on Russian
air power. It is also buying eight US-made F-18 fighters and 28 British Hawk
fighters as part of a programme to upgrade the airforce.
The country is using its new-found economic prosperity to modernise all its
defence forces. Under the the current six-year (1991-95) defence plan, its
is spending about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) on weaponry, an increase of more
than 200 per cent over the previous five years.
That makes it exactly the kind of customer that Russia's newly revamped arms
export agency is trying to woo.
On the face of things, arms exports from the former Soviet Union plummeted
following the collapse of communism, in part because so many of the
country's traditional clients, such as Libya and Iraq, were subject to
international sanctions.
However the statistics were somewhat misleading. Most Soviet arms deliveries
were dictated by political rather than commercial considerations, and they
were often made on such soft terms as to be of little economic benefit to
Moscow.
Only now is the Russian government mounting a properly co-ordinated effort
to sell weaponry to countries that can afford to pay.
Russia's initial approaches to Malaysia were amateurishly presented - 'an
offer scribbled on a piece of paper', as one military expert put it  - and
governments in south-east Asia were bewildered by the number of Russians who
claimed to have the authority to sell MiGs.
Ironically, one of the Moscow's most high-profile salesmen in Malaysia has
been Alexander Rutskoi, the renegade vice-president who was at the centre of
last October's attempted putsch.
Since the October violence, President Boris Yeltsin has moved to consolidate
his own authority over the arms export business. He blessed the foundation
in March, amid a dazzling display of corporate hospitality, of a new state
agency called Ros-Vooruzhenie.
As well as south-east Asia, other target markets include the wealthy Gulf
states and Latin America. Russia sent a top-level delegation to an arms
exhibition in Chile in March.
The estimated value of the Malaysian deal is about Dollars 650m, with 25 per
cent to be paid in palm oil. There have been tough negotiations over
servicing and maintenance, with Malaysia pressing - reportedly with some
success - for the production of some spare parts on its own soil.
This is likely to raise eyebrows among western defence officials, who allege
that the servicing of weaponry is often used as a cover for Russian military
intelligence.
However the Malaysian government is insisting a mixture serves its purposes
best. It says its MiG fighters will be used for defence tasks, while the the
F-18s will be deployed as strike aircraft.
The combination will not be an unmixed blessing for the Malaysian air force,
since it involves combining two systems for internal organisation and
training. It could also complicate the efforts of south-east Asian countries
to integrate their armed forces.
However the country's refusal to commit itself to the weapon systems of any
one major country has increased its financial bargaining power.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Japan's SDP opposes Korean sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese government preparations for possible sanctions against North Korea
have provoked strong resistance from the Social Democratic party, the second
largest opposition group.
Opposition to action against North Korea, voiced over the weekend by Mr
Wataru Kubo, the SDP's secretary general, suggests that a United Nations
call for sanctions might produce a slow response from Japan, given the
unstable state of the minority coalition government.
'The Socialists. . . are against this idea,' he said.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, has repeatedly warned
that Japan will lose international credibility if it fails to make a
contribution, commensurate with its economic clout, to solving international
crises.
The SDP, whose left wing supports the Pyongyang regime, was responding to
Japanese press reports that the government offered a 10-point sanctions
package to curb cash transfers and stop official visits.
The package resulted from a meeting between US and South Korean officials in
Washington on Saturday, according to the reports.
Government officials in Tokyo refused to comment on details but confirmed
that a draft plan had been discussed, following the International Atomic
Energy Agency's decision to refer North Korea to the UN Security Council for
continuing to frustrate its attempts to inspect nuclear reactors.
Japanese government policy, as explained by Mr Koji Kakizawa, the foreign
minister, is for a two-stage strategy: a UN resolution warning North Korea,
followed by a decision on sanctions.
According to Japanese newspapers, the draft includes a complete ban on
bilateral trade - including any through third countries - on flights,
financial transfers and travel between Japan and North Korea by officials of
each side. Stricter immigration controls are also said to be proposed.
Japan's stance will be an important influence on the weight of any threat to
take sanctions - or the effectiveness of actual measures - because it is
North Korea's second largest trade partner after China. Officials believe
Beijing is likely to veto any UN sanctions, leaving the US to act outside
the aegis of the UN, with Japan and South Korea.
But some Japanese commentators as well as politicians said the proposed
sanctions would be difficult to implement, illegal and ineffective.
Japanese exports to North Korea were Dollars 219.7m (Pounds 146.4m) last
year, while imports were Dollars 252.3m, according to the Japan External
Trade Organisation. On top of this, North Koreans living in Japan carry an
estimated Dollars 600m annually back to their home country. For this reason,
the package also includes curbs on cash that North Korean immigrants may
carry with them on home visits.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Indonesia hit by 12 tidal waves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesians mourned their dead yesterday after up to 12 tidal waves engulfed
Pancur, 880km east of Jakarta after an earthquake just after midnight on
Friday.
Pancur and its surrounding areas stand on a spur near the resort island of
Bali. More than 400 earthquake aftershocks triggered fears of a fresh
tragedy in the remote south-east corner of East Java.
No official death toll has been issued but police estimate the toll at more
than 200.
It was Indonesia's worst tidal wave disaster since over 2,000 people were
killed on Flores island, east of Bali, after a big earthquake and tidal
waves in 1992.
Wreckage from nearly 500 wooden homes was strewn among palm trees in the
fishing town of Pancur. Children played among the debris while people sought
to salvage possessions from their homes.

FT  06 JUN 94 / China plans way to bridge 57km sea channel

China plans what would be the world's biggest sea-crossing construction  - a
chain of bridges and a tunnel, linking the Shandong and Liandong peninsulas
jutting into the Bohai sea.
An official in the Liaoning government in north-east China said feasibility
studies, expected to take several years, had begun on the Yn60bn (Pounds
4.6bn) project to bridge the 57km Bohai channel.
Work was unlikely to begin, however, before early next century and the
project would take about 10 years to complete. In the meantime, Liaoning and
Shandong are planning a Yn1.3bn train ferry linking the two provinces.
This would run between Dalian, the main port in Liaoning, and Yantai in
Shandong. Both are important ports and railheads connected with China's
interior.
The ferry is expected to be operational by 1998, and would be capable of
handling 10m tonnes of goods a year. Capacity would double by the year 2005.
The plans to bridge the Bohai channel and improve transport between Liaoning
and Shandong, two of China's most important provinces economically, reflect
a new drive to boost economic development in the north-east.
The official China Business Weekly reported last month that efforts were
under way to improve the economic integration of the Bohai rim which
encompasses 680,000 sq km and includes the provinces of Shandong, Shanxi,
Hebei and Liaoning, and the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.
This followed a government decision taken in 1992 to declare the Bohai rim
an independent economic zone under China's strategic economic development
plan.
An important aim is to match explosive economic growth in southern China.
Development in the north-east, home to much of China's heavy industry, has
been lagging behind programmes around the Pearl River and Yangtze River
deltas in the south.
Some of China's largest cities are located around Bohai Bay, including 11
cities with populations of more than 1m people.
But Bohai rim development has been hampered by inadequate transport and
crumbling infrastructure.
The Bohai channel project, combining a railway and highway, would involve
the construction of seven long bridges and causeways as well as the tunnel.
Other schemes under consideration in the region include the building of a
large power plant to make use of the bay's tides and a plan eventually to
turn the Bohai into the world's largest fishing pond.

South Korea wants the United Nations to give North Korea a deadline by which
it must open its nuclear sites to international inspection or be slapped
with economic sanctions, Seoul officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
'What the international community wants is North Korean nuclear transparency
and not punishment for the sake of punishment,' a government official said.
Yoo Chong-ha, South Korea's UN ambassador, said: 'It is the South Korean
government's clear position that there's no other option but to seek
sanctions against North Korea through the United Nations.'
He told the Seoul daily Dong-A Ilbo that the five permanent members of the
UN Security Council would soon begin intensive consultations on a US-drafted
resolution on sanctions.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Seoul on hook of unattractive options: There are risks in
both war and sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The deepening crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme is provoking much
soul-searching in South Korea.
The possibility that United Nations economic sanctions could trigger a
military response from North Korea is raising doubts about whether the South
should risk going to war to stop the North from possessing a nuclear weapon.
A conflict could cost several million civilian lives and the destruction of
Seoul, the South Korean capital, which lies only 35 miles from the
demilitarised zone separating the two Koreas.
The no-war scenario is also alarming. An international trade embargo could
cause the tottering North Korean economy to collapse and with it the
government of President Kim Il-sung - a prospect that scares Seoul almost as
much as a military conflict.
Such a premature reunification of Korea would force South Korea to spend as
much as Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133.3bn) on reconstruction costs to absorb the
North, while diverting resources from the South's push to create an advanced
industrial base that would compete effectively against the West and Japan.
The complexity of the situation is in sharp contrast to the clear-cut cold
war view of North Korea during the 1961-1987 period of military rule in
South Korea. The government and public then widely regarded North Korea as a
dangerous foe that must be brought quickly to its knees.
That attitude has not completely disappeared under the democratic government
of President Kim Young-sam. The military and intelligence service contend
that North Korea is intent on developing a nuclear weapon, possibly to
support a forced reunification on Pyongyang's terms.
They warn that North Korea has talked about reunifying the 'fatherland' in
1995, the symbolic 50th anniversary of Korea's division after the
peninsula's liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
North Korea's apparent efforts to destroy evidence of its suspected nuclear
weapons programme by removing spent fuel rods from its reactor and hiding
them from international inspectors has strengthened the position of South
Korean officials who favour a hard line toward Pyongyang.
But the belief that North Korea still harbours hostile intentions toward the
South has been met with increased scepticism among some South Koreans,
particularly those born after the Korean War ended in 1953.
The South's growing prosperity and democratic progress have increased
national self-confidence. It has supported the perception that the South has
already won its cold war against the struggling and isolated North and has
little to fear from it.
Government officials who favour a conciliatory approach toward North Korea
argue that Pyongyang is using its nuclear programme as a bargaining chip to
win security guarantees from the US, including diplomatic recognition and
economic aid.
These officials believe that the North may not even have the technical
capability to build a nuclear weapon, but Pyongyang needs to create the
impression that it is pursuing such a programme to bolster its negotiating
position with the US.
The action by North Korea to bar international inspections of the spent fuel
rods is part of its strategy to maintain uncertainty over the extent of the
programme until Pyongyang wins the concessions it seeks, according to this
theory.
Outside government, there are widening generational differences on the North
Korean issue. University students believe that the US and Japan, rather than
North Korea, represent the biggest potential threats to South Korea,
according to a recent survey.
Radical students view the nuclear dispute in a pan-Korean nationalist
perspective, claiming that the crisis has been provoked by the US to reverse
Washington's dwindling influence on the Korean peninsula and to force Seoul
to buy US weapons, such as the Patriot missile. Anti-American feeling is
widespread among students because of past US support for the country's
military rulers.
Distrust toward Japan is even greater as it develops a nuclear reprocessing
capability and the potential means to build a atomic bomb. Opposition
politicians are demanding that South Korea should acquire nuclear processing
facilities in response.
There is growing public sentiment that a North Korean nuclear bomb programme
may not be such a bad thing as South Korea could inherit it after
reunification and use it to defend Korea against Japan.
The best-selling book in South Korea recently has been a thriller describing
a secret joint North-South programme to build a nuclear weapon, which is
then used to stop a Japanese attack on Korea in the late-1990s. 'Many people
find the book thought-provoking and wonder why South Korea shouldn't have a
nuclear weapon,' said one Korean journalist.
The popularity of the novel suggests that one unexpected result of the North
Korea nuclear dispute could be growing public acceptance for a more
assertive and independent South Korean foreign policy, including the
possession of its own nuclear arsenal.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Beijing may toughen line on N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has given no official indication that it might be about to reconsider
its refusal to countenance sanctions against North Korea over Pyongyang's
resistance to International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of nuclear
facilities.
But there is also no doubt that Beijing is viewing developments with
increasing alarm, and may have decided to begin sending more pointed signals
to Pyongyang that it cannot continue to defy international pressures.
In Hong Kong at the weekend, the Beijing-funded newspaper Ta Kung Pao
provided the first hint that China might, if all else fails, fall into line
with sanctions that would include an oil and food embargo. China would also
cease all border trade, the article said.
China's oil exports to North Korea are critical to the continued functioning
of its economy, and perhaps more importantly its war machine. Chinese
foodstuffs are also vital to a country suffering from shortages of basic
items.
But, for the moment, it seems more likely that China will continue to insist
that diplomatic efforts be exhausted before the international community
resorts to sanctions.
South Korea has few links with the North, so the impact of its sanctions
would be limited without the participation of other nations.
South Korean officials have indicated that Seoul wanted a resolution that
would put an economic embargo into effect only if North Korea failed to
offer a credible way to open its nuclear programme by a deadline. 'This
formula might make it easier for China to take part in the resolution,' the
official said.
A conditional embargo seems compatible with a statement by US President Bill
Clinton that Pyongyang could still head off sanctions.
In Beijing last week a foreign ministry spokesman said that, while China was
very concerned about the issue, 'we do not favour the resort to means that
might sharpen the confrontation'.
However, as the crisis deepens, it is becoming more difficult for Beijing to
maintain that dialogue will yield positive benefits. In March, China headed
off an earlier US attempt to promote a sanctions process in the United
Nations Security Council, arguing that more time was needed to draw
Pyongyang into discussion on the nuclear issue.
Two months have passed without tangible progress. Indeed the IAEA conclusion
that it may now be too late to verify what has happened to weapons grade
plutonium from spent fuel rods in North Korea's nuclear reactors suggests
that diplomacy has failed.
Chinese officials were this weekend talking about 'fresh complications' over
North Korea, but this is a long way from indicating a sea-change in policy
may be under way.
Beijing has no interest in seeing a further destabilised Korean peninsula
and one in which nuclear weapons have become part of the equation on both
sides of the demilitarised zone. But equally, it remains deeply opposed to
meddling by outside powers in the region's affairs.
One of China's abiding fears is that an economic blockade against an
impoverished North Korea might precipitate a refugee stampede along the two
countries' common frontier.
If Beijing fell into line with limited sanctions it would almost certainly
produce a deep chill, if not a diplomatic estrangement with Pyongyang. China
would risk such a development only as a last resort.

Indonesian ministers, journalists and publishers have expressed stiff
opposition to the relaxation of rules on foreign investment limits.
Presenting their case against the new policy which was introduced last week,
they complained the move would endanger Indonesian values by allowing
foreigners to influence public opinion. 'If (this is allowed) we can no
longer use the media to fight for the country,' Mr Harmoko, minister of
information, was quoted saying in the national press. 'We will be under the
control of foreigners.'
Mr Harmoko said a law stipulating that only Indonesian citizens may own
publications may be enough to thwart any attempts to open the media to
foreigners.
The debate gave credence to criticism that government departments and
ministries do not consult each other when formulating policies. Mr Harmoko's
statements come only two days after the government announced it was slashing
limits on foreign investment and foreign equity ownership in an effort to
compete with neighbouring Asian economies offering more attractive
investment policies. Foreign investment in Indonesia dropped to Dollars
8.4bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in 1993 from Dollars 10.3bn a year earlier.

writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Mr Miguel Montes, the government's special prosecutor, last week retreated
from his contention that several people aided the assassin. Without calling
for the release of three men arrested for helping, Mr Montes said: 'The
hypothesis is strengthened that the murder was committed by one man alone -
Mario Aburto Martnez.'
Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of the centre-right
opposition party, said: 'They should get to the bottom of this. What Montes
has said so far does not satisfy me or my party.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's hopes of achieving its austerity targets have been dealt a blow
with publication of the latest inflation figures, which could undermine
government efforts to win union restraint in the current public sector wage
negotiations, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul.
Annual consumer price inflation last month rose to 117 per cent, compared
with 107 per cent in April, after a 24 per cent increase in April had
followed the announcement of one-off price rises in state-controlled
commodities such as petrol and sugar.
The government's austerity programme, announced on April 5, aims to halve
the budget deficit to the equivalent of Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.85bn) in
1994, on the basis of a 15 per cent real cut in wages across the economy and
annualised inflation in the second half of this year at about 30 per cent.
The latest figures, announced at the weekend by the state institute of
statistics, suggest that, four months into the crisis, some companies are
only now adjusting prices to compensate for slower sales and squeezed
margins.
The latest increases, higher than the official forecast of 7 per cent, will
make it more difficult for the government to hold the line on wages, and
thus could imperil the fiscal reduction targets on which Turkey is
negotiating for a stand-by facility with the International Monetary Fund.

territorial waters be used for the questioning, on board US-chartered ships,
of Haitian refugees who had been intercepted at sea by US forces.
The prime minister and the president used their informal meeting, in Britain

North Korea, Bosnia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland.
On Bosnia, the two men welcomed the establishment of a diplomatic process to

Before the broadcast an Aden resident told foreign correspondents in a hotel

people had been killed. It was not possible to confirm the report.
The plant is the only refinery in breakaway southern Yemen and has been
producing around 90,000 barrels a day. One of its crude oil storage tanks
was set ablaze earlier yesterday by what southern officials said was a
northern air raid. During the day rival forces exchanged rocket and tank
fire around the city before the expected arrival in Yemen of a UN envoy.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Czechs alerted by investment deadline: Vincent Boland
assesses the latest twist in an eastern European privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little disturbs the average Czech investor, except the occasional deadline.
This weekend, aspiring shareholders in another tranche of the country's
economic infrastructure were making last-minute touches to their voucher
booklets as the second and crucial round of the second wave of privatisation
drew to a close.
Applications for shares in 846 of the Czech republic's top companies have to
be at the privatisation ministry first thing this morning. Ministry
officials have cleared the decks for a deluge of paper from an estimated 6m
investors.
Prague launched Eastern Europe's most ambitious mass privatisation programme
with the first wave of sell-offs in 1991, transferring 943 enterprises to
the public. It is now mid-way through the second, and probably final wave of
mass privatisation.
To rapidly transfer state property to the public, the Czechs have developed
a complex system in which each investor starts off with 1000 points. These
points are then converted into shares through a series of closed national
auctions at bids which are matched with the shares available. If a
particular share is over-subscribed no shares are sold and the share is
moved into a second round of bidding at a higher price.
The second wave of privatisation began in March with an initial round of
bidding which resulted in the allocation of just over 13 per cent of the
Kc155bn (Dollars 5.34bn) of assets for sale.
Bids for the second round closed this morning and investors are busy
predicting how much of the state property will be sold.
Analysts in Prague expect a large number of the available shares to be sold
off in this round. 'This is the single largest round in terms of shares
distributed,' said Mr Alexander Angell of stockbrokers Wood and Company. 'My
guesstimate is that between 40 and 50 per cent of the shares will be
allocated.'
Managers of Prague's investment funds, to which 65 per cent of private
investors have entrusted their vouchers, are tight-lipped about which
sectors and companies in this round are most in demand.
Fierce competition among the 349 funds for points, and the inevitable excess
of quantity over quality on offer, is likely to lead to heavy bidding for
certain sectors, reflecting a growing trend among fund managers to
concentrate their investment strategies on certain sectors.
Privately, the fund managers say that the brewing, pharmaceutical, chemical,
telecommunications and oil distribution sectors are those most likely to
attract the most bids.
In the first wave, many less-experienced funds bid for shares in almost all
the companies on offer. The result was a dispersed portfolio which has
failed to match the returns being offered to investors by those funds which
concentrated their investments in a narrower range of companies.
The most successful funds - including Creditanstalt Investment Fund, ZB
Trust (run by Zivnostenska Banka) and Harvard (established by controversial
Mr Viktor Kozeny) - have invested in less than 100 companies in key sectors
of the economy.
This round of the privatisation is attracting strong interest by foreign
investors, according to Mr Nigel Williams, chairman of Creditanstalt's
funds.
Foreigners cannot participate directly but some, such as emerging market
funds, are offering to buy stakes in some Czech companies from the
investment funds at a premium. Mr Williams said the premium can be as much
as 20 per cent of the value of the stake. 'It happened to an extent with
industrial investors in the first wave. Now we are seeing financial
investors coming in,' he said.
The premium offered by such investors to the Czech investment funds goes to
the shareholders in those funds, increasing the attraction of investing in
the funds themselves rather than directly in the companies.
Creditanstalt's privatisation fund was fully listed on the Prague stock
exchange last week, only the second such fund to be quoted so far.
When the second wave is completed, probably by October of this year, some
1,600 companies will be listed on the exchange, making it the biggest
stockmarket in eastern Europe. Then, all investors should have taken
possession of the shares, substantially increasing the liquidity of the
market.
Problems of illiquidity have caused share prices to fall heavily in recent
months. Since February 1, the market has dropped by more than 40 per cent in
thin trading as the big investment funds concentrated on the share
flotations.
Analysts expect the deadline today deadline to shift the focus back to the
market, though no great surge in prices is expected until more companies are
fully listed.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Expand jobs 'through training'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and other western industrial nations could achieve higher levels of
employment by training more people to develop problem-solving skills, Mr
Robert Reich, US secretary of labour, said yesterday.
At a seminar on job-creation, organised in London by the British newspaper
The Guardian, Mr Reich said there was a 'third way' between the US
experience of the past 20 years, of creating many jobs but with low wages,
and the European approach of creating few, highly-skilled jobs and suffering
high unemployment.
Faster job growth, Mr Reich said, would be in areas where intellectual
capital is required. Job seekers in industrial countries had to cope with
the world in which the mass production of high-volume, standardised products
was no longer the engine of economic growth. Instead, growth lay in
fulfilling niche requirements and constant adaptation.
The US administration has acted, Mr Reich said, to create national
vocational standards, created links between school and apprenticeships,
introduced an earned income tax credit to help the poor in work, and started
a scheme to channel the unemployed into new jobs and skills.
Mr Reich will explain more about the US programme for dealing with
unemployment at a meeting of finance, employment and trade ministers in
Paris tomorrow. That is due to adopt a new report on job-creation prepared
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Mr Reich's remarks yesterday showed how far the Clinton administration has
shifted the debate on unemployment and pay from the free market doctrines of
the Reagan and Bush years. Using words that would surprise many in the UK,
he said flexibility in labour markets should not mean giving employers the
power to fire workers or reduce wages at will.
He also spoke in favour of the minimum wage as a way to combat poverty,
suggesting that the present US minimum wage of Dollars 4.25 (Pounds 2.81)
per hour could be raised by 50 cents to Dollars 1 without endangering
employment.

The United Nations yesterday abandoned efforts to start new ceasefire talks
among the leaders of Bosnia's warring communities, after a four-day
government boycott, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government had refused to return to the negotiating
table in Geneva, in protest against the Serb failure to comply with the 3km
UN exclusion zone around Gorazde, the south-eastern Moslem enclave. UN
officials yesterday said the bulk of the Serb militia had withdrawn from the
zone set up by the UN in April.
Also, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia called for a 100km exclusion
zone with its centre in the heart of the country. He told US senators
visiting Sarajevo that he would propose the idea to the peace talks in
Geneva, in order to create a 'free Bosnia'.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Party facing Northwards: George Graham finds Virginia
Republicans divided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year ago, Virginia Republicans were divided sharply over the religious
right-winger whom their party had nominated for the state's
lieutenant-governorship. He lost.
This weekend, the party selected to run in November, for election to the US
Senate, a candidate who divides opinions even more sharply: Mr Oliver North,
former colonel of Marines, who was one of the organisers of the Iran-Contra
plot to trade arms for the US hostages held in Lebanon.
The near-15,000 delegates who picked Mr North, at a festive party convention
in the Virginian state capital of Richmond on Saturday, were determined to
avoid the internal strife of last year and to preserve party unity.
Once it was clear that Mr North had won more than 55 per cent of the
delegates' votes, Mr James Miller, budget director in the Reagan
administration who had also battled for the nomination, promised his full
support in the campaign to unseat Senator Chuck Robb, the Democratic
incumbent whose sex life has severely tarnished his prospects of
re-election.
Virginia Republicans are unusual in picking their Senate nominee at a party
convention. The state's Democrats will hold a primary, open to a wider
electorate than the party faithful who attend conventions, next week.
The often fierce struggle for the Republican nomination has been portrayed
as a fight between the moderate and the right-winger, but Mr Miller's
political stance was as far to the right as Mr North's. Indeed, he even
outflanked Mr North on the issue of abortion by refusing to accept any
exceptions, even in cases of incest or rape.
Although the few party moderates who attended the convention in Richmond
mostly backed Mr Miller, most delegates committed to him were barely
distinguishable from their counterparts in the North camp.
'It's neck-and-neck on conservative issues. I could support either one,'
said Mr Harry Lee, a delegate who had picked Mr Miller mainly because
opinion polls show his chances of defeating Mr Robb to be much better than
Mr North's.
Many Miller delegates, such as Mr William James from rural Brunswick county,
on Virginia's border with North Carolina, had once backed Mr North. Mr James
switched in April, but only in the last week was he able to persuade his
wife, also a delegate, to change her mind.
Besides the blessing of former President Ronald Reagan and most senior
figures from the Reagan administration, Mr Miller also won the late support
of many of Virginia's congressmen and Republican party heavyweights.
But political endorsements swayed few at the convention.
'It doesn't matter which congressman is speaking on whose behalf, it matters
what the person who kneels next to you in church thinks,' said Mr Kerry
Burch, a North supporter.
Senator John Warner, the Republican moderate who holds the state's other
seat in the Senate, has called Mr North unfit for office and has thrown his
weight behind Mr Marshall Coleman, a Republican and a former state
attorney-general who is trying to get on the November ballot as an
independent. He may even run as an independent when he faces re-election for
his present job in 1996.
Mr Warner preferred to attend D-Day commemorations in Europe this weekend
rather than brave a party convention at which his name was often jeered.
'I think he's leaning too far to the left. He's talking about running as an
independent and I can see why, because I don't think this party would
support him,' said Mrs Janice Cifers, a North supporter.
Yet, even in this conservative and religious assembly, however, Mr North was
able to win only 55 per cent of the votes.
There remain doubts over his ability to win votes from a broader electorate
which remembers that he was convicted of lying to Congress over Iran-Contra.
His convictions were subsequently overturned, because he had previously
testified to Congress under immunity from prosecution, but he has admitted
lying.
In fact, the Virginia Republicans have picked one of the very few candidates
against whom Mr Robb's chances of winning re-election must be rated as good.
Mr North's fervent supporters are aware of the difficulties he will face in
the November election, and have joined with gusto in the game of tactical
voting that is expected then: supporters of the Democratic former governor
of Virginia, Mr Douglas Wilder, set up stands outside the convention and
estimated that 5,000 to 6,000 Republican delegates, eager to split Mr Robb's
support, signed petitions to put Mr Wilder on the ballot paper as another
independent.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Ethiopians vote for assembly to draw up constitution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethiopians began voting early yesterday in a national poll for an assembly
which is to draw up a democratic constitution, agencies report from Addis
Ababa.
The election is Ethiopia's first national democratic poll for decades, with
about 15m registered voters from a population of more than 50m choosing a
547-member assembly. About 60 per cent of the candidates say they are
independent and not allied to any political party.
Some opposition parties, which draw their main support from the Amhara
ethnic group in the capital, are boycotting the poll. They argue that a
draft constitution likely to be approved by the new elected body could lead
to the disintegration of the country by granting the right of secession to
its many ethnic groups.

A Kuwaiti court on Saturday sentenced five Iraqis and one Kuwaiti to death
for plotting to kill former US president George Bush when he visited the
emirate in 1993, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
Another five Iraqis and two Kuwaitis were sentenced to prison terms ranging
from six months to 12 years for offences including possession of explosives,
liquor smuggling and illegal entry. One Kuwaiti was acquitted.
The death sentences are subject to review by another court and by the ruler
of Kuwait, the emir.
During the last session in April of the trial, which opened nearly a year
ago, defence lawyers said the testimony of the sole prosecution witness,
state security Colonel Abdul Samad al-Shatti, was based on assumptions.

Northern Yemeni warplanes yesterday bombed Aden's oil refinery, setting a
storage tank on fire. Rival forces exchanged rocket and tank fire at
battlefronts around the city before the expected arrival in Yemen of a
United Nations envoy, Reuter reports from Aden.
'As part of a dangerous escalation in the war, and in a flagrant violation
of mediation by the international community, Aden's refinery was bombed by
 . northern warplanes, setting fire in one of the storage tanks,' said a
southern statement. It added that southern anti-aircraft fire shot down one
of the raiding aircraft.
The refinery, in the Little Aden suburb about 12 miles from the centre of
Aden, has been a constant target of northern aircraft. Refinery officials
put production at 70,000 barrels per day, down from about 110,000 bpd at the
start of the war.
Southern officials had warned that, if the refinery or the nearby power
plant were hit, the south would retaliate by attack vital northern
installations.

<TEXT>
Britain has agreed to let Washington use the Turks and Caicos Islands, a
British archipelago in the Caribbean, for processing Haitians seeking asylum
in the US, writes David Owen in London.
This was agreed over the weekend at a meeting of Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, and US President Bill Clinton. The proposed processing centre
could be in use by next month.
The agreement on Haitian asylum-seekers came less than a week after Mr P J
Patterson, Jamaican prime minister, had said his country was to let its
territorial waters be used for the questioning, on board US-chartered ships,
of Haitian refugees who had been intercepted at sea by US forces.
The prime minister and the president used their informal meeting, in Britain
during the D-Day commemoration, to discuss a wide range of issues, including
North Korea, Bosnia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. On Bosnia, the two men
welcomed the establishment of a diplomatic process to bring together the US,
the European Union and Russia, and the two men discussed plans for a
conference in Geneva on the reconstruction of Sarajevo.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Serb commanders remain confident of Bosnia victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DOBOJ, BOSNIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Firmly convinced that peace talks on Bosnia will remain deadlocked, Serb
commanders maintain that the final settlement will be reached on the
battlefield.
From his hill-top command post in northern Bosnia, Lt-Colonel Miko Skoric
insists that Serb forces will honour an agreement reached by their leaders.
'But the war will end only when the Moslems are defeated.' He echoes the
oft-repeated threats of his military chiefs - that Serb forces will seize
all of Bosnia if the Moslems sustain their offensive.
There is scant evidence of this offensive, much heralded by the Serbian
media. Instead of a major military push, the occasional crash of artillery
rounds inflicting civilian casualties in Serb-held towns, appears to signal
the growing confidence of the Bosnian army.
Eager to portray the Serbs as victims, guides point to a gaping hole where a
tank round ripped through the wall of the medical centre at Doboj, northern
Bosnia. In a departure from the usual military bravado, Lt-Col Milovan
Milutinovic, the Serb army spokesman, even claims huge losses in a recent
battle in the area.
Despite these reports, Serb soldiers on the northern front appear relaxed
and self-assured. In fact, say diplomats, there are signs that Serb forces
are preparing to launch an attack in northern Bosnia, a region which both
sides see as crucial to the war's outcome.
The Serb corridor, linking Belgrade to Serb-held land in Bosnia and Croatia,
weaves through the northern Posavina, the Sava River valley.
Lt-Col Skoric say the Serbs will never give up this land. As though
following an order, local commanders no longer use the term 'corridor'.
They say that the Posavina historically was Serbian, ignoring the fact that,
before the war, Moslems and Croats comprised the bulk of the population.
Republika Srpska, the self-styled Serb state which covers more than 70 per
cent of Bosnia, depends on the corridor for survival.
People show little remorse for their former neighbours in the towns of Doboj
and Brcko, who were mostly Moslem before the outbreak of war in April 1992.
Instead, they complain that the West has sided with their Moslem enemies.
With each day of what they call Moslem delays in reaching a political
settlement, Serb commanders say the Bosnian army risks losing everything.
'When Serb forces re-take territory, we don't just take a few metres but
several kilometres,' says Lt-Col Skoric, laughing. 'Like the Moslems, we see
Bosnia-Hercegovina as our fatherland. We also believe that much more land
should belong to us.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: Journey to prison - the
businessman's nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne is living a businessman's nightmare. Since he
travelled, voluntarily, to Brussels on May 26 to make a statement concerning
an investigation into two Belgian subsidiaries of his electrical engineering
group, the Schneider chairman has been locked up in the city's ageing Forest
prison, under investigation for alleged fraud and embezzlement.
'It is a cautionary tale of the risks for managers of multinational groups,'
says a French industrialist. 'Many businessmen are wondering to what extent
they are responsible for every part of their company's operations. Many are
watching this case very carefully.'
The nature of the problems encountered by Schneider in Belgium extends well
beyond the question of senior management's liability for operations in
different countries.
A long and contorted affair links Schneider's headquarters in the smart 16th
arrondissement of Paris and a prison known locally as the 'black hole of
Brussels.' A landmark came in November 1992 when Schneider launched an offer
to buy out minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two Belgian
financial subsidiaries.
Minority shareholders protested against the terms of the offer, which was
launched at BFr2,525 per share for Cofibel and BFr1,265 for Cofimines. They
claimed that the bid undervalued their investments and that Schneider
manipulated sales of shares to benefit its own balance sheet.
Mr Andre de Barsy, one of the rebel investors, said last week he had
collected files of information incriminating Schneider's management in the
conduct of the offer.
In support of their claim, the disgruntled minority shareholders filed a
suit in Brussels to secure a higher bid price. After protracted and bitter
negotiations, Schneider raised its offer to BFr3,400 per share for Cofibel
and BFr1,475 per share for Cofimines. The improved terms cleared the way for
an accord with minority shareholders at the beginning of this year.
The original complaint, however, had set Belgium's legal wheels into motion.
Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, a well known prosecuting magistrate, with a
history of handling financial fraud cases, had launched an investigation in
October 1993. The probe continued after the resolution of the dispute with
minority shareholders and is the reason why Mr Pineau-Valencienne stayed
behind bars at the weekend.
Following the agreement with minority shareholders, Mr Pineau-Valencienne
was confident the case could be brought quickly to a close. 'He had
appointments in his diary for Friday,' said one colleague, referring to the
day after the Schneider chairman's visit to Brussels last month.
Instead, he was held without charge, under investigation for fraud,
benefiting from fraud, embezzlement and falsification of accounts. He was
detained for the five days of preventive detention allowed under Belgian
law. Last Wednesday, a Brussels' court confirmed the nature of the
investigation and ordered the Schneider chairman to remain in prison for a
period of up to one month.
Since Wednesday's hearing, the thrust of the inquiry into Schneider and Mr
Pineau-Valencienne has become clearer. After the ruling to extend the
Schneider chairman's detention, the prosecution issued a statement alleging
'illicit manoeuvres' through which the company received more than BFr3bn at
the expense of its Belgian subsidiaries between 1988 and 1992.
According to the prosecutors, Schneider had concealed offshore companies and
assets worth about BFr4.8bn from regulators and shareholders in Cofimines
and Cofibel. Dividends totalling BFr1.8bn from the offshore companies
registered in Panama and Bermuda were not distributed to all shareholders in
the subsidiaries, the prosecutors believe.
The investigation is also focusing on the dealings of PB Finance, a Belgian
shell company in which Cofibel held a minority stake of 25 per cent before
selling out earlier this year. The company was controlled by Mr Valentino
Foti, an Italian businessmen, who represented Fimo, a Swiss Italian company.
Mr Foti, arrested as part of the same investigation, served as a director on
the board of Schneider's Belgian subsidiaries during the period before the
offer to minority shareholders.
Schneider denies the accusations of the Belgian prosecutors and says it
'deplores' the actions taken against its chairman. It claims it never harmed
interests of minority shareholders and that Mr Pineau-Valencienne, although
nominally chairman of Cofibel and Cofimines, was not actively involved in
their management.
This task fell instead to Mr Jean Verdoot, who was managing director of the
subsidiaries until his death last year.
Schneider says its ties to the group of offshore companies at the centre of
the investigation are an historical accident, dating back to the group's
origins in the business empire of the Belgian Empain family. Schneider
claims the offshore companies, as with many Belgian groups, were established
in the 1960s to protect mining interests in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire)
from nationalisation after independence.
Schneider denies benefiting from funds generated by the offshore companies,
except in the form of dividends to Cofibel and Cofimines.
The company has also firmly denied allegations in the Belgian press that PB
Finance was involved in money-laundering activities. 'There is nothing in
the structure of PB Finance which would allow any laundering of any kind,'
said Mr Pineau-Valencienne in an interview with Les Echos, the French
business daily, last October. 'I would add that money has rather been burned
than laundered because the company has lost a lot of money,' he said.
Cofibel sold its shares in PB Finance earlier this year and the company is
currently being managed by court-appointed lawyers.
Despite denials by Schneider of any irregularities, the events to date leave
several questions unanswered. Why did Mr Pineau-Valencienne travel to
Brussels apparently unaware of the legal risks involved? Were decisions
taken which, as the prosecutors allege, acted against the interests of
Belgian minority shareholders? If this was the case, to what extent could Mr
Pineau-Valencienne have been involved? On the first count, Schneider says
its chairman was taken by surprise and fell victim to an over-zealous
Belgian legal system. 'We have encountered a very particular judge,' said a
company official after the chairman's arrest. 'Mr Pineau-Valencienne went to
Brussels to make a statement which he believed would resolve the whole
affair.'
The answer to the second and third points is more complex, and will partly
depend on a study of documents and correspondence taken by prosecutors after
a search of Schneider's Paris headquarters by French and Belgian police last
week. The documents have been studied over the weekend and will be used to
decide whether Mr Pineau-Valencienne's appeal to be released will be upheld.
An appeal is due to be heard early this week, and a decision should be made
within 11 days.
Ironically, it was Mr Pineau-Valencienne's attempt to bring more coherence
into the disparate group of companies he inherited in 1981 that lies behind
his current plight.
His decision to buy out the minority investors, he says, was an attempt to
rationalise the 'unimaginable imbroglio' of Schneider's Belgian operations.
As he sits in his cell in Forest prison, he is confronted by an imbroglio
which appears denser still.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: Schneider chief's arrest
spotlights business ties - David Buchan looks at Franco-Belgian two-way
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne's detention in a Brussels prison has developed
into an affair of enormous media and business interest in France and
Belgium. But it has not so far caused a major political row between the two
governments.
Certainly, the Schneider chairman must have taken some satisfaction from
having almost the entire French political and business establishment weigh
in on his side.
On hearing of his arrest 10 days ago, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur rang
his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, while Mr Alain Juppe, France's
foreign minister, telephoned his opposite number, Mr Willy Claes.
They got the same message in private that the Belgian press has been
broadcasting in public: that Belgian justice is independent of government.
Since that has not always been the case in France, it was perhaps a salutary
reminder.
Having assured themselves that Mr Pineau-Valencienne is not being
ill-treated - he is getting meals from the French embassy and wearing his
own suits, rather than prison-wear - the French authorities are now helping
Belgian justice to run its course.
Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, the Belgian prosecuting magistrate investigating
alleged Schneider irregularities in Belgium, got no answer to his first
request on May 16 for judicial help from France.
But last week Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, France's justice minister, belatedly
pledged full co-operation to establish the truth. Last Wednesday a French
judge and policemen helped their Belgian counterparts start to question
Schneider executives and look for documents at the group's Paris
headquarters as well as at Mr Pineau-Valencienne's suburban home.
If the Schneider affair has gradually elicited more co-operation from
France, in Belgium it has reawakened a certain animosity towards its large
neighbour.
This is particularly prevalent in the field of business. Extending beyond
traditional Belgian complaints about French high-handedness, there is
irritation, particularly in the Flemish community, about the activities of
slick 'money men' from France.
In Paris last March Mr Luc Van den Brande, head of the Flemish regional
government, invited French companies with interests in Belgium to 'stop
thinking about purely financial operations' and to start creating real jobs.
His reprimand was exaggerated, because some French companies, such as
Renault, have set up manufacturing plants in Belgium. But of 800
French-controlled subsidiaries in Belgium, employing 157,000 people, most
resulted from takeovers in the financial sphere.
By far the biggest was the 1988 takeover of Societe Generale de Belgique by
the Suez financial group, which now controls 61 per cent of the giant
Belgian holding company.
Some of the French financial investment - such as the controlling stake by
EMC, a French holding group, in the Tessenderlo chemical company - is in
industry. There is a link between the two countries' biggest companies.
Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil group, owns 5 per cent of Petrofina, Belgium's
leading company in this sector, but the main ties are in banking and
insurance.
The French insurance groups Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances
Generales de France control Royale Belge and Assubel. The investment flow is
by no means all one way. Belgian companies have some 350 subsidiaries in
France, employing 37,000 people. They range from Solvay, the major Belgian
chemical company, to the flourishing textile businesses of west Flanders
that have expanded into northern France.
In tending to reinforce their presence in Belgium through financial
takeovers of existing Belgian enterprises, rather than setting up greenfield
operations there, French companies have tended to forget about that
often-awkward customer - the minority shareholder.
'This may be because Belgian legislation to protect rights of minority
shareholders is fairly recent, though very similar to what has existed for
longer in France,' says Mr Jean-Nicolas Caprasse of Deminor, a Brussels
legal firm specialising in work for minority shareholders.
The new Belgian law gives people owning 1 per cent of a company's shares, or
BFr50m (Pounds 980,000) of the company's capital, the right to start legal
proceedings for an investigation into the company.
Deminor acted for minority shareholders in Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel
group, who felt they were unfairly treated when Accor, the French hotel
group, took it over in 1991.
Belgium started to put legislation to protect minority shareholders into
place only in 1989, after the Societe Generale de Belgique saga, and
completed the job in 1991.
For its part, the French business community has closed ranks in rallying to
Mr Pineau-Valencienne's defence.
'Imagine that a policeman from a French village committed a certain offence
and Mr (Charles) Pasqua (the interior minister) was arrested for five days
while the affair was studied,' said Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone
Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, expressing a common
reaction.
The Belgian affair has underlined French companies' particular sensitivities
about allegations of malpractice, following revelations of a series of
examples of corruption in the last two or three years, including those of
companies involved in illicit political financing.
Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, a crusading French magistrate who is running in the
European Parliament elections, has just published a 40-page booklet alleging
widespread corruption in French political and business life.
Mr Jean-Pierre has stopped short of giving specific details into his
allegations of corruption in areas ranging from party financing and export
commissions to football and motor racing.
But there is a growing nervousness in France that he, or someone else, may
soon provide them.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: De Barsy - a high-profile
minority shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andre de Barsy displays none of the low-key characteristics of the
typical bourgeois Belgian investor.
Unlike the Belgian shareholder who carefully avoids both the country's tax
system and the limelight, Mr de Barsy is known for his forthright
questioning at annual general meetings.
At his sombre offices in central Brussels, Mr de Barsy, a financial analyst
who runs his own investment company, expounds on the questions he has put to
the management of Cofimines since 1991, when he first became a shareholder
in the Schneider subsidiary.
'For some years I was singled out because, when I went to meetings, it
wasn't just to hear what I could read in a report, it was to ask questions
about the normal course of business,' he says. Other individual minority
shareholders took note. A total of 180 of them turned to Mr de Barsy for
advice when they first suspected that Schneider was giving them a less than
fair deal in its takeover bid in late 1992. The group of minority
shareholders took their case to the Belgian legal authorities. The threat of
legal action prompted Schneider to raise the share price offer.
While most of the individuals took the money and settled back in anonymity,
Mr de Barsy refused to accept the raised offer - and has continued to ask
questions about unexplained aspects of the Schneider-Cofimines link.
From behind his solid wooden desk, piled high with papers and sporting a
bakelite telephone, as well as two more modern handsets, Mr de Barsy has
meticulously followed the Schneider case. He focuses on what he calls the
'complicated architecture' of Cofimines' elaborate off-shore operations,
which he alleges has had the effect of hiding part of Cofimines profits from
shareholders.
'I knew in 1992 of the existence of some of these offshore companies and
asked why it was necessary to have this sort of investment vehicle. But I
didn't suspect that other offshore companies existed as well.'
In 1992, he says, Mr Jean Verdoot, the companies' former managing director,
answered some of his questions in apparent good faith. 'But he evidently
knew many things he didn't speak about.'
One of the points queried by Mr de Barsy refers to guarantees on share
transactions involving both Schneider and Cofimines, centred on the purchase
of a stake in the Luxembourg steel company Arbed.
'At Cofimines annual general meeting in May 1992 I received an assurance
that these (guarantees) were clear, and I was satisfied with the
investment.' Now, however, he thinks that questions on these dealings need
still to be followed up.
Mr de Barsy questions Mr Pineau-Valencienne's closeness to the operations of
Cofimines, of which he was the chairman, and alleges that the Schneider
chief was rarely in Brussels. 'I think it is important that a manager is
conscious of his need to report to the people, and not to stand apart like
the Roi de Soleil.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: Hostile strategy pays off for
Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 13 years as head of Schneider, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne has
transformed a disparate range of business interests, ranging from steel and
telecommunicatons equipment to sportswear, into one of Europe's largest
electrical engineering companies.
The transformation has involved an aggressive strategy of acquisitions and
disposals. Landmarks include liquidation of the group's Creusot-Loire
steelmaking arm in 1984, after a protracted test of strength with the
Socialist government of the time. The government's refusal to rescue the
steel company prompted its collapse, one of France's largest corporate
failures.
In 1986, Mr Pineau-Valencienne took over Telemecanique, the electrical
equipment group, after a bitter battle with employee shareholders.
Five years later, the target was Square D of the US, which again succumbed
only after a fierce fight. The final cost of the deal, Dollars 2.23bn
(Pounds 1.48bn), made it the biggest hostile takeover by a French company in
the US. Mr Pineau-Valencienne's victory won him the accolade of manager of
the year from the Nouvel Economiste magazine.
The Schneider chairman's aggressive restructuring strategy can be seen from
the company's statistics. Last year it recorded sales of FFr56bn (Pounds
6.55bn) and employed about 90,000 people. In 1981, sales of FFr40bn were
achieved from a workforce of 125,000. The bottom line has also been
improving, with net profits up by 33 per cent last year to FFr405m.
The bulk of the group's business comes from electricity distribution,
industrial controls and electrical contracting. In addition to Square D and
Telemecanique, the principal subsidiaries are Merlin Gerin and Spie
Batignoles. The Schneider chairman has also pursued a strategy of
partnerships, resulting most recently in a joint venture with AEG of Germany
in robotics.
Ironically, Mr Pineau-Valencienne's role in transforming the company may
prove a weakness. 'He is responsible for a lot of what the group has
achieved in improving productivity and re-focusing its operations,' says one
electronics industry analyst in Paris. 'As a result, his incarceration is
worrying for investors.'
Such worries have been reflected in the movement of the company's share
price. It fell by 5.6 per cent on the day of Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrest
and by a further 5.5 per cent when the Brussels magistrates confirmed that
he would be detained in prison.
Industry observers say Mr Pineau-Valencienne's detention does not pose a
threat to the group as a whole since the subsidiaries involved in the fraud
case are relatively small - Cofibel and Cofimines represent less than 5 per
cent of Schneider's total assets. But in terms of image and practical
management of the group, the implications are more serious.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Horn set to become Hungarian premier
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gyula Horn, a long-time Communist party functionary and now leader of
Hungary's Socialist party, is set to become the country's next prime
minister.
The reformed communists, newly assertive after gaining an absolute majority
in last month's parliamentary elections, named Mr Horn at a special congress
at the weekend. The party gave overwhelming backing to the 61-year-old Mr
Horn, a former foreign minister, and brushed off a challenge from Mr Laszlo
Bekesi, the party's economics spokesman. At the same time the Socialists
also offered to begin coalition talks this week with the Alliance of Free
Democrats, the liberal party which came second in the vote.
The Socialists had held off from designating a candidate for the premiership
because the liberals regard Mr Horn as a 'divisive figure'. The Socialist
leader was a volunteer in the 'padded jacket' workers' militia that helped
put down Hungary's 1956 uprising against Soviet and communist rule. But the
unexpected scale of the former communists' election triumph - the party won
209 of the 386 parliamentary seats - has changed the political balance of
power.
Free Democrat leaders had vowed never to serve in a government dominated by
the Socialists and led by Mr Horn, and even last week were holding out for a
compromise.
The liberals nevertheless agreed yesterday to begin talks on joining the
next government after coming under strong pressure from intellectuals and
the business community to bolster Socialist technocrats and dilute the
influence of the traditionalist and trade union groups among the former
communists.
The Socialists' outright election victory has emboldened the party's left
wing and the weakness of the party's technocrats was further demonstrated by
the 96 per cent vote of Socialist congress delegates for Mr Horn.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and Sweden will today agree to work together on future defence
projects, a step expected to clear the way for a tank deal worth at least
DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m).
The agreement comes just as Sweden is nearing the end of talks to buy 120
Leopard II tanks and Germany is understood to have made the deal more
attractive with offers to include Swedish companies in future defence
projects.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, and his Swedish counterpart, Mr
Anders Bjorck, will sign an agreement outlining future co-operation in the
development of unspecified defence-related projects.
While about 75 per cent of Germany's arms building programmes are already
undertaken in co-operation with several Nato allies, the closer links with
Sweden are the first such initiative with a non-Nato member.
As part of a programme to re-equip its mechanised brigades the Swedish army
will buy 120 Leopard IIs from Krauss Maffei, the Munich-based company, in a
deal worth about DM1.2bn. Another 80 tanks are likely to be bought later, an
official said.
To complete the overhaul the Swedes are considering leasing another 160 used
Leopard IIs which Germany needs to take out of service. An official said the
deal was likely to be completed this year but could give no further details.
The Swedes preferred the Leopard II to the US-made M1 Abrams and the French
Leclerc and will become the third army to use it as its main battle tank,
after Germany and the Netherlands.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Russia wins debt scheduling agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western governments, continuing efforts to support Russian economic reforms,
agreed at the weekend to reschedule Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) in debt owed
by Russia in 1994.
The deal reached in Paris reschedules over 15 years with three years' grace
debts towards the Paris Club of creditor governments, which are owed more
than half of Russia's Dollars 80bn foreign debt.
Russia urgently needs to reschedule its foreign debt to get round the burden
of loans of which a significant proportion fall due around this year. The
International Monetary Fund has calculated that Russia, which has
overestimated its trade surplus for this year, has to plug a Dollars 25bn
gap in its balance of payments this year, compared to a gap of Dollars 15bn
last year.
This year's obligations include Dollars 14.5bn owed in principal payments,
plus Dollars 6bn in interest - a burden partly alleviated by this weekend's
rescheduling agreement.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting Russian finance minister who negotiated this
weekend's agreement, told reporters in Paris he expected 'fairly difficult
negotiations on the rescheduling of all our debts on a long-term basis' this
autumn.
Western governments and multilateral organisations such as the IMF are
expected to bring new funds to Russia this year. But a rescheduling
agreement with western commercial banks, which are owed another Dollars
26bn, continues to elude Russia for the second year in a row because of
Russia's insistence that banks should not be able to seize state-owned
assets if it defaults on repayment.
While the governments say they do not want to write off Russian debts to
preserve its ability to borrow new credits in the future, the banks are
waiting for it to come round to their point of view, confident it will need
western bank finance in future.
Russia has allocated Dollars 4.1bn for debt servicing this year.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Health reforms hurt drug sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcare reforms in France and Italy depressed pharmaceuticals sales in
the first quarter of 1994, according to figures published at the weekend.
France introduced guidelines at the start of the year to reduce the
country's notorious over-prescribing habits; doctors were asked to prescribe
only drugs appropriate to a given medical condition. Sales in France in the
first quarter of 1994 were worth Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.9bn), compared with
Dollars 3.2bn in the first quarter of 1993. The decline was 4 per cent,
taking into account currency fluctuations, IMS International, the
London-based market research company, reported.
Italian reforms significantly affected sales, which fell 11 per cent in
constant currency terms to Dollars 1.8bn. Italy has introduced limited lists
of drugs for which the state medical system would pay in the treatment of
patients.
By contrast, sales in Germany, Europe's biggest individual market, recovered
6 per cent against a year earlier to Dollars 3.1bn. However, the comparative
improvement was partly due to the low level of last year's figures for the
first quarter, when new healthcare reforms penalised doctors for
over-prescribing.
Sales in the UK, where reforms have been relatively modest, grew by 8 per
cent, faster than any other large country. Nevertheless, UK doctors remained
relatively low prescribers, and sales of Dollars 1.3bn were less per head of
population than Spain.
The US, where sweeping healthcare legislation is still being discussed, saw
drugs sales rise 6 per cent to Dollars 12.2bn. Sales in Canada, which has a
thriving generics (cheaper unbranded drugs) industry, rose 1 per cent to
Dollars 822m.
Sales in Japan, where the government has pushed through drug price cuts,
fell 6 per cent to Dollars 4.6bn.
By therapeutic area, cardiovascular drugs, including many treatments for
heart conditions, remain the biggest single area, with sales 5 per cent
higher than in the first quarter of 1993.
But the next biggest category, digestive tract drugs including the world's
biggest seller, Glaxo's Zantac, was one of the fastest growing sectors.
Sales increased 7 per cent.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Spain to discuss Seat aid with VW: Madrid unwilling to help
if it means distorting competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government faces tough new talks this week with the management
of Volkswagen over the scope of state aid for the German group's loss-making
Seat subsidiary.
The Industry Ministry said it was prepared to provide investment backing but
not to make a special case of Seat by subsidising restructuring costs in a
way that would distort competition in the car market.
VW is seeking aid of DM820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish central and regional
authorities to cover compensation for early retirement by 4,600 Seat
workers, reducing the workforce to about 9,500.
The issue is expected to surface in a two-day meeting starting today in
Schwerin between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish
prime minister.
Promises of assistance for Seat provoked sharp reactions last week from
other multinational motor groups which manufacture in Spain, including Ford
and General Motors.
'You cannot help one without helping all,' said Mr Arnaud de
David-Beauregard, managing director of Citroen Hispania, part of the French
PSA group. Mr Juan Antonio Moral, chairman of the Renault subsidiary
FASA-Renault, said aid for job reductions at Seat was 'not acceptable'.
However, Mr Juan Llorens, Seat chairman, said the company was not comparable
to others since it had its own models and technical centre.
The ministry said it was prepared to support new investments at Seat based
on the same criteria as other motor companies. The cutting of 9,000 jobs at
Seat announced last year would already result in a cost to the Spanish
taxpayer of Pta30bn (Pounds 146m), it said.
This was in addition to an estimated Pta400bn spent on restructuring the
formerly state-controlled company in readiness for sale to VW in a phased
operation that began in 1986.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Delors faces fight for 'Union bonds'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, faces a test of
strength with the UK and Germany today over his plan to launch 'Union bonds'
to finance trans-European networks, the multi-billion dollar rail, road, and
telecoms infrastructure projects.
Amid strong scepticism in Bonn and London, EU finance ministers will
consider revised proposals for the European Commission to borrow on the
capital markets to help fund the networks, which Mr Delors argues are vital
for improving competitiveness and creating jobs.
Ministers meeting in Luxembourg will also discuss how to improve labour
market flexibility and tackle unemployment, now nearing 18m. A row would
damage prospects for the European summit in Corfu on June 24, which is
already threatened with a showdown over who should succeed Mr Delors as head
of the Commission.
Some diplomats in Brussels are predicting a stormy session today between Mr
Delors and the finance ministers, notably Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Last month, Mr Delors railed against a German plan to set up an independent
panel of experts to examine whether Brussels legislation is damaging efforts
to improve European competitiveness. Mr Clarke, anxious to build bridges
with Bonn, strongly supported the German deregulation plan, which has won
lukewarm backing from France.
However, Mr Delors is under pressure not to provoke a second confrontation
with the finance ministers. With short-term interest rates falling, German
monetary policy slackening and recovery clearly under way, senior Brussels
officials argue that the prospects for a successful summit are the best in
two years.
Aides to Mr Delors suggested that he might decide to shelve his financing
plan for the trans-European networks until the Essen summit in December, his
last appearance as Commission president.
But he remains convinced that the private sector and the European Investment
Bank alone cannot finance the multi-billion dollar projects - hence the
Commission's plan last week for financing a Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.85bn) alleged
funding gap for 10 infrastructure projects.
'The Commission's paper has reawakened some spectres we though had been
already killed off,' a UK official said.
Another diplomat added: 'We remain extremely sceptical, as do the Germans
among others, about the need for this. At the moment we are not persuaded
that there is a funding gap.'

The US said yesterday it might seek to organise international trade
sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear weapons programme
even if such action failed to win United Nations backing.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, also confirmed the US had built up
its troops in South Korea, although he said there was 'no immediate danger
of military confrontation'.
He said on US television: 'We are not seeking and we will not provoke a war,
but, at the same time, we will not invite a war by not being ready. We have
a commitment to defend South Korea; we are prepared to defend South Korea,
and we are capable of defending South Korea.'
Mr Perry said Washington would consult its allies this week over proposals
to impose trade and economic sanctions against Pyongyang over its failure to
co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Mr Perry said, however, that if sanctions were blocked in the UN, it was
'entirely possible' the US would seek formation of an allied coalition to
proceed.
President Bill Clinton said last night that 'the door is still open for them
(the North Koreans) to become part of the world community'. But he has
already begun to consult Russian president Boris Yeltsin and senior US
officials believe Russia would not block sanctions. They also consider it
possible that China, North Korea's sole ally and main source of oil, might
co-operate.
China has given no public indication that it was becoming exercised over the
crisis. Last week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said: 'At this time,
we do not favour the resort to means that might sharpen the confrontation.'
US, Japanese and South Korean officials agreed in Washington that sanctions
were an appropriate response to Pyongyang's refusal to co-operate. The US
said last week it would begin consultations in the Security Council.
The talks concluded that North Korea's most recent refusal to allow IAEA
inspectors to examine fully a nuclear reactor confirmed suspicions that
North Korea was developing nuclear weapons. The three said: 'the situation
demands that the international community, through the UN Security Council,
urgently consider an appropriate response, including sanctions'.

FT  06 JUN 94 / OFT to investigate market-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has launched a new
inquiry into the practice of market-making on the London Stock Exchange,
under which stockbroking firms buy and sell shares in publicly-quoted
companies.
The Office of Fair Trading has written to market makers, brokers and
institutional investors to ask for comments on the effects of market-making,
a system which is not used by other large international exchanges.
The last inquiry into market-making, which relies on large brokers providing
liquidity by guaranteeing to sell or buy shares at set prices, was made in
1988 and cleared the system of anti-competitive effects.
Supporters of market-making argue that it has helped London to establish a
pre-eminent position in Europe because it guarantees investors the ability
to sell and buy large blocks of shares.
The OFT said yesterday the inquiry was a standard re-examination of an area
that had been investigated before, and had not been prompted by a particular
concern that market-making had become less competitive.
The inquiry is likely to focus on the use of capital by firms that trade
shares, and on wheth-er the system allows market-makers to make excessive
profits by fixing large margins between their bid and offer prices.
Other exchanges tend to use systems of an order-driven type, where offers to
buy and sell blocks of shares at particular prices are posted on computer
systems and matched centrally.
Pressure from the former director-general of fair trading, Sir Gordon
Borrie, over the separation of brokers and jobbers, and minimum commissions,
eventually led to the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986.
A subsequent inquiry into the privileges and obligations of market makers in
1988 found that the rules of market-making on the London Stock Exchange were
'not significantly anti-competitive'. Sir Gordon said after that inquiry the
OFT might make a further assessment of market-making if there were
representations to suggest that competitive circumstances had changed.
The stock exchange said it had been informed of the inquiry by its listed
companies advisory committee, which had been contacted by the OFT. The OFT
is asking for preliminary responses by the end of this month. The OFT may
hold detailed talks with firms involved in market-making after that. It
could refer the stock exchange to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if
dissatisfied at the outcome.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Battle of soap powder giants gets even dirtier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Blue and red striped boxer shorts yesterday became the latest weapon in the
fierce battle between the world's soap giants.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US manufacturer, claimed that one pair of underpants,
faded and shredded to the point of indecency, had disintegrated during
repeated washing in the new soap powder launched by its bitter rival
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group.
According to P&amp;G, tests by research institutes show that clothes are damaged
by washing in Unilever's Persil Power.
P&amp;G yesterday circulated some of the institutes' reports and distributed
colour photographs contrasting the tattered state of clothes washed in its
rival's powder with the pristine, crisp state of those washed in its own.
P&amp;G later admitted the photographs were not from the research institutes but
from its own tests. 'There was no intention to mislead in supplying the
photos together with the institutes' reports,' it said last night.
Unilever rejected P&amp;G's claims. It said its own tests, carried out at one of
the research institutes quoted by P&amp;G, had shown no damage.
On Friday, Unilever dropped a Dutch court case against P&amp;G for making
'untruthful and misleading statements' about the properties of its new
detergent, which is sold as Omo Power in Continental markets. Unilever
acknowledged that its new generation washing powder could damage clothing
under 'extreme laboratory conditions'.
P&amp;G also claimed yesterday that clothes washed in Persil Power might
continue to fray even if consumers switched to a different soap brand,
because manganese residues from the powder, included to aid washing, had
built up on the fabric and remained 'active'.
Yesterday in Rotterdam, Unilever said: 'In the huge number of articles of
clothing washed in field trials there was no systematic build-up of
manganese residue. Moreover, even if there is manganese left on the
clothing, it does not later become reactivated.' Independent institutes in
France, Germany the Netherlands and the UK had confirmed these results, it
said.
P&amp;G's claims are based on reports from six European research institutes.
According to P&amp;G, the institutes, which tested clothes under normal
household conditions and followed the clothing manufacturers' instructions,
all reached 'similar conclusions'. It quoted the British Textile Technology
Group, based in Manchester, as concluding that 'Persil Power results in
fabric damage which would be unacceptable to a consumer'. The EMPA Institute
for Material Testing and Research in Switzerland found 'strong to very
strong weakening of the cotton fibres' after up to 25 washes in Persil
Power, P&amp;G said.
It also quoted a Dutch study last week as saying 'the use of Omo Power under
domestic washing conditions appears to result in extreme fabric damage on
some consumer garments making them unfit for use'.
Mr Andrew Seth, chief executive of Lever Brothers UK, said yesterday: 'It is
always possible in laboratories to choose test conditions which will give
you the results that you plan to get.' The temperature of the wash, the type
of garment and its colouring, and the level of soiling all affected the
results, he said.
'I am not saying that (P&amp;G's) data is inaccurate, just that it's
irrelevant,' he said. In separate tests conducted by BTTG, Unilever had been
assured that 'after repeated washing . . . no physical damage was visible'.
He also cited tests by the UK's Fabric Care Association which concluded
'essentially we see no evidence of visually apparent damage after 25
washes'.
He said Persil Power had been used in 60,000 homes and in 3m washes since it
went on sale in Europe and there had been 'a minuscule number of complaints
 -fewer than 10'.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Bundesbank chief warns on pace of EU expansion: Tietmeyer
urges deeper ties in core group of members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union could disintegrate if it takes in new members before
deepening monetary and political ties in a core group of the existing 12
members, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president.
Mr Tietmeyer, picking up the theme of a multi-track, multi-speed Europe,
warns today in the German newspaper Handelsblatt that the Union will fall
apart if progress towards monetary and political union is oriented towards
the 'slowest ship'.
Spelling out what a multi-speed Europe might look like, Mr Tietmeyer said it
was unlikely a majority of EU countries would fulfil the convergence
criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty by 1997.
'But stability is more important than the timetable,' he insisted, saying
that whether the union took effect in 1997 or 2000 was not the decisive
factor.
His hard-hitting remarks amplify the Bundesbank's view that monetary union
is appropriate only for a core group of countries which fulfil the
anti-inflation criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty.
His remarks also lend support to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the German leader,
who is in favour of a core group of countries pressing ahead with further
integration.
'A monetary union represents a long-term community of solidarity and risk,
which requires a corresponding long-term political union,' Mr Tietmeyer
said.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, echoed Mr Tietmeyer's view
that convergence was the priority. In a London speech at the weekend he said
convergence was the first concern and that an early move to a single
European currency would be a mistake.
'However appealing the vision of a single currency may be . . . the
absolutely essential prior economic condition is to establish sustainable
convergence, based on an underlying stability in the participating member
states,' Mr George said. 'I believe that we have a long way to go before
that necessary pre-condition will be met.'
The remarks of the two central bankers comes against the backdrop of a
sustained period of exchange rate stability within the European Monetary
System, following the substantial widening of the fluctuation margins last
August.
Mr Tietmeyer did not specify when he thought monetary union could be
achieved by the 12 existing states. He also failed to indicate which
countries he thought might be able to move more quickly to the first stage
of monetary union.
However, it is the Benelux countries, Germany and France that have achieved
most, so far, in co-ordinating interest rate policy and establishing
exchange rate stability, although it is only Luxembourg that fully meets the
tough convergence criteria.
Mr Tietmeyer's remarks represent an implicit rebuke to those who believe the
union can simply take in new applicants, in particular from eastern Europe,
without first deepening integration among the 12.
The EU had to to become deeper - in terms of closer co-operation between the
core member-states - at the same time as it became broader, Mr Tietmeyer
said.

FT  06 JUN 94 / PM says 'no plans' for VAT extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday all but ruled out extending value added tax to
zero-rated goods such as food and children's clothes. The move will restrict
chancellor Kenneth Clarke's room for manoeuvre in this year's Budget.
By going as close as he could to dismissing such a step, the prime minister
sent a strong signal that Mr Clarke should exclude a further expansion of
the VAT base from his revenue-raising plans for November.
His remarks followed Labour accusations late last week that the Tories were
preparing to extend VAT to more zero-rated goods. Labour's attack was
triggered by radio interviews in which both Mr Major and Mr Clarke refused
to rule out imposing the tax on food, public transport, children's clothes,
newspapers, books and period-icals.
Mr Clarke said then that such issues were a matter for the November Budget.
Mr Major said the government had 'no plans' to extend VAT, but 'these are
matters the chancellor has to consider'.
On BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme yesterday, Mr Major said he saw
'no likelihood' that the government would have to extend VAT before the next
general election.
'I see no likelihood of it, I see no need for it. We have an improving
economic situation, not a deteriorating economic situation, and we are a
government that cuts taxes by instinct and doesn't increase taxes by
instinct,' he said.
The prime minister was particularly robust in dismissing speculation that
VAT might be extended to food. Food was 'the last thing one would put value
added tax on'.
But, accusing his political opponents of 'politics by scare', he was careful
to leave some leeway for a possible change of tack, saying: 'We have no
plans to do it . . . but one learns in government it is better never to say
never.'
Labour last night pounced on this to accuse Mr Major of 'slipping, sliding,
ducking, weaving and diving' over the issue.

FT  06 JUN 94 / People: Romano Prodi gets on his bike - Robert Graham
reviews the achievements of the departing chairman of IRI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Romano Prodi is demob happy, having plucked up the courage to announce his
resignation from the chairmanship of IRI, Italy's huge debt-ridden state
holding company.
It was always questionable whether he would serve under the new Berlusconi
government. In such a hot seat he would have guided the biggest chunk of the
planned privatisations. But he took his time in reaching a decision.
The moment he chose came last week when the IRI board approved the 1993
balance sheet with record losses of L10,320bn (Dollars 6.4bn). Today he
begins a brief holiday to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary but will
return in an interim role until the shareholders' meeting on June 28.
'There was no confrontation with Berlusconi,' insists the 54-year-old
economics professor from Bologna. The two informally discussed his tenure at
IRI last autumn when Berlusconi still ran his Fininvest media empire and had
not declared an interest in politics. Even then, Prodi told the future
premier he was not considering a long stay.
'To do this job properly now would require staying on for some five years.'
Prodi wants to do other things like return to his native Bologna, ride his
bicycle and look after his economic think-tank, Nomisma. He also wants to
concentrate on one of his 'dreams' - the creation of an institute to export
Italy's successful development of medium-sized companies to developing
countries.
Some colleagues say he is biding his time before entering politics, but he
is coy about admitting this. Several times during the past two years of
transitional politics, Prodi, who is close to the former Christian
Democrats, has been mentioned as a possible premier. Since the election,
several of his colleagues in that party have tried in vain to enlist him as
a figure around which to build a new centre party to oppose Forza Italia.
He is smart enough to realise that Berlusconi and his right-wing coalition
government cannot be challenged in the short term. Asked how long
Berlusconi's honeymoon will last, he chuckles: 'His popularity depends on
whether or not Italy wins the Football World Cup.'
IRI for him is already in the past tense: 'Mine was an emergency
administration, brought in a year ago at the request of the Ciampi
government . . .I was given a completely free-hand and had Ciampi's full
support. It is the right moment to change.'
Unsaid but obvious is the fact that Prodi would have to work with a
government whose mindset he does not know and whose various components may
be pulling in different directions.
He would have risked being caught between those who want to privatise and
wind up the state holding as quickly as possible and others, like the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, who are nostalgic about retaining a
strong state presence in the economy - IRI was after all founded in the
1930s by their hero Mussolini.
Prodi was previously chairman of IRI from 1982 to 1989. But his role this
past year has been very different from what it was then. He found himself
frustratingly fettered at every turn by politicians who invariably placed
political criteria above business sense.
'It's been a very creative year,' he says with a hint of
self-congratulation. He feels he has laid down the the essential strategic
lines for IRI's future - 'progressive break-up through privatisation'.
Prodi is not without his critics, but few would deny his skill in tackling
the dismemberment of what was until recently considered an untouchable
institution. In Italy it is one thing to talk about slimming down the public
sector - quite another to translate this into action and tackle the vested
interests.
This time last year the turnover of companies under the IRI umbrella was
equivalent to 5 per cent of Italy's GDP. By the end of this year, especially
with the privatisation of Stet, its telecommunications arm, the proportion
will have been halved. Privatisation revenues over the past 12 months have
been L5,000bn.
'It is easy now to forget the tremendous scepticism only a year ago
surrounding our plans for privatisation. Many said privatisation wouldn't
work. They said people won't come forward and buy shares; others said the
operations won't be transparent. No one believed we would sell off our
entire stake in the banks.'
Despite such scepticism, he claims a new share-owning culture has been
created. 'Milan has been turned into a modern stock exchange,' he says,
relishing the idea of days when recent turnover has exceeded that of any
other European bourse.
'You had to begin privatisation of banking and finance. No other European
countries allowed over 85 per cent of the banking and financial system to be
held directly and indirectly by the state. You have to begin here if you
want a more pluralistic system.'
The banking privatisations he conducted - Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana (BCI) - are a sore topic. He cannot conceal a certain
bitterness about the way he failed to persuade the previous industry and
treasury ministers to agree to introduce legislation which would have
produced genuine public companies that protected the role of small
shareholders.
This left the way open for Mediobanca, the powerful and secretive Milan
merchant bank, to establish a dominant position in the privatised Credito
and BCI using its traditional foreign and Italian allies. The battle had
been well signalled in advance. Prodi had already rejected a closed offer
from Enrico Cuccia, the octogenarian honorary chairman, to take over at
least one.
'At least through privatisation, we got more money than Mediobanca offered
us,' he says in consolation. And adds defensively: 'The present situation
with Mediobanca exercising such control can only be an intermediate one.' He
believes other merchant banks can be formed by recruiting internationally to
rival Mediobanca's near-monopoly position.
The disposal of SME, the foodstuffs group, which he inherited, has also been
messy. Part of the group, the canned foods side, was sold to a heavily
under-capitalised consortium which has since been obliged to call in a white
knight in the form of controversial financier Sergio Cragnotti, Raul
Gardini's the former right-hand man.
'We got a good offer and the initial tranche of the payment was backed by
bank guarantees. How could we refuse?' Prodi says of the original consortium
which has now effectively been disbanded.
On the disposal of industrial assets, he has managed to accelerate the
reorganisation of Ilva, the loss-making state steel group, and hopes during
the current month to be able to settle the disposal of the special steels
arm. Here Krupp has emerged as a front runner in a consortium with the local
group, Riva.
'I have nothing against foreign groups taking advantage of privatisation -
although I think here as elsewhere in Europe, governments are anxious to
safeguard against foreign ownership of utilities . . . Nevertheless, here
one has to be careful of a backlash against foreign ownership. In particular
there are problems at a local/regional level in Italy; and the trade unions
remain suspect of foreign ownership.'
He feels the most important signal the Berlusconi government can give is to
respect the existing timetable for privatisations - notably for Stet and,
outside IRI's empire, INA, the state insurance group. At the same time he
says this means introducing early legislation to allow the Rome Airports
Authority and the company running the Autostrada toll roads to be fully
privatised.
But an equally important signal will be the person selected to replace him.
He observes dryly: 'I don't think Berlusconi has made up his mind about my
successor.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: A feast for Europe's media -
International Press Review / Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are very few prisoners whose incarceration would inspire a former
French prime minister to write a front page newspaper article protesting
against their plight.
Yet Mrs Edith Cresson, the former Socialist premier, was moved to do just
that in last week's Journal du Dimanche following the imprisonment of Mr
Didier Pineau-Valencienne.
The protest from Mrs Cresson, who once worked for Schneider, was followed
inside the paper by a declaration of support for the Schneider chairman
signed by 36 of France's most eminent industrialists. The protest set the
tone for French coverage of L'affaire Pineau-Valencienne.
'Stupefaction and emotion' was the headline of an article in Monday's
edition of La Tribune, the financial daily. Le Monde recalled Belgium's past
criticism of French 'imperialism' in the corporate arena.
Even Liberation, the liberal-left daily, expressed astonishment: 'Company
chairmen have been imprisoned before, but this time, a linchpin of the
establishment has been hit.'
Le Figaro, the centre-right daily, struck a cautionary tone on political
consequences of Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrest: 'A stumbling block in the
calm waters of Franco-Belgian relations'. Later in the week, the media
turned to long-term consequences on public perceptions of the business
world.
The news on Monday that Mr Pierre Berge, Yves Saint-Laurent chairman, had
been indicted for insider trading cast another cloud over the corporate
scene, as did continuing speculation over Mr Bernard Tapie, the left-wing
entrepreneur under pressure from Credit Lyonnais to repay part of his debts.
Liberation ended the week with an essay entitled 'Goodbye to business?' in
which Mr Michel Wieviorka, a leading sociologist, said idolisation of
business in the 1980s had been replaced with disillusion over the 'failure
of industry to reduce unemployment or to regenerate the economy'.
The Belgian press has been, as L'Echo, the francophone financial daily put
it, 'indignant that the French are indignant'. Many newspapers said that if
France had forgotten the principle of judicial independence, Belgium had
not.
'That this affair leads (in France) to unkind commentaries on the way
Belgian judges conduct business arises from confusion which borders on bad
faith and lends support to those circles that denounce, more often
incorrectly than not, French 'imperialism',' said La Libre Belgique.
La Libre noted that Mr Melchior Wathelet, Belgian justice minister, was
obliged to remind the French that, in Belgium, rule of law prevails.
De Standaard took a similar line, writing glowingly about the prosecuting
magistrate, Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, as 'a judge like no other'. The idea
that the arrest of Pineau-Valencienne was a lapse at the end of Van Espen's
long career is just 'wishful thinking' by people who believe that 'a judge
should defer humbly before a certain class of people', said the Flemish
daily.
La Lanterne, a populist tabloid, rephrased the same thoughts. 'France in
shock: how could a little judge dare ..' it suggested.
De Standaard even contemplated a conspiracy theory. While it was inevitable
business and politics in Belgium and France should be intimately involved
with each other, it said, political reaction in France prompted by the
detention lends weight to the theory that the French have a dark political
and economic strategy of investments and takeovers in Belgium.

FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bugatti to seek market listing
in New York

<TEXT>
Bugatti, the Italian luxury carmaker which owns Lotus of the UK, is to seek
a stock market listing in New York this autumn.
Bugatti's chairman, Mr Romano Artioli, told international journalists that
the company would seek more than Dollars 100m of financing through a US
flotation.
Bugatti, which is registered in Luxembourg but based near Modena, would
float its shares in New York rather than Milan because it was a more
sophisticated market, Mr Artioli said.
He said Credit Suisse First Boston would advise Bugatti on the sale.
The car manufacturer re-launched the Bugatti name last year with production
of the fastest sports car in the world and produced 80 cars in 1993. They
sell for L460m-L550m (Dollars 272,000-Dollars 325,000).
Bugatti is 100 per cent family-owned although it is believed outside finance
was needed for the L150bn re-launch. It is not known how much Bugatti paid
General Motors for the Lotus group.

FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Holders defeat Kmart's stock
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday suffered a
humiliating defeat at the hands of its shareholders when dissident
institutional investors succeeded in throwing out the company's
reorganisation plan.
Kmart said although the proposal won the support of 61 per cent of the
shares voted at its annual meeting in Troy, Michigan, the number of
non-voters left the company without the required approval of 50 per cent of
the eligible votes.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive said he was 'disappointed'
at the outcome. Management and the board would now assess the alternatives
available.
Kmart's plan had been to create new shares in its four specialty retailing
subsidiaries - Builders Square, Borders-Walden, OfficeMax and Sports
Authority - and raise money by selling stakes of up to 30 per cent in each
of them. It intended to retain majority control.
However, six of the company's most powerful institutional investors -
including the College Retirement Equities Fund, Wall Street's biggest
investor - publicly opposed the plan, saying Kmart should sell the
subsidiaries altogether and concentrate on improving the performance of its
ailing discount stores instead.
Some of the dissident investors said they would also withhold support for
the re-election of five board directors to mark their dissatisfaction with
the company's performance, but the five were re-elected yesterday.
The institutions are challenging Kmart's board and management because the
company has been struggling unsuccessfully to compete with its more
successful rival, WalMart.
Last year it ended five years of stagnant earnings by plunging into net
losses of Dollars 947bn.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Bank adjustment plan criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A note of controversy has emerged over UK monetary statistics after the Bank
of England announced yesterday that it would change its system of seasonal
adjustment next month.
City analysts and banking officials fear that revising the monetary figures
monthly, instead of six-monthly, could add more uncertainty to the monetary
series and undermine public confidence in the data.
The Bank argues that monthly revisions to its estimates will be relatively
small and insists that the updating system will provide accurate data more
quickly.
The British Bankers' Association said it had reservations about the new
system, which is being forced on it as a result of the Bank's changes. It
admitted that the system would pick up seasonal trends more quickly, but
said it would make it harder for City analysts to produce forecasts.
The association added: 'The big disadvantage, especially to commentators who
are expected to analyse the latest month's figure, is that they will not
necessarily know where they are starting from, since the previous month's
figures will have been revised - perhaps significantly.'
These fears were echoed by City analysts. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist
with Saloman Brothers, said: 'I would rather that (the revisions) were done
every year, not every six months. Doing it every month will add more
uncertainty.'
Mr Bob Pannell, economist at the Building Society Association, said: 'In my
own view this is an unhelpful development. You get to a stage where the
markets are reacting to second revisions and it becomes more remote from the
real economy.'
Bank officials insist these fears are exaggerated. After running test
dummies of the new system for the past two years, it predicts that revisions
will initially change M0, the narrowest measure of money supply, by 0.3 of a
percentage point a month. M4, the broadest measure of money supply, is
likely to change by 0.1 percentage point a month.
'Instead of having one big revision every six months, we have smaller
revisions more regularly - the advantage is that we can arrive at the final
resting place quicker,' the Bank said. The only monetary figure that will
not be updated will be December's M0, which is highly volatile due to
Christmas spending, it added.
The first data that will incorporate the changes will be M4 figures on June
20.

An opinion poll in Scotland today shows a 43-point Labour lead over the
Conservatives, who scored a record low of 10 per cent.
The System Three poll in today's issue of The Herald newspaper in Glasgow
suggests Labour has gained nine points in the space of a month, to 53 per
cent, with the Tories down four points.
The poll shows the Scottish National party still in second place with 24 per
cent, a fall of three points from last month, with the Liberal Democrats on
12 per cent, down two points.
The only party rated lower than the Tories is the Greens - at an unchanged 1
per cent. The survey was conducted among 983 people in 38 Scottish
constituencies from May 26 to 31.

Zaire began to fall behind on debt payments to the IMF in November 1990 and

FT  04 JUN 94 / Old secret of the modern Don Juan: At the opera the seducer
inspires. In life he is mocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a scene in Mozart's Don Giovanni which, I suspect, has puzzled many
others besides me. It is that passage in which the aristocratic seducer of
'old ones, young ones . . .' (and their daughters, I am sure) turns the full
power of his melody on to Zerlina, the peasant beauty, at her wedding lunch.
We know before she flutters her first hesitation, that she is lost; that she
is fated to be number one thousand and four, gaining at last nothing but
misery and shame, because no-one in those days would pay for her story.
But wait] Her lilting song entangles the don in one of the loveliest duets
ever written, peeping hesitantly at first and then gazing in wonder on the
rapture love. It is not necessary not be a moralist, nor to read leading
articles in British newspapers to know that this is not love. It is the word
that dares not spell its name, shameless, disgraceful and one which would
certainly have ruined our hero's political career, had he stooped to such an
occupation.
But - here is the puzzle - no-one is ever surprised that the deplorable
climax of this lascivious couple holds the audience in a spell of pure
beauty. Thousands of respectable parents, politicians and even newspaper
columnists, have been seduced by it. It would be too much to say that they
want the don to succeed, but certainly they delight in the attempt. And they
understand that, for the fleeting moment, it is love.
This is not the hypocrisy of those who relish a newspaper scandal, nor can
it be dismissed merely as a trick of the music; for the victim, Donna Anna,
remains a revolting moralist, even in her sublimest arias.
No, Zerlina's song captures exactly the concealed anti Christian message of
a story which has fascinated the warmer parts of Europe for 3 1/2 centuries.
The tale of the libertine dragged to hell by the statue of a murdered father
first hit the Spanish stage in 1630 as Tirso de Molina's play, The Seducer
of Seville. Why has it continued to hold the imagination? And why does it
now consume the British public to the exclusion even of European election
issues?
In our real life modern version, the father-judge is dead only to good
taste, and he drags the seducer merely into a living hell of press
interrogation; but the British son of a lord is heir to all the Spanish
don's arrogance, vitality and insouciant humour. He shares also a weakness
for chronicling his conquests.
And we love him, our Don Clark; or if not him, it. His ancient tale may not
be dismissed as an escape into male fantasy. For as my colleague with the
sparkling eyes observed: 'Women love a rogue. He understands them. And they
always hope . . .' That rascal Pushkin knew it too: His Juan found Anna
scandalously pliant even after he had murdered her father. Bernard Shaw gave
him the last word in hell. Many others, including Moliere and Baudelaire,
understood the story's dissident message.
Newspapers editors, alas, trade only in vulgar certainties and so force
their readers to become prigs or voyeurs. Yet Pushkin and Mozart are
honoured as gods for telling this story with elegant simplicity while
exploring, almost without our noticing it, a most uncomfortable truth -
namely, that the Christian sexual code never was accepted fully by western
society, whatever people pretended. It was and is defiantly ignored in real
life by bold dons and amorous women and secretly resented by many others who
may consume either great art and cheap newspapers - or both.
All understand that dons leave a trail of unhappiness: the tearful fury of
Mozart's Elvira, and the despair of Mrs Harkess, who cuckolded her husband,
the judge, only to become her daughters' rival.
But we know also that Zerlina is a pussy-cat longing to slip away to be
stroked and perhaps to bear her poor Masetto unexpectedly handsome sons.
Great art whispers, moreover, that the Christianised version of the myth
contains a deep untruth. In real life, Don Alan Clark, is not dragged into
the icy fires, nor even horsewhipped.
He suffers, like Leporello, the don's lecherous servant, some inconvenience.
Then he laughs defiance at the devil and lives happily ever after in his
castle with a wife who, not improbably, has the last laugh of all.
Real hell is the state of soul inhabited for evermore by Anna and Elvira
and, from last week it seems, by Mr and Mrs Harkess.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Shoot the bureaucrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifty years after the invasion of Normandy, we have turned western Europe
into a buffoon-state: a place where the bureaucrats control the asylum and
are running it in a manner that is an insult to the memory of those who
scrambled on to the Normandy beaches half a century ago.
This buffoon-state is a place of hysterical laughter, jokes and gibes
occasioned by the avalanche of directives and regulations emanating from
Brussels, as well as those concocted locally by bureaucrats working for
member governments.
How about this for a laugh: in Blackburn, the Cavalier Carpet Company,
surveying, in astonishment, the Pounds 28bn or so it costs per year to fund
the Common Agricultural Policy, has calculated that it would be much cheaper
to cover every square inch of the 12 European Union countries with
top-quality carpet.
Or how about this for a laugh: Oliver Field, of Berkshire, one of Britain's
top beekeepers, has been battling to stop Ministry of Agriculture officials
coming on to his honey farm to test his 500 hives for signs of 'foul brood',
a bacterial disease which can devastate bee colonies. The reason he did not
want them back is that in March 1992 they dosed six of his hives with the
anti-bacterial syrups used to cure foul brood - at four times the required
strength.
More than 250,000 bees died; he lost Pounds 3,000 worth of honey production.
He says that he could treat his own bees against the disease, as he used to,
but that the ministry's Bee Control Order makes that illegal. He has said he
would rather face prison than risk a repeat visit from the ministry's
blunderers.
Or how about this for a laugh: in November 1992, out in the North Sea, the
Peterhead trawler Sundari was battling mountainous waves. As she did so, her
crew struggled to hurl overboard 300 boxes of fully-grown haddock.
The skipper had to dump his entire catch, worth Pounds 8,000, because
Britain's annual haddock quota had already been caught.
If he had returned to port with his catch, he could have been fined up to
Pounds 50,000. But he couldn't help catching haddock. In the autumn of 1992,
haddock were present off the north-east Scottish coast in greater numbers
than for many years.
The trawlermen were trying to catch whiting. But every time they lowered
their nets they found them bulging with haddock. Meanwhile, other European
boats were catching almost unlimited quantities of haddock, knowing that
their own fisheries inspectors would not bother to enforce the quota rules.
Fifty years after the Normandy landings, you can laugh or you can cry at the
Europe that has been created, but you cannot ignore it. An excellent guide
to the pathology of the bureaucrats is a book, The Mad Officials, by
Christopher Booker and Richard North (Constable, Pounds 7.95), which
pinpoints what Booker calls the great regulatory disaster that has been
hitting millions of people, and thousands of businesses, in Britain alone.
But it is not all Brussels' fault. According to the authors, there is the
'Whitehall effect' - the way in which UK officials often tack new
requirements on to original EU directives, making their impact on businesses
much more damaging. In addition, there is a wave of regulatory law which is
entirely British-made and has nothing to do with Brussels. One of the
greatest problems of all is over-zealous enforcement.
'One thing which particularly struck us', they write, 'was that wherever we
looked . . . we found the great engine of bureaucracy and its myriad
officials behaving in the same, identifiable ways . . . using the same
jargon, causing the same problems, making the same mistakes.
It was as if we were always looking at the same enormous, blundering monster
which, although it had many heads, was always in the end the same
recognisable animal.'
The Mad Officials is important for the way it threads together the different
strands of the regulatory disaster caused by officials. But it has not
converted me from Euro-enthusiasm to Euro-scepticism. I am a federalist, as
it happens, if only because I detest and fear tribalism and nationalism.
The great thing that can be said for western Europe, 50 years after D-Day,
is that we are not ripping each other's throats out. We are muddling along
appallingly, but at least not warring. All we need to do is shoot the
bureaucrats.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Private View: A young trooper in the battle for Europe -
Robert Buckland, 25, is a Conservative candidate in the European elections.
He explains why he is running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Buckland, novice barrister, settled his tubby, pinstripe-suited frame
behind the pupil-master's desk and explained why he wants the 400,000 voters
of his region to make him a Euro-MP on Thursday. He is talkative, tidy and
25 years old.
Is politics your career? I asked him.
He looked momentarily uneasy. 'I don't like that word,' he said in his
sing-song Welsh accent. 'I think it's a vocation. I think it's a duty, an
old-fashioned thing. And indeed some people might think it was rather
disingenuous of me to start talking about service and duty. But I think it
is a calling, and a noble calling.'
Voters may think it has more to do with self-service these days than public
service.
'I know, I know,' sighed the candidate sadly. 'I think that's a problem of
communication.'
Communicating is not Robert Buckland's weak suit: although not on the
Conservative Party's official list of candidates he managed to persuade the
selectors to run him, the local boy, in South Wales West, a Labour-dominated
constituency they have little hope of winning.
This putative moulder of post-millennial Europe was a mere 10 years old when
Labour's strikebound winter helped Margaret Thatcher to her first election
victory in 1979. He says he remembers it well.
You were a bit precocious, then?
'I don't know about precocious. But I had a healthy interest in church
architecture from an early age. And my parents used to laugh about that. We
were always a very bookish family. My father (he is a solicitor) is a very
well-read man.' His mother runs a municipal luncheon club for pensioners.
He was, he said, a 'strange teenager' who spent his time at a local private
school 'reading and listening to music and thinking and writing and doing
all sorts of things that perhaps a normal child wouldn't have the time to
do. So to that extent it was rather an isolated upbringing. And this sense
of the misfit perhaps came in now and again. Perhaps I played up to it.'
His first political act, at 16, was to join the Llanelli Young
Conservatives. After school he worked as a political agent before going to
Durham University to read law and become president of the Union Society. He
sits on Dyfed county council.
His heroes are Peel, Disraeli and Lord Salisbury. He calls himself a
non-ideological, post-Thatcherite Tory for whom conservatism, today, wrongly
identified with large vested interests, is really about 'what used to be
called the little man'. He suggested his party's leaders have missed their
way, garbled their message and lost touch with the ordinary person.
No doubt they felt like you when they started, I said.
'I know. It's a real worry of mine,' he replied, quickly injecting a note of
humility. 'I don't want to forget that. I thought it would be much better to
come back to where I'm from and work amongst people I know, to stay local.'
Shouldn't you learn a bit more before aiming for Europe?
'Yes, I've got a lot to learn. I don't pretend I haven't. But if you don't
have people like myself from local areas who are genuinely interested in
foreign European policy and who have learned a bit about it beforehand, and
who, importantly, are from a younger generation, then where are we going to
be?
'Are we to continue to elect anonymous figures to Europe, or are we going to
start electing people who can relate those grandiloquent issues back to
grass roots?
'Although I'm young, I think youth is an asset. Why can't we have more of a
cross-section of representatives? Why is it that on my own county council I
am the youngest person by 15 years? The average age there is 70. They're all
old men] You've asked the question why. But why not? Pitt was prime minister
at 23.'
Are you attracted by the big expenses and salary?
'Well, I've heard a lot about the gravy train. Quite frankly, it doesn't
attract me. It concerns me if there is abuse. I would be scrupulous, first
of all in not indulging in it and secondly in trying to stop it.
'I'm doing very well, thank you very much, as a barrister. I'm working very
hard here. I'm managing to pay off my student debts. As far as I am
concerned it's not a meal ticket, it's something which genuinely interests
me. Call me an optimist, call me naive, call me young, whatever, I don't
care. That's how I feel now, and I don't want to forget that.'
While Buckland practises criminal law from Swansea, his girlfriend is in
London learning to be a manager with Abbey National building society.
I said: in politics you'll need a wife, of course.
He laughed, a little ruefully. 'Oh, I know that's what they say. I don't
like to see myself as this cut-and-dried young man who's, you know, going to
make it and has sort of set his sights and carefully tailored everything to
that end. I haven't'
Why do they see you like that?
'Because I'm young, because I'm a barrister, because I'm a Tory, because I
like going round and speaking to old ladies or whatever they seem to think
'Oh, yes, he's going to make it, he's going to be there, he's guaranteed, a
dead cert.' All I am is an enthusiast. I'm over-enthusiastic.'
You mean just because you're a cardboard cut-out young Tory doesn't mean you
don't care?
'Yeh. alright,' he said, swallowing the designation reluctantly. 'I do care.
I'm a human being just like anybody else and I have interests and passions
and concerns. I just want to get involved. There's no point sitting on the
sidelines.
What makes you passionate?
'What makes me passionate is . . . this sense of disillusion, particularly
now in the 1990s, this sense of cynicism, this disillusion that the general
public have with our elected politicians, this sense of drift . . . '
That's not a passion, I objected. I mean what brings a lump to your throat,
a knot to your stomach?
He pondered. 'I think, really, it's some of the traditional issues: the
Union, for example, does get me going. I genuinely get very passionate in
debates about the Union.'
Buckland explained that although he was proud of being Welsh - he sings
baritone in the choir - he loathed Welsh nationalism. 'There's no
contradiction between being Welsh, being British and being a European. I
think it was John Buchan who said you can't have too many loyalties. And I
agree with him. I rejoice in that illogicality.'
But do you have no over-riding humanitarian aim?
'I think it has to be the preservation of community spirit and the
preservation of the notion of awareness and responsibility to each other.'
Buckland is from an evangelical Anglican background, likes the Book of
Common Prayer but has no quarrel with women priests. 'It would be nice to
see Conservatives talking about Christian or religious values as being a
good thing.'
I thought they did that all the time, I said, but just practised the
opposite.
'Well, that's individuals,' he said quickly. 'No, what I am saying is there
are lots of values we have lost and we should go back and rediscover in
organised religion - as long as government does not preach where it cannot
legislate.'
Are people going to call you a young fogey?
'Now, yes, sort of A N Wilson men in tweeds? Funny, I thought you'd ask me
that. A young fogey is not only someone who dresses like that but who thinks
like a young fogey, who has a love of the old dispensation and a contempt
for change. That's dangerous. I'm not a reactionary.'
What will you do if you don't win this seat?
'Carry on working.'
Your next political step, I mean.
'I would like to be on the list and see where it goes from there.'
Would you like to be a minister one day?
'What I want to do is mark each target as it comes, become an effective MP,
as opposed to the ones I see round here who depress me. I can't help
thinking if only I was there perhaps I could do it differently. Being a
minister? Hmm. Yes, I suppose so. I haven't calculated anything.
'But I'm very conscious of what I don't want to be. I'm very conscious of
what I dislike about politics and politicians. At the same time I think I
have the frankness to admit that I'm still learning about what it takes to
be a good and right politician and an honest politician. Perhaps that
honesty itself shows I could have the capacity to make it.
'And I will make it.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: A northern family makes its mark - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have an affinity with Rutherford &amp; Son apart from the title. The author,
Githa Sowerby, grew up within a stone's throw of where I, too, spent
formative years. This was Low Fell, Gateshead, which a note in the National
Theatre programme quaintly locates in Northumberland. It is, in fact, in
Durham.
There were - and still are - Rutherfords all over the place, though probably
diminishing south of Darlington and north of Berwick. K. Rutherford Davis,
who wrote the definitive book on the subject The Rutherfords in Britain: a
History and Guide says that we were all descended from a Scottish laird in
the late 12th century.
Githa Sowerby plainly knew her background. Just after the successful opening
of Rutherford &amp; Son at the Royal Court in 1912, she told The Queen (the
magazine) that her original title, The Master, was blocked by copyright, so
she switched to Rutherford as one of the oldest and best known names in the
north. She never had such a theatrical triumph again. The reference books,
if they mention her at all, list her under her married name of Mrs John
Kendall. She died in 1970, having long since left the north-east for
Chelsea, then Kensington.
Ms Sowerby, as she would now be called, thoroughly deserves this revival.
Rutherford &amp; Son is an excellent play, somewhat in the manner of Harley
Granville Barker, who had his successes at the Court a few years earlier,
and of a kind much admired by Richard Eyre, the NT's director. In other
words, it is a grown-up piece for grown-up people.
A temptation nowadays may be to see it as early feminism, and certainly it
is a powerful plea against male domination. Historically, however, that is
not entirely surprising. The play coincided with the suffragette movement, a
body that might have achieved its aims much earlier had it not been for the
outbreak of the first world war.
The most fascinating aspect of Rutherford &amp; Son is the insight into family
business, the industrial revolution and the implicit realisation that, even
in 1912, Britain was in relative economic decline.
The business is glass making. Sowerby had some knowledge of it because her
father had inherited the family company in Gateshead. But glass needs new
processes in order to remain competitive. There is an uncanny resemblance in
Rutherford &amp; Son to some of the problems faced by another glass-making
company, Pilkington, in the 1950s. Without the new processes, the firm would
be dead.
Still, it is as drama, not history, that the play succeeds. Katie Mitchell,
who directs, has not pushed the feminist line too far. True, the old Mr
Rutherford who owns the glass works is a tyrant. He has little time for
anything but work and practically none at all for women, except as servants.
He regards his own sons - one of them a curate - as useless. But it would be
a one-dimensional interpretation of the piece to suggest that this was all.
Old Mr Rutherford, magisterially played by Bob Peck, has both thoughts and
feelings. He knows that the business is running down: when women, and
perhaps even male subordinates, stand up to him, he responds. He does not
like it, but he accepts reality.
The two women who matter most are his daughter-in-law, Mary, and his
daughter, Janet, played at the Cottesloe by Phoebe Nicholls and Brid Brennan
respectively. The daughter is prepared to walk out; the daughter-in-law is
prepared to stay, but only after dictating her own terms. This is
emancipation, and it is magnificently done.
Whether you will take to the accents depends on how well you know the
north-east. Some of them sounded awry. Vicki Mortimer's set catches superbly
the frugality of the well-off northern businessman.
In repertory, Cottesloe, (071) 928 2252.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: Intimate, yet spacious - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As one regular re-marked, 'Isn't it marvellous? They have increased the
audience by 400, but there is still plenty of room to stretch out when you
are having your picnic.'
The double success of the new opera house at Glyndebourne is to have
expanded the scale of operations, while keeping the intimacy that has made
the festival special.
For an opera such as Yevgeny Onegin the new theatre is ideal. Tchaikovsky's
romantic orchestra is able to fill its lungs and breathe with a depth of
sound that was not possible before, but the characters on stage still feel
close and intimate. Tchaikovsky thought that crucially important in this
opera, because he was dealing with ordinary people and wanted them to seem
as natural and true to life as possible.
As a producer, Graham Vick is the antithesis to that. He sees all his operas
in stylised terms and that goes for Yevgeny Onegin as well, even if it means
viewing the opera from the wrong end of the telescope.
An empty box provides the basic element of Richard Hudson's designs, varied
with doors opening on to other areas for some scenes - a visual style that
would seem bare, if the blend of colours was not so beautifully subtle and
the lighting so effective.
Where Tchaikovsky could not help falling in love with his characters, Vick
is always the sophisticated observer, watching them with cold detachment.
One senses little familial warmth on the Larins' farm; the peasants'
harvesting chorus becomes a formal song-and-dance routine. Later, when
Onegin and Tatyana meet to discuss her letter, they sit on opposite sides of
the stage, unable to spark any reaction off each other, even if it is hurt,
anger or shame.
Elena Prokina's Tatyana is left to live in an icy emotional vacuum, though
perhaps that is Vick's point. This young Russian soprano, who made such a
striking impression in the Royal Opera's Katya Kabanova earlier in the year,
fits conscientiously into the production's ideas. She keeps her Tatyana
outwardly cool and composed, admitting not a flicker of love's flame to show
on the surface. Only her tinglingly alive, soft singing (this is a
first-rate voice) hints at the intensity inside.
Her Onegin makes less impression than he might, although Wojciech Drabowicz
effects a properly disdainful manner and has a pleasing lyrical baritone,
lacking something in ring and focus in the middle.
Martin Thompson's Lensky, who lustily chases his Olga rather than reciting
poetry to her, has the soft head-tones the role requires, but does not use
them to win much sympathy for the character. At his death one feels sorry
for a wasted life, but not more.
Louise Winter works hard at being a carefree, playful Olga. It is good to
see Yvonne Minton back as Madam Larina and there is a restrained, not very
incisively-sung Filippyevna from Ludmilla Filatova. Frode Olsen is a model
of aristocratic dignity as Prince Gremin and sings his aria with
distinction. By the final act Tatyana has left her rural home to marry him
and join St Petersburg society: a world of formal posturing, in which Vick's
sense of ironic detachment runs riot.
Nevertheless, it is in these final scenes that the production starts to come
together, aided by Andrew Davis whose conducting of Tchaikovsky is equally
cool-headed and needs time to build up a head of emotional steam.
Glyndebourne has a reputation as a company which fuses music and drama as
one. Whatever reservations one might have of it, this production is at least
all of a piece.
Sponsored by Lehman Brothers. Fourteen further performances ending July 24.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: In support of a summer institution - William Packer
finds this year's Royal Academy Summer Show a hotbed of controversy and
talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It really is time to stand up for the Royal Academy's annual Summer Show.
This year's is the 226th in an unbroken sequence that goes back to 1768, and
without it the Academy would be nothing.
Whatever else it does in the meantime with its splendid galleries, it
remains in its essence what it always was - a private society of artists
come together for the purpose of showing the work of its members by right,
and of others by invitation. That is entirely its affair.
Throughout its history it has been a natural source of controversy, stirring
up squabbles within and resentment and misunderstanding without. But then
what else would we expect, or indeed want? This year is no exception and
fairness requires only that our criticism should be levelled at what is
presented in the light of what is possible, given the nature of the beast.
Some hope.
I have seen every Summer Show since 1960. I first successfully submitted my
own work in 1963, and have continued to do so at intervals, though not this
year. I reviewed every one from 1970 to 1990, at which point it seemed
reasonable to pass the duty on to a colleague for a while. I am, you might
say, an old Academy hand.
But I remember well the days when the Academy had seemed to set its face
against much of contemporary painting and sculpture, alienating a whole
generation of artists. And I recognise now just how much the Academy has
re-newed itself from within, reclaiming that central position in British art
which it was always meant to hold.
In resuming my own public response this year, I have to say that I have been
shocked, not by the Summer Show itself, but by the published violence
already visited upon it. Certainly I hardly recognised the show described so
brutally by at least two distinguished colleagues on other papers as the one
I visited and enjoyed myself.
Of course there are weak and even dreadful things among those on show, but
then how could there not be in a miscellaneous show of even 300, let alone
some 1300 works? And how could any such show achieve formal or thematic
coherency when the member artists alone, who have the right to show six of
their works, are of such different kinds? To expect such virtue is to miss
the point.
There is nothing like the Summer Show anywhere else in the world, and its
critical importance lies in its very independence from critical dogma and
curatorial orthodoxy.
I would defend it on those grounds even at its most maddeningly
idiosyncratic and perverse, but that is hardly the case today. What in fact
it demonstrates to the world at large is that the Turner Prize and the
Saatchi Collection notwithstanding, and all that goes with them of
avant-garde orthodoxy and opportunism, there remains a broad and rich
stratum of professional artists hard at work putting paint on canvas, making
prints, making sculpture.
Some of them may have had their own moment in the spotlight of critical
approbation, which has now passed on: others may have long been disregarded.
Some are abstract in their preoccupation, some still content to draw upon
the stimulus of the real and visible world.
Collectively in their work they give the lie to the facile assumption that
such things of any quality are no longer done, that none of it is worthy of
the collections of the Tate or the honour of a British Council tour abroad,
that none of it is even worth attention.
And who could honestly say that the quality is not there, if only the
visitor has the independent curiosity to discover it on the walls of the
Academy for himself? With some 400 fewer works hung, this Summer Show is
smaller than normal and, taking it room by room, is clearly and effectively
hung. The architecture, spreading into the Central Hall, is less
constricted, and the sculpture, though still a problem, is better
assimilated throughout than before and well displayed in its particular
concentration in the Lecture Room.
Of particular works, I recommend the still-lifes of Gus Cummins and
Elizabeth Blackadder; the etchings of Norman Ackroyd and Peter Freeth; the
large abstracted water-colours of Norman Adams; two vast abstracts by Sandra
Blow; the quiet Sussex parkscapes and greenhouses of Olwyn Bowey; Norman
Blamey's portrait of his son - which is as fine a modern portrait as one
could find. Portraits and life painting and drawings of true distinction are
thin on the ground.
Of the non-members' works, I was drawn to Chris Orr's Small Titanic print;
to Noel Forster's linear abstract; to three tiny still-lifes by John
Maddison; to Stan Smith's seated nude; to Karn Holly's Paris bridge; to the
animalier sculpture of Adrian Sorrell; to a portrait by Tom Coates. But it
is invidious to go on . . . Peter Coker, Anthony Whishaw and William Bowyer
 -the 226th Summer Show has much to show for itself.
The Summer Exhibition: Royal Academy of Arts, Piccadilly W1, until August
14: sponsored by Guinness.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: Renaissance of the Gothic master - The eccentric
pioneer that architecture forgot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROSEMARY HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is hardly a town in Britain that would not look different today if
Welby Pugin, the architect who began the 19th-century Gothic revival, had
never lived. His influence spread with the Empire. From Bombay to Melbourne,
the Gothic schools, country houses, churches, railway stations and horse
troughs that dot the landscape owe their inspiration to him.
In his work on the Palace of Westminster he gave London one of its greatest
landmarks, Big Ben. As a theorist he was the first designer to formulate the
modernist principle of 'truth to materials', and as a pioneer of flatpack
furniture his presence still haunts Habitat today.
Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than his achievements is the extent
to which they have been written out of art history. This has something to do
with Pugin himself. He was not by temperament or circumstances a conformist,
falling foul of every institution he came into contact with, including
Oxford University and the Vatican. After his death, in 1852, the Victorians
preferred to forget him.
He was born, in London, in 1812, the son of a French emigre illustrator and
his English wife. The Pugins struggled to keep up genteel standards, but
money was always short. Pugin got most of his education at home among the
pupils in his father's drawing office and on family visits to France. A
precocious only child, by the time he was 15 he had his first job -
designing furniture for Windsor Castle. It was a debut that set the pace for
the rest of his short, turbulent life.
During the next six years he worked as a scene painter at Covent Garden and
set up a furniture business that failed. He became a keen sailor, buying his
own boat in which he imported antiques from the Continent to sell in Soho.
At 17 he married for the first time, his wife dying in childbirth within a
year. By the time he was 21 he had been ship-wrecked, bankrupted and
widowed. He decided to become an architect.
In 1834 the old Palace of Westminster burned down, watched by a huge crowd
that included Lord Melbourne, Turner and Pugin himself. It marked a turning
point in his career and in the history of architecture. In the competition
to rebuild Parliament Pugin acted as Charles Barry's 'ghost', making the
drawings for what turned out to be the winning design.
Periodically for the rest of his life Pugin worked on the decorative details
of the palace.
He provided hundreds of designs for wallpaper, carpets, firedogs, the
monarch's throne, from which the Queen's speech is still delivered, as well
as the interior of the central lobby and the idea for Big Ben. But he had
little respect for what is now his best-known work. He resented Barry's
modifications and, as his own ideas evolved, he found himself working in a
style he had outgrown.
He had become a Roman Catholic - a socially disastrous move at that time -
and it was his faith as much as his practice as an architect that shaped his
ideas. They were laid out in his first book Contrasts in a series of
illustrations comparing the buildings of the 19th century with those of the
middle ages - to the advantage of the latter. He argued that modern
architecture was not only ugly but inhumane, reflecting a moral as well as
an aesthetic decline.
Pugin spoke to a generation as troubled as our own about the moral aspects
of architecture and city planning. His arguments struck home to a nation on
the brink of the steam age. New buildings - factories, gas works and urban
slums - were being run up without design. An architecture that was ethically
and historically rooted was deeply attractive. Gothic, popular as a novelty
style since the 18th century, quickly became a principled, national school
of architecture.
For 15 years Pugin worked at incredible speed on churches, cathedrals and
private houses. He wrote more books, exploring the principles of medieval
design and applying them with radical originality to his own work. He
employed no clerk - 'I'd kill him in a week' - and fitted in his work for
Barry when he could. But he always made time to design any small thing, a
tea caddy for example, that his wife might want.
Pugin married three times and had eight children. An affectionate man for
whom domestic life was central, he never lost sight of the humanising
influence of Gothic. The alms houses he designed in Lincoln are still in
use. For more than a century the elderly inhabitants have been grateful for
the cloister walk that allows them to visit one another sheltered from rain
and wind. These small, efficient houses are the essence of the man, as much
as the sumptuousness of his great church of St Giles, Cheadle.
By the late 1840s his practice had begun to decline. Other architects took
up his ideas and won the commissions. Most of them were cheaper and all were
easier to work with. Pugin would arrive on site in the sailing clothes he
always wore, shout instructions at the workmen and disappear on the next
train. He overspent budgets and was spectacularly tactless with his patrons.
As a design theorist he began to be overtaken by John Ruskin. On the
religious front, the Catholic revival was now led by Cardinal John Henry
Newman who made heroic efforts to accommodate Pugin but could not understand
his devotion to Gothic. Asked if he would build an oratory, Pugin told the
cardinal he would rather design a mechanics' institute.
His swan song was the Medieval Court at the Great Exhibition of 1851, which
persuasively promoted Gothic as a domestic style. The next year, aged 40, he
lapsed suddenly into insanity. He had contracted mercury poisoning from the
eye baths his doctors gave him for inflammation. Within six months he was
dead. He had always been eccentric and intense, so his final illness made it
easy to dismiss him as a madman. He was already forgotten when Gilbert Scott
built the Albert Memorial. Finding there was no provision for a statue of
Pugin, Scott gallantly gave up the space reserved for his own.
Pugin's place in history, however, continued to be denied. Reappraisal of
his work began in this century with Kenneth Clark and has now led to an
important exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum. At last he can take
up the position he deserves, alongside Ruskin and William Morris, in the
history of English art and ideas.
Rosemary Hill is working on a biography of Pugin to be published by Hamish
Hamilton.
Pugin: A Gothic Passion opens at the V&amp;A on June 15 from 10.00-17.30 Tuesday
to Sunday, and 12.00-17.30 Monday. It runs until September 11.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Collecting: Rarities in blue and white - Susan Moore samples
the numerous wares of quality Chinese porcelain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese porcelain takes pride of place at the seasonal Oriental art shows in
London this month. Even the British Museum presents highlights from the
Meiyintang Collection, the first public display of one of the largest and
finest private holdings of Chinese ceramics in the west.
Amassed during the last 40 years, this continental collection is remarkable
for the variety, quality and rarity of its pieces which range from Neolithic
pottery and Han and Tang dynasty tomb figures and burial wares to Ming and
Qing Imperial porcelains (June 9-September 9).
Eskenazi has a no less sumptuous feast of market rarities in its exhibition
of early blue and white (10 Clifford Street, W1, June 7-July 8). From their
first large-scale manufacture in the 14th century, these luxurious white
porcelains painted in underglaze cobalt blue have been highly prized in
China and beyond. Perhaps no ceramic tradition has been more widely imitated
or more enduringly popular.
The Middle East appears to have been the destination of a number of these
vessels. Forms are distinctly un-Chinese: there are Islamic emblems, even a
Persian inscription proclaiming a piece the property of one Alamgir Shah.
The star turn, discovered in Damascus 30 years ago, is a spectacular and
densely decorated mid-14th century Yuan dynasty dish, 46cm wide. In the
central medallion, reserved in white on a rich blue ground, are cranes and
ducks in a lotus pond, well observed and full of life.
Their liveliness is matched by the dish's surface: one of the delights of
handling blue and white is the way in which the impurities in the cobalt
produce a heaped and piled effect in the glaze and a varying intensity of
blue.
This unique piece is of museum quality and into a museum it may well go  -
given that it was broken and repaired and even hair-line cracks are not
tolerated by the new breed of avid Hong Kong collectors.
The show's other tour de force is not technically blue and white at all.
This large, deep Ming dynasty bowl of the Hongwu period (1368-98) is
decorated with scrolling peonies in underglaze copper red, which firing has
turned into the subtlest of pinks and greys. Dated 1340-1435, the 26 pieces
bear Pounds 45,000-Pounds 400,000 price tags.
At S. Marchant &amp; Son (120 Kensington Church Street, W8), the focus is on the
great age of blanc de Chine - 1640-1710 - a much more particular taste. As
this show demonstrates, however, the craftsmen of provincial Dehua gave
their glossy white wares an astonishing variety of expression. At one
extreme stands a graceful and superbly modelled Guanyin or goddess of mercy
in flowing robes. Dating around 1640, and 38cm high, the figure bears the
seal mark of the mysterious He Chaozong, the most illustrious name in Dehua
porcelain. At the other, a whistle in the form of a European gentleman in a
tricorn hat seated astride a comically grinning tiger. The whole group is
only 4.7cm high. Prices Pounds 200-Pounds 30,000 (June 3-24).
Early celadon porcelains from Korea, China and Japan are the delicate fare
at Jehanne de Biolley Oriental Art (29 Conduit Street, W1, June 1-July 1).
Prices Pounds 150-Pounds 20,000. Chinese, Korean and Japanese works of art
are also at Spink's, 5-7 King Street, SW1, June 1-17. Notable here is a pair
of white jade lotus-shaped drinking cups that unusually bear the mark of the
Qianlong emperor, and an understated white porcelain moon flask from late
Choson dynasty Korea. Prices Pounds 5,000-Pounds 150,000.
The Oriental Art Gallery's wide- ranging exhibition includes Ming and Qing
caladons, blanc de Chine and monochrome porcelains at 4 Davies Street, W1,
June 7-24. Prices Pounds 950-Pounds 55,000, with most objects under Pounds
10,000.
With characteristic theatrical flourish, Christian Deydier of Oriental
Bronzes Ltd unveils one extraordinary item for one evening only. This is a
pair of stylised gold tigers dated to 8th century BC China, their slender,
elongated bodies decorated with cinnabar stripes and formed out of gold
strips wrapped and pinned around a wooden core. Professor Han Wei, an
authority on ancient Chinese gold, has suggested that the 45cm long tiger
mounts flanked a burial pillow. Nothing quite like them is known in gold -
nor any other gold artefact of comparable size and date. Deydier is asking
around Pounds 1.5m. 96 Mount Street, W1. June 7, 5.30-8pm.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: Exiles go wild for the Bahian beat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine Elton John, George Michael, Shirley Bassey and Kate Bush sharing a
stage and you get some idea of the excitement frothing around the Albert
Hall this week when the Four Great Bahians, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso,
Gal Costa and Maria Bethania, collectively gave the Bahian Festival in
London a celestial climax.
The singers all come from that Brazilian state that looks towards Africa for
its history and culture, and although, to add some spectacle, the Mangueira
samba school from Rio were also on the bill, it was very much a celebration
of Bahian music.
When political exiles in London in 1969, Gil and Caetano became Rolling
Stones groupies, and once back in Brazil they added electric guitars to the
traditional samba rhythms to create Tropicalism, the most distinctive
Brazilian sound for the next 20 years.
This reunion concert gave to a new generation of voluntary exiles music that
was indirectly inspired by their temporary home.
They loved it. You expect Brazilians to stand up and samba at the tap of a
drum; you do not expect them to know every word of every song. It is
distinctive music. Unlike Spanish Latin American music, with its sensual
brass obligatos, the music of Brazil is drum driven - very African. To
outsiders the singers often seem to sing across the musicians: it has no
easy appeal - it is a national ritual.
The atmosphere was naturally relaxed, the singers appearing solo, to duet,
to quartet, as the mood took them. Gil was exuberant; Caetano wistful; Costa
and Bethania full-throated.
Romantic ballads and plangent songs of home nestled alongside rousing
chants, in which the audience hurled back as echoes the Amazonian caws of
the singers. There was no interval and the bars stayed open.
There was also the overpowering sight of Mangueira, the Manchester United of
the samba bands, sashaying its way on to the Albert Hall stage. First the
percussionists, dressed like camp centurions; then the poseurs, arrayed like
gigantic birds of paradise, parading plumage tails 15ft wide; finally the
dancers, quivering every inch of their bodies.
Once the balloons had fallen; the audience had danced itself dry; the flags
had been fluttered; the fever had died down, the Four Bahians returned for
their own encore. It was both a personal event yet also a national occasion,
a vibrant nostalgia for home. It was no place for a foreigner to be.
While the Rio carnival might now be a tourist attraction Bahia hugs its
local identity and for one night the heart beat of Salvador, its capital,
was in SW7.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Collecting: Dealers face the month of truth - Is the
antiques revival under way? Antony Thorncroft looks at the Grosvenor House
and Olympia fairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is it: the month that will decide for many of the nation's 8,000
professional antique dealers if the long-awaited, and oft-predicted, revival
in demand is actually there - or whether they will have to struggle on,
persuading their bank managers they are worth supporting for another year.
In June, London once again becomes - although briefly - the centre of the
international art market. Rich collectors and dealers arrive for the grand
Grosvenor House Fair which, for 10 days from Thursday, celebrates its 60th
anniversary.
They take in, too, the important exhibitions staged simultaneously by the
top West End galleries, plus the major auctions. And they will surely pop
along as well to Olympia where, for the next nine days, more than 400
dealers, mainly British but with an increasing number of foreign exhibitors,
display the largest accumulation of vetted antiques seen annually in London.
Around 40,000 people are expected at Olympia, a popular bun-fight where the
largest London dealer in Old Masters, Richard Green, lines up alongside
provincial furniture dealers on their annual selling trip to London. Some
will expect to notch up 40 per cent of their annual turnover there from the
choice items they have salted away for the occasion.
Opening day on Thursday got off to a starry start - Elton John, Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Rowan Atkinson were all touting their cheque books. Of course
Olympia is too large - although Imagebase, a visual database which locates
the stands offering the antiques in which you might have particular
interest, should ease aching feet. Dealers love Olympia. One reason is that,
at around Pounds 15,000 a stand, it is half the price of Grosvenor House.
But it really does have an aura of excitement despite the chaos.
In good years, Grosvenor House dealers used to raid Olympia each day for
fresh stock. It could just happen again in 1994, for there is a feeling that
the revival in business must come soon. To help with transport, there is a
bus service between the two fairs.
Grosvenor House has a very different atmosphere. The organisers have
digested the fact that its glitzy array, and sometimes exorbitant prices,
have deterred both middle range collectors and informed browsers. They know
also that the more international Maastricht fair in March has had the edge
in recent years. So, for its diamond jubilee, Grosvenor House has been given
a new look
The biggest change is quite revolutionary: it has abolished datelines. For
the first time, the great works of art of the 20th century - Picasso
paintings, Matisse prints, art deco ceramics, abstract expressionism even -
can now be displayed. Indeed, it is possible that the Dover Street Gallery
will offer a painting by the still-shocking Allen Jones, creator of sexist
furniture.
There will certainly be 1920s' furniture on the Yves Mikaeloff stand; a
1930s' bronze at Agnews (along with a fresh-on-the-market Lawrence
portrait); an Ivon Hitchen at Spink; Matisse lithographs at William Weston;
and designs by Omar Ramsden and CR Ashbee at Nicholas Harris.
It will take time for the change in stock to filter through: despite the
arrival of a few foreign dealers, Grosvenor House remains the annual
showcase for the cream of the British antiques trade and, especially, brown
furniture dealers. But, over the next few years, younger and trendier
collectors of the modern will have reason to add this fair to their
itinerary.
A more immediate impact comes from a transformation in the fair's
appearance. Designer George Carter has created a classical environment, with
colonnades of Tuscan pilasters creating a unified look. The height of the
stands has been raised considerably so that more substantial antiques, like
chandeliers and tapestries, can be displayed attractively.
Dealers also are attempting to offer a wider range of stock. There will be
fewer seven-figure masterpieces and more four-figure collectables. Among the
affordable items are early English needlework at Witney Antiques; a Danish
wine barrel at Jeremy Ltd; St Louis goblets at Mallett; and a pair of
Regency painted children's chairs at Halcyon Days.
In total contrast is Newark, in Nottinghamshire, the biggest antique and
collectors' fair in the world with up to 4,000 stalls stretching over 86
acres. It opens on Tuesday; and, although it might be only one step ahead of
a superior boot sale, there is enough good furniture on display for it to be
a magnet for continental dealers.
Yes, there are too many fairs. But with dealers being forced by higher costs
and lower revenues to close down their retail premises - Lapada, the
Association of Art and Antique Dealers, reckons that up to 10 per cent of
its members have shut up shop in the past two years - fairs, both specialist
and general, have become a lifeline for dealers now trading from home. At
fairs, they can acquire new stock, meet existing and new customers - and
perhaps sell some antiques.
As well as the big mixed fairs, this month also sees two successful
specialist gatherings in London: the Antiquarian Book Fair, at Grosvenor
House for the first time, from June 30; and the International Ceramics Fair,
at the Park Lane Hotel from June 10.
While there has been a slight improvement in demand in the antiques trade
over the past year, the recovery remains as elusive as that in house prices
and the economy generally. If overall confidence improves, so will antique
buying.
Dealers hope there is considerable pent-up demand; certainly, there is a
shortage of good items appearing on the market. The travails at Lloyd's have
released relatively few art works to date although, sadly, they have
eliminated one major source of buyers.
Salerooms are showing dealers the way by looking overseas for new business.
Of course, with vastly greater financial resources, it is easier for them to
do so. This year, both Christie's South Kensington and Bonhams - which
concentrate on the middle and lower ranges of the market - report an
increase in turnover of more than 20 per cent.
This comes partly from their success in marketing themselves to foreign
buyers - in Bonhams' case, by forming a marketing relationship with auction
houses in New York, Los Angeles and Vienna.
Demand also has been stimulated by the salerooms trading in new markets.
Christie's South Kensington has had great success with cameras  - and
corkscrews. Bonhams is offering Victorian Gothic on June 20 to coincide with
the big Pugin show at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum this month.
In areas such as furniture and, to a lesser extent, pictures, there is no
doubt that buyers now have the confidence to bid at auction rather than rely
on the advice of dealers. This is a long-term problem for the trade, which
fairs go only some way to countering. But stories about the demise of London
as an international art centre seem premature. Leslie Waddington, one
leading modern art dealer, might be threatening to close one of his
galleries in Cork Street, London - but that would leave him with a couple of
brace still trading happily.
Indeed, three important international dealers have just shown their faith in
the future by opening up in London for the first time. Finarte, from Italy,
is mounting a major show of the work of the surrealist artist de Chirico in
new premises in Mason's Yard; Johnnie Eskenazi, cousin of Giuseppe, is
settling in Old Bond Street to trade in rugs, textiles and Oriental art; and
Danny Katz gives London its first major specialist sculpture gallery, in the
old Heim premises in Jermyn Street.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Property: Where it pays to be quick - Hampshire has
everything for the would-be resident but homes can sell fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Variety and convenience make Hampshire popular. It is a large county with
masses to offer. Gardening thrives. So do fishing on the rivers Test and
Itchen and riding in the New Forest.
For sailors, there is Cowes Week. Winchester, the county town, is packed
with history, archaeology and education. And Jane Austen lived in Chawton,
near Alton.
Transport links are excellent. It is an easy journey to London by train or
on the M3 motorway. And cross-Channel ferry services mean that a short break
in France can happen any weekend, finances permitting.
Hampshire homes, when priced sensibly, are selling fast in 1994. Philip
Gossage, of John D. Wood's Lymington office, described it as a 'hardening'
market, with many more deals than last year.
Many sales are on the invisible market, when an agent dangles a likely buyer
before an owner who has often thought of selling - and might have asked
agents what the house should fetch - but has never quite steeled himself to
proceed.
Now, he is faced by a buyer with cash who wants an answer. Philip Blanchard,
of John D. Wood in Winchester, agreed three such under-the-counter sales in
a day recently, all in the Pounds 350,000 range.
At the top end of the market, Blanchard stresses how much it helps for the
vendor to prepare the paperwork (deeds, searches, etc) before marketing
begins. Then, a price can be agreed on a Thursday and contracts exchanged
the following Monday, as happened with Upton Manor near Andover (guide price
Pounds 1.5m).
For Lady Soames's Castle Mill House at North Warnborough (offers over Pounds
800,000), with fishing on the river Whitewater, Lane Fox had more than 40
viewers and several offers in the 3 1/2 weeks it was on the market. In the
medium-price range, Hamptons reports that offers can appear in the first
24-48 hours of marketing.
The north-eastern part of Hampshire is particularly accessible, which makes
Forge Cottage in Odiham enticing at Pounds 120,000 on a 1,000-year lease
that began in 1863, or Holly Tree Cottage in South Warnborough at Pounds
129,000. The agent for both is Hill &amp; Morrison, which also is selling flats
in the handsome Georgian Kingston House in Odiham High Street (now being
restored) at Pounds 195,000 and Pounds 220,000.
Runtens Farm at Rotherwick, near Basingstoke, is half-timbered and has a
barn and a paddock (Pounds 425,000 from Lane Fox in Basingstoke). Near
Alton, Farringdon House is a substantial turn-of-the- century brick building
in four acres (from Hamptons in Alton, Pounds 325,000).
Hill Top, at Powntley Copse (Hill &amp; Morrison, Pounds 250,000), is a little
gem of the 1930s in white-painted brick. The copse was a development of 26
gentlemen's cottages/weekend retreats in 32 acres of wood; Hill Top has 2.6
of them and is the last house in the wood. It makes an intriguing change
from the Tudor half-timbering and Georgian red brick so frequent in
Hampshire.
If your retreat must be in timber and thatch, Ivy Cottage in Wherwell, a
village on the Test near Stockbridge, could be ideal (Pounds 140,000 from
John D. Wood in Winchester). But if you want age, Goleigh Manor at East
Tisted, near Alton, dates back to medieval times. Built of timber, brick and
stone, it is named after the de Golley family (which is known from 1200),
and Winchester College owned it from 1469 to 1965. Price: Pounds 750,000
from Savills.
Lane Fox's London office offers Lyss Place, with 217 acres near Petersfield,
for Pounds 1.5m. It has good Georgian rooms but needs some work. Nearby
Stodham Park is an immaculately restored Regency house, rich in bedrooms and
with an indoor swimming pool. It is set in 23 acres, which include a stretch
of trout fishing on both banks of the river Rother. Price: Pounds 1.95m from
Savills.
The red brick Rookery Farm at Kingsley, near Alton, is cheaper at Pounds
395,000 (from Hill &amp; Morrison). A neighbouring wood belonging to the
Woodland Trust (and listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest) helps
privacy.
Fishermen and bird-watchers will opt for the Lower Itchen Fishery, three
miles of trout fishing on the river Itchen just one mile from Eastleigh
airport, near Southampton. The bailiff has noted more than 150 types of
bird. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley is asking around Pounds 1.05m for four lots as a
whole, including a mill and mill pond.
For sailors, Sally Point is a modern house at Hamble with its own mooring
and splendid views over the river Hamble ( Pounds 385,000 from Hamble Estate
Agency or John D. Wood). They are also joint agents for Bailey Cottage -
originally a barge-master's house - at nearby Old Bursledon (Pounds
185,000).
Another property offered by John D. Wood (with Penyards) at Old Bursledon is
8 Greyladyes, the centre part of an 1800 manor house (price: Pounds
225,000). Inland at Wickham, overlooking the village square, the same agents
have Havelock House, an unusually smart 18th century red and blue brick
property listed grade II* (Pounds 300,000).
New on the market at Beaulieu is Blackbridge House, 1930s' Tudoresque with
views down to the Beaulieu river (from John D. Wood in Lymington for Pounds
450,000). On the east edge of the New Forest, Oakapple Cottage at Bartley,
near the end of the M27 motorway, is a four-bedroom thatched house (from
Woolley &amp; Wallis: Pounds 525,000).
In Winchester itself, Westbrook House is a 15th-16th century timber-framed
building in Chesil Street (from the Winchester offices of Hamptons or John
D. Wood for Pounds 153,000).
Further information: Hamble Estate Agency, Hamble (0703-455 055); Hamptons,
Alton (0420-868 68) and Winchester (0962-842 030); Hill &amp; Morrison, Odiham

Basingstoke (0256-474 647) and London (071-499 4875).
Penyards, Fareham (0329-844 812); Savills, Guildford (0483-576 551); John D.
Wood, Lymington (0590-677 233) and Winchester (0962-863 131); Woolley &amp;

FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: An Italian secret to be shared - Alan Ponsford
enjoys an unpolluted Mediterranean shoreline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PONSFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was like coming home, except that we did not paint a wall or prune an
orange tree or unstop a drain.
But, driving down from Fiumicino airport, we felt the familiar wonder that
we should be among the few foreigners who knew - had half lived in - the
special corner of Lazio so beloved by Italians.
In nine years we commuted along those 70 miles dozens of times. Passing
Latina, we would watch the terrain changing. From there it distends, as flat
and nearly as green as a snooker table, westwards to the beaches below
Anzio, inland across the Appian Way to collide abruptly with the mountains,
and south to where they drop into the sea at Terracina.
This great plain was for centuries the putrid, mosquito-infested Pontine
marshes. It was drained and invigorated by Mussolini in the 1930s to more
lasting effect than his efforts with the trains.
Soon we would look eagerly for the incongruous eruption that rears on the
horizon, seemingly a rugged island, which in pre-historic times it was.
Nowadays the coast, skewing east, embraces the craggy, 1,700-ft high saddle
of Monte Sirceo, so that one flank is turned to the abundant sun. Falling to
rocks and clear, clean water, this is one of the most beautiful, balmy and
unpolluted shorelines of the Mediterranean.
Scattered white houses peep out of verdant vegetation. Nearly all, including
the one we still presume to call our house, are the second homes of Romans.
The scene never changes, for this is a national park with strict controls.
At one end, the mountain serves to shield the two-tiered town of San Felice
Sirceo. The medieval walled part, astride a hill-top, is officially
sign-posted as Centro Storico; locals never call it anything but the Paese.
It commands the newer, sea-level district of La Cona, with its shopping
centre, promenade, beaches, seafront hotels and man-made port.
At the other end is the stylish hotel and villa complex of Punta Rossa,
draped over the point of that name. We had always assumed it to be above our
station. Now here we were spending Pounds 900 to rent one of several
apartments - virtually a little house - at the foot of the hotel for two
weeks.
Perched a few feet above the sea, it had some pluses over our house. We
could be snorkeling among shoals of small fish in moments. We were used to
trekking down the garden path, amid lemon, orange and apricot trees,
oleanders, hibiscus and masses of bougainvillaea, strolling along a lane and
descending exactly 100 steps to gain a rock perch. At weekends, when
exuberant youths arrived with radios, we were miffed that Italians should
invade our territory.
If the sea was petulant, an alternative was the La Cona beaches, most of
which are kept pristine in season by concessionaires - at a price. We
preferred to drive round the Circeo to the superb sands and dunes that
stretch 15 miles north from abeam of Sabaudia. There development is
restricted to a few beach houses and bars.
At Punta Rossa we had another option - an adjacent sea-water pool, gouged
into a vertical cliff festooned with greenery. We usually had it to
ourselves. And that exemplified the dilemma of such elegant hotels in
southern Italy. With two or three months of hot sun remaining, the ascending
gardens, the guest rooms above, the elevated restaurant with magnificent
views on three sides, were nearly deserted.
For this was the beginning of September, the time called sereno, when
August's excesses of heat and humidity have exploded in spectacular thunder
storms, leaving the sea warm and generally placid. But the tide of visitors,
virtually all Italian, which starts to rise in late July, streams out on the
last Sunday of August. Only for a few more weekends will San Felice bulge.
Ten years ago the cordial San Feliciani readily accepted us into their
community as an Anglo-Saxon minority of two. We are still a bit of a
novelty. For this is no Costa del Sol, or Provence, or even Tuscany. No
expatriate parties here, no golf courses, hardly any private swimming pools.
How smug we were. Occasionally stray fellow-countrymen would appear in
Carletto, La Sona's small supermarket. Inglesi we would hiss from the sides
of our mouths as we dodged behind the pasta shelves.
Along the main street many friends would shake our hands when we returned
from even a brief visit to Surrey. Like Claudio, in the Sant' Andrea
cantina, who fills your five-litre damigiano from a cask for Pounds 3 as you
sample his several varieties of wine. And Pita, always smiling, dispensing
pasta all' uovo, filled and unfilled.
On Friday evenings the street is in turmoil, double-parked Masseratis,
Ferraris and Range Rovers with Roman number-plates disgorging big spenders
in very dark glasses and shoulder-slung jackets.
A place of somewhat grim fascist architecture, Sabaudia is in fact a lively
place with smart shops and several restaurants worth the 15-minute drive
from San Felice. La Pineta, for instance, does wonders with fresh mussels,
clams and scampi.
San Felice has adequate eating places, many combining a pizzeria with the
restaurant. But our favourite outings for Sunday lunch are along the coast.
We always feel euphoric eating seafood in the sunshine at an outside table
on the quayside at Anzio, with a sweeping view of the harbour and fishermen
selling their catches nearby. On the way back, digestion is much assisted by
an espresso or an ice-cream in adjoining Nettuno, a good-looking town with
handsome villas, a big marina and a highly-organised beach.
Our other choice is La Campania on the beach at Terracina. Further on,
Sperlonoa, an attractive combination of hill-top alleyways and golden sands,
makes a good day-out. Indeed, so does Rome - preferably by rail.
From Fossanova, a 25-minute drive inland from San Felice, trains to Rome
take an hour, though it can be worth missing one to visit the 13th century
abbey along the road from the station. A mere 90 minutes from Rome, San
Felice will nevertheless continue to hide from foreigners. This is fine with
us - but what a waste.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: The lost wonder - David Pilling rides a slow train
along the Andes to Macchu Picchu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Yale professor Hiram Bingham stumbled upon Machu Picchu in 1911, he had
confounded his sceptics by overcoming the absence of accurate maps of the
Peruvian highlands, the toughest of terrains and 300 years of jungly growth
that had all but obscured the stone ruins. Worst, he had endured the
scepticism of his fellow academics, who doubted that the so-called Lost City
of the Incas ever existed.
Modern-day tourists have had to confront a different hurdle - terrorism.
Since the founding of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement in the
early 1980s, Peru has been embroiled in a ghastly civil war that has claimed
the lives of at least 26,000 people. For much of the time the Cuzco
highlands, where Machu Picchu is located, have been practically out of
bounds.
Even during lulls in the conflict, Peru's reputation for bombs, bullets and
bandits kept all but the hardiest travellers away. Machu Picchu, lost for
300 years, vanished for another decade.
But things may be changing. Since the capture of Abimael Guzman, the
intellectual founder of Shining Path, there has been a slowdown - though not
a halt - of terrorist activity. And tourists are tentatively returning to
Machu Picchu.
They are being encouraged by the reputation of the Lost City of the Incas,
fed by lyrical descriptions such as the one in the preface of Bingham's
book: 'In the sublimity of its surroundings, the marvel of its site, the
character and the mystery of its construction, the Western Hemisphere holds
nothing comparable.'
If the ancient capital grips the imagination, the modern one, Lima, seems to
leave most visitors under-enthralled. It bears all the scars of economic as
well as terrorist catastrophe. There are slums, diesel-thick air and
swirling garbage. Armoured guards loiter on many street corners, and there
are battered tanks discreetly parked alongside important buildings and
windowless skyscrapers patched up with wooden sheeting in the aftermath of
car-bomb explosions.
Fortunately for those with little inclination to seek out Lima's more
delicate side - colonial architecture, treasure-stuffed museums and
imaginative cuisine - the Peruvian highlands lie just 45 minutes away by
air. It is from the regional capital of Cuzco, former centre of the Inca's
sprawling empire, that modern travellers begin their pilgrimage to Machu
Picchu.
I made the trip recently, catching the tourist train from the central
railway station at 6am and clapping my hands to keep warm in the highland
chill. We set off precisely on time, but progress thereafter was less than
bullet-like.
The steep-sloped terrain obliged the train to zigzag as it dragged itself
from the valley floor, first lurching forwards, then backing up, before
manoeuvering ahead again. The same house or tree or sheep would appear in
the window, slipping behind, before appearing again as we zigzagged ahead.
The crawling pace, though, did afford more time to sponge up the views of
bulging mustard-brown hills, the unfolding plains and the glimpses of
snow-packed mountains.
Although Machu Picchu is at a lower altitude than Cuzco, which lies at 3,310
metres, the impression was that the train was inching higher, breaking into
ever-more remote valleys of sun-seared grass and grazing animals.
The tourist train, three carriages of clicking and clattering Japanese
camera equipment, was said by the authorities to be the safest way to Machu
Picchu. But it was difficult to understand how - bolted into the carriage as
protection against thieves, I felt like a participant in canned target
practice, crawling at enticing speed up the mountainside.
It was perhaps an indication of Peru's catastrophic economic state that
thievery, to which so many people have been driven, was considered a greater
threat than one of the world's most determined guerrilla armies.
After a couple of hours the landscape changed with almost indecent
abruptness. The neatly-ordered scorched yellows turned to luxuriant, rowdy
plant-life as the train was swallowed by jungle.
The change of scenery brought with it a change of mood. Sunny and light
became brooding and mysterious. We went on, edging into the heart of this
strange jungle, before stopping at a little station.
Here, we swapped the rattle of the train for the drone of a bus, which
heaved itself up the plant-entangled mountainside. The train station
disappeared below. Suddenly, unexpectedly, the pilgrimage ended. Just over
there was one of the world's most extraordinary sights: Machu Picchu.
The postcard image was instantly recognisable: a stone city labyrinth with a
ribbed, dinosaur-backed mountain in the background; Inca terraces; ruined
palace walls; even a llama. But Machu Picchu, unlike the pyramids of Egypt
or the Great Wall of China, was not diminished by reality.
What celluloid images fail to capture is the tremendous tumble and jostle of
jungle-infested mountains soaring skywards and plunging valleywards to the
Urubamba river below. What the postcards miss, too, is the highland silence,
the humidity, the drilling heat and the atmosphere of centuries undisturbed.
Most importantly, pictures could not convey the essential beauty of Machu
Picchu: the almost organic harmony with which the stone city appeared to
grow, with the same ease as a bush or a tree, from its mountain saddle. So
perfectly carved were the stones that they seemed to nuzzle together.
The conquistadors never found Machu Picchu, and it is still not known
precisely what it was for. It may have been a fortress, a pilgrimage centre
or home to the 'chosen women' of the Inca. Bingham thought it was the
principal city of the last four Inca rulers who retreated to the
impenetrable hide-away following the arrival of Spanish aggressors.
Whatever, it is now one of the wonders of the world. Peru's president,
Alberto Fujimori, thinks so, too. Aware of the importance of a good press,
he is fond of telling foreign journalists about the growing number of
visitors to the Lost City. For that, says the president, one can thank him
and the success of his war against Shining Path.
Peru, insists the president, is now as safe a destination as London or New
York. There is no need to be frightened, he says. However, readers who are
familiar with those two cities may take only limited comfort from his
assurances.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: Devon - good waves, man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS EALES

<TEXT>
These guys tell me we are driving after high waves. I am the green one here,
the novice lured by the prospect of 'pure pleasure.'
We stop at Welcome Cove and it is a most unwelcome place. There is rain,
grey sky and only a bit of light left in the July evening. Thin lines of
black coral run down the beach and disappear into the sea. Beyond a steep
cliff is a barren landscape of shapely curves.
Legend says that about 100 years ago farmers used to gut their sheep on
those hills to placate the devil. Apparently, they blamed evil spirits for
killing off their flocks. But the guys I am with are not superstitious. They
are waxing their boards in glee - waxing makes the board less slippery - and
telling me we are in luck. They reckon these are fine waves.
Soon, I am up to my chest and out of control in sea a murky shade of green,
holding the surf board tight. A seal pops up and bobs off. Another high wave
crashes over my head, sweeping me closer to those dark claws. What am I
doing here?
There are other places to surf in Devon. Black figures in wet suits hunched
over boards like jackdaws waiting for waves are a common sight along the
fractured north Devon coast at any time of the year. They have been there
since the 1960s, when Australian lifeguards first drifted over with their
boards.
Locals say that some of the best surf in the world is at Croyde Bay, where
waves roll up a sandy slope and bounce off an oyster bed. But there were no
waves to speak of there that day. At the bar in the Thatched Barn Inn it was
decided to go and look for some. Hence the road trip. Pity.
Croyde is a laid back village refreshingly free of gloss. It is part of a
chunk of land between Barnstaple and Ilfracoombe that juts into the sea like
a hooked nose. It is just west of Exmoor national park, and is an
unfashionable but friendly landing place for Atlantic swells and travellers
to south-west England seeking a daring alternative to cream teas.
More than a few visitors to Devon find their way there each year, but most
pass it by. The lure of the theme-parked, congested south is apparently too
much to resist.
In Croyde, a place of contrasts, surfers hang out in narrow high-banked
lanes. White cottages with thatched roofs stand in well-kept gardens. In the
Thatched Barn, an inexpensive menu includes pheasant pie and fresh Lundy
plaice. A stroll away is Croyde Bay and a car park where surfers often camp.
Those black figures you see in wet suits waiting for the next wave are not
all lithe young men. There is a core of committed surfers well into their
50s who dare the waves. I tracked down one of them eating a ham sandwich in
his garage.
'Pure pleasure, that's what I call it,' Alan told me. His garage, where he
crafts foam and polystyrene into surf boards which he sells, is just down
the road from Braunton, an inland village a few miles south of Croyde. A
wizened man, Alan is not quite bald. He is an agile 58-year-old who surfs
whenever there is a wave. Often he is out at 4am.
'Surfing is much more than a sport; it determines how you live,' he said.
'I'm addicted to the rush you get from the energy of the wave. But it's
impossible to describe. You've got to try it.' I was told about a local
barrister: a man who doesn't want to miss chances. In court, he wears a wet
suit beneath his gown.
Other passionate surfers include Surfers Against Sewage, a group leading
calls for a clean-up of British waters. Occasionally, their members surf
wearing gas masks. As well as fish, they reckon, you could catch ear
infections or hepatitis. You might even die.
I suppose it was cavalier of me to try to learn to surf at Welcome. These
were not beginners' conditions. I caught a cold but no waves. At least I got
out alive.
Equipment: wet suits are essential for warmth even in the height of summer.
Beginners should use long boards, which are easier to balance on. Boards and
wet suits can be hired for around Pounds 20 per day. More information from
British Surfing Association, tel: 0736-60250.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: Down at Papa Paul's the joint is jumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A jungle of arc-lit freight yards and chemical storage tanks on the
Mississippi at Baton Rouge; walls of leafless trees rising from the black
water along the causeway in the Atchafalaya Swamp; hunters' pick-up trucks
parked in the mist by the roadside. There is not much to see on a dark
winter's morning on the highway west of New Orleans, writes Nicholas
Woodsworth.
Driving, I wonder why anyone bothers with such refinements as guns and
hounds in Louisiana: there are opossums and racoons, muskrats and skunks,
squirrels and porcupines squashed flat on the roads.
At Eunice, in Prairie Cajun county, a sign - 'Links' - brings me to a halt
at a gas station on the edge of town. 'Seven-course breakfast?' asks the man
behind the till. For people passing through Eunice early on a Saturday
morning, a seven-course breakfast is a link of Cajun boudin sausage and a
six-pack of beer to go.
Where are they going? To Fred's, in Mamou. I am on my way to Fred's, too,
but decide to stick to a single course. Back in the car, the sausage is hot
 -so spiced and fiery that I can feel my breath flaring out of my nostrils.
I run back - blessed relief - for at least part of the remaining menu.
Mamou is small but still I manage to get lost in its broad, flat grid of
shacks and straggling bungalows and end up in front of Bett's Seafood Store.
Eventually, back on Sixth Street, I see the sign I am looking for: 'Fred's
Lounge - Cajun Music Capital of the World - Laissez les Bons Temps Rouler'.
Can you actually translate 'Let the good times roll' in such literal
fashion? In Mamou, on a Saturday morning, you can do almost anything you
like.
All the windows in Fred's are blacked out. Inside, 9am looks to me like 9pm.
It is not just the lack of daylight; it is the cigarette smoke, the blinking
neon beer signs hanging on pink walls, the packed crowds swilling Bud and
vodka-and-7, the jukebox with the sign above saying 'No standing on the
jukebox'. It is the couples locked in a fast-moving two-step that has them
careening around the miniature dance floor like billiard balls. It is Donald
Thibedeau and his band, Cajun Fever, pumping and scraping away in the corner
for all they are worth.
Fred's, as the saying goes, is an institution. Quite what kind of
institution I am not sure, but Fred's has been letting rip early Saturday
morning, week in and week out, for more than 30 years. Fred died not very
long ago but his wife, Tante Sue, hosts an equally exuberant gathering.
Its stated purpose is a live weekend broadcast by KKPI 1050 - the Voice of
Cajun Country, a radio station down the road in Ville Platte. The real
reason, though, is that Cajuns like to get together and laissez les bons
temps rouler. The earlier they start, the further they roll.
A plump man in a moustache and cowboy shirt is standing in front of Don
Thibedeau's microphone and doing a little radio advertising between sets. He
is reading the ads in French.
My French is all right. But 'Charlie's Meat Market' and 'Goodyear Tyres' and
'live bait' and 'Cajun hot sauce' are the only phases I understand. The rest
is a French so twisted by 300 years of emigration that not even the French
understand what is being said.
Tiny Tante Sue - who, with blue-rinsed hair, imitation pearl necklace and
large-framed spectacles, looks like my grandmother - seems no more impressed
than I.
Swigging from a half-pint bottle of bourbon, she nudges the plump man away
from the microphone, calls for Donald Thibedeau, and lets go a great whoop.
As accordion, guitar, violin, steel pedal guitar and drums break into
another rambunctious two-step, she jitterbugs off across the dance floor to
grab a man. My grandmother might sometimes feel like acting that way, but I
do not believe she ever has.
All those packed into Fred's are wearing their finest cowboy boots, their
cleanest baseball caps. It is, after all, the social occasion of the week,
and rice fields, crawfish ponds, tractor repair shops and other workaday
places are left far behind.
I meet James and Anetta, who began dancing here in their teens and are still
dancing here in their middle age. 'This is the same bar I grew up in - place
hasn't changed at all', James tells me. 'Not even the people have changed.'
Watching Tante Sue and others in their 60s, 70s and 80s bopping about and
playing the fool, I realise he is right: these old people are just young
people in disguise. Cajuns have the knack of staying young for life.
I am not sure that I do. The morning wears on and the pace begins to tell.
Two-stepping is tough. By noon, when everyone - including Tante Sue and the
entire staff - piles out of Fred's, only to pile into Casanova's next door
for the afternoon dance, I have had enough. I wander over to Jeff's Diner
for the blue plate special: pork roast and potatoes, rice with gravy, snap
peas, cake with bright pink icing for dessert. My fork is bent, my plate is
plastic, but this is honest food for honest folk.
Afternoon, and I am sitting on a doorstep in the pale winter sun with
70-year-old Pascal Fusilier, drinker, dancer, Cajun folklorist and columnist
for the Mamou Acadian Press. Pascal is telling me about the decline and
revival of Cajun culture. His generation, he says, saw great changes: the
banning of French in schools; the passing of a subsistence economy with the
discovery of oil; the opening up of remote swamp and bayou with the building
of roads. When he was young, Cajun was a dirty word, a near-defunct culture.
What brought it back? He points across Sixth Street to Fred's Lounge.
'Music', he says. 'We may forget how to speak French one day, but we'll
never forget how to sing it.'
Midnight in Mamou, and it is bitterly cold. Fred's is closed and most of
white Mamou fast asleep. Black Mamou, though, is just waking up. Down on the
edge of town, Papa Paul's dance hall is shaking, rattling and rolling as the
wooden-plank floor begins to bounce beneath the rhythmic tread of dancing
Creole feet.
I am a bit nervous as I stand at the bar. I am the only white in the place.
'Kinda rough down there', they told me in Fred's. 'Papa Paul packs a
pistol'. It was not just some Mamou tongue-twister: here is stern-looking
Papa Paul at the cash register, a revolver in a holster at his hip. But
everything turns out fine.
The music is wonderful. Like Cajun music, Zydeco, the music of rural black
Louisiana, is accordion-driven and usually sung in French. But it is music
with soul, with spice, with Caribbean flavour. Indeed, Pooky and the
Heartbreakers make Donald Thibedeau and Cajun Fever sound like hayseeds.
Certainly, Pooky's music is too subtle for me to dance to. I did passably
well at Fred's, but at Papa Paul's I step all over the feet of the young
woman who is kind (and foolish) enough to dance with me.
Two hours of Zydeco and I pack it in. It is exhausting. I lie in bed in the
dilapidated hotel across from Fred's, but cannot sleep. It is freezing.
There is a gas heater in the room, a vast, primitive thing that looks like a
pre-industrial revolution experiment, all monstrous valves and knobs and
stopcocks. It is useless. I cannot turn on the light, the room is too ugly.
The wooden floor is painted grey, the peeling wallpaper brown, the bedspread
the same pink as Fred's walls and Jeff's cake.
And so I lie and, to the rhythm of remembered pieces, tap my toes against
the metal bedstead and think of Mamou, Louisiana. Drive to the right place
and you will find all sorts of things on a dark winter's morning on the
highway west of New Orleans.
Nicholas Woodsworth flew to New Orleans with Continental Airlines.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Travel: Hedonism on Bourbon Street - There is always
something going on in New Orleans, says Christina Lamb. It is a 24-hour city
given to food, music and cosmopolitanism. Away from the bright lights,
Nicholas Woodsworth travels the backroads of southern Louisiana and finds
some fun
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There is something about the air in New Orleans that makes perfectly normal
people yearn to throw off their everyday skins and become artists, writes
Christina Lamb.
Maybe it is the riverport aroma of crawfish and spice; or the Mediterranean
ambience of outdoor cafes and stucco houses with lace-patterned wrought-iron
balconies; or just the way the sky hangs low over the Mississippi as a lone
saxophonist serenades the sunset.
It happened in the guest-house in which I was staying. A 50-something couple
at the next breakfast table pored over guidebooks and maps, the man planning
the day's activities like an army assault.
On the third day the meek-looking wife had swapped her tweed suit for a long
flowing garment stamped with large yellow and red roses. Under a floppy
straw hat adorned with sky-blue feathers, she bore a new and determined
expression - and an interesting brown paper package.
Instead of following Mr Dragoonmaster, she headed for the hotel's small
courtyard with its crumbling fountain and, lighting up a cigarillo, began
painting bold indecipherable strokes on a pristine sketch pad.
The landlady had obviously witnessed such a metamorphosis before. Passing by
with an armful of freshly laundered towels, she nodded encouragingly and
said: 'That's coming together'. Flushed with pride, the formerly
meek-looking wife returned to work with new vigour, making me feel mean that
I had walked past without so much as a glance. After all, what was I doing
but making feeble efforts at romantic poetry in the shade of a crooked
banana tree.
New Orleans was once a mecca for aspiring artists and writers, providing the
setting for Tennessee William's play, A Streetcar Named Desire, and
inspiration for John Audubon's Birds of America paintings. But these days,
most people associate it with two big events - Mardi Gras, the pre-Lent
carnival which rivals Rio's as the world's biggest party, and the Jazz Fest.
Unless one is a lover of crowds, the best time to savour the city's
atmosphere may be outside the two main events. There is always something
going on in New Orleans. As the birthplace of jazz it is a magnet for
musicians. Parades and festivals celebrate everything from tomatoes to
Tennessee Wiliams.
The French Quarter, or Vieux Carre, the original part of the city, is busy.
On my first afternoon there, admiring the Spanish-style iron-work and cool
inviting interior courtyards of Royal Street, I came across Blanchette and
Michelini playing baroque music on multi-stringed lute-like instruments.
Around the corner, in front of the white Disneyland facade of St Louis
Cathedral, on Jackson Square, a melancholy jazz trio was competing for
attention with a group of long-haired blues musicians, one of whom was using
string tied across a large card as a bass. In the park, a gaggle of giggling
black school-children had gathered around a clown. Along the railings,
artists made sketches of tourists for Dollars 5 a time.
As the shadows lengthened, a squat old woman, swathed in turquoise crepe
with a huge beribboned hat, dismounted a spindly old bike and set up shop as
the Star Lady, predicting the imminent arrival of tall dark strangers to
breathless women in short skirts and scarlet lipstick. Nearby, a group of
punks with clashing shades of luminous hair queued at the Lucky Dog, a giant
tin hot-dog on wheels.
New Orleans owes its cosmopolitanism to its history. Founded in 1718, it is
the only US city to have changed flag six times - French, Spanish, French,
American, Confederate and Federal Union. But it was the brainchild of a
Scotsman.
John Law, a crooked financier from Edinburgh who had won his way into the
affections of Philippe d'Orleans, regent for the infant Louis XV, to become
his de facto finance minister, conceived of a scheme to make France rich
through colonising the Louisiane territory. Establishing the settlement of
La Nouvelle Orleans, he sold real estate to Europeans.
But it was not quite the paradise Law described. Instead of fabulous wealth,
colonists found a crude collection of shacks on a swamp, beset by fire,
yellow fever, hostile indians and hurricanes. As the swindle was uncovered,
Law's company went bust, although some tenacious colonists remained, the
city passing into Spanish rule, then back to French, becoming a flourishing
port, before being sold to US president Thomas Jefferson by Napoleon in 1803
for Dollars 15m.
Today the spirit of John Law lives on in the city's hedonistic character.
This is most evident on Bourbon Street - a neon jungle of strip-bars and
tacky T-shirt shops, with music oozing from every crevice.
There is something very special about hearing jazz in the place it was born,
and New Orleans continues to produce great musicians such as the Neville
Brothers, Dr John, Wynton Marsalis and Harry Connick. Just Dollars 3 (and a
wait) can buy an evening of traditional jazz in Preservation Hall where some
aged founding fathers of jazz still play. Further along, at Lafitte's
Blacksmith Shop, you can listen to piano in perhaps the oldest bar in the
state. Dating from 1772, it presents a striking sight with its original
timbers and soft brick, like the creole cottages of the first French
settlers. Blues lovers adore the Old Absinthe House.
The New Orleans tourist authority does little to boast of its musical
heritage, offering only a few glass cases of memorabilia in Louisiana State
Museum, among them Louis Armstrong's first cornet and a pair of Bix
Beiderbecke's cuff-links.
Armstrong Park, named for the city's most famous son, is sadly dilapidated
beyond its illuminated arch. Inside, Congo Square, where last century free
blacks and slaves would congregate to improvise music and dance, is silent
save for the groans of some drunken hobo.
Storyville, a legal red-light district which flourished from 1898 to 1917,
attracting players such as Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver,
who developed what we know as jazz, is not safe to explore  - the city is
sadly crime-racked.
After music, the highlight for many visitors is food. Of both Creole and
Cajun origin, local specialities include catfish, alligator, jambalaya,
gumbo and sweet pralines washed down with Dixie beer.
New Orleans is a 24-hour city, and reward for staying up all night should be
breakfast in Cafe du Monde. From there you can saunter across to the
river-side Moonwalk to watch snub-nosed barges and brightly painted paddle
steamers emerge in the morning mist.
As the sun meets the moon in the sky and the saxophonist plays a final
rendition of Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans before leaping on
the red river-front streetcar, do not be surprised if you feel inclined to
stay to write that long-planned novel, or take up painting.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (14): Nice convertible, pity
about the gearing - Gillian O'Connor test-drives Trustspeak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annuity share: Useful jargon term for one variety of income share in
split-capital trusts. They get a very high income until the trust is wound
up, but then have only a token claim on the capital. They are a good way of
turning capital into income. But note that the income is taxable unless
shielded in a Pep. The problem for the outsider is that share price pages
and research material do not distinguish them from other income shares with
worthwhile claims on the capital. The give-away is normally the very high
running yield. Estimated redemption yields, though fallible, are probably a
fairer yardstick.
Convertible: Convertible loan stocks are one common form of prior charge
capital and work like any other convertible - ie, stockholders have the
option to convert the stock into shares on fixed terms at fixed times (the
conversion terms). They provide a higher income than the underlying shares
but will produce lower capital growth.
Discount: Conventional way of expressing the difference between the stock
market price of an investment trust share and its net asset value (qv), when
the share is below its asset value. For example, if the asset value is 100p
and the share price 90p, the discount is 10 per cent. When the price is
above asset value, it is said to be at a premium.
Gearing: A capital structure in which certain classes of security have prior
but fixed or limited claims on either or both the income and the capital of
the trust. The presence of these securities normally exaggerates the effect
of changes in income or asset value on securities with secondary but
unlimited claims. Thus, if the trust's income is increasing, the existence
of a fixed-interest loan stock will mean that the income attributable to
shareholders rises faster than the underling income. Similarly, if the
trust's assets are increasing in value, the existence of a stock with fixed
capital claims will mean that the assets attributable to shareholders rises
disproportionately. But in bad times gearing means that both income and
assets attributable to shareholders can shrink faster than the decline in
underlying income and assets. Think of negative equity in houses. Nowadays
gearing in many trusts, particularly split-capital ones, is exceedingly
complex, with several layers of gearing. When a security is said to be
'highly geared', it means it will react very sharply to minor changes in the
underlying portfolio. The high risk/reward ratio makes highly geared shares
unsuitable for novices, widow, orphans, or the bulk of anyone's portfolio.
Gross redemption yield: The average annual yield on a gilt-edged stock,
including both the annual dividend payments and the capital gain/loss
implied by the gap between the current price and the price at which the
stock will eventually be repaid. Stockbrokers' analysts have attempted to
apply a similar system to certain types of investment trust share. This is
plausible with securities such as zero-dividend preference shares (qv) which
have a fixed redemption price, provided there is a realistic prospect of
assets sufficing to cover that redemption price when the trust is wound up.
More contentious are attempts to apply the concept to securities with an
uncertain redemption value, by making various assumptions about portfolio
growth.
Hurdle rate (also known as fulcrum): Warning: meaning varies slightly with
the context. The minimum annual rate at which assets must grow before
certain returns can be achieved. For example, a hurdle rate of 2 means that
assets must grow at 2 per cent a year before assets will cover the current
share price of a particular class of shares, or alternatively - when
relevant - the set future redemption value of a particular class of shares.
A hurdle rate of minus-2 means that assets can decline by 2 per cent a year
before capital backing will not suffice to cover the current share price of
a highly geared ordinary share. But in a different context, it would mean
that assets can decline by 2 per cent a year before assets will not suffice
to cover the future redemption price of a zero-dividend preference share
(qv). Note, then, that a hurdle rate is specific to a particular class of
shares, not to the investment trust as a whole.
Net asset value (NAV): What each ordinary share in a conventional trust
would theoretically be entitled to if the trust were wound up today and the
assets distributed to shareholders; normally expressed in pence per share.
NAV total return is a way of measuring the performance of the trust,
assuming income is reinvested.
Ordinary income share: Anything but. Shares with two different
characteristics. They are usually entitled to all the income from the trust,
but have no claim on the capital until at least one other class of capital,
usually ZDPs (qv) has been fully satisfied. As they get near to winding-up
date, they should behave more like a very highly geared capital share.
Portfolio yield: Average annual income that the managers are getting from
the shares in the investment portfolio. Very broadly, the higher the
portfolio yield, the lower the prospects of capital growth in the portfolio,
and vice versa.
Split-capital trusts: Trusts with several different types of security with
differing rights, and aimed to satisfy different investment needs. Some
commentators refer to split-capital trusts which combine zero-dividend
preference shares (qv) with ordinary income shares (qv) as hybrids.
Subscription price: (Sometimes called exercise price): Price at which a
warrant entitles the holder to buy a certain type of share in a trust.
Redemption price: Price at which the holder of a security has the right to
be repaid at the stated redemption date, provided the trust has sufficient
assets. The security will often have a tapered redemption price in case some
unexpected event, such as a bid, occurs.
Warrant: Traded security, usually issued free to buyers of the ordinary
shares at the original issue, often in the ratio of 1:5. It entitles the
holder to subscribe to a certain type of share in the trust at a fixed price
at fixed dates or over a fixed period.
Winding-up date: Many trusts, and all split-capital trusts, have a limited
life, and shareholders are due to be repaid at a specific date. Occasionally
trusts have extended their life, but this is expensive; the cost is borne by
shareholders, and the extension may not be equally in the interest of all
classes of shareholder.
Zero-dividend preference share (ZDPs): Share in a split-capital trust issued
at substantial discount to its eventual redemption value, but not entitled
to any income in the intervening period. Assets of the trust will normally
suffice to cover the ZDPs when the trust is launched. But if the market
falls thereafter, the value of the ZDPs is endangered. The extent to which
assets cover the promised redemption value is a key statistic.

THE HISTORY OF THE GINGER MAN By J P Donleavy Viking, Pounds 17, 517 pages
There are two stories here. The first is of the life, loves and friendships
of J P Donleavy, an Irish American in his 20s, who left the US Navy at the
end of the second world war and used his entitlement of a free education
under the GI Bill to enrol as a law student at Trinity College, Dublin. The
energy released by his new freedom went on a variety of activities in the
Irish capital, of which heavy drinking, fights in bars and the pursuit of
innumerable women were a high - and the academic study of law a low -
priority.
The second, and the more absorbing story is of how his first book The Ginger
Man came to be published by the Olympia Press in Paris in 1955 and of his
subsequent bitter legal battle to extricate it from their 'Travellers'
Library' (a list of pornography) and get it brought out in England by a
reputable publisher where it could be taken seriously. Its rampageous
foul-mouthed hero Sebastian Dangerfield and its brutal candour about sex,
pioneered a new approach in fiction. It was both hilarious farce and
wonderfully evocative of location. Donleavy had been a painter before
becoming a writer.
Story one describes Don- leavy's life as a recently married man whose wife
showed saintly forebearance at his violent antics and frequent absences. His
gregarious love of male company derives from a childhood in the Bronx, where
his Irish immigrant background set him apart from the other children at his
school. His aggressive nature was apparent even then. One of his victim's
mothers intervened during a scrap with another boy pinioning him so that her
son could punch Donleavy with impunity. He was rescued by his own mother who
told the other woman: 'You are going to have to do that for the rest of
(your son's) life'.
In Donleavy's adult life rescue from imminent danger is a recurring theme.
It might take the form of a timely loan from from a friend; or the
fortuitous presence of a bruiser-pal who would keep angry pursuers at bay
while Donleavy made his escape through a side-exit of the pub. More often it
is Donleavy, pugilist as well as literary artist, who has to perform a
rescue for one of his cronies.
He re-creates the drunken chivalries and verbal jousting of a male set whose
fame, unlike his, has not survived post-war Dublin. Apart of course from
Brendan Behan, a firm friend who recognised Donleavy's powers early on, and
whose skill as a mimic, persistence as a lecher and outrageous behaviour as
a guest, are all hilariously noted. But the exploits of such as Gallagher,
McKernan, Craig, and even one Gainor Stephen Crist who was the model for the
Ginger Man are rather less entertaining to read about here than were those
of the fictional counterparts they inspired.
The novel still reads well thanks to its lively prose. Donleavy learned a
lot from the thought processes of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. But
now, approaching 70, the ginger in Donleavy's writing has given way to a
blander flavour; a maturity that has unfortunately been accompanied by the
onset of prolixity. Eventually we move from Ireland to other places where
Donleavy has lived - the Isle of Man, Boston, London, Paris, where, from
time to time, the former fine descriptive touch returns.
It is to Paris that he goes to confront Girodias, publisher of Olympia
Press. Letters exchanged between author and publisher, gastronomic lunches
followed by fraught meetings in the office, then the shock of the early
copies of the book with the company's porn-titles emblazoned on the
fly-leaf, are the opening rounds in a costly legal battle that culminated in
an auction many years later at which the Olympia Press came wholly into
Donleavy's possession. He was now a rich man thanks to the success of the
rescued Ginger Man and of later books.
Page 400 onwards should be read by anyone who is about to sign an agreement
to publish a first novel. That Donleavy won his battle to rescue his book
says much for his courage; it also shows that his training in law was not
wasted time.

WAKE UP BRITAIN]
by Paul Johnson
Weidenfeld and Nicolson Pounds 9.99,200 pages
DAMN YOU, ENGLAND
by John Osborne
Faber and Faber, Pounds 14.99, 264 pages
LORD LONGFORD
by Peter Stanford
Heinemann, Pounds 20, 502 pages
One of the enduring English traits is the capacity to produce eccentrics.
Here are three on parade: Paul Johnson and John Osborne with their oddly
symmetric titles - Wake Up Britain] and Damn You, England (the latter
avoiding the exclamation mark) - alongside an authorised life of Lord
Longford, possibly the most eccentric of the lot.
All of them have changed as time went by: Johnson from left to right,
Osborne from a fairly prolific playwright to someone who may not write for
the theatre again, Longford from right to left (with a conversion to Roman
Catholicism in the middle) and almost back again. In his late years, we
learn, Longford gets on well with another English eccentric, Denis Thatcher.
The pair share a love of rugby and the experience of being the butt of
cartoonists.
Yet one wonders if the changes have been in anything much more than the
labels. Johnson, once the editor of the New Statesman, remains a polemicist.
The new element is nostalgia for an old Britain. When he was at school, he
recalls, the whole dormitory would be woken up in the middle of the night
'to be given the glorious news that yet another old boy had won the VC'. And
when he was at home in Staffordshire, 'an entire street would celebrate when
a boy or girl from it got into a grammar school'.
Something went wrong after the second world war starting, he thinks, with
the end of empire without the consent of the British people. Ever after,
save a brief interlude from Lady Thatcher, it has been down hill. Johnson
claims that Europe might have saved Britain if it had joined at the start.
He sees Jean Monnet as a hero and the 'onlie begetter' of the European
Union, with Churchill alone ready to support him on the British side.
Note that the evidence for Churchill's staunch commitment to Britain in
Europe is not produced and would be hard to find. Note also that there was
nothing to prevent anyone reading the Treaty of Rome when it was first
written and realising its implications. Still, the book is sub-titled a
pamphlet, so perhaps details do not matter. Johnson wants the emergence of a
party 'broadly conservative in its attitudes' campaigning for 'the retention
of essential elements of British sovereignty'. In spite of the exclamation
mark, the fire has gone out.
Osborne has perhaps been misunderstood, partly by his own doing. The words
'Damn you, England' originally came from one short article written as the
Berlin Wall was going up in 1961. There are other harsh words in it, such
as: 'I carry a knife in my heart for every one of you. Macmillan, and you,
Gaitskell, you particularly'.
Yet if you read his prose as a whole there is not all that much spleen even
in the political pieces. In 1974 he wrote in The Observer: 'I shall vote
Labour once more, but with even emptier heart that usual'. He added: 'If I
lived in Ebbw Vale I should vote for Michael Foot, and if I lived in County
Down I should vote for Enoch Powell'. In other words, another English
romantic eccentric hankering after his own kind.
For the rest, Damn You, England is mainly a collection of Osborne's
sensitive and highly intelligent views on theatre. He may not like critics
and sometimes even audiences, but they were not always right about him. Nor
is he especially little English: see his notes on Strindberg and Ibsen. The
public image has sometimes obscured the quality of his work.
Much the same may be said of Lord Longford, notably by way of his attachment
to the convicted moors murderer, Myra Hindley. The reservation about this
authorised biography is that Longford should think himself important enough
to trust his life to a 500 page book by a former editor of the Catholic
Herald, Peter Stanford. Longford cannot be as modest as he looks.
Over time he has had much to be modest about. As Stanford points out, his
ambition was to rise much higher in politics than he did. It is hard now to
recall that he rose as far as minister for civil aviation. He would have
liked, but was never offered, the Home Office.
Perhaps he wanted to be more conventional than he seemed. Certainly, with
the possible exception of the Hindley case, there is nothing particularly
eccentric in what he has said. It is not all that odd for someone with a
decent education to abandon the Conservative Party. Longford did not turn
far left: only to the Labour Party.
Yet the image of eccentricity remains. As one of his daughters comments:
'It's as if he is saying, 'I'll be a maverick, I'll be a rebel, I'll never
tie my shoelaces, but two people I'm always going to support are the Pope
and the President of the United States''. Stanford's claim that he is an
elder statesman of the Labour Party goes a bit far, but it's not a bad life.

<TEXT>
DAISY BATES IN THE DESERT by Julia Blackburn Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 15.99,
232 pages
At the start, it appears that Julia Blackburn has done it again - by which I
mean that she has repeated the feat, and the approach, of her remarkable
previous book, The Emperor's Last Island. But after the first chapters of
Daisy Bates in the Desert, it is evident that this is a development, a
pushing-forward, of a real talent.
The Emperor's Last Island was 'about' St Helena, the author's visit, and the
last days of Napoleon. It was a blend of travel, imagination, biography,
autobiography, whisked together by a beautiful prose stylist to produce -
hard to convey the flavour - a haunting and rhapsodical memoir: booksellers
found it hard to decide in which section to display her wares. It has now
been reissued in paperback (Mandarin, Pounds 5.99) to coincide with Ms
Blackburn's new book, in which, this time, the proportions have changed a
little - this is more 'biography' than 'travel', more imagination than
history.
Daisy Bates was an eccentric old lady of Irish extraction who spent most of
her long life in a tent in the South Australian sands promoting the cause of
the wretched native population. She published The Passing of the Aborigines
(1938 and 1966), received a CBE, died in 1951, and is certainly not an
unknown figure, quite apart from the fact that she was briefly married to
Breaker Morant, the fantasist and adventurer who was court-martialled and
shot in the Anglo-Boer War.
Julia Blackburn in her St Helena book developed the trick of picking on an
autobiographical memory, describing it briefly, and then using it to
pole-vault into her main subject. She does it again (and again) here - 'I
first heard of Daisy Bates about 25 years ago when I was on the edge of my
adult life: back straight, waist narrow, jaws always aching because I
clenched my teeth in fear or perhaps in rage. I had established a curious
relationship with a woman called Edith Young . . . She had learnt about
Daisy Bates, the only interesting person with a white skin who had ever
lived in the entire (Australian) continent as far as she was concerned . .
.'You must write a book about her,' she said . . .'
Soon the author is creeping up on her unlikely target: 'I'll give her a
dream from her childhood which is a dream that I used to have when I was a
child . . .'. And then, after intense empathy and research, the break-out
from the St Helena mode as Blackburn discovers she feels able to become her
subject: 'I am Daisy Bates in the desert, stretched out on the floor of my
tent, surrounded by the intense heart and dryness that has not let go for
months, or is it years . . .'
There follow 120 pages which purport, successfully, to describe Daisy Bates'
own story of her years in the desert - acceptance by the Aborigines, the
years in Ooldea astride the main railway line, with all its corrupting
impact on the locals, the onset of frailty and age, the angry retreat. And
then Ms Blackburn returns, intrudes, inserts herself back into the story,
for the last years.
This is a fascinating exercise. Part of the quest is the unravelling of a
mystery, because Daisy Bates was a liar who told whopping stories about her
grand Anglo-Irish Protestant background (she was a Catholic orphan), her
meeting with Queen Victoria (she travelled Down Under as a penniless free
migrant, soon to be a bigamist), and so on.
As the author observes, 'Some of what she says is true but a great deal of
it is not and it is such an odd process trying to separate the person who
she was from the person she would have liked to be, pulling the two apart
and untangling their embrace.'
But Julia Blackburn is concerned for a mythical rather than a literal truth
about Daisy Bates. There will be comparisons with Bruce Chatwin's Songlines,
but I do not think that means much. I suggest to booksellers that Daisy
Bates in the Desert should be stocked, in substantial numbers, either under
'Biography', or 'Travel', or, best of all, under 'Fiction'.

MOVING BEYOND WORDS
Glory Steinem
Bloomsbury, Pounds 9.99, 296 pages
The cover of this book says it all. Here, at 60, is Gloria Steinem: long
blonde hair, drainpipe pants, high black boots, exquisitely manicured
fingernails. She is the acceptable face of American feminism: radical but
feminine, prosperous - the picture of a healthy, pampered confident young
girl.
And that is the problem. For between the covers, Steinem writes like an
adolescent. Moving Beyond Words is a collection of essays: some revamped
versions of the smart journalism with which she made her name, such as 'Sex,
Lies and Advertising'; others new, long pieces on Freud, on a feminist
economics, on being 60. It is these, published to celebrate 30 years of
feminist wisdom, which reveal Steinem's limitations as writer and thinker.
They are embarrassing, tedious, shallow and, in their pretence to
scholarship, deeply fraudulent.
The essay 'What if Freud were Phyllis?' is the core of the book. At 90 pages
it introduces the volume and Steinem, subtitling it 'The Watergate of the
Western World', compares it both to Swift's A Modest Proposal and Nabokov's
Pale Fire. In fact, it is a trite pastiche of Freud's life, constructed as a
mock biography of Phyllis, a matriarchal psychoanalyst who discovered male
womb envy and female breast castration anxiety.
Steinem tells this deadpan but, every few sentences, she tries, like a
precocious student, to catch out teacher Freud. He was beastly to his wife,
'too bad Martha didn't write a book'. He had an affair with his
sister-in-law - or even worse, he did not: 'If he'd had a satisfying sex
life with anybody, he wouldn't have been so bananas.' And his theories were
a male conspiracy which 'keeps society and the psyche in its proper order'.
Years ago, Steinem got laughs out of role reversals. Her fantasy of men
menstruating when women could not, for example, - 'men would brag about how
long and how much . . .street guys would invent slang (he's a three-pad
man)' - was funny, warm, provocative.
By contrast, this pastiche is crass. We know Freud was a chauvinist who made
serious errors about female sexuality; Steinem merely trivialises feminism's
long quarrel with psychoanalysis. And in her schoolgirl cockiness, she
ignores the key point - that Freud was an intellectual revolutionary whose
effect on modern consciousness can never be reversed, in spite of grave
individual flaws in his argument.
Like many feminists, Steinem's vision of truth is ideologically determined.
She interprets basic human experiences through the prism of a gender war. In
'Doing 60' she complains that the (male) state is removing older women's
right to bear children: 'France has just passed a law against medically
assisted procreation for post-menopausal women . . . It makes you understand
why women lie 'about their age'.'
The undertone of the Freud piece is that women would have better sex if
Freud had not got us wrong.
Through them all run the cliches - 'testosterone-fuelled corporations',
'women are primordial underdogs' - which reflect the strong hold of
political correctness on our responses to Steinem's world view. To demur,
says Steinem's tone, is to rule yourself out as a moral player.
For so many of the issues Steinem discusses - ageing, sexual neuroses,
having and rearing children or not having them - are problems which are not
entirely or even largely caused by politics.
A return to flower power - 'I hope to live to the year 2030, and see what
this country will be like when one in four women is over 65 . . . perhaps we
will be perennial flowers who repot ourselves and bloom many times' - is not
the answer.
The psyche was never an easy or simple thing. Steinem's utopianism denies
the tragedy and awe, the chaos and venality, that are a rich part of life
and whose absence leaves her book soulless and banal.

Surrender: young members of the Wehrmacht - from D-Day: The Climactic Battle
of World War II by Stephen E Ambrose (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 20)
It was with foreboding that I tackled this clutch of books about D-Day and
the Normandy landings. There was little reason to suppose that the familiar
story would be improved by the hoop-la of the 50th anniversary.
And yet, the D-Day landings were an amazing event. It was the biggest
sea-borne invasion in history, the product of an extraordinary combination
of intelligence, deception, secrecy, inventiveness, planning, engineering,
logistics, discipline and bravery.
None of this would have been able to overcome the fearful odds, if the
operation had not been over-arched by an astonishing depth and intensity of
international co-operation and military integration between the allies,
which laid the foundations for Europe's security throughout the next 50
years.
If you want to know the essential story, I cannot imagine a better place to
begin than the Penguin Atlas of D-Day (Viking / Penguin, 143 pages, Pounds
17 in hardback, Pounds 10 in paperback). This is a superbly produced little
book, with excellent maps in colour, which illuminate every aspect of the
operation from the planning to the armada, from the landings to the
bridgehead, right through to the end of the Normandy campaign 10 weeks
later. If you are a military history buff, and want to trace the movements
of an individual division, the index gives a reference to relevant maps and
text.
The text is the real bonus. I had expected the words to be no more than a
make-shift skeleton of facts, filling in the spaces between the maps. In
fact, it is a sizzling narrative, told with verve and drama by John Man; and
he skilfully intersperses the detailed account of events on the battlefield
with glimpses of the larger picture and stimulating judgments which avoid
any taint of patriotic prejudice.
David Evans' Guide to the Beaches and Battlefields of Normandy (Michael
Joseph, Pounds 14.99, 186 pages) is a more pedestrian affair. It is
obviously intended as a utilitarian handbook for military tourists or
relatives of men who fought in Normandy. There is a short historical
section, but the book is mainly devoted to an alphabetical gazetteer of
villages and towns in Normandy, with brief thumb-nail sketches of their
associations with the campaign, and their war memorials and museums.
Unfortunately, the maps and diagrams, in black and white, are rather crude.
If it is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, then a book of
photographs of the invasion ought to give the vividest possible impression
of a great and dramatic event. The curious thing about D-Day: the Invasion
in Photographs (edited by Tony Hall, Salamander, Pounds 4.99, 64 pages,
paperback) is that the overall impression is rather confused and unfocussed.
Perhaps this is because this book does not include the best selection of the
available photographs. Or perhaps it is unavoidable that the dominant
impression through the lens is the fog of battle; it is only afterwards that
the researcher can reconstruct the drama and its meaning - which must be
conveyed in words.
Russell Miller's Nothing Less Than Victory (Penguin, Pounds 7.99, 496 pages,
paperback), is in its way a verbal equivalent of the book of photographs,
because this is an oral history of the invasion, told afterwards by men
(from both sides) who were there. Some of the extracts are drawn from books
or other published sources. But most of them are from interviews conducted
by the author, and cumulatively they give a powerful impression of what it
was like to be alive in 1944, to be young, and to be at war.
D-Day 1944 (by Robin Neillands and Roderick de Normann, Orion, Pounds 5.99,
320 pages, paperback) is another attempt to tell the story of the invasion
in the words of men who were there. But where Russell Miller leaves the
extracts to speak for themselves, Neillands and de Normann have woven their
first-hand sources into a seamless story. This is warfare at ground level,
and a vivid and frightening experience for all these terribly young men.
Someone took a lot of trouble to liven up the page layouts in D-Day: the
Normandy Landings and the Liberation of Europe (Anthony Kemp, Thames and
Hudson, Pounds 6.95, 194 pages, paperback). Unfortunately, the effect is so
busy, with different type-sizes and different types of illustration
inter-twining with the text on every page, that the result is difficult to
read. Anthony Kemp has produced a straightforward narrative, but the visual
confusion does not help, even if many of the illustrations are striking.
The attraction of a first-hand account of war, such as Geoffrey Picot's
Accidental Warrior (Penguin, Pounds 6.99, 318 pages paperback) or Alastair
Borthwick's Battalion (Baton Wicks, Pounds 16.99, 270 pages) is that it can
give a powerful impression of what it was like to be there; the drawback is
that personal knowledge is almost invariably confined to a small perimeter:
the individual soldier knows little of the battle, and almost nothing of the
campaign.
Geoffrey Picot, a 19-year-old infantry officer in Normandy, makes this
explicit. 'Those who get their picture of a battle from films where
seemingly hundreds of rival soldiers are packed into a few hundred square
yards may have difficulty imagining a real battlefield. You and a couple of
pals can be hundreds of yards from anybody else; you may not have much idea
where friend or foe are. You fire from a concealed position to a hidden
target. And how on earth do you find out what is going on?'
Accidental Warrior has been praised by soldiers. I found it a bit too
stiff-upper-lip; as Russell Miller found when he was interviewing for his
oral history, the English were less ready to admit to any real feelings than
the Americans.
Borthwick, however, has a turn for engaging humour. 'Egg-hunting was the
only sport possible in St Honorine, and it was pursued so diligently by the
garrison that some claimed eggs were snatched before they even touched the
straw. All the hens certainly had a harassed look . . . You had to follow
the hen into the hen-house and sit staring it out of countenance until it
had laid, because if you took your eyes off it for a second someone came in
and robbed you.' Battalion was published in 1946, under the title Sans Peur;
it deserves its re-issue.
Decision in Normandy, by the American military historian Carlo d'Este
(Harper Collins, Pounds 10.99, 558 pages, paperback) is another welcome
reissue. First published in 1983, it is detailed, comprehensive, deeply
researched, penetrating, and well written; it has become and will doubtless
long remain one of the classic accounts of the Normandy campaign.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (13): High income may be an
illusion - Robin Angus asks why anyone should prefer to pay tax at their top
rate on low-quality income returns, rather than cash in high-quality capital
returns and pay no tax on them at all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ANGUS

<TEXT>
I had a very upsetting experience a few months ago. At the annual general
meeting of a blue-chip general investment trust, which had risen in price by
well over 30 per cent during the previous year, I met an intelligent-looking
private shareholder.
'You must be very happy with your portfolio,' I remarked.
He made a woeful face and shook his head. 'I haven't worked out my total
income for the year yet,' he said sadly. 'But I'm pretty sure it'll be
down.' And he went on to suggest that he would shortly be switching out of
his lower-yielding general trusts into high-yielding specialist trusts, or
into the income shares of split-capital trusts.
In my view, that man needed to consult not an independent financial adviser
(IFA) but a psychiatrist. He was a prisoner of the absurd fixation that,
however large and soundly-based his capital profits might be, the only thing
he could possibly live off was his income. As a result, he probably sold a
high-quality investment and bought one offering him a higher yield but a
much lower total return. And that was what I found so upsetting.
The quest for high income has dominated the retail investment world
recently. Sometimes it has seemed that you could bundle up any old rubbish,
stick a fancy yield on it and sell it in limitless quantities. And people
have panicked into such investments, because they are no longer getting the
9 or 10 per cent interest rates they have become used to over the past 10 or
20 years.
But where do they suppose these so-called 'high interest rates' actually
came from? The charitable impulses of the banks and building societies? What
a hope. Interest rates were high because inflation was high. So, unknown to
themselves, people were living off their own capital, which was being handed
back to them as 'interest'. And yet such people often tell you that to live
off capital is the one thing you should never do.
It baffles me that people apparently prefer paying tax at their top rate on
low-quality income returns to cashing in high-quality capital returns and
paying no tax on them at all.
If I needed a high income from my savings, I wouldn't even look at a 'high
yield' investment. I would either go to the monthly income plan offered by
Ivory &amp; Sime ISIS (unique in the investment trust sector so far, although
some unit trust groups have followed suit), or I would buy shares in good,
sound diversified trusts which were likely to appreciate substantially in
value over the years while still paying a reasonably dividend. Then I would
sell a small percentage of my shares annually, in order to exploit the
greatest tax-break of all - the fact that realised capital gains are
tax-free to a level of Pounds 5,800 per annum to all taxpayers (Pounds
11,600 to a married couple).
I also find it baffling that some people seem prepared to commit large
chunks of their savings to highly specialised investment trusts.
Emerging-markets trusts, for instance, are intended essentially for
institutions that need to invest in these markets but lack the expertise to
do it for themselves. Private investors can certainly join the party. But
they should do so only with the 5 or 10 per cent of their total net worth
they set aside for their 'fun' investments.
And if I stagged new issues in the trust market, I would do so only with my
5 or 10 per cent of fun-money, too. I should hate my main portfolio to be
treated as a sort of cut-and-come-again cake, off which stockbrokers or IFAs
were constantly slicing commissions.
Dreary though I may sound, I treat my main portfolio more like bread dough.
I add the yeast, in the form of proven, dependable blue-chip trust shares,
and then I leave it to rise peacefully by itself.
But enough of all these 'don'ts'. I am excited and encouraged by much that
is happening in the trust sector at the moment. In particular, since all my
own investing is done through trust Peps and savings schemes, I am pleased
to see increasing numbers of people recognising their merits. My biggest
hope for the future, however, is the way in which the industry is starting
to respond to what are called 'lifestyle needs'.
Life is a series of liabilities. We have to buy houses, educate our
children, provide for ill-health, plan for our old age, and provide also for
our dependants when we die. And in all these areas, the state will tend to
help us less and less. So in order to meet the liabilities in our personal
balance sheet, we have to match them with assets accumulated for the
purpose. And this is where trusts have a major opportunity.
Lifestyle needs usually cannot be met by straightforward purchases of
investment trust shares, whether as Peps or through savings schemes. A
direct holding of Foreign &amp; Colonial shares, for instance, would not satisfy
the Inland Revenue as a personal pension scheme. But the new Foreign &amp;
Colonial Pension does. So I warmly welcome it as a way of enlarging the
sector's customer base, along with similar planned initiatives from other
investment trust management groups like Flemings, Kleinwort Benson and Ivory
&amp; Sime.
When investment trusts started life in the 1870s, people bought shares as
their main form of provision for the future. Today, instead, they buy
savings products designed to do specific things, like provide pensions or
pay off mortgages. Investment trusts were slow to realise this, but are now
making up for lost time. And it is through meeting these lifestyle needs
that investment trusts will survive and grow into the next century.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Outdoors: The desperate jet set - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON and LUCY DICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began in the US, and last month skied in
France, Austria, India, Japan and the and north America. Now in Austria,
they will soon be on the way to South America . . .
The enormous globe of the moon hung over the top of Lift 23 at Mammoth
Mountain in California's High Sierras. Simultaneously, the rays of the
rising sun suddenly cleared the top of Broadway. It was 5.27am and the start
of a tense day for the FT's Round-The-World Ski Expedition.
Before the rush hour started, Lucy and I would be the only passengers
cruising over the snow-capped peaks in an executive jet heading for an
already hazy Los Angeles and from there to Europe and the Alps. Two
logistical conundrums had jeopardised our plans to travel from California to
an Austrian glacier in our attempt to ski every day of 1994.
We had relied on the normal morning flight to travel the 300 miles from
Mammoth - one of less than a handful of north American ski resorts where
lifts were still operating at this time of year - to Los Angeles. What we
had failed to bargain for was that during late May this flight was out of
service. We seemed to be marooned in the middle of the Sierra wilderness.
The nature of our second crisis only dawned on the day before we were to
leave for Europe to mark time in the glaciers until the first snows in the
Andes: even if we managed to find a way of leaving Mammoth, our overnight
flight to Frankfurt, which arrived around noon, was going to leave us too
far from our intended destination at Hintertux in Austria to be able to ski
that day.
Our first problem was solved in spectacular style when Randy McCoy, son of
Mammoth's owner, Dave McCoy, agreed to fly us to Los Angeles in the resort's
new Dollars 3m Citation jet. He found room not only for all our skis, but
also our bag of dirty laundry.
After McCoy had come to the rescue in his glistening new jet to fly us out
of Mammoth, American Airlines, who have already flown us once round the
world, agreed to fly us first class to Munich, where we would arrive two
hours earlier than Frankfurt and be nearer the mountains.
The odds against our skiing in California and Austria on consecutive days
had suddenly shortened. And thus it was that we found ourselves being
ferried by Steve Brown's Snowcat to the top of Lift 1 at dawn, long before
Mammoth's lifts opened, to ski Broadway just the once. It was a rude but
spectacular awakening to the day. We then jetted to LA to try to stay on
course for our 146th day's skiing.
We had spent a jet-lagged but idyllic week at Mammoth, combining some much
needed rest with some equally important ski mileage. Even with only four of
its normal winter quota of 30 lifts open, Mammoth still has a formidable
amount of skiing available in spring.
Trying to find large - preferably interconnected - snow patches to ski on
when it is not winter anywhere in the world is not easy, as our poor ski
record this month confirms. We had become expert at finding such snow in
India, and - as one local put it: 'Here in Mammoth we have some pretty big
snow patches]'
With more than a dozen trails open, Mammoth was bliss after our hunt for
snow in Asia. And, even though most lifts were closed, you could still hike
into tougher runs such as Wipe Out and Dave's Run.
In May, the resort's lifts close at 2pm. Skiers can spend the afternoon
marvelling at local attractions such as the monoliths and waterfalls of
Yosemite, and perhaps America's best-preserved and most poignant ghost town,
Bodie, 'a mining town frozen in time'. We were even able to play nine holes
of golf.
Around 24 hours after leaving Mammoth, Lucy and I were revelling in fresh
powder on the Stubai, an Austrian glacier at Neustift. It seems an age since
were last in Europe, but it is a mere 23 days and 26,820 miles. After our
hectic and car-less schedule in India and Japan, it is a relief to be mobile
again.
Trying to ski either side of an inter-continental flight is always tricky.
What should have been a straightforward run from the top of Argentiere's
Grands Montets before we left for Geneva and our flight to Delhi at the
beginning of May became tense when high winds sprung up suddenly, almost
trapping us helplessly on top of the mountain only hours before our
aircraft's departure.
We had been warned that it was raining at the top of the cable-car but,
unexpectedly, we encountered savage conditions. By the time we reached the
summit, 60 mile-an-hour winds plus thick fog had made the long black run
back to the mid-station at La Croix de Lognan - more than 4,000 ft of
extremely exposed and mogulled terrain - a frightening prospect to ski in a
hurry or even to ski at all. Feeling just a little like Captain Oates, I
clambered down the metal staircase to the slopes way below, but I knew in my
heart that the descent on skis was too dangerous.
There was now a real risk that the cable car would stop running and leave us
stranded until the wind dropped. But the gusts were just within operational
limits. We chose a more benign run for our one descent before leaving, but
it was a close thing.
Now we are back in Europe, the next few days in Austria and Switzerland are
going to be very precious. They will represent the only real taste of summer
we will have in 1994. In mid-June we shall be plunged back into winter when
we arrive in Santiago in an attempt to ski every single resort in Chile and
Argentina. But here in Austria, it is snowing again. Perhaps there will be
some winter sunshine in south America.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Outdoors: Potting the way to a summer of profusion -
Gardening / With retailers rushing to multiply their prices, Robin Lane Fox
intends to be selective about the plants he buys to fill his containers.
Sweet peas are at the top of his list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
This weekend, we can all play at decorating without being real gardeners:
bedding might be out but potting is in. I have seen the signs all over
England. Dog-tired wholesalers are heaving plants by the thousand from
Hereford and Leicester; retailers are multiplying their prices up to five
times and putting them out on the pavement; impatient gardeners have made
off already with too much impatiens; and Lizzie has been ever so Busy.
On Wednesday, I found the most over-priced pot in London. It was not being
passed around a bond dealer's birthday: at Pounds 360, it was standing on
the pavement in Knightsbridge, a clay container with two mini-roses in
flower, a wisp of silver leaves, and a scattering of white pansies. For
Pounds 20, you could have run up your own superior version.
Potting is in because we have all learned to do it better. Gone are the days
of a few petunias and a zonal geranium: potters pack in a jungle (and, if
they have read the FT, they reduce the days of watering by adding
water-retention crystals to the soil). They prolong the flowering season by
feeding with Phostrogen once a week. And they aim at a profusion which
leaves the new Royal Horticultural Society encyclopaedia looking out of date
already.
Undoubtedly, the best pots are terracotta, and none is better than the
terracotta cast thickly in Britain by Whichford Potteries near Stratford,
Warwickshire, which leads the exhibitors at each year's Chelsea show. I fear
I am not rich enough to acquire enough of them, though. If each pot costs up
to Pounds 80, how can I line my terrace and work towards the illusion that a
warm Riviera without tourists stretches beyond the tree line?
Wanting width, I have come to rest at Sainsbury's Homebase. For Pounds 13,
they will sell you a 19in pot of clay, not terracotta (and would have given
you 10 per cent off last week when you most wanted to buy it).
These pots are plain, durable, and are much better than anything with little
patterns or a plastic appearance. I use them for my yearly mainstays: the
standard fuchsias, large salvias and felted grey helichrysum. Since these
plants are taken indoors each October, there is no point in going to the
extra expense of frost-proof terracotta when the plants themselves will die
with a touch of frost.
Instead, I am prepared to spend on plants. Mind you, it is not easy to
splash out on the wholesalers' routine offerings. Far too much is being
forced on us in mixed colours, which include beastly mauve and strong pink.
Wherever there is a 'compact' form, the tall form is being discontinued.
Scented, tall, white tobacco plants are now a collector's item at garden
centres because of the monotonous Domino mixture which can be trusted to
behave on a municipal roundabout.
From the mass market, I have found nothing tolerable except white pansies,
which are over-priced and trailing dark blue lobelia Sapphire. Vita
Sackville-West used to insist that lobelia could look marvellous when massed
in semi-shade in a dark-flowered form. I agree; but she might not agree with
my fancy for finely-cut pyrethrum Silver Feather, or the blinding white
flowers of lavatera Mont Blanc which are prone to provoke shock.
Sensitive souls, meanwhile, head for half-hardy perennials. Most of them are
a dream for part-time nurseries which have been started up on open days by
one or other partner in the backyard: they root like weeds from cuttings,
but we can all be nudged into paying Pounds 2.50 for our own individual
piece.
My ideal jungle would combine scented heliotrope; the finely-cut silver
leaves of a senecio under its old name of leuchostachy; several angel
pelargoniums; and a plant or two of the best verbena, the pale pink Silver
Ann.
The heliotropes may well trap the unwary. Ordinary stores sell boxes of dark
purple forms with large flowers, often named Marine. These plants are annual
varieties which have almost no scent and die totally in the autumn.
The ones you want are the perennials, which cost at least Pounds 2 each and
grow madly from what may seem a small fragment this weekend. Their smaller
flowers smell exquisitely of sweet powder. Chats worth is a handsome
mid-blue and Princess Marina should not be muddled with the pointless
Marine.
The sweetest of all is White Queen and, although these flower best in their
first year, they can be rooted so easily from cuttings that one plant soon
turns into 50.
Pelargoniums are another trap. This weekend, the blotched and spotted Regal
forms look very tempting (unless their flowers have too much pale mauve).
They will flower briefly until July and will usually hold fire until a thin,
second showing in autumn.
By feeding heavily every week, I did force the old blotched form called
Royal Ascot to flower beyond its form book but, this year, I am compromising
with the small-flowered Angel varieties. They, too, have pretty, dark
markings on pale petals, but they last much longer and can be tucked easily
into the heavy planting of modern plotting.
For connoisseurs, I recommend softer varieties: the violet-blue alyogynes
and pale forms of the evergreen orange mimulus which are just appearing in
the UK from California. The best way to find these varieties is to take a
day trip to a specialist: Hopleys of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, and Brian
Hiley of Wallington, Surrey, are two Chelsea medallists near to London's
north and south ring roads.
Remember that you will be able to multiply your first plants from their
stock and keep them going in ever greater quantities by yearly cuttings.
They are a far better buy than yet more strips of annuals which will be dead
by November.
Lastly, what about some sweet peas? Here, too, we have been fobbed off too
often with low-growing varieties and names like Snoopee. But at the Malvern
show a month ago, one top grower was showing 19in pots with four plants each
of his noted tall varieties, grown up 5ft bamboo canes and flowering
magnificently.
Start yours up canes of around the same height, feed them regularly with a
strong tomato fertiliser and, when they reach the top, take them down to the
bottom of the cane, wind them round and let them climb all over again. They
will flower excellently and may even be better without the hottest sun or
the reflection from a supporting wall.
If you like potting and hate long Latin names or journeys down the motorway,
opt for sweet peas in the knowledge that there is nothing better this side
of paradise.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Outdoors: Here is the weather flowercast . . . - Gardening /
How ordinary garden blooms may be an indicator of climatic changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN ALDRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of the British climate is written in the nation's flower beds,
according to Fred Last, honorary professor of forestry and natural resources
at Edinburgh University. He believes the UK's parks and back gardens could
be used as early indicators of such climate changes as global warming.
Botany and meteorology have come together in Last's own garden in East
Lothian. It was pressed into service as a weather station in 1977 when he
decided to explore the impact of the previous year's drought on plants and
realised there was no bench mark for his observations.
Records of the flowering dates of plants all over Britain had been kept
between 1891 and 1945, but no one had analysed the data to see if it had a
story to tell about climate. So Last decided to use his garden to build a
definitive picture of how plants respond to their environment over time.
Since 1977, he has recorded the flowering date of every species in the
garden. At present, there are 450, of which 250 have been there since the
start.
The records show that some species - such as honesty, lilac and apple -
bloom on the same day every year. Indeed, the archives at Covent Garden (the
London fruit and vegetable market) show that home-grown apples have been
reaching the market on virtually the same date for more than a century. But
the flowering dates of many other species - such as grape hyacinths,
rhododendrons and roses - appear to be dictated by temperatures in the
months before blooming.
Using average flowering dates for the period from 1978 to 1988, Last has
been able to show that warm years such as 1988 and 1989 were registered by
changes in flowering dates. 'Maximum and minimum temperatures were both four
degrees higher than average in January and February 1989, and this resulted
in a total change in flowering patterns in the garden,' he says. 'By March,
there were three times more plants in bloom than normal, and the flowering
of sensitive species such as poached egg plant and rhododendron were
advanced by several weeks.'
These species flowered early in 1990, too. But the trend was not sustained
and 1991 saw the return of average flowering patterns. This season has seen
few highlights so far - at least in East Lothian.
While November and December were unusually cool, temperatures were normal
thereafter and the number of flowers in bloom from January to March
reflected this, being close to the long-term average. People thought it was
a cold winter, but the message from the flower beds is that while it was
long, it was not exceptionally hard.
Put simply, most sensitive species respond to air and soil temperatures a
month or so before flowering. Some also are moisture-sensitive, while roses
seem to respond to cumulative effects - two warm years such as 1988 and 1989
saw them flowering even earlier in 1990.
Plants which are not climate-sensitive are said to be photoperiodic - their
flowering triggered only by the length of the day. The underlying reasons
for these differing responses remain unknown but Last hopes his garden-based
studies might trigger more research into the basic biology of flowering.
These trends have obvious implications for garden design. A year-round show
could be guaranteed by mixing plants which unfold their flowers in an
orderly progression as the days lengthen, with those which are
climate-responsive; this would add interest and variability.
Bulbs, for instance, could include temperature-responsive snowflakes and
fritillaries alongside the yellow and white tulipa tarda, which is
photo-periodic. For the rock garden, saxifrage will bloom early or late
against a constant background of yellow alyssum. Photo-periodic shrubs
include the pink and white-flowered escallonia, while the buddleia (known as
the orange ball tree) is a climate responder.
As far as climate goes, it is still too soon to say if the trends of the
past few years amount to global warming. 'People thought that the warmth of
1988 and 1989 was bound to have a residual effect,' says Last.
'The fact that we were back to normal by 1991 suggests that those years may
have been part of a short-term trend. But with many more years of
monitoring, we will certainly pick up the longer term climate trends.'
Last would like to see climate change gardens used in a serious scientific
context - in schools, or attached to meteorological stations. At present, he
is designing a climate change garden for the Centre for Deep Sea
Oceanography, in Southampton.
The scientists there are looking at how the oceans act as a 'sink' for
carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by anthropogenic emissions such
as power stations and car exhaust fumes. 'It's particularly appropriate to
have a climate change garden at a site where they're studying the effect of
climate on the ocean,' Last says.
Violet willow, witch hazel and lily of the valley are among the
photo-periodic responders which will provide constant and predictable
year-round colour for the scientists. Mexican orange blossom, blue-eyed
Mary, and Solomon's seal will work alongside them as early indicators of
climate change - as could many of the plants in gardens up and down the
country.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (12): Study reports and ask
three questions - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson says he has made respectable
profits from investment trusts, though one produced a dramatic loss, which
has shaped the way he now assesses a trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON

<TEXT>
As a private investor, my approach to investment trusts is to look for
'added value': what can a trust offer me that I could not otherwise obtain
as a result of my own investment endeavours?
The obvious answer is: an interest in a wide spread of investments. But
there are now so many trusts, with such wide variations in their
performance, that selecting the right one can be as difficult as choosing
the right share in a trading company.
However, there are three factors to which I pay particular attention:
Are the investment trust's shares standing at a discount to net asset value?
If so, then it offers an opportunity to acquire an interest in a share
portfolio at less cost than buying those shares directly.
Does the trust invest in areas where it would otherwise be difficult for me
as an individual to invest? For example, in unquoted or very small companies
in the UK and elsewhere; or in companies overseas, where the complexities of
dealing make it difficult for a foreigner to acquire shares easily and keep
track of their progress.
Are the managers of the investment trust likely to out-perform others in the
same sector?
Over the years, I have made respectable profits from investing in a variety
of investment trusts. However, one trust investment produced a dramatic
loss, and it was this experience that shaped the way I assess individual
trusts.
In March 1991, I bought, for my personal pension scheme, 1,500 shares in
Gresham House investment trust for 300p each. At that time, according to
County NatWest Wood Mackenzie figures published in the FT's share price
pages, the trust's net asset value was estimated at 751p per share.
How could I go wrong with shares in a trust standing at more than 60 per
cent discount to net asset value?
Unfortunately, the share price drifted downwards until July 1, 1991, when
the price plunged from 225p to 75p in reaction to the company's announcement
that it had suffered an 82 per cent fall in net assets and would not be
paying a final dividend. The shares subsequently fell still further, and at
one time were less than 1p each, although they are now around 19p.
Why had the company suffered such a collapse in the value of its assets?
Because a number of the unquoted companies in which it had invested went
into receivership, and there was also a downturn in the value of the
company's property portfolio.
This experience taught me to view with great caution the figures given in
newspapers for trusts' net asset values - especially if the trusts invest in
unquoted companies. I now always obtain a copy of a trust's annual report -
and a copy of an earlier report - before I invest.
Comparing the latest report with one for the previous year can often be
instructive, especially with regard to assessing the trust on the basis of
the three criteria mentioned earlier.
For example, looking at the lists of the trust's major investments may show
marked differences between the two reports. Some investments listed in the
earlier report may not appear in the latest one, or be shown to have a much
reduced market value.
I examine the possible reasons for this: has the trust cut its losses on
poorly-performing investments, or have the companies concerned been forced
into receivership? If a number of unquoted companies are shown with reduced
market values, does this mean that they may have fallen even further since
the publication of the report, so that the trust's own shares may not be
standing at a discount to net asset value but at a premium?
Has the company (perhaps in the earlier report) listed holdings in quoted
companies which have since got into difficulties - such as Queens Moat,
Rosehaugh, Geevor, West Industries, Video Store and Doctus?
Gresham House had reported an investment in Polly Peck, which ought to have
acted as a warning sign to me, although every trust should be allowed at
least one mistake, if only to show that its investment approach is not so
'play safe' that it will avoid taking a reasonable risk on a company that
might produce spectacular gains. One hopes that the managers will also learn
from any mistakes.
I also look at the reports to see if there have been any changes in the
management. If a trust has performed well but one or more of the managers
named in the earlier report no longer appear in the latest report, will the
trust continue to produce such excellent returns?
Does the trust give details of any directors or managers with specialised
knowledge relevant to the trust's area of activity: such as ability to read
the languages of the countries in which the trust invests, or practical
business experience, or professional qualifications useful in assessing,
say, high-technology companies or mining/energy interests or some other area
of specialist activity relevant to the trust?
With trusts investing in emerging markets and other countries, I am
particularly keen to see whether or not the trust has an office or a
representative in one of the countries concerned, which might assist it in
keeping a close watch on market conditions that may be more volatile than in
some other countries.
I hope that my cautious approach to trusts will continue to produce good
returns.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Sport: The word in the slips - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cricket has always been a noisy game in the Indian sub-continent and in the
macho world of Australian competition. But now in England too, howls of
annoyance or encouragement are shattering the traditional peace of cricket
grounds.
With the noise has come a crop of jargon that you will pick up at any
professional match without listening particularly carefully. You might hear
the wicketkeeper yelling 'get it up 'im' as a precocious batsman takes
guard. Sledging has become so familiar that the word is incorporated in
larger dictionaries.
Other cricket vernacular is less well known. Here is a quick glossary, with
one or two oblique references to England's current visitors, New Zealand.
Aerosol bowler - usually a wayward paceman, literally someone who sprays it
everywhere. The young New Zealand fast bowler Heath Davis, playing his first
Test at Trent Bridge, is a good example. Batsmen actually dread these types
because sprinkled in between the wides and long-hops will be the unplayable
delivery.
Bunsen (burner) - rhyming slang for a turning wicket. A 'raging bunsen'
describes the sort of pitch occasionally found in India. There are few in
county cricket.
Boot Hill - short leg. The youngest member of the team usually fields here
because he is the most expendable, but 41-year-old Graham Gooch stands there
for England, presumably so that he does not have to run after the ball much.
Cafeteria bowling - Downright rubbish so called because you can help
yourself. You might see some when New Zealand take the field this series.
Dribbly - New Zealand term for a slow medium bowler (including former
captains Jeremy Coney and Bev Congden) who are lethal on their damp, mossy
pitches.
Grabbers - slip fielders. Graeme Hick seems to have regained his composure
there for England after a winter of fallibility.
Minefield - a raging bunsen that helps fast bowlers as well. Usually found
in provincial areas of New Zealand or on council-run county grounds in
England, more by accident than design.
Nick - touch, allegedly too faint for the umpire to hear or see, so
non-walking batsmen usually get away with them, particularly Australians,
but nowadays more and more English ones as well.
On 'Em - Loud reminder from the slip cordon that the batsman taking guard
made nought in the first innings, and is therefore in danger of making a
pair. Even the worst tail-enders dread that.
Pongo - rapid scoring. Serious pongo indicates a run rate of about eight an
over usually inflicted by one of the great players - Brian Lara for instance
 -and a day when the bowlers do not want their analyses advertised in full
on one of those new-fangled electronic sight screens.
Pull a Pup - Derbyshire term for doing a muscle, and nothing to do with
thieves at Battersea Dogs Home.
Rabbit - A batsman with a career average of less than five, or someone who
has taken more wickets over his career than he has scored runs. (I don't
qualify])
Reverend - player who only plays regularly on Sundays. Essex, Somerset and
Durham seem to have had a monopoly. Usually indicates a cricketer coming to
the end of his career. Not many are religious.
Sawn-off - given out by a cross-eyed or crooked umpire sometimes this is
just a pure gripe by a player who was legitimately dismissed and some come
out with extraordinary excuses such as being distracted by spectators
flashing mirrors or bowlers wearing coloured sweat bands.
Strangle - a wicket taken with an unlikely delivery, also sometimes
described as a 'death'. The new England cap Craig White strangles a lot of
batsmen with deliveries of varying quality.
Up The Ladder - general term for a coward or a hypochondriac. Basically
anyone who manages to get off the field because life is getting a bit rough.
Waqared - term coined from Waqar Younis's prowess at producing inswinging
yorkers which are usually both painful and terminal. Yorkshire's Darren
Gough is developing the same ability, but getting 'Goughed' doesn't quite
have the same ring.
X's - Money given to county or international captains for rounds of drink
after play . The strange thing is you never see these captains for dust
afterwards.
Zorro - Energetic swishing batsman - a flashing blade. This summer there may
be a plague of them representing England tucking in to the rather friendly
New Zealand bowling.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Motoring: Fiat scores a point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For months, Fiat's new supermini-sized Punto and I have been avoiding one
another. Nothing personal, you understand. It was just that when Fiat asked
me to go somewhere to drive it, I was committed elsewhere.
But at last a Punto came my way. Having driven it for a week I can say, hand
on heart, that it was worth the wait.
The model I tried was a 55 S 1.1 3-door, at Pounds 6,350 the cheapest and
least elaborate of them all. There can be few cars less favoured with
goodies.
It was the first I had driven for many years that lacked a trip mileometer.
The windows were hand wound (no great hardship); there was no rev counter,
no central locking, no split rear seat backrest and no power steering, which
was bothersome only at very low speeds or when parking.
That, however, just about sums up this most basic Punto's downside. The
upside included a willing engine (55 horsepower at 5,500 rpm); a five-speed
gearbox with the nicest shift of any Fiat in recent years, even if getting
reverse called for a strong push down; and a good ride due to the
wheel-at-each-corner design.
The driving position is excellent because neither pedals nor steering wheel
is offset and - most unusually - there is a proper rest for the left foot
away from the clutch. Headroom is more than adequate, with no sunroof
runners to reduce clearance. There is no sunroof. The tailgate opens on to a
reasonable boot. It will not take two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys
without folding the back seat - but I cannot think of any car in this size
and price class with a boot that does.
Punto's styling is trendy and practical. I rated it as pretty and original
as that of the 'one-box' shaped Twingo that Renault, to its discredit and
probably ultimate regret, has said will never be made with right-hand drive.
The body is easy to see out of and is well protected, front and rear, from
minor knocks by whacking great plastic bumpers. But the flanks of the Punto
55 S look vulnerable to careless multi-storey parkers; they lack the rubber
side-strips that are standard on every other Punto model from the 55 SX 1.1
3-door (Pounds 7,350) upwards.
Height-adjustable seatbelts with pre-tensioners are part of the package;
airbags for driver and front passenger are a Pounds 540.50 optional extra.
Full marks to Fiat for equipping all Puntos with an inertia switch that
de-pressurises the fuel line from tank to engine in a crash to reduce fire
risk. Neither power steering nor anti-lock brakes are available as an extra
on this entry model though they are on some of the dearer ones.
Another nice touch, unusual in a small, cheap car is the choice of fresh or
recirculated air from the heater.
Although a car of Punto's size and engine capacity is likely to spend more
of its life in towns and suburbs than on long journeys, it does not run out
of steam on motorways. At normal third lane cruising speeds it sounded
fairly busy but unstressed. On smooth tarmac it ran quietly, but coarsely
textured surfaces created a surprising amount of tyre noise. Fuel
consumption should average around 44-45 mpg (6.42-6.27 l/100 km).
For a mix of performance, comfort and value for money, the Punto 55 S must
be the best buy among supermini-sized family hatchbacks, There are some
slightly cheaper ones, but they are mainly basic versions of yesterday's
cars, such as the Fiat Uno, Rover Metro, Renault 5 Campus, Citroen AX and VW
Polo that are nearing the end of their lives.
The most competitive of its up-to-date price rivals are the Peugeot 106 Kid
1.0i and Vauxhall Corsa Merit 1.2i 3-door, listed at Pounds 6,375 and Pounds
6,645 respectively, Nissan Micra 1.0 L 3-door (Pounds 6,855) and Seat Ibiza
1.3 CLi 3-door (Pounds 6,895).
Perhaps its most formidable challenger will be the new Volkswagen Polo, due
to be launched in the UK in October. Prices will have to match Punto's
closely. Fiat has not had a happy time in the British market for several
years but in the last 12 months has been pulling out of the doldrums. The
Punto's arrival can only speed up the process.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Sport: The Indianapolis formula - Motor Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-American motor racing fans, indoctrinated by the self-proclamation of
Formula One that it is the pinnacle of motor racing, can only pause and take
thought after visiting the 'Indianapolis 500'.
Americans insist it is the world's greatest motor race. And they may have a
point. The Indianapolis board does not need to woo Formula 1 for the right
to stage a grand prix. Formula 1 is wooing it.
This week, as the grand prix world continued fierce arguments over how to
improve safety following the fatal crashes of Ayrton Senna and Roland
Ratzenberger, many 'Indy' fans were still trekking thousands of miles across
the US on their long way home from last Sunday's 78th running of the
500-mile race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
A subdued crowd of perhaps 30,000 watched Damon Hill inherit his first grand
prix win of the season at Barcelona on Sunday, but, in the US, some 450,000
flocked to see Al Unser Jr win in his Marlboro Penske Mercedes after 500
miles at an average of nearly 200 mph.
Of that total, just under 300,000 were in grandstand seats which cost as
little as Dollars 25 - enough to admit an arm and maybe a leg for basic,
standing-only admission to next month's British grand prix at Silverstone.
Nearly 100 faces filled just one vertical row of grandstands which line most
of the speedway's 2 1/2 miles. This is a 'live' spectator event without
parallel; the next largest, the Le Mans 24-hour race, on a good year
attracts 200,000.
It awes first-time spectators and overawes new drivers - even of the calibre
of Nigel Mansell, a rookie last year, and other top European drivers lured
to north America's Indy Car series. All concede that it offers a challenge
to driving skill and bravery with few parallels - even on the most testing
grand prix of circuits such as Spa-Francorchamps.
So, how can grand prix be considered the world championship if it does not
include the world's fastest and most daunting motor race?
Superficially, there appears no reason why both grand prix and Indy cars
should not take to the track together. The Indy cars, for which the
Indianapolis race is the biggest event across the US and Canada, look
similar to grand prix cars. They have more power but this is offset by
greater weight. In a straight line their performance would be similar but
they lack the technical sophistication and cornering power of grand prix
cars. But, says Tony Hulman George, the speedway's chief executive, grand
prix cars are not designed to withstand impact with the concrete walls that
line the circuit.
Grand prix's engineers do not all agree; and both Max Mosley, president of
the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, the world governing body of
motor sport, and Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors'
Association, say grand prix cars could be made compatible for this one race
without unrealistic engineering effort.
But on the commercial and political front, too, Indy's powers-that-be refuse
to be intimidated. 'There are a lot of people in Europe who presume that
Bernie not only walks on water but that he also owns the water,' said one
Indy veteran who has also had a long involvement with grand prix racing.
'Well, Bernie might be starting to feel he needs Indianapolis but the
speedway sure as hell doesn't need Bernie.'
The Indianapolis 500 is more than capable of standing on its own feet. Even
more grandstands and spectator facilities are to be added during the coming
year, just as they have been almost continuously under the George family's
nearly 50-year stewardship. The additions are still unlikely to be enough:
the 1995 race ticket order forms warn new applicants to seek only the
cheapest Dollars 25 tickets, the others are already allocated.
Yet haltingly and warily - and after a breakdown in negotiations two years
ago - grand prix and the Indianapolis authorities might soon be once again
groping towards a rapprochement.
They are still far apart, and George says that his talks with Ecclestone
have not been resumed. But quietly, George and his speedway board have
redesigned and landscaped the enormous infield - in which the full-sized
golf course is almost lost.
A grand prix circuit, combining a long stretch of the oval course and some
classic grand prix corners, is in place. All that is missing are the
grandstands and George makes clear that he would be prepared to build them.
George dismisses the idea that the two types of car will ever run together
again around the speedway - even though it was the lightweight rear-engined
grand prix cars of the late Jim Clark and Graham Hill which ended the reign
of Indy's front-engined monsters in the 1960s. He nevertheless insists that:
'I'm prepared to consider making a decent, permanent home for a US round of
the grand prix championship here.
Such an event could, he hints, be only two or three years away, but would
depend on a more flexible approach from Foca and from Ecclestone, who has a
well-earned reputation as a hard financial bargainer.
'If it happens it's going to be on our terms,' says George.
There is another pointer to change. In August the speedway will host a big
Nascar stock car race.
It is the first time an event other than the 500 will have been held there.
The breaking of such a long-hallowed tradition could well be the harbinger
of the grand prix to come.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Sport: Pierce adds fresh verve - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This afternoon in Paris, international women's tennis will experience one of
its periodic moments of rebirth. When Mary Pierce, the 19-year-old
Canadian-born French No. 1 who lives in Florida, plays the effervescent
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, in the final of the 1994 French Open, she will be
injecting fresh life into a sport that has recently been in decline.
Ever since the retirement of Chris Evert in 1989 and the eclipse of her
great rival Martina Navratilova, whose last major success was her Wimbledon
victory in 1990, the game has been dominated by Monica Seles and Steffi
Graf. Between them these two have won 23 of the last 28 grand slam
championships, including the last 13.
Until her comprehensive defeat at the hands of Pierce last Thursday, Graf
had enjoyed a clear run following the stabbing of Seles in April 1993. The
24-year-old German has won her last 20 tournament finals. Although Graf and
Seles have been wonderful ambassadors for the sport, the predictability of
their victories had introduced an unhealthy element of ennui.
Pierce, the No. 12 seed, who was competing in a grand slam semi-final for
the first time, ended all that. Her crushing 6-2 6-2 victory over Graf which
made her the first Frenchwoman to reach this final since Frankie Durr, who
won the title in 1967, was exceptional in several ways.
Pierce had played the world No. 1 twice, both times on hard courts last
year, and had been crushed both times. Yet, after beating two of the top 10
 -Sabatini and Navratilova - at the Virginia Slims Championships in
November, Pierce seemed to become a different person. Now she can say:' . .
. every time I play against Steffi and the top players I feel that I have
the game to beat them.' She has proved that this week.
Pierce hits the ball harder than anyone since Seles. She has been trained
since late last year by Nick Bollettieri, who developed both Seles and that
other mighty smiter, Andre Agassi. Bollettieri has encouraged her to go for
her shots as Agassi and Seles do.
This way of playing is risky. On a bad day the losers outnumber the winners.
On a good day you are assured of spectacular success.
For the past two weeks Pierce has had a succession of good days. During her
six wins she has conceded only 10 games, a record in Paris since open tennis
began in 1968.
Mary smiles a lot on court. She can afford to, now that her father and
former coach Jim has been banned from any venues where she is playing,
following a fight he had with another spectator at last year's French Open.
'Many things have changed, on the court and outside the court. My life has
changed. I enjoy myself more now and I have been training a lot physically.
When you feel good physically you have a lot of confidence,' said Pierce.
Confidence was crucial against Graf. Never did Pierce compromise, perhaps
because, as she explained: 'I told myself this was just another match . . .
I didn't think about Steffi being the other side of the net, I just had to
think about the ball.' Easy to say, difficult to do. Clearly Mary was
enjoying herself, and it showed.
Too few players understand the importance of getting the crowd on their side
 -especially when playing on home territory. Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe
were past masters at it. Time and again I have seen them manipulating the
vociferous crowd at Flushing Meadow so that their opponents have felt they
were taking on the whole of New York.
In Paris, Mary Pierce had the 16,000 French spectators eating out of her
hand. A smile here, a gesture there and they would roar deliriously to
compound the discomfort of the defending champion.
The victory was all the more impressive for the variety of shot displayed by
Pierce. Cleverly flighted lobs, well concealed drop shots and even the odd
volley, all produced at the right moment to catch the champion off guard.
You kept wondering if Mary would awaken from her dream. Certainly Graf hoped
she would.
'It is very difficult to play a whole match like that. You sometimes have to
miss some points so I still thought I had a chance,' said the loser. Any
last chance Graf might have had evaporated when, having broken the Pierce
serve for the first time to make it 2-2 in the second set, Graf lost her
serve with three errors as a light drizzle began to fall.
When they resumed, after a 40 minute delay, Pierce sailed into the attack.
In 13 minutes she blasted through the next three games for the loss of four
points to reach the final.
Pierce's opponent today may prove more troublesome. Sanchez-Vicario, the No
2 seed, had looked fit and fast as she inflicted a 6-3 6-1 defeat on fellow
Spaniard Conchita Martinez in the other semi-final. Sanchez-Vicario, always
in the shadow of Graf or Seles, now has the chance to show us just how good
she is.
When she won the French title as a bubbling 17-year-old in 1989 the future
seemed bright. Since then, however, there have been doubts on the great
occasions. Too often she has faltered on the brink, as at the US Open in
1992 when, having beaten Graf, she froze against Seles. Pierce is another
Seles. She plays the same way. She has the same confident outlook. It would
be ironic if the unfortunate Sanchez, the only woman previously to have
beaten Graf this year, should be thwarted by Graf's latest conqueror.
Sanchez has won three of her four previous meetings against Pierce but lost
their last encounter on a clay court in Hilton Head two months ago. My guess
is that Pierce is now even more confident than she was then and, should
today become the sort of exciting, new champion the game needs.

Occasional lump sums seem to do better than monthly payments

Equity investors face a hard decision: when is the best time to enter the
market?
Someone who chose to go in when the market was at its peak in 1987 and the
FT-SE-A All-Share index stood at 1,238, would have had to wait almost four
years before the index reached the same level. A cannier investor, who had
realised that the market would overheat that year and waited to go in at the
low of 784 in November 1987, would, with hindsight, have invested at an
ideal time, almost doubling his money by now.
But getting market timing right is notoriously difficult. One way round the
problem is to to use a regular savings scheme to drip-feed money into an
investment trust.
By doing so, you avoid buying all your shares at the top of the market, and
when the market drops you have the consolation of knowing that your money is
buying more shares. You are protected from the impact of day-to-day
fluctuations in share prices.
Buying fewer shares when prices are high and more when they are low, is
known as 'pound-cost averaging', because the average purchase price of the
shares will be lower than the arithmetic average over the period.
Another attraction of savings schemes is that many providers offer dealing
charges as low as 0.2 per cent, or even nil. The schemes are flexible, in
that you can stop them without penalty, unlike most insurance-related
products such as endowments.
Although monthly savings schemes are acknowledged as a good thing for
smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the market, they tend to be used
through necessity rather than choice. Many people find they can only afford
to feed Pounds 5,000 into the market through a Pounds 50-a-month savings
scheme, rather than come up with the lump sum. However, the relatively small
minimum investment which many of the schemes allow, can obscure the fact
that you could be gaining market exposure only very slowly.
Moreover, equities have risen over the long-term, so, despite pound-cost
averaging, you are likely to do better investing a large sum once instead of
a much smaller one regularly. A crude comparison between a lump-sum
investment and regular savings over the long-term, shows that returns from
the lump-sum investment are almost always higher than those achieved through
the savings scheme.
The comparison is crude because, to be fair, it is necessary to add to the
value of the increasing savings-scheme investment a figure for interest on a
diminishing cash sum yet to be invested and which may be waiting on deposit.
The table below compares the value of investing Pounds 100 a month into
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust over strategic periods. The return is
compared with the total amount invested over the period, invested as a lump
investment at the beginning of the period.
In all cases apart from one, the investor would have done better with the
lump sum investment. The exception occurs during the period September
1987-September 1990 - before the stock market crash, up to the period after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caused world markets to fall. This was a
turbulent period, at the end of which F&amp;C's share price was lower than at
the beginning.
Monthly savings are not the only option. Many schemes allow you to invest
occasional lump sums, usually of a minimum of Pounds 250. This allows you to
indulge in some market-timing skills. But check when the lump sum will be
invested - some investment trusts take a week or 10 days before buying the
shares.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Powerful, glamorous and beautiful: Lunch with the FT -
Michael Thompson-Noel entertains Janet Holmes a Court at a quiet little
place ...
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
How splendid life would be if one could lunch twice a week - or better,
twice a day - with Janet Holmes a Court. At 50 she is rich, glamorous and
beautiful. But she is also modest and unaffected to a degree that would be
thought exaggerated in a plain woman.
We are sitting in San Moritz - a choice of restaurant that pinpoints the
unassuming classiness of this friendly and resourceful woman. San Moritz is
a quiet place in Wardour Street, not far from Soho Square, where Janet
Holmes a Court reigns benevolently as executive chairman of Stoll Moss
Theatres.
As the proprietor of 11 London theatres, she is one of the most powerful
individuals - certainly the most powerful woman - in West End theatreland.
But San Moritz is not a power restaurant. There is no wheeling and dealing.
The beautiful people are absent. There are no luvvies lurking. It is a Swiss
restaurant, if you please, that serves charming, well-cooked food at
spectacularly non-Swiss prices.
For 'Lunch with the FT', guests can choose any restaurant they like. When I
asked Janet Holmes a Court why she had chosen this one, she said that she
liked its friendliness and food, and that she could walk to it from her
office. I told her that I didn't drink, but that she must have anything she
fancied. She asked for water, and said that a glass of house red might be
fun later. I am afraid I forgot to order it. She did not mention it again.
I asked her about Soho. What was it like to work in? She replied: 'I love
Soho enormously. I have a flat here at present. I can walk here for lunch. I
can also walk to every one of our theatres at night and walk home again,
feeling completely safe. I may not be safe, but I feel I am.'
Stoll Moss Theatres is part of Heytesbury Holdings, a family concern she
inherited on the death in 1990 of her husband, Robert Holmes a Court, the
astute and exceedingly civilised Western Australian businessman whose
fortunes had been reduced by the global stock market crash of 1987.
On the death of her husband, Janet Holmes a Court could have retreated into
a life of luxurious obscurity. But that is not her way. She has tons of
vitality, and a commensurate array of interests. Her principal business
achievement has been to establish Heytesbury as a diverse but focussed
group.
Apart from 11 London theatres, she owns a Western Australian cattle company
(Heytesbury Pastoral Group) and a Melbourne-based construction company (John
Holland Group) that does much business in south-east Asia.
She also owns a Perth-based trucking operation, an extremely successful
racehorse stud, and a winery and restaurant in St Margaret's River, at the
south-western tip of Western Australia.
To supervise these interests, she has homes in Perth, Melbourne and London,
and flits hither and thither, visiting England four or five times a year.
Her CV of cultural, educational and charitable interests is as long as your
arm. She is pro-chancellor, for example, of the University of Western
Australia and a member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
One of the things that seems to please her most is Australia's success with
multi-culturism and its efforts to integrate itself more fully into its part
of the world.
'There are 176 different nationalities in Australia,' says this
ambassador-at-large approvingly. 'You rarely go anywhere and sit with people
who look the same.'
Intrigued, I asked her about her Reserve Bank appointment. Why had they
asked her to join? 'Well,' she said, 'they wanted a woman, and I'm not
particularly flattered by tokenism. They had never had one, you see. On the
other hand, Heytesbury operates in widely different geographical locations,
and in very different businesses, so I expect they found that interesting.'
I said, rather clumsily, that I was sure that the Reserve Bank of Australia
had had hundreds of successful businesswomen from whom to choose for its
foray into - uh - tokenism. To which Janet Holmes a Court replied: 'Michael,
you are charming.'
Theatre is her greatest love, both in Australia and in London. Stoll Moss is
spending Pounds 10m refurbishing her London theatres, which include the
Theatre Royal (home to the money-spinning Miss Saigon), the London Palladium
(awaiting Fiddler on the Roof), Her Majesty's (Phantom of the Opera), the
Lyric and the Queen's.
One of her theatres, the Globe, in Shaftesbury Avenue, is being renamed the
Gielgud Theatre in honour of Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday, and also in
tribute to the late Sam Wanamaker. When Wanamaker's reconstruction of
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames opens next year,
it will be the only Globe Theatre in London.
Janet Holmes a Court went to school and university in Perth, and spent three
years teaching science, but says she has always enjoyed being around
creative people and that her link with London theatreland was something she
was determined to maintain after her husband's death.
'Theatre is the best business to be involved in, and London theatre is - or
should be - the wellspring of what happens in theatre around the world. If I
weren't involved in theatre I would like to make motorway cones. The money
there must be in motorway cones]
'One thing that concerns me is that there are so many revivals on in London
at present. There is very little new writing happening in West End theatre.
'In addition, many of the backers have been affected by the fall-out at
Lloyd's. Yet the theatre business is cyclical, as are most others. That is
why it pays to diversify one's interests. When Stoll Moss is doing well in
London, the Australian construction business may well be in the doldrums.
'I visit the theatre every night when I am in London. Although I feel safe
in Soho, there is a lot more that could be done to perk-up theatreland. For
example, there appear to be more people living on the streets.'
Homelessness, she said, had many costs, some less obvious than others.
Another of her passions is Australian Aboriginal art. She has held on to the
collection of Aboriginal art formed by her husband, and has added to it
greatly, so that she now owns about 1,500 Aboriginal items, out of a total
art collection of about 3,500 pieces.
On the other hand, many other works were sold off.' When I looked into it,
there was an enormous amount of stuff in Heytesbury, including, for example,
a remarkable number of racehorses: about 160 brood mares, four stallions,
four studs and horses in training all over the place, including England and
the US.
'However, what Robert had done was put in place the foundation of great
success. The operation is now much simplified - 50 mares, three stallions,
just one stud farm - and is now, for the first time, making money, having
recorded some notable achievements.'
Racing is an 'interest' rather than a 'passion' for Janet Holmes a Court,
though for all her jet-setting, her favourite place appears to be her
racehorse stud, 40 miles from Perth. 'It is the place where I would like to
finish up.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: A dull day in Germany is . . . well .
. . dull - The way other countries tackle boring news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the week's news consists entirely of tales of the expected and the
straightforwardly boring, newspapers tackle the problem in a manner dictated
by their national traditions.
The British create salacious gossip to replace it. In Switzerland, you
splash the story over several columns, the duller the better. Thus, the Neue
Zurcher Zeitung covered its front page on Tuesday with the death of the
former East German boss, Erich Honecker.
If the Germans report a dull event, they make sure you know it is dull. The
Russians go in for a tiny bit of grotesque exaggeration. The French wrap
boring stories together and manufacture bogus coincidences and astonishing
non-sequiturs.
For them, the key words are: 'At the very moment when . . .' So, one
provincial French paper wrote: 'Erich Honecker passed away in exile in Chile
at the very moment when the old communists were poised to achieve a big
victory in the Hungarian elections.'
The arrest of the boss of France's Schneider engineering company by the
Belgian authorities occasioned even more complex intellectual convolutions
in Le Monde: 'At the very moment when, in the margin of the Franco-German
summit in Mulhouse, the employers' organisations of France and Germany sign
a common declaration in favour of European construction, the indignant
reaction of many French businessmen to the, perhaps hasty, arrest in Belgium
of Didier Pineau-Valencienne seems surprising.'
This is a journalistic style which has gone out of favour in Britain, and
remains only in a shrunken form familiar to readers of Sunday colour
supplements: 'Many, on meeting Charlie Smith, Norfolk's leading rose-grower,
would be surprised to learn that he is a staunch Labour Party supporter.'
For Le Monde, the wondrous discovery of its fantastic coincidence was merely
a cause of wider reflections on l'Europe des affaires. It decided that the
close relations between France and Belgium had led to certain tensions,
particularly in the French-speaking south of Belgium where French business
influence has been regarded as a form of imperialism.
So, the paper warned against falling into a trap that I, for one, had never
even contemplated. It said French leaders should not treat Belgium as 'some
kind of banana republic where the rights of man are not respected.' A survey
I have conducted shows that this view is not remarkably widespread -
largely, perhaps, because Belgium is a kingdom.
Nevertheless, the arrest of Pineau-Valencienne does lead to consideration of
another astounding coincidence. Schneider also is the name of the boss of
the eponymous German company who, in March, allegedly ran off with millions
of his creditors' Deutschemarks.
Since companies called Schneider have now got into the news this year in
both France and Germany, why have there been no editorials on this? As
Schneider means 'tailor', perhaps one should watch out for firms of that
name - which would be Sastre in Spain or Portnoy in Russia.
This reflection leads naturally to the Russian approach on how news and
indignation can be manufactured from inadequate material.
Now the Russians have a unique ability to confront the sensational and be
defeated by the commonplace. That quality has been of immense use to chaps
like Chekhov, who could produce fascinating tales of characters unmoved by
disaster and overwhelmed by trivia. Thus, Sovetskaya Rossiya has been much
exercised by President Yeltsin's decree abolishing export quotas and export
licensing. This, said the paper, 'plunges the country into a new phase of a
so-called democratic revolution.'
Meanwhile, the other conservative daily, Pravda, celebrated the 95th
birthday of writer Leonid Leonov by noting that it coincided with the
publication of his new novel which, allegedly, 'sums up the philosophical
and ethical results of a whole stage of world civilisation.' And never
before had someone of 95 been able to achieve that.
If there is a particular German gift in this area of stylistic endeavour, it
is to render the banal banal. This week, there have been allegations of a
scandal involving over-charging for cardiac valve implants in certain
clinics.
The Allgemeine Zeiting of Mainz commented: 'If this should prove to be so,
it would not be only a case for the public prosecutor. It could also affect
the smooth functioning of social insurance societies such as Sickness
Funds.' And so on.
The trouble is that real news is scarce but comment is abundant. 'No news,
no comment' could, perhaps, provide the basis for a succesful newspaper
commercial.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Stately B &amp; B's of England: Christopher Price tests a
discreet and classy venture by Britain's tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no advertisements for one of the British tourist industry's newest
ventures. Nor are there any signs outside 200 of the most beautiful places
in Britain which offer guests a night's lodging.
In fact, anonymity is almost a condition for those taking part in the
scheme. 'A bed and breakfast sign outside the house? Good Lord, no. We don't
want just anyone calling in,' said Philip Archer, a retired farmer of
Welland Court, a 15th century manor house set at the foot of the Malvern
Hills.
It is a refrain echoed by his fellow mansion owners, who, for reasons
ranging from impecuniosity to boredom, last month began opening up their
homes to paying guests. 'If people just rolled up willy-nilly we wouldn't
know what sort they were,' agreed Richard Cunningham, owner of a listed
Jacobean manor house in Sussex.
The task of finding the right type of guests is being undertaken by Discover
Britain, a Worcester-based agency which, in keeping with its publicity-shy
members, has limited its advertising to overseas tour operators.
'Quite a number of our owners prefer to be discreet about offering B &amp; B and
so will take only overseas visitors,' said Andrew Grieve, the agency's
managing director. Some owners had also expressed concern that potential
burglars might turn up to assess their valuables if they advertised in the
UK. There are plans to extend the scheme to the UK in the autumn, but Grieve
admitted: 'I don't expect all the owners will want to take part.'
Most owners do it because they need the money. Maintaining a large country
house is expensive at the best of times, and the recession has put off some
much needed repair work. Sarah Callander-Becket, owner of Combermere Abbey,
a Grade I listed 12 century abbey set in an 1,100-acre estate in Shropshire,
has a double incentive. 'We have serious maintenance and repair projects to
undertake and overseas guests will not only help finance a new roof for our
16 century library, but also help advertise the new stables we are
converting into holiday cottages.'
'We're all in it for the money, let's be honest,' said Sarah Burgoyne, 'I
could tell you about my love of entertaining, which would also be true. But
it's basically about trying to keep this place going,' - a Grade II listed
17th century manor house, complete with lake, tennis court, swimming pool
and exceptional gardens within earshot of Glyndebourne opera house.
Burgoyne, a widow with two young children, intends to run the B &amp; B venture
alongside her Edwardian garden furniture business.
Several of the owners are Lloyd's names. Sir Graham Lake, owner of Magdalen
Laver Hall, an early Georgian mansion, said: 'I'm not expecting to make that
much from it, but it might make up some of the syndicate money I've lost.'
Belinda Hextall, of 15th century Baverstock Manor near Salisbury, put a
braver face on it. 'Yes, we have got a Lloyd's problem hanging over us and
it's a big open syndicate - but that's not really the reason. We have nine
bedrooms here, my husband works away half the week in London, the children
are day boarders and I like to keep busy.'
Lake, who spent many years abroad in the colonial service, said: 'We're
hoping to meet some interesting people through this. We do really enjoy
entertaining.'
Grieve agreed. 'These are people who are used to entertaining, have in many
cases spent years at it and are finding that with their children grown up
have these big empty houses. They're the perfect hosts and hostesses.'
The cost of one night's accommodation and breakfast is the same rate for all
the properties included in the 'Mansions and Manors' programme - Pounds 34
per person. Dinner is an additional Pounds 15 per person.
Some overseas tourists book their chosen houses through tour operators. But
the most popular method is a scheme enabling touring visitors to
pre-purchase vouchers for the mansion of their choice. The only condition is
that they give 48 hours notice - and it is at the owners convenience. 'The
beauty of this scheme is that you can say 'no',' said Callander-Becket, a
view echoed by many of the owners interviewed.
For those country house owners considering the scheme, the agency despatches
an inspector to check on the suitability of the property and answer queries.
The maximum number of guests allowed per night is six, a figure which stays
within most council tax rules and avoids the need for a change-of-use
planning application for of the premises.
Most insurance companies are also comfortable with this figure as being no
different from having normal house guests. None must sleep above the first
floor in order to comply with fire regulations.
Capital gains tax does not come into play while the B &amp; B activity is not a
principle use of the house. Income has to be declared, as with any business,
but after setting costs against it, Grieve said the scheme remains 'pretty
profitable for all concerned.' After Discover Britain's commission has been
paid, members receive Pounds 26 per guest. He estimated that in a good week
during the summer a house could earn Pounds 500 net a week.
The agency encourages its members to extend every hospitality to their
guests and to involve them as much as possible in the daily routine of the
house. This will usually mean a welcoming cup of tea on arrival, a tour of
the house and gardens and the use of many of the facilities. For their part,
guests are entreated 'not to treat your hosts as porters or housemaids,' -
even though some of the owners interviewed said their housemaids or au pairs
would be doing the bulk of the domestic duties.
The hospitality was evident to varying degrees at the three houses visited
by a colleague and me. At Burgoyne's house, tea and cake were served by our
host in the drawing room, the au pair who would normally help was out
walking the dog.
A tour of the house and grounds followed, Burgoyne giving us an animated
potted history of the house, her life - she is particularly proud of her
prize-winning Chinese Croad Langshaw chickens - and the Glyndebourne opera.
The guest rooms were spacious and, like the house itself, decorated and
furnished in the grandest Georgian style. Dinner could be taken either in
the large kitchen, or in the smaller but stately dining room, and either
with Burgoyne and her au pair or alone. So far her two sets of guests - one
Belgian, one Canadian - have opted to eat with their host.
'I've really enjoyed the entertaining,' said Burgoyne. 'In fact, I got on
with one set of guests so well that I took them to a poultry show. They
thoroughly enjoyed it.'
Further east in Sussex, King John's Lodge, so named because King John of
France was held prisoner there in 1356, is surrounded in prize-winning
gardens. The welcome here was also warm, if a little guarded. Richard
Cunningham and his wife had decided to make a separate lounge area for
guests, deciding that 'both parties like a bit of privacy.' They had not
received any guests as yet, but by all accounts, breakfast and dinner would
also be taken alone. 'We'll be too busy preparing it,' said Cunningham. His
management consultancy business has taken over part of the house, so space
to wander around in was also restricted.
At East Mascalls, a 15th century manor house nestling in a picturesque vale
on the South Downs, we were greeted rather formally by the lady of the house
who showed us to an elegant first floor bedroom overlooking the large lawned
back garden.
Donwstairs, we were served an early evening aperitif, although our host was
surprisingly shy about discussing the house, referring all questions to her
husband, who was working at his heating engineering business. When he
arrived, he quickly disappeared to feed their prize labradors. I took the
opportunity to inspect the gardens. After our previous receptions, it was
all slightly uncomfortable.
We had already decided to eat out, and the husband recommended and drove us
to a local pub, offering to pick us up later. On our return, he served us
his best single malt and for the first time both hosts seemed relaxed. We
chatted until the small hours, during which time and in keeping with many of
the other home owners, they claimed they were doing B &amp; B more for the
company than the money.
The next morning, formality returned and we took our breakfast alone, served
by our reticent hostess. Just prior to our departure and true to form, she
said: 'I would not like to see our names in the paper. I don't think we want
any publicity about this.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (9): Venerable institutions to
tempt the cautious - They are virtually unrestricted, explains Bethan
Hutton, yet have a solid UK base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Many people steer clear of the stock market, or anything linked to it,
because of a vague feeling that companies go bust, stock markets crash, and
the world of stocks and shares is populated by fly-by-night outfits which
take your money and run.
Perhaps even the most truly cautious might stick a toe in the water if it
were possible to entrust their money to institutions which had been managing
money since before their grandparents were born, and had survived every
stock market crash this century.
Such institutions do exist: a good number are to be found among the 20 or so
trusts in the international general investment trust sector. Half of them
were launched before 1900, and only four are post-war - the first world war,
that is.
Like the giant, long-lived tortoises on the Galapagos Islands who met Darwin
when he first passed by, and are still munching placidly away a century and
a half later as hordes of eco-tourists follow in his wake, they have seen it
all before.
When the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, the most venerable and most
gigantic of them all, came into existence more than 125 years ago, the
emerging markets of the Far East and Latin America were all the rage. Since
then investment fashions have gone through many phases before returning full
circle to the 'newly emerging' markets of the Far East and Latin America.
But these trusts are not lumbering creatures still living in the last
century. Their advantage is their flexibility. You want emerging markets?
The international generalists have got them. You want European
privatisations? UK small-cap stocks? Latin American telephone companies?
Japanese game manufacturers and Australian mines? Foreign &amp; Colonial,
Alliance, Bankers Trust, Mid Wynd, Scottish Mortgage and their like will
probably have them all - if they are worth having, that is, not just this
month's gimmick to launch a new trust.
International general trusts are virtually unrestricted in their investment
policies. They all have a solid base portfolio of UK shares, but can move
funds anywhere in the world if they see markets turning nasty in one corner
of the globe while investment opportunities open up elsewhere. They can
invest in the largest blue-chip stocks or the tiniest start-up venture, as
they see fit.
The one thing they do not all have is fully Pep-qualifying status. Some,
like Scottish Mortgage, have decided to go for Pepability, and so make sure
that their funds are always at least 50 per cent invested in the UK and
Europe.
But others, notably Foreign &amp; Colonial, treasure their complete investment
freedom so that although at times their portfolio may be less than 50 per
cent invested outside the EU, they make no promises that it will remain that
way. Therefore investors can only put up to Pounds 1,500-worth of these
trusts' shares into a Pep each year.
However, most of the management groups run other fully Pepable funds which
can use up the rest of your Pep allowance if you prefer to keep your Pep
under one roof.
Because these trusts spread their assets so widely around different markets,
they are never caught up in the kind of wave of enthusiasm which can pluck
more narrowly-focused trusts from obscurity (and a hefty discount) and make
them flavour of the month (pushing them to a premium), only to drop them
when the next fad comes along. General trusts tend to roll steadily along at
an average sort of discount, neither in nor out of favour.
Investors in highly-specialised trusts can find that when their speciality
falls out of favour, they are hit by a double blow as the share price
plummets and the discount widens to as much as 20 or 30 per cent. But it
would take a collapse in all world markets - not impossible, but not a
frequent occurrence - to deal a heavy blow to the international generalists.
International general trusts provide the ideal basis for the first-time
equity investor's portfolio. They give you a little bit of everything,
without too much exposure to some of the heart-stoppingly volatile
individual markets.
This may mean that you never triple your money in six weeks, in the way your
broker swears you could have done if you had shovelled it all into emerging
market warrants and Latin American debt at the right moment. But you will
also be spared the experience of seeing your money disappear into a black
hole as you try to sell last month's hot tip at the same time as everybody
else.
Independent adviser David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says the
Foreign &amp; Colonial trust is a long-standing favourite of his. 'I think of it
very much in the light that it will never reach extremes and be at the top
of the performance tables, but it is solid, and it has downside protection.'
Another handy feature for cautious or small investors is that most
international generalists have savings schemes which allow you to invest
small, regular amounts, sometimes as little as Pounds 25 a month, to build
up a holding in the fund. This also means you can ride out the ups and downs
of the stockmarket, and avoid investing lump sums at the peak of the market
(see above).
Foreign &amp; Colonial was the first to offer a savings scheme, 10 years ago,
and it continues to evolve: now you can even take out a Foreign &amp; Colonial
personal pension plan. If proof were needed, that gives a clear signal that
these trusts expect to be around for a long time yet.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: British tea and torte - Nicholas Lander visits
Betty's, which serves 2m cuppas a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The waitress apologised profusely, although it was a tiny mistake, and
smiled warmly. She was wearing a black skirt, starched white blouse, apron
and alice band, and looked the embodiment of the Victorian maid.
But I was not on the set of television's Upstairs Downstairs, or in a plush
London hotel. I was in Harrogate, Yorkshire, in what many consider to be the
British tearoom - Betty's.
Taking tea is a peculiarly British custom. This is only partly due to the
commercial acumen of British tea traders and their forays into India and
China. Tea is universally popular because of its refreshing qualities and
its versatility.
The story of Betty's is an interesting one. In the early 1900s Frederick
Belmont, a young Swiss confectioner, arrived in London to make his fortune.
He eventually found himself in Yorkshire and fell in love with the Dales. In
1919 he opened the first Betty's - the origin of its name is still unclear.
Belmont's timing was as good as his patisserie. Harrogate in the 1920s was
booming but, until Betty's opened, there was nowhere for women to go
unchaperoned. The tea room became a great success.
The surrounding countryside supplied its own baking traditions and the
finest raw materials. Cream was so plentiful that it was served with tea
until the 1930s when the switch to milk was made. Accordingly, the price of
afternoon tea was reduced to six pence. - An orchestra played during the
tea.
Belmont secured the Swiss succession to his culinary empire when his nephew,
Victor Wild, took over the business. In spite of its size, Betty's still
remains a family affair. It employs 700 full and part time workers and, with
the departure of chemicals manufacturer ICI, has become one of Harrogate's
biggest employers.
Last year, the four Betty's tea rooms (the others are in York, Ilkley and
Northallerton) served 1.5m customers with 200,000 cups of coffee and 2m cups
of tea.
In the 1960s, Betty's took over its rivals, Taylor's, and runs this as a
separate division which blends 570 tons of coffee a year and the Yorkshire
Tea, of which 5m cups are drunk a day (Betty's also supplies, free of
charge, tea to all the northern branches of the Women's Institute).
Betty's has flourished because of a refreshingly open policy towards what it
serves and whom it employs. In the bakery trays of continental pastries -
Amadeus torte, strudels and slices of Venetian festival cake - are stacked
next to vanilla slices, Yorkshire curd tarts and fat rascals, a cross
between a scone and a rock bun, of which more than 500,000 are produced each
year.
Yorkshire bakers and confectioners are sent to Richemont College in Lucerne,
which accounts for the excellent quality of puff pastry and chocolate.
In Mike Riley, the company's young coffee buyer, they have a true,
hard-working Yorkshireman. Riley rose through the ranks. He begins every day
with a blind tasting of numerous teas and coffees - including those of his
competitors. He enthuses about the different tastes of the Puerto Rico Yauco
Selecto Peaberry coffee and the 1993 vintage St Helena coffee - of which he
has bought the entire crop.
The quality of the tea and coffee is unquestionably high at Betty's but, in
the main, people flock there for scones, cinnamon muffins, buttered
pikelets, chocolate cream eclairs, hazelnut meringues . . .
As Jillian Miller, training co-ordinator, put it: 'If everybody round here
decides to get health conscious we're in real trouble.'
Betty's, 1 Parliament Street, Harrogate HG1 2QU. Tel: 0423-502746, also for
postal orders.

One of the finest private wine cellar's to come on the market is to be sold
at Christie's on Thursday June 16. Some 18,000 bottles from the world's
greatest wine estates, which have been assembled over 30 years by a private
collector, are expected to fetch more than Pounds 1m.
Many of the wines are so rare they hardly ever appear at auction by bottle,
let alone by the case. For example, there are seven cases of Chateau Cheval
Blanc 1947, one of the greatest clarets, and each case is expected to fetch
between Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 300,000.
Other highlights of the cellar include: eight cases of Chateau La Mission
Haut Brion 1945; seven cases of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1959; eight cases
of Hermitage La Chapelle 1961 and 16 cases of Gewurztraminer, Cuvee Anne
Schlumberger 1976.
Mixed lots will range in estimate from as little as Pounds 80.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (8): Eyes turn to the discount
 -3i will dwarf other trusts that invest in unlisted businesses, and allow
more savers to back recovery in smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has never been an investment trust launch quite like it. When 3i comes
to market later this month, the UK's largest venture capital supplier will
have a valuation in the region of Pounds 1.6bn, making it by far the largest
investment trust ever floated.
It will dwarf the existing trusts that invest in unlisted businesses. But 3i
may also raise the profile of investment in unquoted companies, providing
investors with an opportunity to back recovery in smaller businesses
throughout the UK economy.
Whether or not 3i proves an attractive investment will depend on the
pricing, due to be decided on June 22. But unlike 14 months ago, when 3i's
shareholders called off the last attempted float, the group's
smaller-company customer base appears to be on the road to recovery.
3i was set up as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation by six
clearing banks and the Bank of England in 1945. It provides equity, debt and
mezzanine finance through 18 UK offices to unquoted companies seeking
expansion capital, funds for management buy-outs and buy-ins and for
start-ups. The group also has five continental offices.
The group has tended to lend and invest off the strength of its own balance
sheet. But earlier this year it started managing and investing funds
provided by other financial institutions. This will increasingly provide 3i
with fees, raising the group's return on assets.
Preferring to use its branch network to do a large number of smaller deals -
where most venture capital firms focus on a small number of larger deals -
3i has investments in over 3,400 companies, valued at about Pounds 3bn.
The group does not, however, like to be called a venture capital group: it
believes it provides 'investment capital', a term, it says, that better
reflects, among other things, the fact that the managements of companies in
which it invests are not obliged to commit to when they will float, or
provide investors with an alternative exit.
Not does 3i consider itself an investment trust. It argues, with some
reason, that its branch network makes it more like a traditional business.
But 3i is floating as an investment trust, in order to gain exemption from
capital gains tax. Like most other investment trusts, the group is likely to
be valued at a price based on a discount to net asset value (NAV). The only
question is how great that discount should be.
Since 3i announced its float in the summer, the discounts at which venture
capital investment trusts have been trading to net asset value have widened
considerably.
Electra, the venture capital investment trust whose business most closely
approximates to 3i's, is trading at a discount to NAV of about 17 per cent,
compared with about 8 per cent when 3i announced that it would float.
This is only partly because investors are taking a more cautious view of
smaller-company prospects and the strength of the recovery. Average
discounts for the investment trust sector as a whole have widened over that
period, partly because of the number and size of recent new issues like the
Kleinwort Benson European privatisation trust. 3i's advisers will have to
contend with this recent weakness when deciding the flotation price.
Some analysts and brokers, however, say 3i has a unique business which
should reduce the discount.
In the first place, valuation of unquoted companies in venture capital
investment trusts is generally conservative. Quoted companies tend to be
valued on expected future profits. 3i and other venture capital trusts only
revise upwards the valuations of the companies they invest in based on
profits actually produced.
The benefits of economic recovery are, therefore, yet to show up in
valuations of 3i's unquoted portfolios, whereas they may be largely
discounted in quoted company valuations.
That said, results for the year to end-March, released last week, showed
that net asset values had already risen 39 per cent to Pounds 1.85bn,
including the release of a Pounds 152m provision for deferred tax no longer
required as a result of 3i's anticipation that it will receive investment
trust status.
Secondly, institutional support for investment in unquoted investment will
probably increase once 3i floats. Not only is 3i a diversified cyclical play
on UK recovery, but demand may also increase.
Funds that try to match the performance of the FT-SE 100 index may have to
hold 3i, which will be in or near the index. With the banks only selling 40
per cent of their stake in 3i, there may not be that much stock around.
The listing of such a large investor in unquoted companies as 3i might have
been seen as bad news for the existing venture capital trust. But Electra's
managing director, Hugh Mumford, relishes the prospect.
'3i is unique, well run and has a place in investment portfolios,' he says.
'From our point of view, we hope it will stimulate a better understanding of
what we are doing. It will be good to have some competition.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Fashion: Through the looking glass - This year's prime Ascot
accessory could well be a raincoat. But, whatever the weather, Avril Groom
knows the unwritten dress rules for the big occasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If your only experience of Ascot is distilled through the the lenses of the
paparazzi you could be forgiven for thinking it an event of almost
unparallelled vulgarity and excess.
But those who go know that there always are wonderfully-dressed women at
Ascot. They rarely attract the cameras, they wear quiet colours and
flattering proportions and rigorously apply the 'less is more' rule - only
the simplest, plainest outfit can take a real statement of a hat.
If they break the Ascot rules, they do it so elegantly that no-one notices
for the dress rules are unwritten, not engraved on tablets of stone.
According to Laura Thompson-Royds, of the Royal Enclosure office, women
should wear 'formal day dress with a hat covering the crown of the head' and
'formal' is the keyword. Trousers are discouraged but not banned if part of
a suit.
One of last year's most successful outfits was a plain, cream, crepe suit
with wide, soft trousers that balanced a big straw platter hat scattered
with flowers.
On short skirts the discretionary rules are frankly ageist. The young and
lithe-limbed would not and should not get away with it; the pudgy over-40s
probably would (and should) not, on the valid grounds of suitability.
In the late 1980s an Ascot uniform evolved, of tailored jackets, straight
skirts, bright colours and gilt buttons. It persisted right up until last
year when only a few brave souls put an elegant toe into the misty waters of
longline chiffon and soft ruffles. This year the change is writ large in
mainstream fashion and getting it right at Ascot - that is looking both soft
and formal - requires some thought.
There are two main options. One, in spite of its suspect status, is the
trouser suit as the easy alternative to both the long, soft skirt (hard to
make look formal) and this year's very short length. The other is the short
skirt in its new soft form. Both need careful accessorising to achieve the
right degree of formality.
Trouser suits smack of casual or working clothes unless they are in a
drape-like, luxurious fabric such as crepe, heavy silk or a high-quality
viscose mix. A tailored jacket, short or long, and wide trousers is the
dressiest option.
Hats with trousers are tricky. A simple, panama-based style looks too sporty
while a confection of veils and bows is too fussy. Patricia Underwood, the
New York-based British designer whose simple, hand-stitched styles in soft,
pliable straw (available from Browns and Harvey Nichols) are famed for their
flattering effect, says the hat must always be 'clothing driven.' So choose
the outfit first.
'With trousers I would suggest a brim that turns up to keep the eyeline up,
and a structured style to go with the tailoring. It should be simple but
adding self-coloured silk flowers makes it dressier,' she says.
A top hat is one natural partner for trousers, but choose a lightweight
style with a feminine trim to avoid the drag artiste look. Dressy shoes for
trousers are not easy. Heels can look graceful with wide trousers but
stilettoes are inappropriate. Gucci's new block-heeled loafer with
squared-off toe gets it right.
The new short skirt, a youthful A-line, looks most formal not as a skirt at
all but as a dress with matching jacket or coat - a look long overdue for a
comeback. Shapes vary from Ben de Lisi's bias-cut soft fluted version to
Catherine Walker's svelte line.
Dead straight skirts look dated but the less fullness there is the less
likely you are to emulate the woman who failed to interest the photographers
until the wind lifted her huge hat and her full skirt skywards and
simultaneously every shutter clicked.
Hardy Amies, an old hand at dressing chilly English occasions, puts short
puffed sleeves on a pretty dress in lightweight tweed, but the sleeveless or
slip dress is a hot favourite which can slide over a silk T-shirt or would
pass muster alone on a hot day whereas an off-the-shoulder style would not.
This year's prime Ascot accessory could well be a raincoat and Aquascutum
have caught the dressy mood with swingy styles in silk or microfibre and
fondant shades.
Only a pessimist chooses her hat to match her raincoat: for a dress and
jacket, says Patricia Underwood, 'check the shoulderline carefully as some
of the new shapes are cut very narrowly and need a smaller hat. A
see-through brim goes with the feeling of lightness.'
Philip Treacy's banana-straw hats fulfil this brief, some seeming to defy
gravity.
But even an Ascot hat, says Patricia, 'should be useful as well as looking
good.' This is true of the whole outfit. For Ascot also read weddings,
garden parties, school speech days and big summer occasions. If the outfit
you are considering will not pay its way at all of those, then I am afraid
it is back to the drawing board.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (7): Your savings in their
hands - Bethan Hutton stages an identity parade for famous names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you know who is looking after your money? By buying shares in an
investment trust, you are in effect handing over your savings to the
managers of a trust, hoping they will invest wisely on your behalf. But many
investors have a very hazy idea of who the real people are behind the name
on the share certificate.
It is not always obvious from the name of a trust what it is and who
actually manages it. The Bankers trust is an international generalist run by
Henderson Touche Remnant, as are both Law Debenture and Witan - but who
could have guessed?
Some management groups, like Edinburgh Fund Managers, are gradually changing
the names of their funds to present a unified 'brand image' and increase
awareness of the group behind the funds; but others are reluctant to
sacrifice names which can be a century or more old, and often pre-date the
management company.
Investment trust management is a small but diverse segment of the fund
management industry. The biggest three investment trust management groups
are Henderson Touche Remnant, with Pounds 3,680m under management, Fleming
with Pounds 3,659m, and Foreign &amp; Colonial with Pounds 3,455m. At the
opposite end of the scale, there are also a dozen or two groups with less
than Pounds 50m of investment trust money under management, though for many
of them investment trusts are a sideline to their main insurance, pension
fund or unit trust business.
The large players, like HTR and Fleming, tend to have broad ranges of funds,
with general UK and international funds at their core, supplemented by
portfolios of small specialist trusts.
Smaller groups often concentrate their resources on a particular segment of
the market, such as smaller companies, or the Far East. Niche players are
often the result of one experienced manager or small team breaking away from
well-known houses to follow their own ideas. One example is Scottish Value
Management, set up by former Templeton and Scottish Provident manager Colin
McLean in 1990, which specialises in investing in other investment trusts,
and seeking hidden value in other companies.
As might be expected, many investment trust groups have solid roots in the
City of London. But it is a matter for dispute whether the Scots or the
English invented investment trusts, and the predominance of Scottish accents
is still noticeable in the industry in modern times. Perhaps a third of
investment trust assets are managed north of the border, by groups like
Abtrust, Baillie Gifford, Dunedin, Edinburgh Fund Managers, Ivory &amp; Sime,
Martin Currie, Murray Johnstone, and Templeton - but even the London-based
groups recruit plenty of managers from Scotland.
Charlotte Square, the Georgian square at the heart of Edinburgh's business
and financial district, used to be the hub of the investment trust world, as
it housed many of the large Scottish fund management groups. People used to
talk of the investment community as the 'Charlotte Square mafia', but that
has now been largely disbanded. Many of the companies have moved out to
shiny new headquarters elsewhere in Edinburgh, while others are based in
less traditional Scottish financial centres like Glasgow and Aberdeen. Ivory
&amp; Sime is one of the few old stalwarts remaining, at One Charlotte Square.
In the US, some fund managers are high-profile personalities who can draw
investors to a fund with their name alone. UK investment trusts are
anonymous by comparison, with few names or faces recognisable by the general
investing public. Most funds are run by teams, often composed of one
experienced manager backed up by a number of bright young things trying to
make their mark. However, a few personalities do stand out, particularly at
the more exotic end of the market.
One such is Dr Mark Mobius, the peripatetic American who is the driving
force behind Templeton Emerging Markets. He is constantly on the move,
visiting and buying shares in obscure parts of the world almost before
anyone else has even realised the country has a stock market. He has been
called the Indiana Jones of the investment world, and descriptions of him
invariably include the word 'guru'. His striking appearance - small, tanned
and bald - helps make him a memorable figure. But the real test in the
investment world is the performance of your funds - and Mobius qualifies as
a force to be reckoned with on that score too.
Another home-grown personality hit the headlines last year, when his
brainchild for a time became the largest UK investment trust ever launched -
Julian Baring's Mercury World Mining trust. Baring has spent his career
analysing and investing in commodity and mining stocks, making his
reputation with his management of the Mercury Gold &amp; General unit trust.
Last year, his persuasive powers were strong enough to attract Pounds 425 to
a fund which under normal circumstances would have been lucky to go much
over Pounds 50m.
Other managers with a strong following include Anthony Bolton, who manages
Fidelity European values, and Ed Merner of Schroders, who is about to be
launched on the investment trust world with the new Schroder Japanese fund,
after making his name with unit trusts.
Like those of any other stock market sector, the ups and downs and intrigues
of the investment trust sector are monitored by analysts employed by the
large stockbroking firms. The select few who follow investment trusts at
Smith New Court, SG Warburg, NatWest and Credit Lyonnais Laing produce
regular reports and statistical analysis, intended mainly for institutional
investors, though some of their research is also available to private
investors.
SG Warburg, for example, produces an annual private investor guide with
clear explanations for the novice investor, while Credit Lyonnais Laing's
yearly manual is a very comprehensive reference work with detailed
background information on the trusts and their managers. The NatWest annual,
written by Robin Angus and Hamish Buchan, can be an entertaining read as
well as a source of useful information.

FT  04 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: English restraint in Bond St - Caroline
Charles tells Lucia van der Post about her latest shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something extraordinary is happening in Bond Street next week - a British
designer is opening a shop. Here in the street where the big international
names such as Versace and Chanel, St Laurent and Hermes have their flagship
stores British designer Caroline Charles has decided to open up for
business.
One is tempted to ask if she is entirely right in the head - this, after
all, is the street where Pierre Cardin, Etienne Aigner, Chaumet and
Birger-Christiansen came to grief. But Charles smiles serenely and says that
she is 'quite, quite sure that it is time to open in another area of London.
'We were on a roll, you see,' she tells me. 'The Beauchamp Place shop is a
success, the licences in Japan are doing well, the business has until now
been totally owned by me but I found I could borrow money from the City to
expand and when I found the shop in Bond Street that seemed the perfect
answer.'
Indeed she may be right - later in the year Calvin Klein, Donna Karan,
Joseph and several other fashion luminaries will be opening in Bond Street,
suggesting a kind of collective vote of confidence in the revival of the
street's fortunes.
Charles is a quintessentially English designer and her success, as she
acknowledges, is founded on understanding perfectly the world the
Englishwoman moves in. She understands the grand occasion clothes the season
calls for as well as the English preference for reticence and restraint. Her
clothes are, above all, ladylike.
'Anybody who has to launch a ship, sing at Bayreuth, get married or make a
public speech could be a customer of ours,' she tells me. 'We make clothes
that stand up well to public scrutiny and I am absolutely obsessed with
making sure the clothes work. I like to make the basic lines in plain
fabrics that don't get noticed too much and then they can be mixed with
embroideries and special weavings, what I call collectables. All the time I
tell the design team to check - are they warm enough if it is for
Glyndebourne, can they move their arms properly in that sleeve, will the
skirt deal with a windy day.'
She has been providing these special clothes in her own quiet way ever since
1963 when she showed her first collection in her tiny flat and both
Woollands (the chic Knightsbridge store which today is Harvey Nichols) and
Harrods decided they had to have it.
'You couldn't begin to call it a show,' she says, 'We could hardly afford a
hanger, let alone a show. I used to get my hangers from Sketchley and buy my
labels from Harrods which I would then rush back to sew in before delivering
the clothes back to Harrods.
'It was incredibly lucky timing - Mary Quant had beaten a great path and a
little group of us were able to follow. We swung along through the 1960s,
all short and sharp and then we moved into slightly hippy but very beautiful
embroidered Lebanese inspired clothes, then into gipsyish boots and
petticoats.
'We got another boost when oil brought the Arabs to London and they liked
our sequins and embroideries but it wasn't until the 1980s that I finally
got the courage to open my own shop in Beauchamp Place. It was absolute
heaven to have my own clothes hanging up as I chose.'
It was not long before she realised that many of her customers wanted a
total service.
'If you buy here,' says Charles, 'not only will we make sure the dress or
outfit fits (there are alterations experts on the premises at both shops)
but we will trim your hat, find you a pair of shoes, give you a cup-of-tea
and even find something as small as a handkerchief.'
The new shop manages to be both intimate and grand. There are the trademark
cream and black interior, spacious changing-rooms, helpful assistants and
there on the rails, the hallmarks of the Caroline Charles style - an
investment evening dress on a hanger there, a discreet navy suit that would
go from school-run to cocktail party taking in the boardroom in between.
There is lots of her favourite wool crepe ('perfect for the English
climate'), soft, floaty skirts, lean waistcoats, very plain and simple wide
trousers and a palette that is mainly cream and black, ivory and honey and
maize.
Anyone still dithering about how to dress for the occasions that make up the
English season could do worse than look at the new shop at 170 New Bond
Street, London W1.

FT  04 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: Tiny golden chimes - Lucia van der Post
listens to a Pounds 100,000 wristwatch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of horology is not one with which I am overly familiar, largely
for the extremely good reason that developing an interest in fine watches
seems like a hobby I cannot afford. I already have more than enough
expensive hobbies to keep my bank manager irritable.
But not everybody, fortunately for the (mainly) Swiss watch industry, thinks
like me. There is, it seems, a thriving clutch of collectors who are
enamoured of horology and who have the funds the hobby requires (and believe
me as funds go this is well into the polo-playing, yacht-owning class).
Indeed, so convinced is Asprey of the market for these rarified pieces that
it is next week launching what it calls a 'world first' - a Grande Sonnerie
wristwatch made by Audemars Piguet.
If you are new to these things you may be wondering exactly what a Grande
Sonnerie wristwatch is. It is a watch that strikes the hour and the quarter
every quarter hour while if set to petit sonnerie it strikes just the hour
on the hour. In addition it has a quarter repeater so that at any time the
hour and the quarter can be struck by simply pressing a button. It can also,
those who believe in sleeping quietly, will be happy to hear, be set to be
silent.
Not, of course, that these watches get worn a great deal. Most of them
reside in drawers or fancy cabinets for, as Asprey points out, 'the sort of
people who will buy this watch are bound to have several others and
certainly never wear a single model all the time.'
In this rarified world one can spend thousands and thousands of pounds on a
watch and then let it pass much of its life between velvet pads, which I
suppose, is much the same as happens to expensive jewels.
There is, however, real technical achievement behind this watch - until now
all the Grande Sonnerie features have only been found in a few
pocket-watches and it has taken four years to develop the miniaturisation of
so many complicated mechanical parts necessary to produce a wrist version.
The watch itself will sell for about Pounds 100,000, it is entirely
hand-made and, for a watch that is so vertiginously expensive, it is
surprisingly understated. A simple 18 carat yellow gold case on a leather
crocodile strap would mean it could pass almost unnoticed in all but the
most horologically sophisticated of company.
For most of us, of course, these sums are mere doodlings on a page but
Audemars Piguet does have a few more accessible treats. For instance its
offers the ultimate sturdy stainless steel sports watch, what it calls its
Royal Oak model, for just Pounds 3,000 and to celebrate the launching of the
Grande Sonnerie wristwatch it has brought some of its most original and
beautiful museum pieces to Asprey at 165-169 New Bond Street, London W1
where they can be seen and admired.
A few special pieces will be for sale and a master watchmaker from the
Audemars Piguet workshop will be showing what precision watchmaking is all
about.
The Grande Sonnerie wristwatch has to be ordered - each one takes many
months to make - and the exhibition runs from June 8 to Saturday June 18.

If you have ever longed to get hold of yukatas from Tokyo, puppets from
Bangkok, a bureau from Portugal or even just fishing rods from Nottingham
but seem unlikely to make it there in person then Richard McBrien's book The
Global Shopper is the book for you.
He starts with the boring but essential bits - how to order, what to do
about customs and VAT and cards and bank drafts, as well as looking out for
guarantees and pitfalls, all those vital bits of information that mail order
fans so often forget about when they first pick up catalogue and pen.
Then McBrien moves on to the more interesting bits for the shopaholics of
this world - where to track down the best jeans, suits from Italy,
camcorders or antiques from Hong Kong, contact lenses from California. It
contains lots of useful indices and all for Pounds 9.99.
Global Shopper, published by Headline Books, 404 pages, Pounds 9.99.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (6): Taking a chance on the
unknown - Launches in a sector seen as the domain of institutional investors
have attracted money from ordinary savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON

Specialisation has become an increasingly notable feature of the investment
trust industry.
Perhaps because there are already plenty of general funds doing a perfectly
good job, the only way that fund managers can entice investors into a new
trust is by giving some novel, possibly unique, twist to its investment
strategy.
The more cynical might describe these as gimmicks. But, to be fair, there is
often a good investment idea hidden somewhere behind the hype.
Flourishing areas recently have included Latin America and Japan, while
there have also been many single-country or narrowly-based regional funds
for previously untouched regions, including India, Israel, Taiwan and
central Europe.
Other specialisms popular at the moment are smaller companies, venture
capital and privatisations, while last year's launches included the giant
Mercury World Mining fund, as well as plenty of smaller company and emerging
markets funds.
The general rule is that the more specialist a fund is, the riskier and more
volatile it is likely to be. For example, buying shares in a single-country
fund for Indonesia would be a much bigger gamble than buying a regional Far
Eastern fund, or a global emerging markets one.
Obviously, the risk-rating of a specialist trust also depends on the
riskiness of its holdings. A venture capital fund, which invests in small
start-up companies and management buy-outs, is inherently more risky than,
say, the two European privatisation trusts, which buy shares in large
formerly state-owned companies.
As usual, the flip side to this argument is that the greater the risk, the
greater the potential reward. So the European privatisation trusts are
likely to move steadily ahead with performance comparable to general
European trusts, while a good venture capital manager in the right economic
climate could produce outstanding returns.
There is no doubt that you are more likely to find a specialist trust at the
top of the performance tables than a general one, but the specialists often
hog the bottom end of the scale as well. For example, if you had invested
Pounds 100 in the TR Property investment trust in April 1989, by April this
year your investment would have shrunk to about Pounds 76 - hardly a
sparkling performance. But if you had invested Pounds 100 in April last
year, it would have turned into about Pounds 182 a year later -
outperforming most other trusts over the same period.
Extremes like this are usually to be found only in highly specialised,
cyclical areas like smaller companies, venture capital, commodities and
single-country funds in emerging markets. Poor timing can be disastrous, but
if you judge the moment correctly, the rewards can be great.
The added risk with investment trusts launched to cash in on a fashion, as
many of them are, is that if a specialist area falls out of favour, probably
because it is underperforming, the shares of trusts in that area will become
difficult to sell. The share price may then drop to a wide discount to net
asset value, compounding the effect of poor investment returns.
Specialist trusts have traditionally been the domain of the institutional
investors, who use them as a way of sub-contracting the management of part
of their portfolios, while all but the most sophisticated private investors
have stuck to more general trusts.
However, some of the recent specialist launches have pulled in large amounts
of money from the general public. The Fleming Chinese trust, launched last
year, was extremely popular with private investors, who had been reading
about the booming Chinese economy. It was heavily over-subscribed - Pounds
15m worth of shares were available through a public offer, but applications
were received for Pounds 40m.
Some sections of the industry are, no doubt, delighted by this extra source
of demand, but it is causing concern to others, who worry that people are
buying inappropriate investments without taking advice about the
implications.
Legal restrictions mean that new issues can be advertised much more freely
than existing trusts. So new issues tend to grab all the attention, while
longstanding general trusts cannot advertise their attractions except
indirectly by promoting Peps or savings schemes.
Fund managers are always alarmed when they discover that, among their
investors, are elderly people who have put a substantial chunk of their
savings into an emerging markets trust, with all the rest in a building
society. This is not a good spread of risk. All the industry can do is
plaster health warnings across application forms, but often these seem only
to whet the appetite further.
Most financial advisers emphasise that, unless you are very sure of your
investment nose and can afford to lose the money you are investing, highly
specialised trusts should form no more than 5 or 10 per cent of your
portfolio.
But there will always be people who see investment as an entertaining and
occasionally profitable hobby, akin to doing the pools. They tend to put a
little money into whichever exotic fund is being promoted each month, and
will follow its progress with interest. The good news for that breed of
investor is that the supply of exciting new specialist funds shows no sign
of drying up in the foreseeable future.

The best selling personal finance package these days is Quicken from the US
company Intuit. On June 1, Intuit released QuickBooks 2.0 for Windows with
which they hope to achieve similar domination in the small business market.
QuickBooks costs Pounds 149.95 (or Pounds 157.62 inc VAT) from Intuit,
including postage and packing. As with all Intuit products, telephone
support is free in perpetuity.
QuickBooks will print sales invoices and cheques. It will handle bills from
suppliers, cheque payments and cheque receipts. Quicken can do all this too,
but only when the volume of transactions is small. Intuit suggest that if
you run your business and personal affairs from the one bank account, basic
Quicken will suit. However, if you need to run a separate bank account for
business use, you should be thinking of QuickBooks.
Quicken already has a legion of followers who delight in its ease of use and
slick interface. QuickBooks is even better; a superb underlying design which
is overlaid with numerous ingenious touches. This is state of the art
software of the highest standard and represents terrific value. QuickBooks
joins two other packages which have appeared in the last two years, Mind
Your Own Business from Soft Numbers and Exchequer from SBS, which belong to
a new generation of accounting software.
Traditional accounts packages work on a 'summarise and carry forward' basis:
once a transaction has been entered on to the computer its original details
are lost. By contrast, these new packages retain all transactions in full
detail and from anywhere in the program a couple of keystrokes or mouse
clicks can display any invoice or payment exactly as it was entered.
Packages like QuickBooks 'unlock the door of your filing cabinet', giving
you instant access to all your files and limitless management information.
QuickBooks contains over 50 standard reports covering profit and loss
statement, balance sheet, VAT analysis, aged debtor and aged creditor
reports, sales analysis by customer, by item or by rep. You can customise
each of them with a report-writer which I can only describe as fabulous -
then use the Quickzoom feature to drill down from any report total to
display the underlying transactions in full detail . . .
QuickBooks is full of nice touches to make life easy for the user. For
example, to amend the date just tap the + or - key to the right of the
keyboard. It also analyses data 'proactively'. So, by looking at the payment
due dates on your invoices it generates a 'Reminder' list of payments due as
well as a cashflow forecast. Both these ideas are excellent, but
unfortunately nullified by Intuit's assumption that if an invoice is on
payment terms of '30 Days' this means it actually comes due for payment in
30 days.
Nonetheless I like this product very much. What sort of business is it
suitable for? For the service company or the company that does jobs and
recharges costs to customer QuickBooks is excellent.
For the business that buys things and resells them, it is less good. It
holds a selling price but not a cost price for each stock item. Therefore,
it can neither work out profit margins nor maintain an accurate cost of
sales figure within the Profit and Loss account. MYOB has these features and
more, and for the company that buys and sells things is well worth the extra
money (Pounds 195 from Soft Numbers, 0992-451551).
Intuit say that QuickBooks is 'designed for time-pressured business people,
not trained bookkeepers. Being a Windows product, data entry is awkward and
slippery compared with DOS. QuickBooks is therefore ideal for the
owner-manager of a service or jobbing company who is already a keen user of
products such as Excel or Ami Pro.
Finally, a caution, in 20 minutes an ill-disposed person could change
without trace every clients' name on every document stored in Quickbooks. I
am surprised that the Institute of Chartered Accountants has approved this
package. The auditing profession must consider how far accounts packages
such as QuickBooks should allow you to rewrite the past.
QuickBooks 2.0 FOR WINDOWS, Pounds 149.95 inc VAT and UK delivery from
Intuit, tel: 0800-585 058 or 081-990 5500

FT  04 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A life of highs and lows - Mike
Evans records Welsh choirs. Clive Fewins visits Evans in his idyllic base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deer roaming in the parkland surrounding his office in a Welsh mansion make
a curious contrast with the sight of his Pounds 200,000 mobile recording
studio parked nearby as Mike Evans ponders on three of the most turbulent
years in the 15 year history of his Welsh-based recording business.
For the past 10 he has specialised in recording Welsh choirs and issued
several hundred releases. In 1989 he spent Pounds 100,000 upgrading his
mobile studio to cater for the increasing amount of subcontracted sound
recording work he was doing for television companies.
At the same time he moved the two-man company from Swansea to its present
home: the National Trust-owned 17th century Dinefwr House, set in 450 acres
presided over by a medieval ruined castle, perched on the edge of the Towy
valley above the town of Llandeilo in west Wales.
The move coincided with a downturn in the subcontract work. 'With
recession-led cutbacks location productions were the first to be hit. No
sooner had my expansion plans begun to bear fruit when the subcontract work
came to a juddering halt,' said Evans, the sole director of Black Mountain
Records.
Fortunately Evans had a good track record. With the aid of some first-rate
freelance technical staff he had recorded Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Dennis
O'Neill and the now 'retired' boy soprano Aled Jones, at locations as
diverse as the Royal Albert Hall, Glyndebourne and opera houses in Italy. He
also had a steady turnover and a Pounds 200,000 overdraft facility.
What could have been a very shaky period turned out to be no more than a
blip. But when he diversified again, in late 1992, with a tie-up with the
world's largest mobile facility company - Fleetwood Mobiles - the
arrangement came to nothing when Fleetwood went into voluntary liquidation.
Evans ended up with the Fleetwood name, a mobile studio, complete with
Pounds 60,000 advanced mixing desk, sports the Fleetwood livery.
'Perhaps the main lesson I learnt is that you should take great care before
expanding in too many other directions when you have a good core business,'
said Evans, 43. 'It really is a case of the old adage: 80 per cent of your
business will come from 20 per cent of your customers.'
In the case of the choirs this certainly proved true. 'With the recession
and most choirs representing a cross-section of their communities one might
have expected them to be among the first organisations to be affected by the
adverse conditions, especially in former pit villages,' Evans said.
'However the opposite has been the case and we have just enjoyed our busiest
year yet, with a turnover of Pounds 200,000.'
He attributes this to good groundwork in the early years, plus the skill of
former BBC enginer Geoff Atkins, a freelance available whenever Black
Mountain needs him for an important recording.
'From the outset I knew that gaining a reputation with the 500 or so choirs
in Wales would take a long time,' He said. 'Recording used to be regarded
with very mixed feelings by choirs, mainly through bad experiences and
advice. I like to think Black Mountain has pioneered a fresh approach to the
art of choral recording that has won us many converts over the years.
'Initially I had to offer every possible incentive to gain clients - even to
offering six months settlement terms on unsold stock, which used to give my
bank manager palpitations. On average, the return in those early days was
only about 5 per cent after tax. Nowadays I expect a typical deal to involve
about 1,000 cassettes or CDs, with the choir agreeing to sell a minimum of
500. The standard price is Pounds 5.99. I look for a return of around 20 per
cent after tax. We are expecting to turn over Pounds 250,000 this year.
'The choral world in Wales is like one big club,' Evans said. 'Choirs are
probably the last bastions of community spirit in most areas. People sing
for enjoyment and their camaraderie is overwhelming. Black Mountain Records
is an extension of that tradition, and great fun to run.
'Although there is some concern over the future of the choral tradition in
Wales, as long as the communities are there I believe the choirs are an
integral part of them and will stand the test of time.'
Evans is steering the Black Mountain road train towards England. 'I have
taken the truck to Scandinavia and Italy, so why not England - or for that
matter, the rest of the UK?' he said. 'There are more than 2,700 choirs in
mainland Britain so we only at present service 20 per cent of the market.'
Last month Evans completed repayments of a Pounds 40,000, 8 per cent loan
from the Welsh Development Agency. He took the loan in 1989 for vehicle
refurbishment. The balance of Pounds 60,000 was met by his bankers, Lloyds,
and has already been repaid. By late May he should be the owner of a company
worth around Pounds 500,000 with no debts and only one full-time employee -
assistant Lee Lewis.
'It will be a nice position to be in after working in a financial
straitjacket for the past three years,' Evans said.
'With an increasing number of bookings in England and the TV work starting
to gain momentum again things are looking good.'
Evans and his landlords, The National Trust in Wales, plan to turn Dinefwr
park into a centre for music, staging a variety of summer open air musical
events.
'Wales is the land of song, yet the range of music offered to summer
tourists has been very limited. We intend to do somethig to try to overcome
this,' he said.
'Llandeilo is an ideal location for this. It is close to the M4 and on the
A40 - the main artery for tourists from the Midlands to Pembrokeshire. I am
not only looking forward to recording more choirs, but also towards helping
promote the Welsh musical tradition to visitors.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (5): Verdict awaited on the
high-yielders - Their long-term performance has yet to be assessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There are two ways of getting an income from investment trusts. You can buy
trusts, or particular types of trust securities, specifically designed to
provide an above-average yield; or you can buy trusts aiming to produce an
above-average total return, and periodically sell some shares to provide an
income.
If you prefer the total-return method, (resoundingly endorsed by at least
one guru, Robin Angus, of NatWest Securities), turn to our article on
investing for growth on page 15.
Now, a brief explanation of the different types of income specialist. First,
trusts which invest in shares with an above-average yield and pass this on
to the investor; second, trusts in which the capital is structured in a way
that gives an unusually high yield to holders of certain types of security.
Income Growth trusts and High Income trusts
Both invest in shares with an above-average yield, which they aim to pass on
to the investor. The difference in the objectives of the two types may seem
slight, but is important.
Income growth trusts do not offer such a high immediate yield, but aim to
increase your income steadily in future. The vast majority (at least 80 per
cent) of their holdings are in UK shares, rather than convertibles or other
securities which may offer a high immediate income at the expense of capital
growth.
Some trusts are more prepared to go overseas than others, and it is worth
checking this if you are worried about overseas exposure. If you are
comfortable with overseas investment, another group of trusts, International
Income Growth funds, do not have geographic restrictions - though in
practice most of them have the majority of their portfolio in the UK.
A fairly typical investment strategy is to scour out-of-favour sectors for
shares the managers reckon are unfairly neglected, and have a
correspondingly high yield. The managers then sell when the share price has
risen sufficiently to bring the yield in line with the market average.
This strategy ran into some problems when the economy was deep in recession
and many companies were cutting their dividends. It has been working better
now the economy is coming out of recession, because companies are finding it
easier to maintain imperilled dividends, and their share prices have
benefited accordingly. But it will be harder to find neglected shares now
that the market is relatively high.
High Income trusts are distinguished both by their yield and by the means by
which they achieve it. They aim to provide a yield at least a quarter higher
than the FT-SE-A All-Share Index, and keep at least 80 per cent of their
assets in UK shares and convertibles.
At the moment, for example, high income funds have an average yield of 6.4
per cent, compared with 4.4 per cent for UK Income Growth trusts, 3.9 per
cent for the FT-SE 100 index., and 3.7 per cent for the FT-SE-A All Share.
Convertibles, a cross between a fixed-interest security and an ordinary
share, help the overall portfolio yield, and also produce a good capital
performance in rising markets. But they do not generally do well in falling
or static markets.
Other strategies to boost yield vary, from gearing up with RPI-linked
debentures (which provide a cheap source of borrowing at the moment) to
investing in the income shares of split-capital trusts. The point to
remember is that there is almost always a capital cost to this type of
strategy. Income shares of split-capital trusts, for instance, are in many
cases bound to produce large capital losses at some future point, though
clever trading can mean that the loss is passed on to the next investor. But
few of the high-income specialists have been in existence long enough to get
a realistic idea of their long-term performance.
Split-capital trusts
These are trusts which achieve a high yield for some shareholders, mainly
through their capital structure rather than their choice of investments.
When split-capital trusts were first invented, in the 1960s, they were
relatively simple. All the trusts had a pre-set date for winding up - like
the redemption date of a gilt.
One class of share got all the income and was repaid at a pre-determined
level, usually the issue price when the trusts were wound up. The other
class got all the capital gains. These 'old fashioned income shares' still
exist. But the recent fashion for splits has introduced more complex ways of
dividing the total cake.
It is important to distinguish between the different types of income share,
and between the differing entitlements of individual securities. But,
irritatingly, even the investment trust industry does not have a common way
of classifying or describing them.
Income shares normally have a guaranteed repayment value, but this may
increase, decrease or fluctuate over the life of the trust. Very broadly,
they can be divided into those which can be expected to provide a worthwhile
capital repayment when the trust is wound up, and those which will have only
a token value (perhaps 1p) often called 'annuity shares'.
Points to consider when looking at income shares with worthwhile capital
claims are: what the repayment rights are, how many other classes of capital
rank for repayment before the income shares, how the (probable) repayment
price relates to the current stockmarket price, and how long the trust has
left to run.
Points to consider when looking at 'annuity' income shares are: what the
probable level of income will be, how long the trust has left to run, and
what your capital loss will be.
If there are several years left before redemption, the market price of both
types of income share may be considerably higher than the redemption price,
but the redemption price will exercise an increasingly powerful attraction
as redemption looms. Treat an unusually high dividend yield as a warning
sign that further inquiry is necessary. Such shares move in a parabola,
dragged up by the high income in their early years and pulled down by their
redemption price in later years; and the longer the fall is delayed, the
steeper it will be, particularly with an annuity share.
What are disarmingly called Ordinary Income shares can be even more
treacherous, since there are no repayment guarantees. They get a good
income, though there have been some dividend cuts, but investors will only
get any money back once other types of shareholder have been paid off.
They are frequently part of a trust whose other component is zero dividend
preference shares. (The zeros, which are issued at a discount, get no income
but are entitled to a set amount of the capital on winding up.)
Thus the Ordinary Income shares' secondary role is as a highly geared
capital play: if things go wrong, they get nothing; if the trust prospers,
they could produce big capital gains as well as providing a good income
throughout. One helpful description of them is that they are annuities with
warrants attached.
Experience to date is that the overall performance of most split-level
trusts is inferior to that of trusts which do not have to target an unduly
high portfolio yield. What is not yet clear is who will bear the real cost
of that poor performance, investors in the capital shares or investors in
the income shares. Some observers reckon that income investors have the whip
hand, in that their need for a high income is immediate and obvious, and
that it will be investors with unspecified claims on the capital on winding
up who suffer. If they are right, the knowledgeable, skilful and lucky
investor in the various types of income share could do well.
How does the private investor make use of all these different types of
share? Many advisers suggest that it makes sense to put income shares in a
personal equity plan, since that magnifies the yield benefit. But personal
circumstances will dictate what type of share you put into your Pep. An
annuity-type share might, for example, be suitable for a very elderly person
who wants the income for a limited period.
Many people will be rightly reluctant to tackle the complexities of splits
without expert professional advice. And it is worth considering a couple of
funds from Exeter Fund Managers: both the Dartmoor Investment Trust and the
High Income unit trust invest mainly in the shares of split level trusts -
though there are, of course, management charges.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and the Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE PARRY-WINGFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue's promised revision of its concession on assets of
negligible value in relation to capital gains tax was published this week*,
writes Maurice Parry-Wingfield, of accountant Touche Ross.
The purpose of making a claim for negligible value is normally to
crystallise (for CGT purposes) a loss which may then be set against
liability on other gains.
The concession allows the taxpayer some flexibility in choosing the most
useful tax year in which to make the claim - but with the caveat that the
choice should not allow him to get more indexation allowance than the Pounds
10,000 transitional relief announced in April.
A negligible value claim made after November 29 1993 (Budget day) might
still be backdated to an earlier time when the asset had a negligible value.
But the indexation allowance up to the date of that deemed disposal can be
relieved - up to the aggregate of the Pounds 10,000 transitional relief
announced previously - only in 1993/94 and 1994/95.
In order to take advantage of the transitional relief, the negligible value
claim must be made by April 5 1995. Whether it should be backdated, so as to
give rise to an earlier deemed disposal, will depend upon the individual's
mix of gains and losses on other assets, losses brought forward, and annual
exemption.
The table provides an example of an asset that became of negligible value on
June 1 1993 and for which a negligible value claim is submitted on April 1
1995. In this case, the claim should not be backdated because a year's
annual exemption would be forfeited - and the indexation reduced.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Boost for bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regular readers of the Highest Rates table may have noticed the interest on
guaranteed income bonds creeping up over the past few months, particularly
on longer-term investments, writes Bethan Hutton.
Three months ago, the best rate for a five-year guaranteed income bond was
5.7 per cent net. Two months ago, it was 6.5 per cent, one month ago 6.9 per
cent. Now, it has reached 7.45 per cent. Generally, rates are slightly lower
for monthly income.
Anyone who invested in March will now be regretting it as guaranteed income
bonds are fixed-rate, fixed-term investments. The question for anyone
considering investing now is whether to hang on for a while in case the
trend continues, or to lock in to the present rates in case they fall.
Economists have been predicting base rate rises later this year, but fixed
investment rates may have risen already to take this into account. Variable
rates could still have further to go, however.
Chase de Vere's Moneyline says many investors are hedging their bets by
dividing their savings between fixed and variable rate accounts until the
situation becomes clearer.
Many building societies are offering escalator bonds or stepped interest
accounts, which start by paying a relatively modest interest rate in the
first year and rise by a fixed amount each year for five years.
These may appear to offer the best of both worlds in the form of fixed,
increasing rates. But, in fact, if interest rates do rise over the five
years, the pre-set increases may not be as high as the general increases in
variable rates. Also, penalties for early withdrawal tend to be stiff on
these accounts - if this is even possible.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With returns increasing by up to 15 per cent over the past few months, the
annuity has bounced back from a 20-year low.
Indeed, it has now reached a level where it can now provide a guaranteed
income for life at rates often surpassing other regular products.
Moreover, further increases this week mean those receiving annuity income
can at last look ahead to the prospect of even more positive growth as the
year goes on.
Inflation fears over the past few days saw the gross redemption yield on the
15-year gilt move to 9.07 at close of business on Tuesday.
This was a rise of 36.8 per cent compared with four months ago: on January
20, the rate was 6.63 per cent.
Just how quickly the market has risen can be seen from the rates available
to a 60-year-old male using a Pounds 100,000 personal pension fund to buy an
annuity which is paid monthly in advance, with a five-year guarantee period.
If he had retired on January 20 1994, the Prudential Assurance Co. would
have paid him Pounds 8,929.08.
The same fund and the same type of annuity from the Prudential would now
bring him Pounds 10,244.88 a year had he purchased it on June 1. This
corresponds to an increase of 14.7 per cent.
Other life companies also have shifted their rates upwards to reflect the
market surge (as shown in the table above).
One such is Scottish Widows, which has upped the rates offered to the same
man buying the same annuity by 14.5 per cent over the same period, paying
Pounds 10,180.08 a year as at June 1 compared with Pounds 8,890.08 on
January 20.

1. Shares bought outside Britain and later sold there.
2. Shares bought in the UK and later sold there.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Personal allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughter is a British subject, resident in the US since about 1987. She
has very little income there but Pounds 8,000 a year gross income in the UK
 -mostly income from rents - on which she pays UK income tax.
On two occasions, I have asked the inspector of taxes if she could claim
personal allowances. He replied that, as she was resident outside the UK,
she did not qualify for UK personal reliefs.
Some months ago, however, Barry Stillerman wrote in answer to a reader's
letter that 'British citizens, no matter where they live . . . are entitled
to their annual personal allowance for income tax'. Have I misunderstood his
reply or is my daughter's inspector wrong?
Under section 256 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA 1988),
any individual who both makes a claim to personal allowances and who
satisfies certain conditions is entitled to UK personal allowances.
Under section 278 ICTA 1988, personal allowances are limited to individuals
who are resident in the UK unless that individual can satisfy the board of
the Inland Revenue that they are a Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the
Republic of Ireland, or fall within other limited categories.
In addition, personal allowances sometimes are available to citizens of
other countries under the terms of a double tax treaty.
Assuming your daughter is still a British citizen, I suggest that she
completes form FS122 and forwards it to her inspector of taxes quoting the
provisions of section 278 ICTA 1988. (Answer by Barry Stillerman).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On going through my investments, I find I am the holder of 300 'non-voting A
convertible shares' in Magnet Group plc. These were issued in July 1989 and
I think were related to the management buy-out that occurred at that time.
Are they worth anything or should I consign them to the dustbin?
Our investigation shows that Magnet Group changed its name to Airedale but
that these shares are now worthless and, therefore, available to you only as
a loss to offset against gains elsewhere. (Answer by Murray Johnstone
Personal Asset Management).

FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Shares in Guernsey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Guernsey resident, non-domiciled for UK tax purposes, has a portfolio of
UK company shares registered in a Guernsey nominee company. Does this afford
any protection against liability to UK inheritance tax? Is the ultimate
protection to have them owned by an offshore company or trust?
Assuming the shares are registered on a UK register, a liability to UK
inheritance tax arises since the determining factor is the beneficial and
not the legal ownership.
Even if assets remain liable to IHT, there is a Pounds 150,000 nil rate band
which is available to UK and non-UK domiciled individuals alike; therefore,
any transfers of up to this amount will not suffer a UK inheritance tax
charge.
If the value exceeds this figure, you might wish to consider transferring
the beneficial ownership of the shares to an offshore company. (Answer by
Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward).

FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Why equalisation needs indexing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have read with interest the recent articles on capital gains tax in the
Weekend FT. In the case of unit trusts, it is stated that equalisation
should be regarded as a repayment of capital.
But as this repayment does not occur until up to six months after the
initial investment, at the time of the first dividend, presumably the
equalisation itself needs indexing from the time of repayment and not from
the time of the initial investment?
Yes, you are right. By virtue of section 99 of the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992, units in an authorised unit trust are treated as if they
were shares in a UK company.
Consequently, equalisation payments are treated as if they were capital
distributions in respect of shares, and the receipt of an equalisation
payment is deemed to be the occasion of a part disposal of the units, by
virtue of section 122(1) of the Act.
As the equalisation payment will, in practice, always be 'small, as compared
with the value of the (units) in respect of which it is distributed',
however, section 122(2) authorises the unit-holder's tax inspector to direct
that '(a) the occasion of the capital distribution shall not be treated for
the purposes of this act as a disposal of the asset, and (b) the amount
distributed shall be deducted from any expenditure allowable under this act
as a deduction in computing a gain or loss on the disposal of the (units) by
the person receiving or becoming entitled to receive the distribution of
capital'.
If, by chance, your tax inspector declines to give a direction under section
122(2) in respect of any particular equalisation payment, then section
122(3) gives you the right to 'appeal to the commissioners having
jurisdiction on an appeal against an assessment to tax in respect of a gain
accruing on the disposal'.
For equalisation payments made before April 6 1985, there are complex
indexation rules (re-enacted in section 57 of the 1992 act (Receipts which
are not treated as disposals but affect relevant allowable expenditure)),
which are quite different from those for later payments.
For current payments (and those made in 1985-86 onwards), section 110(8)(d)
simply says: 'Whenever an operative event occurs . . . if the operative
event results in a reduction in the qualifying expenditure but is not a
disposal, the same reduction shall be made to the indexed pool of
expenditure.'
We shall be happy to explain the oddities of section 57 and its predecessor,
if need be - but we hesitate to burden you with a reply even longer than
this one is already.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (4): Basic-rate taxpayers,
beware - Unlike many unit trusts, investment trusts may impose an extra
charge for personal equity plans. Scheherazade Daneshkhu recommends caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
If a product is labelled tax-free, it is bound to arouse the interest of
private investors. This is one reason why personal equity plans have proved
a popular way for private investors to hold investment trust shares against
a background of low interest rates.
Some Pounds 300m flowed into investment trusts through Peps in the 1993-94
financial year, representing an increase of 42 per cent over the previous
year, according to the Association of Investment Trust Companies. The choice
is more limited than for unit trusts, but is nonetheless wide with 33
investment trust management companies offering 93 Peps.
Current rules allow investors to hold up to Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep
(and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep, though investment
trusts cannot be included in these). All income and capital gains are free
of tax, but the plan has to be administered by a manager who will usually
make a charge. In general, lower-rate taxpayers may find Peps a waste of
money unless they intend to invest a lot over a long period, when
substantial capital gains, exceeding the current annual exemption of Pounds
5,800, may be made.
Along with their unit-trust brethren, investment trusts have been enjoying
the benefits of the government's decision in 1992 to raise the annual limit
on unit and investment trust Pep holdings from Pounds 3,000 to the full
Pounds 6,000 general plan allowance. However, many are still restricted by
the Pounds 1,500 Pep limit on 'non-qualifying' funds - that is, those trusts
which do not have at least 50 per cent in Europe (including the UK). Given
that so many investment trusts have their roots abroad, as many of their
names (Scottish American, Foreign &amp; Colonial, Anglo &amp; Overseas) testify,
this can be offputting for investors.
Foreign &amp; Colonial, the world's largest investment trust is non-qualifying,
and therefore eligible only for an annual maximum Pep investment of Pounds
1,500; but it decided in October 1992 to launch a qualifying trust, the Pep
Investment Trust (Pepit) rather than tinker with the international trust.
Pepit only has a one-year record, which showed growth of 20 per cent in the
year to April 1, lower than the average return over the same period of 27.8
per cent in the UK general sector (Source: HSW, net income reinvested).
Almost all investment trust Peps restrict choice between the manager's
trusts; but Alliance Trust, which is non-qualifying, allows investors, at no
extra charge, to top up the Pounds 1,500 maximum in its trust with shares
from a large number of other investment trusts. This Pep has no initial or
annual charge, and dealing costs are much lower than the industry standard
at 0.15 per cent.
Unlike unit trusts, investment trusts tend to impose an additional charge
for Peps, because plans cost money to administer, and standard trust fees
are relatively low by comparison with unit trusts. Although consistently
good performance should always been the main determinant of an investor's
choice, charges are an important consideration and competition has been
driving down prices.
Some companies are offering to run a Pep for nothing, and do not even charge
dealing fees, although there may be a transfer charge. According to the
AITC, these include Finsbury Asset Management, Henderson Touche Remnant
Smaller Companies and Personal Assets which is administered by Ivory &amp; Sime.
If your choice of investment trust does not have competitive Pep charges, it
is always possible to take a self-select Pep administered by a stockbroker
offering low charges and fill it with investment trust shares.
Many investment trusts come with warrants attached to them, which give the
investor the option of buying more shares at a fixed price in the future.
Since warrants are not shares, they cannot usually be included in a Pep, but
an exception is made for warrants that form part of a new investment trust
issue as long as they are packaged with an ordinary share and the package is
transferred within 42 days into the Pep.
Finally, if attending shareholder meetings is important to you, it is worth
asking the investment trust whether you will be able to do so through the
Pep investment, and/or whether you will be charged for attending.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (3): Simpler - and yet more
complicated - The different types of trust and share available to private
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment trust industry's campaign to sell its wares to private
investors has had one ironic consequence: investment trust shares are
considerably harder for even professional investors to understand than they
were a few years ago.
For, while the industry has simplified with one hand, it has complicated
with the other. It has simplified by making it easier for private investors
to buy shares in traditional broadly-based trusts, notably through savings
schemes. But it has added fresh complications: first, by introducing a range
of specialist trusts, notably 'split-capital' trusts; and second, by
introducing 'warrants' for many trusts of all types.
Split-capital trusts embrace packages of different securities, designed to
cater for various specific investment needs, and are difficult for the
private investor to understand let alone assess. They are the investment
trust industry's answer to the array of packaged products on offer from
insurance companies and unit trust groups, and are designed mainly to appeal
to investment advisers.
Warrants, which give investors the right to buy investment trust shares at a
given price in the future for a given period of time, became fashionable as
a sop to buyers of new issues. They acquire value rapidly if the underlying
shares do well.
Both split-level trusts and warrants can be be perfectly efficient
instruments - in knowledgeable hands. But they do rather muddy the water
when private investors are searching for old-fashioned trusts to buy
themselves. Around 50 of the 260-odd investment trusts are split-capital
ones, and they have between two and five different types of security each:
over 100 different quoted shares. And there are also over 100 quoted
warrants attached to traditional trusts. So the private investor now has to
pick his way through well over 400 different securities when looking for an
investment trust to buy. That's nearly as daunting as trying to choose
between the 1,500 or so unit trusts on offer.
But it's not impossible. This is what you need to do:
Clarify your investment objectives;
Understand which types of trust and which types of security should help you
achieve those objectives;
Decide whether you are going to make your own selection or rely on advice
from a financial adviser; and
Make your choice - or weigh up your adviser's recommendations.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies* divides its members into
different categories, to make it easier to find the type of trust you want.
Investment objectives
First, do you want capital growth or income, or a mixture? If you want a
mixture, you should probably stick to ordinary shares in one of the
old-fashioned general trusts. These have shares in a number of companies in
a number of different countries.
If you want most of your money to remain in British companies, you may find
it easiest to stick to UK general trusts. But many of the international
general trusts have around half their portfolio in British companies. So if
you are prepared to do a bit of digging, you can enjoy a much wider choice.
But some of the trusts in these categories are rather more specialised than
you might expect. So always check what the trust actually does, not just its
category.
Stepped preference shares, which provide regular pre-set increases in both
income and capital are worth considering for investors who do not need to
squeeze the last ounce of income out of their holdings.
Growth
If you want capital growth, you have two main choices. You can look at
trusts in the UK and international growth sectors, or ones concentrating on
particular geographic areas, such as America, Japan or the currently
fashionable emerging markets. As we explain elsewhere in this guide, some of
these are much riskier than others. But it is perfectly possible for an
intelligent layman to concoct a short-list of possibilities, look at their
objectives, their long-term performance, and technical factors (such as
'gearing' and the discount) and make his own mind up.
The alternative route, buying some of the shares of split-capital trusts,
can be dangerous without expert advice. Possibilities are capital shares,
zero-dividend preference shares, and stepped preference shares. Very
broadly, stepped preference shares are the most predictable; zeros promise a
known return provided you hold them to redemption; capital shares are a high
risk/high return instrument whose attractions can vary dramatically over a
relatively short period of time.
Two other possibilities for capital growth are warrants and index funds, and
index-linked loan stocks. They are at opposite end of the risk spectrum.
Index funds work much like an indexed unit trust. Index-linked loan stocks
are an interesting alternative, which guarantee precisely to match a given
stockmarket index when they are repaid, and pay the same interest meanwhile
 -but the market price can fluctuate in the interim
Warrants are another high risk/high return choice. If the price at which the
warrant entitles you to buy the underlying share is below the market price
of that share, it has a fairly obvious intrinsic value, which will rise (and
fall) more sharply than the underlying share. Those with several years
before expiry also have a more uncertain additional 'time' value. But a
warrant which gives you the right to buy the underlying share at more than
its current price and is near to its expiry date is valueless. Warrants are
essentially speculative - ie, they can give an interesting fillip to a
growth portfolio, but should never form the bulk of it.
Income
Investors interested primarily in income again have a number of different
routes open to them. If you plan to make your own decisions, consider either
investing in income trusts or buying a growth trust and periodically selling
some of the shares in order to produce an income. (Discretion is obviously
necessary here).
Split-capital trusts have two types of share designed to produce a high
income - income shares and ordinary income shares. But their prospects of
capital growth, or even maintenance, are varied: some return none of your
capital and the return on others is unpredictable.
Tax considerations will influence your choice. Zeros, for example, are
useful for people who want to turn income into capital, certain types of
income share (known as annuity shares) do the reverse. Unless you are
prepared to work hard to understand the subject, you are probably safer
getting professional advice if buying any of the shares of split-level
trusts.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: A saver for travellers - Annual
insurance policies can offer good value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you throw away automatically all the glossy leaflets that fall out of the
envelope with your bank and credit card statements each month, for once you
could actually miss something useful. Your bank, building society or card
issuer might have been touting an annual travel insurance policy which could
save you time and money.
With single-trip insurance, a couple spending a week skiing and a two-week
summer holiday in Europe each year would be lucky to spend less than Pounds
100 to cover both.
Once children, weekend breaks, business trips and holidays outside Europe
enter the picture, the attractions of an all-inclusive family policy for as
little as Pounds 109 become clear.
Annual policies usually provide cover for an unlimited number of overseas
trips and their convenience and cost-effectiveness have been strong factors
in their growing appeal. But another reason could be the increasingly common
habit of taking more frequent holidays abroad, particularly short breaks.
Most of the clearing banks and large building societies now have own-brand
policies, as do several specialist travel insurers, American Express, the
travel club Wexas, and health insurer BUPA. Insurance broker Towry Law is
the latest to join the crowd.
A lucky few consumers may have annual travel insurance already. Some gold
cards include it in their high annual fee while Clinicare has travel
insurance as part of its private medical cover.
Recent policy launches are showing a tendency towards greater
sophistication, not to mention complication.
You can now opt for budget, standard or deluxe cover; reduce premiums by
going for a high excess or ruling out trips to North America; opt out of
baggage cover; choose higher or lower cancellation limits, and so on. Some
policies even offer overseas motor breakdown insurance as an optional extra.
The numerous quirks and options available mean that it is well worth
shopping around to find the most appropriate deal for your own
circumstances. Unfortunately, some of the better-value schemes have limited
availability.
Midland's policy is available only to its credit card-holders and a more or
less identical policy is available only to First Direct customers.
With some of the cheaper policies, watch out for an overall limit on the
amount of time you spend abroad each year. If there is one, it is usually
100 days or more.
This should not create any difficulty for the average working person but
could be a problem if, say, you have a house in France or Spain and spend a
lot of time there.
All the policies have time limits per trip (to stop them being used by
expatriates returning to the UK once or twice a year); these range from one
to three months.
Should your home contents policy already cover your luggage and personal
possessions, insurers such as Bradford &amp; Bingley, National &amp; Provincial,
Lloyds Bank, Towry Law and Frizzell offer premiums 15 to 20 per cent lower
if you opt out of baggage cover.
Skiers should be aware that some policies exclude winter sports, although
most cover up to 17 days' skiing a year automatically while the Midland and
First Direct policies set no limit on skiing holidays. Devotees of other
sports should ask specifically if they are covered.
Likewise, business travellers should check that their chosen policy also is
valid for business travel.
The Halifax, for example, excludes business travel altogether while the
Bradford &amp; Bingley charges an extra Pounds 24.50 to extend the policy for
unlimited business trips.
Older travellers may have difficulty finding an annual policy as many
insurers impose an age limit for annual cover of 60 or 65. Indeed, some
refuse customers older than this, and others charge substantially more.
Towry Law has an age limit of 71 for its standard rates while Bradford &amp;
Bingley charges Pounds 130 for over-65s.
Some insurers let you choose if you want a partner and children to be able
to travel separately from the main person insured. The Crispin Speers family
premium quoted in the table covers a spouse and up to three children for
travel with or without the first person insured, but Pounds 25 less buys
cover if they only ever travel as a family group.
It is always worth reading the small print, preferably before you sign up
for the policy - although it can be surprisingly difficult to get hold of
full policy details before you make up your mind.
A keen-eyed reader could discover, for instance, that Columbus will not
cover cancellation costs if you lose your job - but will cover delays due to
acts of terrorism.
In general, areas to check particularly carefully include excesses, limits
on individual items and money, and overall limits for cancellation costs.
Also, you should let the insurer know if you have any medical problems;
otherwise, you could find it will refuse to pay up if you become ill on
holiday.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pensions with a hidden twist - Group
plans that may not be what they seem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you sign up for a company pension scheme, it is tempting to assume that
the employer will see you right. But under a group personal pension (GPP) -
now the fastest-growing company pension arrangement - the employer does not
have to take any responsibility whatever. Nor does he have to pay a penny.
Since 1988, when GPPs first became available, life offices have marketed
them as the cheapest alternative to traditional pension schemes. Certainly,
a well-funded GPP can provide excellent benefits. At their most basic,
however, these group plans offer a subsistence-level pension based on a
rebate of National Insurance contributions.
Moreover, GPPs claim to offer flexibility and portability to younger
employees who are likely to change jobs. What providers often fail to point
out is that a typical regular contribution contract is completely
inflexible, while portability is available only at a price.
A GPP actually is a collection of individual 'money purchase' personal
pensions selected by an employer. Unlike traditional final-salary schemes,
which link the value of the pension to the employee's salary at retirement,
the investment risk rests with the employee under a GPP.
Contributions are invested to provide an individual pot of money at
retirement; this is used to buy an annuity. The level of annuity income
depends on investment returns and the provider's charges, among other
factors.
The main point to remember with a GPP is that although the employer selects
the plan, the onus lies with the employee to decide whether it is a suitable
investment. Clearly, then, it is important to find out what benefits you are
likely to get and whether you need to boost your contributions to provide a
better pension.
The following questions apply to most group money purchase arrangements, not
just GPPs.
How was the provider selected?
The employer should receive advice on a fee basis from an independent
consultant, rather than from a commission-based salesman or adviser. This
ensures that the selection is free from bias, and that competitive plans are
considered from low commission and non-commission-paying providers. It means
also that the employer has paid for the cost of advice. If he does not pay,
the provider will deduct these costs from your early premiums.
What are the provider's credentials?
If the adviser has done a thorough job, he will have checked the provider's
financial strength, administration facilities, investment options and past
performance. Information on performance should come from an independent
source, either the adviser's own research or from independent surveys such
as those published in such FT group magazines as Pensions Management and
Money Management.
Several direct sales organisations do not take part in these surveys; if the
provider is one of these, you should ask why. They may well say that, since
they do not sell through independent advisers, the surveys are irrelevant.
Often, though, the real answer is that they have a combination of poor
performance and high charges and, therefore, are not competitive.
What are the charges?
The level of charges will have a significant impact on the final return. The
adviser should be able to explain what the charges are, how they compare
with those of competitors, and if the employer has negotiated reductions for
economies of scale and contribution collection.
If your employer does not check for flexibility, you could be locked in to
regular payments until expected retirement date. If payments stop,
particularly in the early years, most of your contributions will disappear
in the provider's administration costs and the adviser's commission
payments.
What happens when I change jobs?
This follows on from the last point. In theory, you can take your personal
pension with you from job to job. In practice, if you have a
commission-based regular premium plan, you will incur a penalty when
payments are reduced or stopped.
If your new employer offers a good company pension scheme, then almost
certainly you should join to benefit from the employer contributions, the
guaranteed pension, and other family protection benefits. By law, however,
you cannot be a member of a company scheme and maintain payments to a
personal plan.
Some providers allow clients to re-direct personal pension payments to a
free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) plan, which is used
to top up company pension benefits.
This arrangement is fine if the employee can afford to keep up the company
pension and FSAVC payments. But many younger people cannot afford this
luxury and, even if they could, the employer's AVC scheme might offer better
value than the individual FSAVC plan.
Those who become self-employed can continue their personal pension plan,
although there might be a penalty for short contribution gaps if initial
cash flow is poor. The unemployed may be covered for a short period by a
'waiver of premium' clause in the contract but the long-term unemployed will
have to drop out as they will have no earnings on which to base
contributions.
Given the unpredictability of career patterns, the only way to guarantee
complete flexibility is to avoid regular contribution contracts unless they
are on a nil-commission basis. If you have to pay commission, opt for a
recurring single-premium plan which avoids the heavy up-front charges.
Is the plan contracted out of Serps?
If you are sold an 'appropriate' personal pension plan, you will contract
out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). In return, the
Department of Social Security (DSS) will send to the plan provider a rebate
of your own and your employer's National Insurance contributions.
A decision to opt out of Serps should be made each year and will depend on
your age, sex and salary. As a rough guide, if you are a man under 40 or a
woman under 35 and earn at least Pounds 8,500 a year, you should consider
opting out. Otherwise, stay in Serps because it is likely to provide better
benefits than the personal pension.
The contributions
The reason most group personal pensions do not provide good benefits is that
the amounts invested are too small. Whether you opt out or stay in Serps, it
is essential to pay additional premiums in order to build up a decent
pension.
Under a personal plan, the combined employee and employer contribution must
not exceed 17.5 per cent of earnings (more for older employees but there are
restrictions for high earners). Where the employer does make a contribution,
this is likely to be about 3 per cent. But most pay nothing at all.
Compare this with the level of contributions needed to match the benefits
provided by a good final-salary scheme and you can see why GPPs are
attractive to the more cost-conscious employers (see table).
Life assurance
Find out if there is any life assurance linked to the plan and who is paying
for it. A close examination often reveals that it is not the employer who
pays; instead, premiums are deducted from employees' contributions.
Caveat emptor
The fact that your employer offers a GPP should not deter you from
scrutinising the provider's terms and credentials in the same way you would
for an individual plan.
Whether you get value for money depends, above all, on the quality of your
employer's research and the depth of his pocket.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Watch those Pep charges - Fourth in
Anthony Bailey's series on the true costs of investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors should be wary of placing too much emphasis on the costs of
investing. Other factors, such as the quality and record of a fund manager
or the administrative efficiency of a broker, can be equally or more
important.
When it comes to personal equity plans, however, it is important to pay
extra attention to costs. How do they measure up against the gain from
Pepping an investment: namely, the tax-saving? There is no point in
investing in a tax shelter if the cost of doing so exceeds the benefit.
'Charge-free' Peps
What this actually means is that all you pay are the charges on the
underlying unit trust. In fact, there are no specific Pep charges levied on
the great bulk of Pepped funds. This is because most Pepped money is
invested in unit trusts. With few exceptions, unit trust managers allow
investors to Pep their funds at no extra cost, although they will have the
usual underlying unit trust costs.
The case for Pepping is strong with charge-free Peps. Even non-taxpayers can
benefit because they avoid the bother of having to re-claim tax and can
re-invest gross dividends. There are, though, a few caveats. You will not
normally be able to mix funds from different managers within the same Pep.
And you are likely to have to pay a transfer fee if you decide to switch to
another manager.
You will also need to decide if your chosen unit trusts are the most
suitable investment to Pep. That could depend on whether you expect greater
growth or higher dividends from other bits of your portfolio.
Reduced charges
Recent developments in the unit trust market have actually made Pep
investing cheaper. Fidelity levies a 2 per cent initial charge on its unit
trusts placed in a Fidelity Pep. That is a saving of 3.25 per cent on the
normal charge, and means the eventual pay-out will be increased by 3.25 per
cent. There is, though, an exit charge in the first three years.
M&amp;G's Managed Income Pep has no initial charge, boosting the final pay-out
by 5.5 per cent. Exit charges are levied in the first five years. Likewise,
Guinness Flight, Gartmore and Schroders are among fund managers who have
made investing in a Pep cheaper than investing outside one.
When charges bite
Charge-free Peps are not for everyone, though. Active investors who tend to
buy and sell a range of unit and investment trusts, and those who prefer to
put their money directly into shares, inevitably incur charges.
The main ones are the initial and annual charges. Where these are levied,
they may be flat rate or percentage-based. You might be looking at an
initial charge of Pounds 30 to Pounds 75, or up to 5 per cent of your
investment. Annual charges may be a flat Pounds 20 to Pounds 60 but, more
typically, are 1 to 1.5 per cent of the capital value.
In addition to the main charges, there are other costs. Fees of up to Pounds
50 to attend an annual general meeting are not uncommon.
Other charges may be more significant. A fee of Pounds 10, Pounds 25 or 1
per cent for taking cash out of a Pep will not suit investors planning on a
regular income. Fees of Pounds 20 to Pounds 50, or perhaps Pounds 10 per
holding, for transferring to another plan manager could also bite.
Choosing on cost
Some fees charged by some plan managers seem excessive and can be avoided
easily by taking your custom elsewhere. Nevertheless, choosing between
different charging structures is not easy.
A fee to cover the cost of re-claiming tax on each dividend is simple and
straightforward. But how many shares and unit trusts do you expect to have
in your portfolio, and of what value?
With any plan manager, you will want to check details of brokerage
commission and minimum dealing charge. Are they priced competitively? What
is the cost of buying and selling unit trusts; and are there any switching
discounts?
The best deal very much depends on what sort of investor you are (or expect
to be). Do you want to invest in a mix of shares, unit trusts and investment
trusts, or can you live with restrictions?
Do you want a self-select Pep, or are you happy to give discretion to an
investment manager? Are you likely to be an active investor who deals often?
Chase de Vere's Pep Guide, price Pounds 9.95, gives a comprehensive listing
of fund managers and their charges (tel: 071-404 5766 for details). Do not
forget you will need to add VAT of 17.5 per cent to most costs, although
this does not apply to a broker's dealing charge.
Cost/tax benefit analysis
When it comes to personal equity plans with charges, the case for Peps is
not clear-cut. They are a must for investors who pay higher-rate tax and
those whose portfolio is big enough to generate a capital gain of more than
the annual Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax exemption.
Basic-rate taxpayers with small portfolios will need to do some sums,
though. A small portfolio could well grow sufficiently to hit the capital
gains tax net, so Pepping could make sense.
But a cheaper way to protect against CGT could be to bed and breakfast
enough investments each year - that is, selling late one day and buying back
early the next - so that, eventually, you can bed and breakfast them into a
Pep once the portfolio has grown enough.
As for the income tax saving, one way of measuring this is to compare the
expected yield with the annual percentage charge. Basic-rate taxpayers
should multiply the annual percentage charge (before adding on VAT) by
5.875. Higher rate taxpayers should do the same, then divide the answer by
2.
The resulting figure must match the yield for the income tax saving simply
to pay for the annual charge. Thus, an 0.5 per cent charge has a break-even
yield of 2.94 per cent for a basic-rate taxpayer and 1.47 per cent for a
higher-rate taxpayer. The break-even yields for a 1.5 per cent annual charge
would be 8.81 and 4.41 per cent respectively.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Foreign attractions - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many years, I have invested directly in a number of foreign companies.
With the UK stock market continuing to be jittery over political and
economic prospects, investing overseas has increasing attractions.
Specialist unit and investment trusts are useful for gaining an interest in
a wide spread of companies, particularly in areas where it is difficult for
a private investor to make direct investments. But there is still nothing
like the thrill of finding an outstanding foreign company and buying shares
in it.
The investor has a direct relationship with the company and, if its shares
race upwards, the effect on a small share portfolio can be considerable.
It is also easier to find one or two good companies rather than, say, 100.
This is why, even if a trust chooses a company where shares soar by more
than 80 per cent, the chances are that most of the other shares in the
trust's portfolio will perform less well; thus, the out-performance of one
company will be watered down by the rest.
This is not to say that an investor should pin all his hopes on one or two
shares; even if the shares are chosen carefully, things can still go wrong
unexpectedly. There are extra hazards with foreign investments, including
currency fluctuations which can affect an investor's profits dramatically.
My first overseas investment, many years ago, was in a small Canadian mining
company quoted on the Vancouver Stock Exchange. I was working in the
Sultanate of Oman at the time and there was no way I could keep completely
up to date with the company's share price.
Although I had a subscription to a Canadian newspaper, it took some time to
arrive. The shares cost me around 45 Canadian cents each. I sold them for
more than CDollars 8, only to see them rise even further before they
plummeted rapidly. I had a lucky, and profitable, escape.
Despite such an unforgettable experience, I have not ventured near the
highly-speculative Vancouver market again. Perhaps if I lived in Canada and
could monitor market sentiment, rumours and share prices closely, I might
well be tempted.
This highlights one of the main problems in investing overseas: following
the progress of your chosen investment. Being linguistically disadvantaged
(the only languages I speak are English and a bit of Cantonese), I have
restricted my foreign investments to those companies where the reports are
available in English.
I did once venture into the Japanese market, where I invested in a company
that was too small to feature in the FT's world stock markets' pages. I had
no idea how its shares were performing (apart from phoning a London
stockbroker) and could not read the all-Japanese report.
There were also problems with the custody of the share certificate (it had
to be held in Japan). I soon disposed of this aggravating investment.
Most of my foreign investments have been in US, Hong Kong and Swiss
companies, mainly because I have travelled extensively in those countries
and subscribe to US and Hong Kong publications.
It is also easy to follow the progress of many major European companies
because the Investors Chronicle magazine has a section every week devoted to
European company results. Their share prices also appear in the FT.
A number of companies, such as Nestle, in which my personal pension scheme
has a holding, also are quoted on the London stock market; thus, it is even
easier to deal in their shares and monitor their progress.
Many private investors continue to think it is difficult to buy shares in
foreign companies. Yet, most brokers have some capability in this area and a
number of them offer a highly- efficient dealing service.
Although shares can be registered in a 'marking' or nominee name, it is
possible to hold many foreign shares directly - in which case, the problem
arises as to how to handle foreign currency dividend cheques without
incurring heavy UK bank charges.
The easiest solution is to open an overseas bank account. But you must be
careful to keep proper records of any withholding taxes on bank interest so
that, where appropriate, these can be dealt with later under any
double-taxation agreements between the UK and the country concerned.
At one time, my two daughters had shares in Walt Disney in the US, as I
thought it would be a useful educational investment exercise. They enjoyed
reading the colourful annual report - and I even took them to Disney World
so they could inspect one of 'their' company's operations and spend their
dividends.
We sold the shares some years ago when I had doubts about the viability of
Euro-Disney. Indeed, we never bought Euro-Disney shares as we felt this
theme park would have had more success in the UK than France.
There are other well-known non-UK companies which can be followed -
especially those making products used in UK homes every day. I am, for
instance, attracted to Dole fruit and juices in the US. A visit to the local
reference library to look at Who Owns Whom provided me with the
headquarters' address. A letter to the corporate secretary produced a copy
of the annual report from which I could start an analysis of the company's
investment potential.
Many US companies have departments devoted to shareholder relations and are
more forthcoming with information than some in the UK. Potential investors
should request a copy of Form 10K, which is required of every quoted company
by the US Securities and Exchange Commission; this is especially useful
because it provides financial and other information, including background
details of a company's executive offices.
Some US company reports put to shame those produced by many UK companies.
Take Knight-Ridder, the newspaper and information services group: it
provides a wealth of financial and other information ranging from operating
cash flow margins to highs and lows of its share price for each year over
the preceding decade.
It also includes biographical details of directors and senior management, a
brief history of the company, and a huge amount of information concerning
the company's operations. I am still digesting it all before making a
decision as to whether to invest.
Over the years, my US investments have been very profitable - notably Amfac
(which owned more than 50,000 acres of Hawaii) and MCA, the entertainments
conglomerate - both of which were taken over for sizeable sums.
My interests in the US were increased after I sold my holdings in Hong Kong
some time ago after becoming concerned about ludicrously high property
values. It was all rather reminiscent of Japan.
An investor might be attracted to a Hong Kong company because he liked its
products - only to find, reading the small print of a report, that much of
its profits actually came from property sales or investments in other
companies engaged in share or property dealing. I believe Hong Kong shares
have much further to fall.
Although Wall Street is overdue for a further market correction, I still
feel there must be companies worth seeking out in the US for longer-term
gains. I hope I can find something attractive in case the UK market
disappoints.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Worry over dividends - Personal
investors face threat to income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal investors might see another attack on their dividend income if
recent government policy hints are translated into action in the next
Budget. Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is reviewing
savings and investment. And, in a recent speech to the Confederation of
British Industry council, he suggested high dividend pay-outs in recent
years may have restricted companies' ability to invest for the future.
Dorrell ruled out a return to the dividend controls imposed in the 1970s and
said tax changes would not be made until the government could 'first
identify the improvement we seek and, secondly, establish that tax changes
are the best means of achieving it.' Nevertheless, City opinion is concerned
about the potential for a tax change. The National Association of Pension
Funds is sending a report to Dorrell arguing that there is no evidence to
suggest high dividend payouts restrict investment.
The government has already made one attack on the tax position of dividends.
Norman Lamont, then chancellor of the exchequer, cut advance corporation tax
(ACT) to 20 per cent in his March 1993 Budget. But the peculiar UK system of
dividend taxation meant that this 'cut' actually reduced the income of many
investors.
The British system is designed to stop investors from facing 'double
taxation'; this would occur if they paid tax on dividend income on which
companies had paid corporation tax already. Instead, UK companies pay ACT
when they make their dividend payments to shareholders. This ACT is then
offset against the company's corporation tax bill on its annual profits. For
basic-rate tax investors, the ACT payment is regarded as meeting their
income tax liability.
But the growth of pension funds, which are non-taxpaying, has had a peculiar
effect on the system. A pension fund can reclaim the ACT paid by a company.
Every time it receives a net dividend, it also gets a tax credit to cover
the ACT paid. It uses this credit to reclaim the tax from the Inland
Revenue, a process known as 'grossing up' the dividend. Thus, by reducing
the tax credit, Lamont's cut in ACT cut funds' income.
What about private investors? If a Dorrell-inspired reform followed the
Lamont example, the two largest groups to be hit would be higher-rate
taxpayers and investors in personal equity plans.
Take a company which pays a net dividend of 7.5p. Under the pre-Lamont
system, that would have generated a tax credit of 2.5p. A Pep investor could
claim this credit, in the same way as a pension fund, and earn 10p in total.
A higher-rate taxpayer would have been forced to pay the difference between
the basic rate of tax, 25 per cent, and the top rate of 40 per cent. This 15
per cent rate, charged on the gross dividend of 10p, would reduce the
higher-rate investor's dividend to 6p.
Lamont reduced the ACT rate to 20 per cent. This meant that, in the above
example, the tax credit fell to 1.875p, and the total return to the Pep
investor to 9.375p. The higher-rate taxpayer was hit, too. He now had to pay
the difference between 20 per cent and 40 per cent tax (that is, his 'extra'
tax bill increased from 15 to 20 per cent). This meant that his net dividend
fell from 6p to 5.625p. Overall, the income of both higher-rate and Pep
investors was reduced by 6.25 per cent.
Say the next Budget reduced the ACT rate further, to 15 per cent. On a net
dividend of 7.5p, the tax credit would be 1.32p, making a gross dividend of
8.82p. For higher-rate taxpayers, their after-tax dividend would fall to
5.29p. Both sets of investors would see a fall in income of 5.9 per cent.
Basic-rate taxpayers are unlikely to be affected, in income terms at least.
The Lamont Budget also cut the basic tax rate on dividends to 20 per cent,
which ensured that 25 per cent taxpayers came out even from the change. A
similar measure would be likely if ACT was reduced to 15 per cent. But
basic-rate taxpayers might still get a capital hit.
One key valuation measure for the stock market is the gross dividend yield.
That would fall automatically if the ACT tax change was implemented. At the
moment, the FT-A All-Share index is yielding around 3.9 per cent, at an
index level of 1,500. A change to 15 per cent ACT would reduce that yield to
3.66 per cent. But if investors were willing to hold shares at only a 3.9
per cent yield, the All-Share index would have to fall to 1,411.5, a drop of
5.9 per cent, to restore the status quo.
An ACT change might not happen. Governments often have 'flown a kite' about
some major policy move in order to gauge public reaction. If that was
hostile, the initiative could be withdrawn without loss of face.
Alternatively, a less stringent measure could be introduced in the belief
that interest groups would be less forthright in their opposition because
they were relieved the worst horrors had been avoided.
Nevertheless, unless the government explicitly rules out a change, expect
the issue to gain greater prominence as the November Budget approaches. In
the meantime, speculation about the change may further undermine sentiment
in an already weak equity market.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Water needs watching - With a price
review looming, Peggy Hollinger feels caution is required
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First impressions are often misleading, and the water sector bears out this
maxim fully. After a disappointing year, water stocks have outperformed the
FT All-Share by almost 7 per cent over the past month. While some may put
this down to optimism about the present price review, Robert
Miller-Bakewell, of NatWest Securities, points to the 6 per cent fall in the
All-Share over the same period. It would seem the sector did little more
than tread water while the stock market lost ground.
Water companies have not always been such laggards. Indeed, shareholders
have done rather well out of these stocks since privatisation in 1989, with
the sector showing a 37 per cent market premium over the five years.
Dividend growth has been equally impressive, with an average cumulative
increase of 40 per cent since 1989. The question is whether this trend is
likely to continue after the review which will decide the rate above
inflation by which companies will be allowed to increase prices.
From the bearish noises made in recent months by Ian Byatt, the industry
regulator, the boom days seem to be over. The review, to be made public at
the end of July, is expected to force companies - and thus investors - to
take on more of the financial burden arising from increasing environmental
legislation.
The water sector has had a fairly gentle ride since being privatised. Then,
the government feared potential investors would be frightened by the huge
spending required to bring the long-neglected water companies up to date. To
woo them, large chunks of debt were eliminated and the companies endowed
with generous price increases to 1995. Investors were tempted further by
under-priced shares and the promise of healthy yields.
Those reasons for investing in water companies have largely disappeared now.
Byatt has made clear that he sympathises with consumers unhappy at paying an
average 57 per cent increase in water bills since 1990 while seeing
aggregate company profits more than double. He has said, repeatedly, that
the sector will now have to call on its own resources to fund commitments.
Bill Dale, an analyst at SG Warburg, estimates that water companies will be
allowed average price increases of just one percentage point above
inflation, against an average of five in the first price review.
Meanwhile, capital spending requirements have spiralled due to increasing
regulation from Brussels. Analysts estimate the sector faces costs of up to
Pounds 16bn over the next five years, against Pounds 13.6bn to 1995.
So, while water companies are facing some of their heaviest obligations, the
regulator is threatening to bring down the rate of return allowed on assets.
'There is a huge income gap,' says Dale, 'and, somehow, that gap will have
to be made good.' But it is clear that the companies' efforts to build
non-regulated income streams will not bridge that gap in the foreseeable
future. This year, the sector is forecast to incur a deficit of up to Pounds
70m, including one-off costs, from non-regulated activities.
The difficulties will be aggravated by the costs of financing the spending
programme. Gearing, now averaging 20 per cent for the sector, is expected to
reach 70 to 75 per cent. The knock-on effect of this, combined with a more
tightly regulated income stream, will be flat earnings for the next five
years.
Earnings have never been important to water-watchers, since so much is
dictated by the regulator. 'No one would value highly an earnings stream
which can be regulated away at the whim of one individual,' says Dale.
Dividend growth and yield have always been more important. Yet, with the
pressures facing water companies, growth is going to be more difficult to
achieve.
Dividend cover, now three times against a market average of twice, is likely
to be the first sacrifice. But the real returns will have to come from
cost-cutting.
If the companies are to fund investment needs and provide solid returns to
shareholders, the only option is to beat the efficiency targets built into
Byatt's price allowances. This will be no easy task and, says
Miller-Bakewell, 'will involve questioning some of the diehard procedures in
the industry'.
Given the difficulty of finding bigger cost savings every year, analysts are
not expecting cost-cutting to fuel dividend rises similar to those of first
five years. Estimates are for real dividend growth to slow from 6 per cent
real under the first price regime to about 3 per cent a year until
year-2000. The real slow-down will begin after 1995 when the new pricing
regime and higher capital spending commitments begin to take effect.
Despite this, analysts maintain that water stocks will be able to increase
dividends faster than the market. With lower dividend cover, corporate UK
will have less room for manoeuvre than the water sector. Thus, the 4.5 per
cent prospective market yield looks less secure in the medium term as
companies will be forced to re-build cover.
All this means that water companies now enjoying prospective average yields
of 6.2 per cent are likely to retain their attraction as income stocks. But
investors should approach the sector carefully, given the uncertainties
imposed by the price review.
In the end, longer-term value depends on an investor's view of the
management. 'Everything will focus on cost-cutting,' says Dale. 'Investors
should be asking themselves which companies are capable of delivering
efficiency gains in an increasingly tough regulatory regime.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: True to form - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors can, from time to time, prove rather predictable and this week's
dealing is an example. Elliot Bernerd's property group, Chelsfield, came to
the market in December last year and, with the exception of a dip at the end
of March, has held up well. Michael Broke, deputy chairman, has sold 250,000
shares at 170p, which more than halves his holding.
Shares in Titon Holdings, the specialist building materials company, have
been climbing steadily over the past three years.
Many directors were buying shares at around 66p in June and July of 1991 at
a time when these were, largely, friendless. Since then, there have been
obvious temptations to take profits, and few directors have been unable to
resist.
The latest sales, at 215p, were executed by Alan Goodman and Alan
Mellenchip. After Goodman's sale of 150,000 shares, he is left with just
113,000, while Mellenchip has cut his holding to 256,000.
Consensus and earnings forecasts for the year to September 1994 suggest a
prospective p/e of 15 this year, falling to 14 in 1995.
Far Eastern stock markets have tumbled faster than their western
counterparts and, inevitably, this has taken a toll on Standard Chartered.
John McFarlane has spent the past three months buying shares, his latest
purchase of 45,000 at 228p adding to the 100,000 he bought a week previously
at 271p. Consensus dividend forecasts for the year to December 1994 put
Standard Chartered on a prospective dividend yield of 4.3 per cent, rising
to 5 per cent the year after.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Vodafone rings the changes - The
week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the UK mobile communications group, is expected to report
full-year pre-tax profits of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 370m on Tuesday,
compared with Pounds 322m last year. Vodafone's shares have been depressed
by the recent malaise in the telecom sector. BAA announces its results on
Monday when pre-tax profare expected of around Pounds 320m, up from Pounds
285m the previous year, reflecting buoyant airport passenger traffic.
ANGLIAN WATER is expected to return a 2 per cent advance to Pounds 190.2m
when it announces annual results on Tuesday. There will be little to shock
here, with declining industrial demand offsetting price increase gains.
Anglian is expected to be somewhat behind the sector in cost-cutting in
spite of its corporate shake-up. The dividend is expected to increase by 7
per cent to 22.7p.
NORTHERN FOODS, the former stock market favourite, is expected to show a
modest increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 153m to between Pounds 155m
and Pounds 160m when it announces its full-year figures on Wednesday. The
results will reflect continued problems in the meat business and the decline
of doorstep milk deliveries. But another good performance is expected in
chilled foods.
RACAL: A poor performance by its data communications business is expected to
hold back results at Racal, which also reports on Wednesday. Flat pre-tax
profits of around Pounds 51m are expected before a Pounds 20.2m provision
announced already.
ELECTROCOMPONENTS: On the same day, Electrocomponents is expected to report
full-year pre-tax profits of around Pounds 71m compared with Pounds 51.9m
the previous year. The group should have been a beneficiary of the recent
upturn in UK manufacturing activity.
SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric: Also on Wednesday, Scottish Hydro-Electric is
expected to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 165m compared with Pounds
146.4m last year.
PILKINGTON: On Thursday Pilkington, the glass group, is expected to
announced that pre-tax profits more than doubled in the year to March to
around Pounds 105m, compared with Pounds 41m in 1993. The figures will be
buoyed by exceptional items, primarily the proceeds from the sale of
spectacle lens business, Sola. Profits before exceptional items should
amount to around Pounds 65m. Further exceptional profits will be written
into present-year forecasts following Friday's sale of Pilkington Insulation
and the expected flotation of its Australian interests.
CHUBB SECURITY: Also on Thursday Chubb Security, the electronic alarm and
locks group, is expected to reveal pre-tax profits of around Pounds 76m
(Pounds 64.2m) for the year to April. The company came out with 37 per cent
profits growth at the interim stage.
POWERGEN'S full-year profits on Thursday are expected to have increased to
about Pounds 470m from Pounds 425m last year helped by fuel and other cost
savings.
LONRHO'S aloof approach has left the City with little guidance on the
interim results out on Thursday. Estimates are for pre-tax profits before
exceptional items rising from Pounds 22m to Pounds 32m. The City will be
looking for insights into plans for revamping Lonrho's expensive financing
arrangements. The dividend is likely to be maintained at 2p.
BRITISH LAND, the property company headed by John Ritblat, is likely to
announce on Thursday that its asset value has increased from Pounds 3.07 to
about Pounds 4 a share in the year to March. British Land's relatively high
gearing has helped it to benefit strongly from the sharp increase in the
value of investment property over the past year. Pre-tax profits, which last
year stood at Pounds 28.5m, are likely to increase to around Pounds 50m.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (2): A foot on the other
side's turf - Scheherazade Daneshkhu examines the increased competition for
investors' money that has followed the fall in interest rates, tempting
savers out of building societies and into equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU

<TEXT>
On the face of it, unit and investment trusts have more in common than
divides them.
It is in both their interests to attract investors into equities, and both
are able to argue that, as collective funds, they offer private investors a
relatively cheap route into a diversified holding.
However, behind these common goals lies the competition for investors'
money, which has accelerated as the fall in UK interest rates over the past
18 months has brought private investors out of the building societies and
into equities.
Investment trusts, with a history dating back to the 1860s, are often
regarded as the more sophisticated investor's choice; but unit trusts, which
have been around only since the 1930s, have been skilled at mass marketing
and at appealing to bank and building society customers.
They have had an advantage here over investment trusts, which have been
restricted in their advertising by the Companies Act prohibiting quoted
companies from advertising their shares. Packaged products, such as savings
schemes and personal equity plans are exempt from this restriction, and
investment trusts have concentrated their marketing on these products.
Unit trusts also pay 3 per cent commission to independent financial
advisers, giving them a distribution advantage over investment trusts.
In recent years, some fund management groups traditionally associated with
one product have ventured on to the other's turf. Before 1991, Fidelity, for
example, did not manage any investment trusts. It now has two: European
Values and Japanese Values.
Mary Blair, Fidelity's product development director, says that the company
decided three years ago that it wanted to enter the investment trust
business, to attract those institutional and retail clients who will only
buy investment trusts and not unit trusts. The ability of investment trusts
to gear by borrowing money also has investment attractions, says Ms Blair.
On the other hand, Foreign &amp; Colonial, manager of the world's oldest
investment trust, has been extraordinarily successful in raising Pounds 500m
within a year for the High Income unit trust, launched in February 1993 with
the German Hypo bank and aimed at building society customers.
F&amp;C's Craig Walton said that, although the company had had unit trusts since
1983, it had decided two years ago on a marketing drive for its unit trust
business. The main reason for launching the High Income Fund as a unit,
rather than investment, trust was that it could be sold through the IFA
network.
Structure
Although some investors may have a clear-cut understanding of which type of
trust to choose, each has its advantages and disadvantages.
From two fundamental structural differences between the trusts stem the
characteristics of each. Unit trusts are open-ended and able to create units
when there is demand, whereas an investment trust has a fixed number of
shares. While investment trusts are traded on the stock market in the same
way as other shares, unit trusts are not quoted companies.
This means that, while the value of units is fixed according to the value of
the underlying assets in a unit trust, the price of shares in an investment
trust fluctuates according to market demand. At periods when demand has been
low, investment trusts have tended to trade at a discount to their net asset
value.
In the early 1980s, discounts could be as wide as 25 to 30 per cent, but the
average discount fell to 12 per cent at the beginning of 1993 and then to 4
per cent in January this year, and has widened since. Private investor
demand, against the background of low interest rates - as well as efforts by
the industry to pull in a steady stream of new money with monthly savings
schemes introduced about a decade ago - has helped to achieve this
narrowing. Split-capital trusts, which separate the functions of capital
growth and income, have also given investment trusts an appeal to a wider
circle of investors.
The narrowing of the discount has helped to give investment trusts their
superior performance over unit trusts in the past 10 years. (See table - the
investment trust figures do not take account of charges and are therefore
comparable with those for unit trusts quoted on an offer-to-offer basis.)
But with discounts historically low, investors cannot necessarily expect the
same level of returns in the next 10 years.
Charges
Many investors are attracted to investment trusts because of their charging
structure. Unit trusts have an initial charge of 5 to 6 per cent, and the
bid/offer spread - the difference in price between buying and selling units
 -can be greater. In addition, there is an annual management charge, often
of 1.5 per cent.
Since investment trusts are bought in the market, there is no comparable
initial charge. Instead there is stockbroker's commission of 1.5 to 2 per
cent (less in savings schemes), 0.5 per cent stamp duty on the purchase of
the shares and the marketmaker's buying and selling spread. The annual fee
is lower than that of unit trusts at about 0.5 to 0.75 per cent.
Liquidity
In falling markets, unit trust managers face the problem of redemptions, and
can find themselves having to sell holdings quickly if investors want to
liquidate their units.
This is both good and bad from the investors' point of view. It means that
they can get out quickly by making a phone call; but if they want to stay in
the trust, its long-term performance can be badly hit by the fund manager
having to sell stock he would otherwise have preferred to hold. Investment
trust managers are spared this problem, but instead their investors are
likely to find the trust moving to a deep discount if it becomes unpopular.
If the investment trust is small, investors may find it difficult to sell
out because of a shortage of buyers.
James Higgins, of fee-based independent financial advisers Chamberlain de
Broe, says: 'We do tend to favour investment trusts, because of their
flexibility. They are ideal for regular savings plans, particularly because
most now have plans with very low dealing charges. However, if a
particularly attractive investment trust is standing at a premium, we might
recommend a comparable unit trust. An example is the use of City of London
Emerging Markets unit trust, instead of Templeton's investment trust.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Putting life back into your Pep -
The best ways to change your plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are happy with your personal equity plan, read no further. But if you
are unhappy with your choice - like one Weekend FT reader whose independent
adviser (IFA) told him he needed a Pep, but that it did not matter what went
in it - read on.
Fortunately, investors who are disappointed with the performance of the
funds or shares in their Peps are not locked into them. They can transfer to
another plan manager without affecting their annual allowance of Pounds
6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep.
These amounts may seem relatively small but, by now, a married couple could
have invested Pounds 110,400 since Peps began in January 1987. Since all
income and capital gains are tax-free, the sums involved are not
inconsiderable.
Why transfer?
The Pep transfer market is growing rapidly. Independent adviser John Spiers,
of Best Investment, explains: 'There is definitely more Pep transfer
business than before; the fastest growing part of our business is people
wanting advice on their existing Peps.' Matthew Orr, of stockbroker Killik,
agrees: 'We are taking a lot of transfers. For each Pep going out, there are
a dozen coming in.'
Why are investors doing it? Some will have been disappointed with the
performance of the Pep or find their investment needs have changed. Others,
who have subscribed to a variety of different plan managers over the years,
may now find the paperwork too much and yearn for a simplified system
offered under the umbrella of a single plan manager, either a stockbroker or
an IFA.
Robert Noble Warren, of fee-based IFA Murray Noble, says: 'The major cause
for Pep transfers appears to be dissatisfaction with the administration and
a lack of personal service. The high street banks and one or two large life
companies seem to have the worst of it.'
Before doing it . . .
A Pep transfer costs money and will take around four to six weeks to
complete, so it is not a decision to be taken lightly or often. Spiers says
that if your worry is performance, first check how the fund or shares have
done compared with a relevant index such as the FT-SE-A All-Share (Money
Management magazine publishes performance tables).
If there is significant underperformance over a number of years, see if
there is a pardonable reason. Recovery funds or UK smaller companies are
cyclical stocks which will not do well in times of recession but should
outperform when recovery is under way.
Some fund management groups allow you to switch out of one sector and into
another in their Pep. But if you are unhappy with the group itself, or want
someone else's fund, this facility is of little use.
How to do it
Contact the new plan manager for transfer forms. According to Roz Barder, of
Chase de Vere, the new manager should handle the transfer process for you.
There may be three forms to fill in: one to notify the old manager that you
are transferring out, another to the new manager saying you want to
transfer, and possibly one telling the latter what you want in your new Pep.
Do not on any account tell your existing manager that you want to close the
Pep. He might cash your holdings - and you would lose the Pep status on the
amount held, so wasting the allowances that allowed you to build it up.
What you pay
This depends on the type of holding you own. Some investment trusts and a
few unit trusts charge a transfer fee, usually between Pounds 25 and Pounds
50. A few funds have withdrawal charges on their Peps for up to five years
as a quid pro quo for a lower initial charge (these include Fidelity,
Gartmore, Guinness Flight, Scottish Equitable &amp; M&amp;G's Income fund). If you
hold individual shares, there will be dealing charges.
If you are transferring from one unit trust to another, you face initial
charges of up to 6 per cent (although some IFAs will be able to reduce this
cost by passing on to you some or all of the commission built into this
figure). Brokerage is the main cost if you are buying an investment trust
Pep, but there are many execution-only or discount brokers which charge
lower commission than the average 1.65 per cent.
A more expensive option - but one that, ultimately, is administratively
simpler - is to transfer all your Peps to one manager. Some brokers offer an
umbrella service; others will suggest a self-select Pep but may advise you
on what to put in it.
Apart from the brokerage fee, there are lots of charges for which you should
watch out. What is the charge for opening the plan and its annual fee? Is
there a dividend collection charge? Is there a charge for selling unit
trusts? (If there is, see if your existing manager will transfer cash rather
than units to the new manager).
For the unit trust devotee, Skandia Life's Multipep is an umbrella-type Pep
for unit trusts. Investors can switch between about 30 funds at very low
cost, but Skandia imposes an additional 0.5 per cent annual fee on top of
the underlying fund and charges for collecting dividends.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: First for savings - Trusts top
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit and investment trust savings schemes offer far better returns than
their life insurance counterparts. Over 10 years, the pay-out on the
top-performing unit trust was more than double that of life-related
policies.
A survey in Money Management magazine asked fund management groups to
provide returns based on premiums of Pounds 50 quoted net of all charges.
Savings schemes allow those who cannot afford to put in large, lump sums to
gain exposure to equities through small, regular investments. They have been
a feature of life plans for over 100 years but are a far more recent
innovation for collective funds.
The higher-charging structure of life policies contributes to the
significant difference in returns. The top-performing fund for both unit
trust savings plans and maximum investment plans (MIPs) - the standard type
of long-term, unit-linked investment life policy - over 20 years is M&amp;G
Recovery (not shown in the table); but investors in the unit trust received
Pounds 152,159 after 20 years compared with Pounds 124,645 in the MIP. If
they had chosen the best-performing endowment policy (Tunbridge Wells
Equitable), they would have seen a pay-out of only Pounds 64,635.
Comparison between collective and life policies is difficult, though. Unlike
collective funds, endowments will provide some life cover and returns are
tax-free. The latter is is not the case with collective funds unless they
are held in a personal equity plan.
Moreover, there are huge variations in performance between different
management groups. The best unit-trust in the UK growth sector over 10 years
 -Fidelity Special Situations - paid out almost double the amount offered by
Save &amp; Prosper Special Situations, the lowest performer.
Top-performing unit trusts tend to be specialist funds. Gartmore Hong Kong
is a single country fund to which few widows and orphans are likely to have
been attracted.
A fairer comparison for a with-profits endowment, which is a broadly-based
fund aiming for low volatility, might be with the UK general unit trust
sector. Even here, though, the unit trust returns are better.
Pay-outs from the top-performing endowments over 10 and 20 years (Swiss Life
and Tunbridge Wells Equitable) were Pounds 12,312 and Pounds 64,635 but M&amp;G
Midland &amp; General, the best UK general unit trust over both periods,
provided returns of Pounds 14,390 and Pounds 135,220.
Interestingly, the survey showed that the top unit trust savings scheme
bettered those of investment trusts over five and 10 years, although the
reverse was true over 20 years. Lump sum investments usually show
outperformance from investment trusts. Since much of this has been due to a
narrowing of the discount, investors in savings schemes have not benefited
to the same degree. Investment trust savings schemes are also far fewer than
unit trusts.
The survey also covers five-year results for Pep regular savings plans.
Re-invested gross income boosts the performance of Peps compared with
collective funds outside them. But the gross income effect is negligible on
overseas funds with lower yields.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (1): High prices spell danger
 -This year can't be as good as last, but investors must keep a sense of
perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Right now, the investment trust industry is facing the problems of success.
Its recent barnstorming run means that many trust shares are now highly
priced, both in their own right and in relation to alternatives, such as
comparable unit trusts. A significant shake-out is a very real possibility.
But it is important to keep current worries about trust shares in
perspective. The long-term merits of trusts as an investment vehicle remain:
they are a good way for investors, particularly private investors, to
participate in stock markets both at home and abroad. The fact that many
share prices look too high, and that there is scant hope that 1994 will be
as profitable for investors as 1993, is a short-term problem. And it would
be churlish not to recognise the industry's recent outstanding performance.
Annus mirabilis
In 1993, the investment trust sector index rose by 46 per cent, compared
with 23 per cent for the FT-SE-A All-Share index. A number of factors
contributed to this . . .
Both the UK stock market and many of the minor world stock markets rose
strongly, partly because American investors were diversifying into overseas
markets. This meant that the majority of investment trust managers were able
to increase net asset values substantially.
The investment trust discount narrowed further, as the gap between trust
shares prices and the underlying assets was virtually eliminated, and in
some cases shares rose above the the value of the underlying assets.
Investment fashion switched to specialist areas, such as emerging markets,
where many trust managers have expertise and where even professional
investors will not venture unaided.
The continuing fall in deposit rates pulled more private investors into the
stockmarket, and both unit trusts and investment trusts benefited. Heavy
purchases of shares in existing trusts tend to narrow the discount, since
there is a finite number of shares in each trust in existence at any given
time.
Widespread advertising of new trusts, and secondary offers of new shares in
old trusts, made the public more aware of investment trusts as an
alternative to unit trusts. The new practice of attaching free subscription
warrants (entitling holders to subscribe to a certain number of shares at a
pre-set price for a certain period of time) made the immediate performance
of most new issues look reasonably resilient.
The increasing availability of savings schemes, particularly ones which can
be combined with a personal equity plan, has created a steady trickle of
money into many funds. Interestingly, most saving-scheme investment in
investment trusts comes through lump sums rather than regular savings. So it
appears that many private investors are - intelligently - using these
schemes mainly as a way of avoiding high stockbrokers' charges, while still
exercising some judgment over the timing of their investment.
Some specialised types of investment trust security did outstandingly well,
notably warrants. In 1993 the best-performing investment trust warrant rose
by 1,700 per cent, the worst by 19 per cent. Warrants are a very highly
geared speculation, and this abnormal rise was a once and for all catch-up.
But it understandably endeared the investment trust concept to investors who
discovered some dusty old warrants in their bottom drawer.
Dies Irae
Why then are most pundits predicting problems? What we have seen so far in
investment trusts is a relatively harmless version of the classic
speculative bubble. There is genuine long-term value in most investment
trusts. But there is also a layer of froth both in many of the shares in
which the trusts invest, and in the securities of the trusts themselves.
This froth is beginning to be blown off.
Some trust shares are already more sensibly rated. But since markets
normally exaggerate both at the top and at the bottom, it is possible that
trust shares will fall further and then suffer a period of unfairly low
ratings . . .
For the past 10 years, investors have enjoyed unprecedently good returns
from all the main forms of investment - shares, bonds and even cash. Many
experts argue that returns are likely to return to more normal levels, which
means that investors may have to lower their expectations.
The interest-rate cycle appears already to have bottomed in the US, and
possibly in Britain. Equity markets normally do badly when interest rates
are rising, and investment trust shares do worse than many other types.
Share prices of many of the securities in which the trusts invest,
particularly the more specialist trusts, had been pushed to levels which
could not be sustained in the short term. Many emerging markets, for
instance, have already fallen heavily this year.
Excessive attention to stock market fashion, both by investors and by fund
managers, has meant that much of the new money coming into the industry has
gone to the most overvalued areas of world stock markets. Some of the more
fashionable recent new issues, such as the European privatisation trusts,
raised more money than they could easily cope with.
The fashion for issuing warrants has diluted the long-term value of the
underlying shares. Assuming the investment portfolio does well enough to
make the warrants worth exercising, warrant holders' right to buy new shares
cheaply can only be satisfied at the expense of holders of the existing
shares. Short-term, of course, any setback in investment trust shares would
have a disproportionate knock-on effect on warrants - and other highly
geared trust securities.
These short-term worries explain why most professional analysts are wary of
the shares. Credit Lyonnais Laing, indeed, has recently advised investors
with shares in investment trusts trading near or at asset value to switch
into alternatives, such as unit trusts. Perhaps this will be the year in
which everybody suffers from a hangover after last year's binge. But
hangovers don't last forever.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust sales remain strong - At
a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net unit trust sales fell last month to Pounds 976m but this was still the
second highest monthly figure this year and the best April figure on record.
Strong sales of unit trust personal equity plans (Peps) had contributed to
making March the best month ever, with net sales of Pounds 1.37bn. But April
5 signalled the end of the rush to buy tax-free Peps for the last financial
year.
Private investors accounted for 73 per cent of net sales last month. UK
equity income and international growth were the most popular sectors for
private investors, while institutions preferred the fund-of-funds and UK
growth sectors.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: House prices rise and fall - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Homeowners were given conflicting views of the housing market by two of the
main building societies this week. Halifax, the largest society, said that
UK house prices fell a seasonally adjusted 1.6 per cent during May, while
Nationwide said that its index showed a rise of 1.4 per cent. The monthly
fall in the Halifax index left prices unchanged from a year ago, but
Nationwide reported an annual rise of 3.3 per cent from last May.
Halifax said the 1.6 per cent fall was unexpected, but added that there was
evidence that total housing market activity had fallen in May. It said this
could be due to the April tax increases and higher fixed rate mortgages.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Boots pulls up its margins - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was ironic that Boots' surprisingly good results this week - a 19 per
cent increase in underlying profits to Pounds 484m - should come a day after
a disappointing trading statement from rival group Kingfisher. It
demonstrated how retailers' fortunes - and market sentiment - can change in
a year.
This time last year, rivalry between Boots and Kingfisher - and in
particular between Boots the Chemists and Kingfisher's Superdrug - was seen
as a microcosm of a wider clash of retailing philosophies for the 1990s.
Kingfisher advocated a strategy of reducing profit margins to increase sales
volumes and market share, adopting a policy of 'Everyday Low Pricing'.
Boots stuck to the margin-led approach, which says growing profits is all
about constantly engineering the profit margins upwards.
In the first half of 1993, Boots' shares underperformed the market by 25 per
cent, losing their premium to the stores sector, while Kingfisher's
advanced. Price-cutting by Superdrug aroused fears that margins at Boots the
Chemists - responsible for 60 per cent of Boots group's operating profits -
were under threat.
The picture a year on is rather different. Kingfisher's shares have slumped
from 778p last December to 516p, after two disappointing trading statements,
and results suggesting its margin sacrifices were not being compensated for
by volume increases - at least not yet.
Boots' shares have also fallen since December, but by much less, and at 525p
are on a considerably higher rating.
Results from Boots the Chemists on Thursday showed it had withstood
competition from Superdrug, and pushed up its operating margin yet again,
from 10.7 to 11.5 per cent. That has more than doubled from 5 per cent in
the mid-1980s, and is getting into territory previously occupied only by
Marks and Spencer.
BTC reported a sales increase for the year to March 31 of 5.4 per cent;
Superdrug a fall in sales in the first quarter of 0.7 per cent.
The reasons for the reversal of fortunes are complex. But while it is too
early to write off Kingfisher chairman Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy's 'value
retailing' approach, Boots' success does suggest the Mulcahy way is not the
only way.
Boots, however, differs in important ways from Kingfisher. First, it has the
advantage when it comes to pushing up margins of vertical integration. Some
43 per cent of Boots the Chemists' sales are own-label, which earn a higher
margin as the retailer can buy them more cheaply than manufacturers' brands.
Much of that own-label product comes from Boots' own cosmetics and
healthcare factories, now grouped in a separate division, Boots Contract
Manufacturing. BCM sells 60 per cent of its output to Boots the Chemists -
and lifted operating profits nearly a quarter last year.
Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs division, also
supplies Boots the Chemists with big-sellers such as Optrex, Strepsils and
Nurofen. Healthcare International more than doubled its profits and is
earmarked for expansion.
A second difference is that a question mark hangs over one of Boots' main
divisions - pharmaceuticals - and several of its retail chains are in rather
worse shape than Kingfisher's.
The withdrawal last year of heart drug Manoplax robbed Boots Pharmaceuticals
of annual sales which analysts had forecast might reach Pounds 166m and left
it too small to compete in a rapidly-consolidating global drugs industry.
Boots is reviewing its future and examining sale, merger or asset-swap
possibilities.
The performance of the other retail businesses, especially those acquired in
the 1989 take-over of Ward White, is patchy. Rationalisation of the DIY
joint venture Do It All should reduce losses, and Halfords is recovering
strongly. But Children's World and Fads made losses, and the task is still
to raise the performance of these businesses to acceptable levels.
Investors might be cautious of Boots until the future of the pharmaceuticals
business is resolved - analysts fear a sale might be earnings-dilutive. It
would, however add to Boots' Pounds 150m cash pile, providing opportunities
for expansion, for example of Healthcare International.
Boots also says it has 'no philosophical objection' to handing cash back to
shareholders. Either way, Boots' success in confounding its critics during a
tough period suggests it is likely to remain one of the market's more solid
long-term performers.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Barbie and Sindy v Ken and Eddie - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As double acts go, Barbie and Sindy may be less edifying than Ken and Eddie,
but more electrifying to investors. A rally of the dolls is underway with
their respective parents, Mattel and Hasbro, battling each other for control
of JW Spear &amp; Sons, the British toy maker. Spear's stock is already up 58
per cent from its January low to 750p with every last Scrabble tile still to
fight for.
But is the stock market's uplift this week - achieved without assistance
from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke or Governor Eddy George - anything more than
a cosmetic correction?
After the dreadful drubbing stocks and bonds suffered the previous week, the
tide turned on Thursday in the futures markets. The cash markets too saw
some genuine buyers attracted by near 9 per cent long gilt yields and 4 per
cent dividend yields.
The upturn proved fragile yesterday. No sooner did the latest US payroll
figures hit screens at lunchtime, than stocks and bonds headed south again.
Only when US bonds rebounded on some comforting words from the White House
did UK markets recover their poise. The FT-SE 100 index finished with a 31.4
point gain on the week at 2,997.8.
Few investors doubt there is genuine value in equities and gilts at these
levels but none are in a hurry to buy. 'We feel slightly spoiled for
choice,' says David Manning, director of UK equities at Legal &amp; General, a
large institutional investor. But there is no need to rush to invest in
either market. 'They will still be here in two or three months' time at the
same sort of levels.'
One factor holding him back is the high yield on index linked gilts. Not
only is the 4 per cent return virtually the same as the stock market's
average dividend yield but it is also risk-free.
As the first of the accompanying charts show, the index linked yield is high
by historic standards apart from the period 1990-92 when it was boosted by
sterling's membership of the ERM. It is hard to envisage yields rising much
further. But even if the bond market fails to rally and achieves only
stability, equities could still gradually recover.
'If indexed linked yields do stabilise and one looks out through 1994 and
1995 one can see an equity yield premium re-emerging fairly rapidly,' say
strategists at SG Warburg Securities, thanks to rapid dividend growth.
As the second chart shows, the dividend yield has rarely been so close to
the index linked gilt yield apart from the run up to the 1987 crash. At
current levels, equities are expensive but will become more attractive as
dividends grow and the yield ratio rises.
Such a modest stock market improvement later this year, led by expanding
earnings and dividends, seems much more likely than one led by a bond market
rally and falling interest rates. Even though a long gilt yield of around 9
per cent is discounting more inflation than most people expect, there are
too many economic uncertainties at home and abroad for investors to chase
bond prices higher.
A parallel can be drawn with the market in mid-1985, says Vivian Bazalgette,
managing director of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers. 'This is a mid-cycle
reaction when the market is switching from being interest rate to earnings
driven. We see scope for the market to rise to its former peak or even a
little higher by the end of the year.' Gartmore has remained slightly
overweight in UK equities throughout the market's 15 per cent correction
from its February peak.
Most other UK institutional investors are also well represented in domestic
equities so they may not be a source of particularly heavy buying when the
market begins to recover. However, there are stocks to cherry pick. Legal
and General, for example, likes those big international stocks in the
Footsie which offer above average dividend yield and exposure to the US
economy.
No companies reporting this week fit the profile although Siebe fails only
on the dividend count. The controls maker reported a 20 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to Pounds 217.2m and an 11.6 per cent increase
in full-year dividend to 11p for a gross yield of 2.4 per cent. Its
underlying profit margins held up through the recession and it is now
enjoying some growth in demand in the Americas and elsewhere.
The most pleasant results surprise came from Boots. Reporting pre-tax
profits for the year up 19 per cent to Pounds 484.4m and the dividend up 12
per cent to 15p, it shook off some of the investor doubts which have dogged
it for the past 18 months. It has yet to work out what to do with its
struggling drugs business or to show it can make money in the do-it-yourself
sector, but there is no doubting the strength of its core retailing
business.
In contrast, elsewhere in the retail sector, Kingfisher delivered a rather
downbeat annual general meeting statement. First quarter sales volume was
lower than a year earlier and its 'every day low-pricing' policy is still
not paying off convincingly. Its shares lost more ground and are now down 33
per cent from their high for the year of 778p.
Granada Group offered the most sparkling performance of the week. Its
interim pre-tax profits were up 51 per cent to Pounds 103m and its dividend
up 10 per cent at 3.33p. Acquisitions in catering and textile rental were
big contributors while LWT, the television franchise, chipped in only
one-month so far.
Although Granada's results attest in part to the profitable audience for
glamorous game shows, Barbie and Sindy are fighting on a higher intellectual

Eddie to a game.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Investments that help you sleep well - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where can you find a hiding place if you are scared by the inflation bogy?
Utilities are tempting: their profits are linked to inflation, they have
been very heavily sold because of regulatory fears, and they offer
correspondingly good yields. But you need to pick the right utilities and
the right companies, and they are relatively risky at the moment.
Index-linked gilts and index-linked National Savings certificates are a
safer alternative. Both guarantee you a real (inflation-proofed) return. But
which should you choose?
The current issue of indexed National Savings certificates (the seventh
issue) offers a tax-free return of 3 per cent above the rate of inflation to
those prepared to hang on for five years: there is no income as such. Both
capital and income from index-linked gilts is inflation-proofed. And though
any capital 'gain' is tax free, the income is taxed. So returns depend both
on your inflation expectations and on your tax rate.
At current prices, and assuming 5 per cent inflation, real
(inflation-proofed) returns on most indexed stocks are around 3.3 per cent
to people paying basic rate tax of 25 per cent. For people paying 40 per
cent tax, the comparable figure is around 2.8 per cent. Unusually the
shorter dated stocks yield much the same as longer dated ones - which
normally offer more because of their greater risk. Note though that the two
stocks with high coupons (nominal interest rates) have poor net yields, and
should be avoided, particularly by higher rate taxpayers.
Given how close their yield is to that on National Savings certificates,
indexed gilts look the better choice for most people. First, gilts are far
more flexible: you can sell when you want. Secondly, there is at least a
chance of a short-term capital gain if the gilt market eventually recovers
some of its nerve. Indexed gilts have fallen along with the others this year
 -though by less.
If you buy indexed gilts now you face two possible outcomes. If inflation
worries persist, you can hang on until redemption, secure in an
inflation-proofed yield of around 3 per cent. If inflation worries fade, you
may be able to sell your indexed stock at a modest profit, and look for
something else. Not perhaps the most exciting investment in the market. But
if you are interested in sleeping well, you take Valium, not a pep pill.
Many people think the UK equity market is cheap, but are scared of buying -
because it might get cheaper still. Market timing is one of the hardest
aspects of investment. Some of the most successful long term investors
simply ignore it. But few ordinary people can sustain such Olympian
detachment. So when will share prices stop falling?
The stockmarket equivalent of the Delphic Oracle is technical analysis, or
charting. Technical analysis is a way of predicting future price movements
from past price movements. It often uses recurrent patterns as a predictive
aide. Think of the charts as a shorthand description of the past behaviour
patterns of investors. Chartists use these patterns to predict how investors
are likely to behave in similar circumstances in the future.
For example, most investors sell a share when it goes below their buying
level. So heavy buying on the way up, is likely to be matched by equally
heavy selling on the way down. Take Wall Street. We know that three-quarters
of all the money in US mutual funds (the American equivalent of unit trusts)
has been invested for less than three years. So if Wall Street takes another
tumble, successive waves of selling by mutual fund investors could help it
on its way until it reaches the level at which the first of these neophytes
bought.
We asked Robin Griffiths of James Capel to give us a chartist view of the
London stockmarket. He reckons that now that the FT-SE 100 index has moved
down through the 3050 level, it will keep falling until it bounces at 2800
or possibly 2890. That will probably be in September, and the subsequent
recovery could be sharp.
Why 2800? When sterling left the ERM in September 1992, the FT-SE 100 index
took off like a scalded cat and rose by a quarter; then it yo-yoed sideways
for six months, before a second steep climb. The bottom of that six month
corridor was 2800. The top of the second climb was 3520. Chart patterns
suggest that once a price has lost more than half an earlier rise, it will
go all the way back to where it started. And FTSE has now lost more than
half its rise from 2800 to to 3520.
And why the alternative floor of 2890? This time we start measuring from the
2260 level of FTSE when sterling left the ERM. From this vantage point,
shares are set to retrace half their subsequent gain. And the mid-point
between 2260 and the 3520 peak is - 2890.
This is not a Crash; it is not even a bear market. It is a setback, argues
Griffiths. But do not expect a serious rally until gilts - which have led
this fall - are generally perceived to have hit bottom. There may well be a
small rally before then, but it will not last long. What will probably
scupper it is the next sell-off on Wall Street. Wall Street's unusually
prolonged rise suggests an unusually big correction in store.
How seriously should you treat chart-based forecasts? The Delphic Oracle was
always right. But fallible human interpretations of her meaning were often
fatally misleading.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Why the Dow does not like Fridays - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first Friday of the month is not proving the best of times to invest in
US stocks.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 15 points down - though
later in the morning it managed a lacklustre return into positive territory.
Stock investors, however, did not see the sort of gains last week enjoyed by
bond investors.
It was at least better than recent first Fridays. In May, the Dow lost 27
points on the fateful day, and then a further 40 points the following
Monday. A month before, it shed 43 points (the market was closed on the
Friday, so the losses came on the Monday instead.)
This is not some statistical oddity. The reason, each time, has been the
same: the publication of monthly employment figures from the Department of
Labour showing that the US is creating jobs at a faster rate than anyone had
expected.
It may seem perverse for the stock market to drop on positive news for the
economy. But strong employment growth points to strong growth in consumer
spending and, possibly, bigger wage rises as companies compete for workers -
both of which in turn raise the spectre of accelerating inflation. In recent
months, that has tended to give the bond market a fright (since inflation
erodes the value of fixed income investments). Also, it adds to pressure on
the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates, which would both eat into
corporate profits and dampen economic growth.
Administration officials are still maintaining the sanguine tone that has
come to sound like a stuck record in recent months. Just minutes before the
latest employment figures came out yesterday, Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury
secretary, was telling members of the Confederation of British Industry that
the US economy was 'in great shape - I haven't seen it like this in 20
years.'
But the markets have their own ideas: the US authorities waited too long to
raise interest rates (why else would they have put up rates four times since
February 4?) and could be forced into further rate rises to put a belated
brake on the economy.
The latest employment figures provided ammunition for both sides. The number
of new jobs created in May, at 191,000, was around 100,000 fewer than the
markets had been expecting. But the April job numbers were revised up by
91,000, and the overall unemployment rate dropped to 6 per cent from 6.4 per
cent the month before. While bonds rallied a point out of relief that the
picture was not worse, equities managed only a half-hearted end to a
half-hearted week.
The stock market had spent the previous days waiting aimlessly for the jobs
figures. One stock that managed to defy this torpor was Microsoft, the
software group. Its shares continued a climb begun in mid-May, when it was
first announced that the company would be included in the S &amp; P 500 index of
leading stocks.
Breaking into a widely-followed index such as the S &amp; P 500 can do wonders
for a company's investment credentials, even when the company is as
well-known as Microsoft. Around a third of the shares owned by US pension
and endowment funds (equivalent to Dollars 400bn worth of equities) are held
'passively' - the institutions holding them are trying simply to track the
performance of a stock market index, not to beat it. To do this, they simply
buy all the stocks in proportion to their weightings in the index.
So making it into an index creates an instant new market for a company's
shares. The people who run indexed funds 'aren't employed to be overweight
or underweight (in a particular stock),' says John Webster, a consultant at
Greenwich Associates, a leading US investment consultancy. 'If they're
underinvested, they're taking a bet.'
It may seem surprising that Microsoft - worth Dollars 30bn - has not been in
the S &amp; P 500 before. The problem for Standard &amp; Poor's, which runs the
index, has been that only a small proportion of the company's shares have
been available to outside investors. Now, it says, there are enough shares
available to make it a candidate for the index.
Apparently, though, there still are not enough available for everyone who
wants them to buy without driving up the price. By yesterday lunchtime,
Microsoft's shares had climbed to Dollars 53 3/8 - a gain of 14 per cent per
cent since 11 May. The company joins the index at the close of business on
Monday.

FT  04 JUN 94 / D-Day's absent friend: Consigned to the periphery of the
D-Day anniversary, Germany has emerged as the greatest power in a united
Europe. Quentin Peel explains what the Germans think of it all
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the legendary 'Desert Fox', and commander of the
main German force in Normandy at the time of the D-Day landings, would be
astonished, if he were alive today, that Germany has survived at all. He
would be even more baffled, says his son, Manfred, to find it a prosperous
and democratic federal republic.
'At the end of 1943, he had found out so much about the concentration camps,
and the extermination of the Jews, that he was convinced Germany was
condemned to total destruction,' says Manfred.
Field Marshal Rommel never lived to see the day. He was critically wounded
in Normandy on July 17,1944 by a low-flying Allied fighter and evacuated to
Germany. By October, he had been implicated in the July 20 plot to
assassinate Hitler, and was persuaded to commit suicide rather than face a
show trial.
He would no doubt have been equally baffled to see his son, who was 15 years
old when he died, as Lord Mayor of Stuttgart for the past 20 years, a pillar
of Germany's post-war liberal democratic establishment in one of its
wealthiest regions.
'During the Allied invasion, my father had decided that on his own
responsibility he would surrender,' he said. 'That was why he had to be
removed. Yet he could not imagine that Germany would get so much
constructive help after its defeat from its own opponents. He could not have
dreamed that it would eventually become the prize pupil of America.
'After the first world war, one could argue about whether the Germans were
guilty. After the second, it was completely clear - and yet our enemies
behaved generously, and it proved a huge success.'
Germany was not invited to join the allies in the flag-waving nationalism of
their 50th anniversary celebrations of the D-Day landings. Yet the bulging
prosperity on the streets of Stuttgart - the headquarters of Daimler-Benz as
well as the US Seventh Corps - leaves little doubt that 'Germany lost the
war, but won the peace.'
Germany's re-emergence as the dominant economic power in Europe has been
accompanied by a great inner search for a new national identity and pride, a
debate about the dangers of nationalism and a huge effort to find its proper
equilibrium in the centre of Europe.
This old debate is now sharply focussed by the barrage of D-Day
commemorations and the other anniversaries culminating in the victory
celebration on May 8, 1995. Should Germans remember this date as as defeat
or as a liberation from the Nazi dictatorship?
This question has especial poignancy at a time when the Berlin Wall is just
a gap in the landscape across the nation's future capital. And a unified
Germany has recovered its sovereignty in international affairs. Yet, it
lacks a unifying sense of national direction.
The spate of racist violence against foreigners in Germany after
unification, and some signs of a revival of far-right political parties in
local elections, has brought the debate on Germany's national identity under
close scrutiny. Yet it remains a confusing debate for Germans east and west,
let alone for foreign observers.
One year ago, a senior adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl argued urgently
that failure on the part of his western allies to invite him to Omaha beach
could cost him victory in this year's general election. The chancellor, he
said, had dedicated his political career to the vision of reconciliation, of
the new Germany being inextricably bound into the twin alliances of Nato and
the European Union. To be snubbed at such a key celebration could be
politically disastrous.
Yet Kohl is most unlikely to have sought an invitation - conscious of having
failed to get one 10 years ago at the 40th anniversary. Any such suggestion
diplomatically faded as it became apparent that even his great ally,
President Francois Mitterrand, was not politically ready or able to extend
the veterans' day parades to include the losing side. Most Germans find it
fairly understandable, even preferable.
'You would hardly expect the French to attend a celebration of the battle of
Waterloo,' says Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, for 10 years a German foreign
correspondent based in Paris for the newspaper Die Zeit. 'It is a military
event, and we were the ones who received a military defeat,' says Renate
Schmidt, vice-president of the German Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament, and leader of the opposition Social Democrats in Bavaria.
'Military events are not my type of commemorations.'
Yet others, including some unlikely allies for the chancellor, regret the
day as a missed opportunity, and a sorry demonstration of the revival of
nationalism around the world.
'The greatest mistake was not to invite both the Germans and the Russians,'
says Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the former hero of the 1968 student barricades in
Paris, son of Jewish refugees from Germany, and now a leading intellectual
force of the German left. 'D-Day is the day of the beginning of liberation
from fascism and totalitarianism. It isn't the victory of the French,
British and Americans against the Germans. They also had to fight French
collaborators and Belgian collaborators.
'The way D-Day will be celebrated is a victory for nationalism, and a black
day for Europe.'
For Cohn-Bendit, however, the most important question for Germans is not
whether the political establishment is invited to attend, but whether they
see the day as liberation or defeat.
The concept of liberation has already been widely accepted. In an opinion
poll published this week in Die Woche, the German weekly newspaper, 69 per
cent said they saw the end of the second world war as liberation rather than
defeat, 13 per cent disagreed, and 14 per cent were undecided. A similar
figure of 67 per cent said they would not have liked to live in Germany if
the Nazis had won the war, and 64 per cent said it was 'good' that Germany
had lost.
President Richard von Weizsacker, the retiring head of state, strongly
articulated this view in a remarkable speech to the Bundestag on May 8,
1985. Yet his successor, Roman Herzog, still felt constrained on the subject
when he was elected last month.
Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, the grand old lady of liberal politics in Germany,
and a rival candidate for the presidency, sees the continuing debate as 'a
sign of precisely how little we have come to terms with this period of our
history. We still don't trust ourselves to say it was the liberation we
never could have achieved on our own.
'If only we could have got rid of Hitler and his criminal band with our own
hands, but we did not.'
She is profoundly concerned at the revival of a debate over Germany's
national identity: 'It worries me very much,' she says. 'There is a strong
feeling of this 'We won the peace'. It could be a good feeling, if it is
combined with modesty and gratitude. But when people like our new right-wing
groups try to cut out all the past, and say Germany is unconquerable, that
means the creation of a dangerous new myth.
'The second myth is that the Jews were not exterminated, and that once again
the Jews are guilty of everything. Something went wrong in telling our
children and grandchildren about it. It is wrong to transfer the feeling of
guilt to young people. They should not feel guilty. It is rather a question
of feeling responsibility for the future, and learning from these historical
disasters. It is a question of learning, and making sure people don't forget
it.'
The conservatives are not the only ones to debate national identity in
Germany. Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, for one, believes this is one of
the big questions facing the nation.
'Only after unification in 1990 did the Germans on either side understand
that they were not easily communicating with one another, as between
brothers and sisters. They had lived under diverging influences for almost
half a century,' he says.
'The east Germans did not know until 1990 that their idea of what it means
to be a German was different from what a west German thought. West Germans
have no idea of what life was like under Ulbricht in Dresden.'
Before unification, West Germany's sense of national identity was
deliberately submerged in the country's commitment to west European
integration. Its self-image was best summed up by Professor Karl Dietrich
Bracher of Bonn University, who described it in 1986 as 'a post-national
democracy among nation-states.' East Germany was dedicated to a communist
vision of internationalism, however spurious that may have been.
'We (Germans) want to harness ourselves in Europe. We don't want to
dominate,' says Renate Schmidt. 'We know that dominance brings unrest, it
disturbs the peace. The difference between Britain, France and Germany is
that Germany has been a nation for the shortest time. Many of you don't
understand our debate over federalism. We are profoundly federal. There are
many different identities: Bavarian, Saxon, Hessian, you name it.
'We don't want to be a great nation. We want our economic power to be
controlled within Europe. We regard the revival of nationalism in other
countries, not in Germany, without any pleasure.'
Helmut Schmidt, like Kohl, was committed to the idea of Germany being 'bound
into' the European Union, although he argues that it is as much out of
self-interest as altruism.
'It is not necessarily only in order to restrain ourselves, but also to
prevent coalitions against Germany from ever happening again,' he says.
'Our geo-strategic position in the centre of Europe is almost unique, shared
only by the Poles. When they were weak, they suffered from invasion: by the
Swedes, by the Turks, by the Hungarians, by Genghis Khan, by the French
under Louis XIV and then Napoleon (who is still a great hero to them).
'But then when the Germans became strong, they pushed out from the centre
towards the fringes. They had been doing this in the early Middle Ages. Then
again after the turn of this century.
'Bismarck in his later years understood the difficulties of this
geo-strategic situation, and tried in a very English way, very
pragmatically, to maintain a balance of power in Europe, in order to prevent
a coalition against Germany.
'We are not acting simply from idealistic reasons in saying Germany must
bind itself in (to Europe). I am relying on very solid historical
experience, which makes it clear to me that we have to bind ourselves in to
greater entities in order to avoid repetition of the grave mistakes under
Kaiser Wilhelm II and the unbelievable crimes under Hitler.'
He is uncertain if the argument is enough to persuade good Germans to remain
good Europeans.
Robert Leicht, editor in chief of Die Zeit, is more sanguine. 'Our European
commitment for decades has been a compensation for the fact that we didn't
have a decent nation state,' he says. 'We were discredited by Hitler and
divided by the Cold War. The consensus on Europe was the only building left
to live in.
'The question after 1989 is whether this is a real consensus, or was it a
psychological or tactical smokescreen? My answer so far is that the basic
(European) conviction is much stronger than I supposed.'
Professor Heinrich August Winkler, of the Humboldt university in former East
Berlin, sees two great challenges to Germany in the immediate future, which
are not necessarily easy to reconcile.
'On the one hand, it has to hurry along the inner, psychological unification
process, which in view of four decades of mutual alienation means nothing
less than rebuilding the German nation. On the other hand, the Europeanising
and Westernising of Germany, probably the most effective insurance against a
relapse into German nationalism, has to proceed.'
When Herzog was elected to be the next German president, many on the left
decried his apparently conservative credentials. Yet his statements on
nationalism have been clear. 'I do not believe that national feeling, or
even national pride - a concept which I treat with extreme caution - can
still be a motivating factor for our people,' he said. As for the idea that
the German people share a 'common blood' - still enshrined in the legal
definition of a German national - he said it would only be entertained by an
unreconstructed Nazi.
In his acceptance speech, he stressed one quality he hoped to see in Germans
above all else - what he described as being unverkrampft. He admitted
afterwards that the concept could scarcely be translated into English ('You
aren't verkrampft,' he said apologetically.) It most nearly means being
'relaxed', although literally it is the quality of 'not being cramped up'.
He was clearly referring to the whole debate over national identity, who won
the war, and who won the peace.
For Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the answer is straightforward enough. 'We will only
be genuinely unverkrampft once we can talk freely of D-Day or May 8,' he
says, 'and if we can see them as events of liberation. That is true for us
all.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / The Long View: Chaos theory for bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For anyone who lived through the second half of the 1970s the past few days
in the markets have felt curiously familiar. With apologies to Henry Ford,
history, in this instance, is funk not bunk. Bond investors are on strike
again and the Bank of England has been forced to disinter exotic kinds of
IOU to coax these fickle folk back.
Its latest offering consists of a 7 per cent convertible - a throwback if
ever there was one. Meantime inflation worriers are in a panic over
shortages of steel and paper in the UK. All that is missing is the presence
of the International Monetary Fund.
If only the IMF would come back. It was much more forgiving than a
liberalised and empowered global market, and you could at least argue with
its poker-faced officials. Even the Bundesbank was punished by investors
earlier this week for daring to cancel an issue of bonds. The backwash from
this stand-off was felt across Europe and caused British gilts and equities
to wobble. Yet the Bundesbank has less reason than most to decline to raise
money at current rates.
With German inflation running at around 3 per cent and 10 year bonds
yielding just over 7 per cent, the real rate of interest in Germany is about
4 per cent. If that sounds tough, look at Sweden, where the comparable rate
is 7 per cent, or the UK, where the equivalent figure is close to 6 per
cent, or France, where it is not far short of that.
These numbers are potentially ruinous for government borrowers and
constitute a pre-emptive strike against inflationary pressures that are
still remote at this early stage of European economic recovery. And if bond
yields continue to rise, they could threaten to turn recovery back into
recession, especially in continental Europe.
Since February, when market strategists reached for their books on chaos
theory, the bond markets seem to have been obsessed with historic
performance rather than future prospects. German bonds have been a safe
haven in Europe, with yields rising less than others in the Group of Seven
industrialised countries apart from Japan. Britain is in the financial
doghouse. Its bond yields have risen further than any in the G7, while its
equities have been treated as though they fell into the emerging market
category. They have fallen more than all the others including the US, which
is at a more advanced stage in the economic recovery. Does it really deserve
this dismal rating?
For all the markets' post-February suspicions of Kenneth Clarke, UK fiscal
policy remains undeniably tough. The new macho regime at the Bank of England
is joining with the markets in stiffening the chancellor's sinews on the
monetary front. The best of the disinflation story may now be over, but the
panic about renewed inflation is surely overdone.
The one genuine cause for concern is the recent rise in earnings, which is
not solely due to inflated City bonuses. But for the moment that looks like
being off-set by the continuing squeeze on prices in the shops. And that
great engine of British inflation, the housing market, is quiescent. It was
good to see the Halifax Building Society revising downwards its house price
forecast this week. As for those bottlenecks in industry, a market that
worries about shortages of steel, the product of an industry plagued with
subsidies and Europe-wide overcapacity, is plain loopy.
Compare and contrast with Germany, where fiscal policy remains loose and
monetary policy looks increasingly suspect. Having built its credibility on
adherence to money supply targetry, and having argued last year that to
abandon the credo would alienate the foreign investors who were financing a
majority of the fiscal deficit, the Bundesbank has suddenly lost its faith.
Whether you think that growth in M3 really is excessive or not, the fact
that the German central bank has changed its biggest tune when the money
numbers are soaring does little for its credibility. Moreover, the timing of
the recent big cuts in the discount and Lombard rates, with a Christian
Democrat boss, Hans Tietmeyer, in charge and federal elections due in
October, looks highly suspect.
The economy, meantime, is recovering more quickly than expected after the
mildest of recessions at the end of a huge boom. Capacity utilisation is
rising. The Bundesbank signally failed to reduce inflation below 3 per cent
in the recession. If this is the definition of a safe haven for bond
investors, then the times are wildly out of joint.
All this suggests that the 1 3/4 point gap between 10-year gilt yields and
German Bunds is excessive. Real bond yields in Britain and much of Europe
are at attractive levels for investors. Yet there is minimal activity in the
cash markets and those investors who have chanced their arm in futures and
options have retired hurt. What could change market sentiment for the
better?
Clearly there can be no going back to the peaks seen in 1993. The bond
markets were suffering from a speculative overshoot. Moreover, the rise in
the yield on index-linked gilts points to a genuine increase in the global
cost of capital. This reflects not only the structural budget deficits of
the developed world, but the increasing demands being made on the global pot
by fast-growing countries in Asia and in the former communist bloc.
Yet the present high level of bond yields is also a result of the
immobilisation of international capital flows. Investors in the world's last
big creditor country, Japan, are sitting on a rising cash mountain. They
worry about political uncertainty at home and the weakness of the dollar
against the yen. The preconditions for both a bond and equity market boost
may thus be a dollar recovery, prompted by further rises in US interest
rates, and the reactivation of Japanese capital outflows. Signs of slower
economic growth in the US would also help. Until then keep the book on chaos
theory beside the bed.

FT  04 JUN 94 / NatWest card error affects up to 60,000 customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 60,000 people have been affected by a mistake in processing by
National Westminster Bank, which led to Visa credit and debit card
transactions for May 26 being put through its computer twice.
The mistake, which involved millions of pounds of transactions, affected not
just NatWest's own customers, but also those with Visa payment cards issued
by other banks and building societies who used their cards at retail outlets
which bank with NatWest.
NatWest said yesterday that it had discovered the error on May 28, and that
corrected entries dated May 31 would be appearing on statements.
The correction was being backdated so that no customer would lose out
financially, it said.
The bank blamed the blunder, which arose when the same transactions were
processed on two successive days, on human error rather than a computer
failure. It said the whole system was being checked to make sure the mistake
did not happen again. 'This is not a regular occurrence', a spokesman said.
NatWest said that the small minority of customers whose monthly statements
ended before the credit entry should deduct the duplicated amount from their
bills, and should confirm this with their card issuer if they had any
difficulties.
This is not the first time NatWest has had problems with its processing.
Last year, a human error in converting its Worldwide Fund for Nature Visa
card accounts into ordinary Visa accounts meant that payments from some WWF
card holders were credited to the accounts of other Visa card customers by
mistake.
On that occasion, the bank initially decided to adjust the accounts only of
those individual customers who noticed a discrepancy and complained.
Only after one customer had contacted a senior member of staff did NatWest
contact and compensate the remaining card holders who were affected. In
1992, NatWest had to alert thousands of cardholders to errors after software
was changed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets did not know quite what to make of yesterday's US
unemployment figures. A jobless rate as low as 6 per cent seems calculated
to fuel worries about inflation as it is the level at which wage pressure is
traditionally expected to appear. But a payroll increase of just 190,000
points to some slackening in the recovery, especially since part of it was
accounted for by the return to work of 70,000 striking truck drivers. Put
the figures together with other recent data, for example on retail sales and
durable goods shipments, and it looks as though tighter monetary policy may
be starting to bite. The Labour Department itself has some reservations
about the accuracy of the jobless rate, both because it is based on
relatively new methods of data collection and because of the size of the
fall from 6.4 per cent in April.
There thus seems little to dispose the Federal Reserve to tighten again in
the near term. But neither can the markets relax. May represents only one
weak month in a trend of generally strong employment growth this year. Also
yesterday's data do show some acceleration in average earnings. Though the
year-on-year growth is only 2.75 per cent, May's increase was 0.5 per cent.
That figure, too, may have been affected by the return of the truckers, but
it could come back to haunt the markets if other signs of incipient
inflation appear.

FT  04 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Daily Mail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Pounds 90m acquisition in regional newspapers is confirmation
that Daily Mail and General Trust has moved onto the front foot. Gearing,
which was uncomfortably high following the buy-out of Associated Newspapers
in 1988, has been gradually lowered. Capital spending is now falling and the
national newspaper titles are in fine fettle. With its bids for the national
lottery and third national commercial radio licence both unsuccessful, Daily
Mail is free to pursue other opportunities.
Even allowing that T. Bailey Forman will improve on last year's Pounds 4.8m
pre-tax profit, Daily Mail is paying a full price for a business already
earning decent margins. But the Nottingham Evening Post is probably worth
more to Daily Mail than to other bidders. Its Northcliffe regional newspaper
empire has titles in most of the surrounding towns, so integration should
yield cost savings. As one of the last independent regional newspaper
companies, T. Bailey Forman was always likely to command a scarcity premium.
Yet the main thrust of recent investments has been in other areas of the
media. This week also saw a Pounds 7m acquisition in local radio.
Substantial sums are being sunk into a cable television station for London
and US multimedia interests. Given its record of picking winners  - the seed
capital investment in Euromoney being a case in point - shareholders will be
happy to back the company's judgment. The real test is whether Daily Mail
can repeat its success outside the familiar world of newsprint.

FT  04 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo/Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo has now been forced twice in a week to modify extravagant statements
that it has made in trying to fend off Enterprise's hostile bid. In the
latest and most serious case, the Takeover Panel said Lasmo's allegations
that Enterprise had breached accounting standards were stronger than it
considered acceptable. Whatever spin Lasmo tries to put on it, investors
will take a dim view of a management that shoots from the hip in this way.
Still, the substance of Lasmo's allegations have hit Enterprise hard.
Enterprise's decision to write down sharply the value of assets at the time
they were acquired in the late 1980s has reduced depreciation charges and
boosted reported earnings. This has reinforced the impression that
Enterprise cannot really afford to pay dividends at their current level. The
company's share price has suffered. At last night's close of 382p, its
all-paper offer was worth only 124p a share compared with Lasmo's share
price of 142p.
This 18p gap is the most important indicator of how the bid battle is
proceeding. Enterprise has sought to close it by arguing that it can add
value to Lasmo's business. But these arguments carry no more conviction than
they did at the start of the bid. That leaves Enterprise in the same bind.
It needs to improve the offer, probably by offering significant amounts of
cash, if it is to clinch Lasmo. But that would put its ability to maintain
dividends to its own shareholders under even greater pressure.

If this were a normal cycle, the UK equity market should soon start to
disengage from bonds. Equities would out-perform because economic recovery
would feed through to corporate earnings while the gilt market started to
worry about inflation and monetary tightening. Two developments this week
suggest the pattern may not automatically repeat itself this time. One is
the April setback in the housing market. The other is yesterday's M4 money
supply data which shows that, after net purchases of gilts as high as Pounds
2.7bn in December, overseas investors were net sellers to the tune of Pounds
1.3bn in April.
It is too early to say whether the April housing figures simply represent a
blip in a still rising trend. But they do cast some doubt on the inflation
fears which have been commonly cited as a reason for the weakness of gilts
this week. Taken together with the data on overseas purchases and the run-up
in real yields on index-linked stock, that suggests the real problem may
still be the withdrawal of the overseas liquidity which sustained the market
at its peak.
Whatever the balance between the two factors, the outlook for gilts is not
particularly encouraging. If growth and inflation worries are not the cause
of the market's malaise, the liquidity shortage leaves little reason for
expecting a sustained recovery. Equities by contrast could do with a dose of
growth, but they too seem to have suffered from the shortage of
international investment liquidity: witness the FT-SE 100's 15 per cent
slide since February despite the improving economic outlook. If liquidity
shortage remains the dominant influence, even the prospect of growth at 3
per cent this year would not put much life back into equities.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Brussels set to revive rescue plan for steel: Compromise
reached after Delors intervenes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission looks set next week to perform a U-turn over its
rescue plan for the steel industry, confounding predictions that the plan
was dead and buried.
Senior officials predicted the Commission was likely to back a fresh effort
to revive the steel plan under the joint auspices of Mr Jacques Delors,
Commission president, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner.
A compromise under review in Brussels calls for the Italian government to
repackage proposals for subsidising plant closures in the northern Brescia
region, raising hopes that the steel plan's ambitious target of cutting 19m
tonnes in capacity can be met.
Just three weeks ago, Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for competition
policy and co-architect of the steel rescue, pronounced the plan 'dead'. He
criticised colleagues for voting down his proposals for monitoring the
Bresciani cuts, and said he would play no part in future talks.
Mr Van Miert's decision to dissociate himself from the steel plan led to a
crisis within the Commission and baffled European steel producers. Despite a
lack of enthusiasm within the private sector, most steel groups argued the
plan provided a useful framework for cutting excess capacity and curbing
state aid.
Mr Delors is believed to have held talks with Mr Van Miert yesterday in an
effort to bring him back on board. 'This is all about saving Van Miert's
face,' said one senior official.
Under a complex compromise, the Commission is likely to examine a report on
the European steel industry, which includes a request to the Italian
government to refine its aid proposals for the Bresciani plants in order to
produce cuts of between 5m and 6m tonnes in capacity.
The Commission will also consider Mr Van Miert's request for the preparation
of possible legal proceedings against the Italians for paying unfair
subsidies to producers. However, officials said the inclusion of possible
proceedings was a token gesture. The real message from the Commission was a
request to Rome to repackage its aid proposals for the Bresciani steel
mills.
Mr Van Miert's original plan was outvoted after legal objections from Sir
Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator. He questioned the principle
of allowing state aid for partial closures of steel companies, and warned
that it could damage his efforts to reach a multilateral steel agreement
with the US.
Yesterday, officials close to Mr Van Miert questioned whether Sir Leon would
risk bearing the blame for a second collapse of the steel plan, not least
because his long-shot campaign to succeed Mr Delors depended heavily on
Italian government support.

FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities ahead in wake of
jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices pushed ahead yesterday after the release of an ambiguous set
of data on May employment conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.23 higher at 3,772.22, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.48 at 460.13. Volume
on the NYSE was a moderate 270m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 1.31 better at
441.84, and the Nasdaq composite added 2.88 to 742.38.
The government's report on labour market conditions last month defied easy
interpretation, as did the subsequent reaction of the financial markets.
The headline figure was favourable for investors looking for signs of a
cooling economy and evidence that could delay the Federal Reserve's next
move to tighten interest rates. An increase of 191,000 in non-farm payrolls
was well below the forecasts of analysts, which centred on a gain of
275,000.
But there was bad news, too. The initial estimates of March and April
payrolls were revised upwards, leaving the gain over the three months a
little stronger than expected.
More troubling, the unemployment rate showed a surprising drop to 6.0 per
cent, from 6.4 per cent the previous month. The 6.0 per cent level was
especially worrying, because it is cited by many economists as the effective
point of 'full employment'. It set off alarm bells about the potential for
higher wages as employers compete for scarce workers.
Initially, longer-dated bonds, which are especially sensitive to inflation,
jumped on the payroll data, but quickly reversed direction as traders
digested the rest of the report. By the time equities started trading at
9.30, the long bond was moderately lower, and the Dow fell 15 points.
However, there were more surprises. Minutes after the NYSE's opening, the
long bond began to rally, climbing nearly a point by midday and holding
there. Analysts were at loss to provide an adequate explanation for the
second turnround. Sliding commodity prices provided some support.
Nevertheless, stocks took the bait, shifting direction and pushing securely
into positive ground. The Dow industrials were held back somewhat by General
Motors which sank Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 in brisk trading. The car
maker announced that it would convert an issue of preferred stock into
common shares. International Business Machines, off Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
61 7/8 , was another drag on the Dow.
Offsetting the declines, 3M added Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 and Sears
put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 51.
In other retailing stocks, Wal-Mart gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 7/8
after announcing plans to expand into Argentina and Brazil. JC Penney
dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 48 1/4 .
Bausch&amp;Lomb plunged Dollars 8 1/8 , or nearly 20 per cent, to Dollars 41 3/8
.
Canada
Toronto prices close mixed in quiet end-of-the-week trading. The TSE-300
composite index edged up 0.44 points, or 0.01 per cent, to close at
4,281.02, but declining issues outnumbered advances 395 to 311. Volume was
47.42m shares, down from yesterday's 54.23m and trading value fell to
CDollars 553.2m from CDollars 568.1m. Among gold issues, American Barrick
dropped  1/2 to 32  5/8 and Placer Dome lost  1/4 to 31.
The mining group posted the day's biggest increase, up 1.2 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo vaulted 6.7 per cent in moderate trade after domestic
and foreign players returned to the market on renewed optimism ahead of the
implementation of a new currency, the real, on July 1.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 1,695 at 26,960
points. Turnover was CR399.7bn (Dollars 205.8m).

FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rally leaves slight
decline in Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo stocks fell moderately, but a late afternoon rally wiped out much of
the losses and left the market in a positive frame of mind for the weekend,
writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225, after a weak opening, continued Thursday's downward
correction. While overseas investors began buying at the opening, domestic
institutions took profits by selling on rallies. The market reached an
intraday low of 20,802.46 in the afternoon, then rallied in the final half
hour of trading to close at the day's high of 20,954.19, down 54.81 points.
Foreign purchases, which had powered the market through much of its
week-long rise, were not sufficient, traders said, to overcome institutional
selling and profit-taking.
Volume was estimated at 380m shares, well below the levels maintained
through the previous five trading days. The capital weighted 300 index
closed at 306.80, down 0.9, while the Topix index of first section stocks
closed 10.04 lower at 1,679.62. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.45
to 1,386.37.
Mr Keith Donaldson, an equity strategist at Salomon Bros in Tokyo, admitted
that 'the week's run-up was more rapid than we expected.' But he was
encouraged by yesterday's light volume . Falling prices on high volume could
have indicated panic selling over the nuclear stalemate with North Korea.
Losers led winners by 691 to 307 with 189 unchanged. Steelmakers attracted
profit taking. Kawasaki Steel, the day's volume leader, lost Y11 to Y408 as
11.5m shares changed hands.
Hitachi, which had announced plans to sell low cost products outside of its
normal channels under different brand names, rose Y10 to close at Y1,090 in
heavy volume of 5.6m shares. Oki Electric, which had projected higher
profits for the current year, gained Y9 to close at Y690 on a volume of 9.2m
shares.
In Osaka the OSE average fell 187.94 to 23,200.12 in volume of 34.3m shares.
Roundup
The region had a better day, in aggregate, after a mostly unprofitable week.
BOMBAY jumped 3.3 per cent on a technicality which encouraged speculative
buying. Leading companies announced annual book closures for dividend
payments, which meant that the delivery period for stock would be extended
to a month, giving the speculators time to play the market.
The BSE 30-share index closed 129.53 higher at 4,053.23, over the 4,000 mark
for the first time since February 28, when India announced its national
budget for 1994/95. Depressed since then by the ban on carry-forward
trading, equities revived only this week, following reports that the monsoon
would be normal and a string of good corporate results. The rise on the week
was 7 per cent.
TAIPEI rose 1.1 per cent in active trading, the paper, financials and
plastics sectors attracting buyers as the weighted index ended 67.07 higher
at 6,023.69, 3.7 per cent higher on the week in turnover of TDollars
71.52bn.
SINGAPORE saw last minute buying which left the Straits Times Industrial
index 16.32 higher at 2,268.70, off a day's low of 2,251.79 but 2.4 per cent
down on the week. Investors focused mainly on Malaysian shares after their
recent losses.
KUALA LUMPUR moved in much the same way, late bargain hunting taking the
KLSE composite index up 10.05 to 965.49, down 3.5 per cent on the week but
apparently resilient at the 950 level.
SEOUL's selective advances in construction, financial and some
telecommunications companies offset concerns about the North Korean nuclear
problem and the composite index rose 5.00 to 942.43, off 1.2 per cent on the
week.
HONG KONG ended little changed, wary ahead of this month's government plans
to cool residential property prices, and the Hang Seng index finished 11.93
higher at 9,234.27, a week's fall of 2.5 per cent.
BANGKOK featured late bargain hunting in banking and finance, gains in both
sectors after early losses limiting the decline in the SET index to 0.92 on
the day at 1,358.00, down 1.8 per cent on the week.

FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Springtime in Paris sees no sign of
renewal - Equities are languishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are times when equity markets seem to move without rhyme or reason
and, at first glance, that certainly seems to have been the case for the
Paris stock market this spring.
The economic data emanating from the French government's army of highly
trained statisticians has been getting better and better over the past few
weeks. Even the more cynical of economic commentators have been forced to
admit that France now shows every sign of hauling itself out of recession
and have adjusted their forecasts accordingly.
Yet the CAC 40 index has fallen steadily since its historic peak of 2,360.98
on February 2, to dip down below the 2,000 mark last Wednesday. The index
rallied on Thursday, closing above 2,000, and yesterday finished at 2,041,
little changed on the week.
'It's clear that the French economic outlook has improved considerably over
the past few months,' says Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist
at Salomon Brothers.
'Unemployment is still high, but demand has improved faster than we expected
and inflationary fears have receded. So why is the stock market doing so
badly?'
The quick answer is that investors' attitudes over the past few months have
been influenced less by the prospects of the French economy and of the
CAC-40 stocks themselves, than by continued concern about the outlook for US
interest rates and for German money supply.
Some analysts also suspect that the market has fallen prey to a widespread
re-rating of equities, reflecting the weakness of the bond market and
instability of global sentiment since the February increase in US interest
rates.
'There has been a general re-rating, equities have fallen to much more
realistic levels and French stocks are now fairly cheap,' says David
Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'But the bond
market is so weak that bond yields are still very attractive compared with
equities.'
In the meantime the fundamentals of the market have been improving. The
economy is still in a fairly fragile state. Unemployment rose to yet another
record level in April of 3.33m, or 12.3 per cent of the workforce, and
consumer spending is still erratic. This spring has seen an encouraging
increase in sales of manufactured goods, notably cars which have benefited
from special government incentives, although expenditure on other items has
remained sluggish.
However, the corporate sector has shown a sharp rebound. The latest surveys
conducted by Insee, the state statistics institute, and the Bank of France
have shown significant increases in business confidence which have already
filtered through to increased production in manufacturing, particularly for
intermediate and capital goods.
This increase seems set to continue during the course of 1994 and to
accelerate in 1995. French companies cut back sharply on investment last
year and also ran down their stocks to very low levels. This means that any
increase in demand should have an immediate effect on production.
'The convalescence of the French economy has turned out to be more rapid
than expected,' says Ms Patricia Lormeau, an economist at Paribas in Paris.
'Attention is now focusing on the degree of vigour which can be expected of
growth in 1995.'
Other observers agree. Insee last month raised its growth forecast for the
first half of 1994 to 0.9 per cent from 0.7 per cent. Salomon's Mr Mercier
has revised his forecast to 1.5 per cent in 1994 and 2.5 per cent in 1995.
'Until recently there was a lot of scepticism about the French recovery,' he
says. 'But now we've seen enough positive economic data to be convinced.'
The recent round of statements from company chairmen has been more upbeat,
too. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of the Paribas banking group, last week
confirmed that it was on course for an increase in profits this year. A few
days later FNAC, one of France's largest retailers, announced that it had
begun its recovery with a return to interim profits growth.
Even Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group which has seen its shares
plummet during months of negotiations over a FFr13bn rescue package with its
banks, gave investors a welcome piece of good news on Wednesday with the
announcement that Prince Al-Waleed, a member of the Saudi royal family,
plans to buy up to 24.5 per cent of its equity following a pending FFr6bn
rights issue.
There was no such luck for Schneider, the electrical engineering group,
which started the week with the news that Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, its
chairman, was being held in custody in Belgium pending investigations into
fraud allegations.
For other companies the critical question is when France's improved economic
performance will be reflected in equities. James Capel anticipates a healthy
increase of 48 per cent for the CAC-40 companies' earnings in 1994 - ending
four successive years of decline - followed by 38 per cent growth in 1995.
'In theory this is a great time for investment in French equities,' says Mr
Harrington. 'The market should have bottomed out. But who knows when the
rally will start?'

FT  04 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mood change for bourses ahead
of US data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bigger than expected fall in US unemployment was one of the prospects
which European markets feared most earlier this week. But when it happened,
the bourses had changed their mood, writes Our Markets Staff.
US establishment figures did their best to calm any fears that might have
been raised, saying that inflation fears were exaggerated. However, opinion
in Europe had been moving that way by mid-week, and yesterday's reaction
merely consolidated an already rising trend in equities.
FRANKFURT came back refreshed from a day's leave with the Dax index 18.69
better at 2,148.39, 34.77 ahead of Wednesday's depressed post-bourse close.
This left it 0.3 per cent up higher on the week but the Ibis-indicated Dax
made another 10.49 to end the afternoon at 2,158.88.
Kleinwort Benson said on Wednesday that a panic in the bond market had put
equity prices to the test and pushed them down towards the bottom of their
recent trading range.
But, said the German team, led by Mr Andrew Thomson and Mr Adrian Phillips,
'with the economy turning and the bullish expectations for equity earnings
looking daily more realistic, we see little further downside in prices.
Trading remained thin following Thursday's holiday. There were outstanding
pockets of strength in financials, where Allianz rose DM38 to DM2,452, and
in engineering where Linde, frequently bypassed in favour of more
lightly-priced stocks, jumped DM25, or 2.8 per cent to DM925. MAN rose DM7
to DM420.50, and Mannesmann by DM9.50, or 2.2 per cent to DM438.50.
On a thin day for corporate news, the construction group, Bilfinger &amp;
Berger, climbed DM19 to DM779 ahead of next week's results.
AMSTERDAM was lifted through buying of financial stocks, with ABN Amro and
ING both rising Fl 1.50 to Fl 62.40 and Fl 77.60 respectively, as the AEX
index put on 3.29 to 403.03, barely changed on the week.
Unilever advanced 50 cents to Fl 191.70 on news that the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products group was to drop two court cases against Procter &amp;
Gamble. The dispute had arisen between the two companies regarding a new
detergent.
MILAN remained quiet, as it has done for the past couple of sessions.
Volume, apparently, was lower than average.
The Comit index closed up 1.44 at 736.36 for a 0.8 per cent rise on the
week.
Paribas Capital Markets downgraded the market from overweight to underweight
relative to the rest of Europe. In explanation the broker said that while it
remained positive on the country's prospects, most of the good news had
already been factored into equities.
'Italian equities carry higher risk, since in recent months high levels of
fund flows have been the main factor during the market,' it said.
Montedison was one of the day's features, up L32 at L1,429 on reports that
the European Commission would approve its joint plastics venture with Royal
Dutch/Shell.
ZURICH could offer itself two explanations as the SMI index eased to
register a mere 2.5 gain at 2,728.4, up 0.6 per cent on the week, after a
day's high 12 points higher.
The conventional one was that Swiss investors took a less sanguine view of
US data and interest rate prospects than their neighbours. The other was the
possibility of a hidden agenda in Roche, regarded as aggressively oversold
in some quarters earlier this week but still seeing its certificates fall
another SFr80 to SFr6,710 as other Swiss blue chips mostly gained a point or
two.
MADRID's general index ended 2.13 up at 326.29, but 1.4 per cent down on the
week following a late recovery as Wall Street weathered the US data.
Telefonica, a front line ADR stock, ended Pta50 better at Pta1,885,
accounting for a quarter of yesterday's Pta32.3bn market turnover.
ATHENS fell slightly but a more optimistic tone had returned to trading,
brokers reported, as turmoil in the currency markets began to subside.
The general index slipped 1.86 to to 868.50 but remained 1.5 per cent firmer
on the week.
ISTANBUL gained 2.1 per cent on buying interest which was mostly
concentrated upon state-companies, the composite index ending 324.69 higher
at 16,072.90 for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week.

FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close strongly in higher
trading volume - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK stock market editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A turbulent trading session yesterday saw UK equities extend the recovery of
the previous day but only after moving through successive ranges totalling
more than 50 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. The driving force came from the
gilt-edged market where long-dated British government bonds ended with gains
of around 1 1/2 points, also after a volatile performance as Frankfurt
returned from Thursday's holiday closure.
By the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 17 points ahead at 2,997.8. After an
uncertain start, the Footsie showed a gain of 23.6 at mid-session, standing
at 3,004.4. This successful recapture of the 3,000 mark came just as a
leading Swiss investment house cut its Footsie year-end forecast from 3,500
to 3,000, according to market traders; if so, the timing was unfortunate,
for the market quickly turned tail, running back to 2,968.4 to show a net
fall of 12.2.
The setback reflected an uncertain start to trading in New York where
Federal bonds at first reacted sharply to a fall in May unemployment which
appeared to threaten action from the Federal Reserve. But US bonds, and Wall
Street, soon turned higher and the UK gilts followed suit. Firmness in
sterling helped the mood in the UK markets.
Further selective buying by the institutions was indicated yesterday by Seaq
volume of 725.6m shares, nearly 18.5 per cent on Thursday's total. Traders
said that the big funds have become more willing to buy equities at current
levels, although they are still alarmed by the instability of the government
bond market. It was clear that UK share prices remain at the mercy of
developments in bond markets.
After falling heavily earlier this week, the FT-SE 100 Index closed last
night with a gain of 31.14 points over the four day market week. But the
extended three week equity account which also closed last night has seen a
fall of nearly 4 per cent in the Footsie as investors have reacted to fears
that the downward cycle in European interest rates may be nearing its end,
while the US authorities are under presure to raise rates again.
With the UK seen as further into recovery than other European economies, the
stock market's hopes for a base rate cut have vanished, to be replaced by
fears that rates will be forced higher before the year-end.
Next week brings a relatively light calendar of economic news on both sides
of the Atlantic and some market strategists believe that this will offer UK
share prices the opportunity to extend their recovery.
Across the broader range of the market, recovery has been less significant.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained only 1 point to 3,557.3 yesterday, leaving a
loss of 15 points on the week and around 4.4 per cent over the three week
account.
Yesterday's rally was somewhat uneven, with share gains more often
reflecting bargain-hunting following losses earlier in the week than longer
term investment views. Financial stocks, with fortunes closely linked to the
performance of securities markets, advanced sharply.
Strong gains in short-dated government bonds again suggested that recent
selling has been overdone and that investors hope that the widely-predicted
rise in UK interest rates will be postponed for as long as possible.
Consumer stocks, which have been badly hurt in the market shakeout,
attracted support. Food retailers, pharmaceuticals, and leisure stocks were
all higher.

FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo speculation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With no signs of the emergence of a much-hoped for counter bidder for Lasmo,
many short-term speculators were said by dealers to have sold their Lasmo
shares although many others had paid a premium to marketmakers in order to
roll over holdings into the new account.
'There are no signs of a third party as yet and the hot money is beginning
to flow out of Lasmo,' said one marketmaker. Lasmo shares closed 2 easier at
142p. The implied value of the bid is now 19 per cent below the original
value of the offer from Enterprise Oil.
Adding to the discomfort of Lasmo speculators holding on for either a
counter offer or increased terms from Enterprise Oil was another slide in
the latter's shares which dropped 11 more to 382p. Enterprise have fallen
sharply since they launched the bid for Lasmo and were additionally weakened
yesterday by a 'sell' note from Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker.
Mr Steve Turner at Nomura said Enterprise's current offer is 'unlikely to
succeed unless it is sweetened by an element of cash.'
He added 'In the event that Enterprise is successful it is likely to involve
significant indigestion as the new shares hit the market and would dilute
earnings.'
A number of the big US investment banks were said to have been aggressive
buyers of the UK banks on the basis that the sector has been oversold this
year.
The heaviest action in the sector was via a big switching operation, said to
have been carried out by one of the US investment banks, involving Abbey
National and TSB, with the latter on the sell end of the deal. TSB shares
have underperformed the rest of the banks since reaching a peak 289p at the
end of January this year. At the close TSB were 5 weaker at 203 1/2 p after
turnover of 8.6m shares, while Abbey were always in demand and settled 6 up
at 416p with 4.9m shares traded.
Smith New Court slipped 2 to 352p but were buoyant earlier in the week as
dealers picked up hints of bumper preliminary profits later this month.
There were also stories that the securities house will move into the market
after its results to buy in its own shares in order to pay expected big
bonuses to its staff in shares.
Commercial Union was the centre of attention in composites with the shares
unsettled by the reemergence of stories that the group could be considering
a bid for Group Victoire, part of the Suez group of companies in France.
Dealers said rumours of a CU bid for Victoire had circulated in the market
several times during the past year and were generally sceptical of the
story. CU shares settled 3 off at 532p.
Other composites continued to respond to the recent spate of buy
recommendations. General Accident rose 9 to 587p and Royals 6 to 265p.
The recovery in Eurotunnel was again evident, with the fully-paid shares
surging 27 to 363p. The shares were the second worst performers in the
mid-cap 250 in May. The new nil-paid shares, which started trading on
Thursday, rose 17 to 60p.
Alfred McAlpine new nil-paids opened at 28p premium but quickly fell away,
eventually closing at 16p premium with the McAlpine family interests
rumoured to have sold their entitlement, some 2.3m shares. McAlpine 'old'
ended the session at 219p ex-rights.
Barcom shares more than halved, closing 30 down at 24p after the interim
loss.
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, dropped 13 to 543p, after 539p,
following the finance director's resignation.
Granada remained weak as worries continued over the group's acquisition
ambitions. The shares fell 8 to 494p. The company declared its interest in
taking control of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees at its results this week. The latter's
shares were again subject to strong buying interest, closing 9 ahead at
309p.
In a strong property sector, Great Portland improved 4 to 200p after
announcing a Pounds 58.5m deal.
A rise of 1 1/2 in Cadbury Schweppes to 456 1/2 p was helped by a buy note
from Strauss Turnbull.
The astonishing bull run by food retailer Greggs continued, with the shares
gaining a further 38 yesterday to 918p. Since acquiring the Bakers Oven
chain from Associated British Foods just over a week ago, the shares have
risen 15 per cent.
Dealers reported stock on offer in Shoprite and the shares slid 9 to 82p.
The stock has remained friendless since a profits warning a week ago.
There was another leap forward in Euro Disney following the news earlier
this week that a Saudi Arabian prince is to buy a stake of up to 25 per cent
in the theme park operator. The shares jumped 21 to 386p.
A positive recommendation from SG Warburg was said to have helped Scottish
and Newcastle, up 6 at 516p.

FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher overhang concern
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stories circulating around Kingfisher refused to die down yesterday as
the market continued to fret over the potential impact of an acute stock
overhang. More than 20m shares, used as part payment to Darty shareholders a
year ago when Kingfisher bought the French electrical retailer, can now be
sold under terms of the deal.
The French shareholders, a mixture of institutions, family interests and
Darty management, are thought to have been approached by a number of UK
brokers, keen to handle such a potentially large order.
According to market rumours, one international securities house which has
succeeded in purchasing a large tranche of Kingfisher shares - some say
around 5m - has already bought up all the stock lending facilities in
Kingfisher stock for the next month.
If true, and the share price were to rise, this could have the effect of
driving up the Kingfisher share price higher as other brokers were forced to
buy shares in the open market to cover positions instead of turning to stock
lending institutions - and give the original broker a handsome profit on the
price paid for the shares.
Upset by the Darty speculation and undermined by a cautious agm statement on
Tuesday, Kingfisher shares finished a miserable week a net 33 down, but a
penny better yesterday at 516p.

Derivatives markets continued to give good support to the recovery in the
underlying equity market, writes Terry Byland. Trading volume in the June
contract on the Footsie had jumped to more than 23,000 contracts in late
trading last night. However, the discount of the contract to the cash
market, which had been cut to four points in official trading hours, widened
to nearly 10 points in later deals.
Progress was erratic, however, with the discount narrowing at first but
widening later as investors reacted nervously to trends in US bond markets.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar climbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar climbed yesterday, buoyed by data showing a sharp drop in the
unemployment rate in May and by comments from US Treasury Secretary Lloyd
Bentsen, writes Graham Bowley.
Labour department figures showed that the US unemployment rate dropped to 6
per cent in May from 6.4 per cent in April. There was also an upward
revision to April's non-farm payroll number from 267,000 to 358,000.
Analysts said this was further evidence that the US economy is growing
strongly.
'This spells inflation,' said Mr Avinash Persaud of JP Morgan. 'The US
authorities will have to raise interest rates again soon to restore the
credibility of monetary policy.'
'Growth is above its long-run trend rate and, significantly, unemployment is
now below 6.3 per cent, the rate usually associated with full employment,'
said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS.
'Interest rates will soon have to move to a more neutral stance of around 5
per cent but even that may not be enough,' Mr Chertkow said.
But the rise in the non-farm payrolls in May of 191,000 was below
expectations. 'This was disappointing and suggests that the US economy is
beginning to lose momentum,' said Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at
Citibank. 'This gave heart to the Treasury market and it is the rally in the
bond market which has caused the dollar to climb.'
Analysts also pointed to remarks made by White House chief economist Laura
Tyson who cautioned against reading too much into the sharp drop in the rate
of unemployment.
Mr Bentsen, who was speaking after a Confederation of British Industry lunch
in London, said: 'I must say that the underlying fundamentals for the dollar
are excellent.'
Mr Chertkow said: 'This is further confirmation that the dollar debasement
has ended. One of the key factors in the recent dollar decline was the
belief in the markets that Bentsen and his colleagues were using the dollar
as a weapon against Japan.'
The dollar firmed in early trading ahead of the labour market data on
short-covering and because the US currency acted as a safe haven because of
concerns over North Korea. 'The dollar has tested critical levels today but
the key levels remain further away,' said Mr Chertkow. 'Further large gains
are unlikely until the US authorities act decisively on interest rates.'
The dollar closed yesterday at DM1.6665, up 1 1/2 pfennigs from DM1.6515 on
Thursday and higher at Y105.245 against Y104.93.
The pound gained ground, largely on the back of the strength of the dollar.
But analysts said that the Halifax house price index, published yesterday,
which showed a large fall in house prices in May, also helped sterling.
However, further gains would be difficult ahead of next week's European
elections. The pound finished the day at DM2.5074, up almost one pfennig
against the D-Mark.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 455m. The central bank had earlier provided Pounds 26m of liquidity
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m, revised upwards from Pounds
600m. Overnight money traded between 4 5/8 per cent and 7 1/2 per cent.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee down as grain
prices soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity markets enjoyed another rollercoaster ride this week with
Chicago's grain markets taking over the impetus from coffee on the softs
side. Heavy fund selling of coffee and copper pushed prices down mid-week
but both staged a partial recovery later.
The bank holiday in the US and UK on Monday gave traders time to worry about
weather prospects for the main US grain growing areas. Their fears sent corn
and soyabean prices at the Chicago Board of Trade soaring to daily limits at
the open of Tuesday trading.
Chicago traders are worried that a lack of rainfall at key growing stages
will damage the prospects for this year's crops leading to large shortfalls
in grain stocks.
Stocks are already depleted after flooding depressed last year's harvest.
On Tuesday July soyabean futures hit their daily limit of a 30-cent increase
to Dollars 6.73 1/4 per bushel. Although prices dipped again on Wednesday,
the market remains buoyed by unseasonably dry weather in the Midwest.
Soyabean prices were pushing the Dollars 7-a-bushel mark towards the end of
the week.
Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday as markets responded positively to data
which confirmed continuing strong demand in the US for petrol. Strong
economic growth in the US has pushed up petrol demand by 3 per cent over the
same period last year.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for July reached Dollars 16.72 a
barrel on Thursday, but later slipped below Dollars 16.50.
In spite of seeing a strong start to the week, the coffee market was nervous
with speculators and hedge funds eager to take profits from the market's
dramatic rise over the past few months. The sell-off materialised on
Wednesday when the London Commodity Exchange's robusta futures contract for
delivery in September slid by Dollars 56 a tonne to Dollars 2,035 a tonne.
Similarly, copper suffered from a bail-out by hedge funds and lost Dollars
39.50 a tonne at the London Metal Exchange to Dollars 2,227.50 a tonne on
the same day. However, traders are confident that coffee prices will remain
buoyed by tight supplies. Analysts expect supply to be constrained until the
new Brazilian crop comes to market in August.
By the end of the week, coffee had made up some of its earlier losses and
was trading around Dollars 2,100 a tonne. Copper had also staged a partial
recovery with LME stocks showing another drawdown and prices rising Dollars
29 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 2,232 a tonne.
Nickel prices tumbled on the LME following the weekend agreement about a new
contract between Inco, the world's second-largest nickel producer, and
labour leaders at its Sudbury, Ontario, metals complex.
Sudbury produces about 110,000 tonnes of nickel a year and, although some
weeks ago a ballot gave union leaders a mandate to call a strike, the market
did not expect there would be industrial action. Nevertheless, confirmation
that employees had accepted terms for a new contract just before the old one
ended on May 31, resulted in prices falling quite sharply.
Analysts suggest the outlook for nickel is not wildly bullish. For example,
the CRU International consultancy group sees western world nickel production
rising by 40,000 tonnes to 576,400 tonnes this year and consumption rising
by 4 per cent to 695,400. But it also predicts a 6,000-tonne rise in Russian
nickel exports to the west to 123,700 tonnes which would give a supply
surplus of about 10,400 tonnes.

During the week prices of both black and white pepper went up drastically,
reports Man-Producten. Improving demand from American buyers for larger
quantities sent up prices in India and Indonesia immediately which indicates
how thin the market is these days. In the US market spot black pepper
improved to about USDollars 85/lb and in Europe the grade 1 went up to about
USDollars 1,750. The white pepper price went up to about USDollars 2,950
spot and nearby shipment positions. Since the new crop white pepper can only
be expected as from August onwards and spot stocks in Europe and the USA are
really small we might expect still higher levels.

FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hutchison takes over UK port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hutchison Whampoa, the diversified Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr
Li Ka-shing, has moved to take full control of Britain's Felixstowe
container port.
The company - through its newly-created Hutchison International Port
Holdings - has paid Orient Overseas International Pounds 50m (Dollars 75.2m)
for the 25 per cent of Port of Felixstowe that Hutchison did not own.
Hutchison is the world's largest independent operator of container
terminals. The Felixstowe deal gives it full control of Europe's fourth
largest container port and one which handles 38 per cent of Britain's
container trade.
The company's main focus is on port facilities in China and Hong Kong. It
owns 77.5 per cent of Hongkong International Terminals which is responsible
for handling 50 per cent of the container traffic in the colony, itself the
world's busiest container port.
In China, Hutchison recently added a port development project in Shantou, a
special economic zone in Guangdong, to an impressive list of ventures under
way on the mainland. It is developing container port facilities in Shenzhen
and Zhuhai, the two main special economic zones in Guangdong, as well as in
Shanghai.
Meanwhile, Hutchison appears to have opted for bank finance to fund its
capital-hungry telecommunications subsidiary in Britain. According to local
press reports the company wants to raise a three-year Pounds 500m loan for
its Orange mobile telephone subsidiary, in which it has a 65 per cent share.
The loan is priced at 55 basis points over Libor and is fully guaranteed by
Hutchison. Barclays and NatWest Markets arranged the loan. Barclays owns 5
per cent of Hutchison's UK telecoms subsidiary and British Aerospace 30 per
cent.

FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: US media groups agree Dollars
2.3bn cable TV deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Times Mirror, the US media group, has agreed in principle to sell its cable
television operations to Cox Enterprises for about Dollars 2.3bn.
In a statement issued yesterday , Times Mirror said it was in 'serious
discussions' with Cox. 'We do have an agreement in principle,' the company
said, 'but a definitive agreement has not yet been executed or delivered.'
Previously, Times Mirror had indicated it was reconsidering its role in the
cable TV business. The group derives about 15 per cent of its revenues from
its television and cable operations and is the 11th largest US cable TV
system operator with 1.2m subscribers. Times Mirror is also a leading
publisher of newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and New York
Newsday.
Atlanta-based Cox is currently the sixth largest US cable TV company, with
more than 1.7m subscribers in 17 states. The privately-held group also owns
several newspapers including the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as well as
television and radio stations. The group's revenues last year were Dollars
2.3bn and it employs about 31,000.
Combined, the cable TV operations of both companies would form the third
largest US cable TV company, after TeleCommunications and Time Warner.
The tentative deal between Cox and Times Mirror follows the collapse, in
April, of a planned investment in Cox by Southwestern Bell, the large
Texas-based local telephone company. Southwestern had planned to buy a 40
per cent stake in Cox's cable TV operations for Dollars 1.6bn.
The companies blamed 'increasingly stringent government regulation of the
cable TV industry' for the termination of their agreement. In February, the
Federal Communications Commission ordered US cable TV companies to comply
with new regulations on their rates for basic cable TV services.
If the sale of its cable TV operations is completed, it will be the second
large asset sale by Times Mirror. Last year the Los Angeles-based group
completed the sale of its four TV stations for Dollars 335m.
Times Mirror's shares opened late yesterday at Dollars 35 1/4 against
Thursday's close of Dollars 32.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The DG Bank, the central bank for Germany's 2,900 co-operative banks which
has been restructuring since 1991, will be in a position to pay a dividend
next year, according to Mr Bernd Thiemann, chief executive.
Mr Thiemann said that 1994 should be seen as a bridge-year leading to a
lasting improvement in the bank's profitability.
The turnround could only be described as complete, he explained, when the
bank was generating big enough profits to finance a pay-out to shareholders.
That was unlikely to be until 1995, Mr Thiemann said, although profits for
the parent bank during the current year were likely to be in the same order
of magnitude as in 1993, when the bank made total operating profits of
DM364m (Dollars 217.9m) before provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Group partial operating profits before provisions rose 7.2 per cent to
DM1.18bn last year.
In the first quarter of the current year, partial operating profits -
excluding trading profits - were DM60m, slightly ahead of last year.

<TEXT>
Fiat Auto Poland yesterday signed loan and equity agreements worth DM288.5m
(Dollars 168m) to help finance the expansion and modernisation of its car
factory in Bielsko Biala, in Poland.
Fiat took over the debt-laden plant two years ago and sales last year
reached DM1.67bn, including exports of 150,000 Cinquecento cars to western
Europe.
Now the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has agreed to take
a DM66m stake in the plant along with Simest, an Italian state-funded
corporation which is to invest DM16.5m. This leaves Fiat with about 83 per
cent of the equity.
At the same time, the EBRD is to provide 65 per cent of a DM140m loan
syndicated to a group of western European banks of which the majority, such
as ING of the Netherlands and Creditanstalt of Austria, have branches in
Warsaw.
The package was completed with another DM66.0m loan syndicated by the
state-owned Polish Development Bank in the largest commercial syndication
organised in the country to date.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) provided DM17.5m of the Polish
Development Bank's syndication. This represents the first tranche of
DM67m-worth of financing the EIB has committed to Fiat Auto Poland.
Fiat is planning to develop a new small car for production at Bielsko over
the next four years under a DM1bn business plan due to run to the end of the
century. Fiat's investment to date in its Polish subsidiary amounts to
DM437m.

FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Alfa's fading badge gets a
polish - Fiat is reviving one of Italy's most famous marques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfa Romeo, one of Italy's most famous - but in recent years most troubled -
carmakers, is poised for a re-launch by its owner, Fiat.
A programme is under way to expand Alfa's European dealership network by 20
per cent - requiring the appointment of more than 200 extra dealers - to
prepare for new models starting in the autumn.
According to Mr Paolo Cantarella, managing director of Fiat Auto, the first
of the new range, a Ford Escort-sized sporting hatchback designated the 145,
is scheduled to enter the showrooms in September.
It will be followed by four other Alfa Romeo models by early 1996 under an
investment programme which since the Italian motor group acquired Alfa Romeo
in 1987 has totalled about L5,000bn (Dollars 3bn), says Mr Cantarella.
He insists that there will be no let-up in the Alfa Romeo investment
programme in spite of the problems besetting the parent company.
Fiat ran up a net loss of L1,783bn in 1993, its biggest ever. Fiat Auto, the
main operating division which includes Fiat, Lancia, Ferrari and commercial
vehicle maker Iveco as well as Alfa Romeo, lost L1,756bn.
The Alfa investment is relatively small set against a new model and plant
programme for the automotive division as a whole which totals L40,000bn. It
is seen by many industry observers as a last ditch attempt by Fiat to secure
a long-term, independent future for the group in Europe's vehicle industry.
About half of this sum has been committed, according to Mr Cantarella.
Alfa produced 130,000 cars last year, compared with a peak of 220,000 in
1989. While sales of Fiat-badged cars fell by 0.3 per cent in the first four
months of this year - compared with a rise of 3.8 per cent for the European
new car market as a whole - Alfa Romeo's sales fell by 14.9 per cent.
For the first time, Alfa Romeo is to launch its new car in all left-hand
drive European markets simultaneously. The 145 will go on sale in September
and other 145 versions will be added by the end of the year.
An all-new Spyder convertible and new coupe will be added in 1995, followed
by a flagship luxury saloon and a replacement for the current Alfa 155
medium saloon.
Mr Cantarella refused to project the size of increase in Alfa Romeo
production to result from the new model programme. 'But I can assure you
that we will recover the investment we are making,' he said.
To further support Alfa's relaunch as a sporting marque, Mr Cantarella is
spending Dollars 40m this year on motor racing - more than Dollars 10m in
the UK to compete in the British Touring Car Championship.
'Sport is not an option for Alfa Romeo - to invest in racing is essential,'
he says.
Fiat is hoping to inject life into its Lancia executive cars unit, which has
also seen a 10 per cent sales fall so far this year, through an expansion
into the multi-passenger vehicle (MPV) market in collaboration with Peugeot
Citroen of France.
It has put on sale a Lancia version of the MPV in which the two partners
have invested some Dollars 1.5bn at their Sevel vans joint venture plant in
Italy's Mezzogiorno and at Sevel Nord, a new plant near Valenciennes in
northern France.
Sevel is an acronym for Societe Europeene de Vehicules Legers, set up in
1978 with both Fiat and Peugeot holding 50 per cent share stakes. The plants
have the same ownership structure but the French group has management
control of the MPV facility and the Italian group retains management control
of the vans plant.
Both Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot's chairman, and Mr Cantarella say they are
considering further collaboration. However, Mr Cantarella makes clear that
this is on a project basis and that there is no prospect of closer financial
or equity links.

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hawtal Whiting, the motor industry design and engineering consultancy, is to
raise Pounds 5m through a rights issue to reduce borrowings and finance
further expansion.
The move was announced as it reported a return to profit after being badly
hit by the world motor industry recession in 1992 which saw several rivals
go into receivership.
Turnover rose 23 per cent to Pounds 69.6m in 1993 on which pre-tax profit
was Pounds 761,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 2.18m. Losses per share
were cut to 2.2p (39.6p).
Mr John Whitecross, chairman, forecast further growth in North America and

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins drives Acorn down to
Pounds 115,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher component costs and increased competition drove margins down at Acorn
Computer Group, contributing to a sharp fall in annual profits.
Although revenues in the 12 months to December 31 rose 13 per cent to Pounds
54.3m (Pounds 48.2m), operating profits fell from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds
104,000 and the pre-tax line was Pounds 115,000, against Pounds 1.31m.
Earnings per share fell to 0.2p (2p).
The shares dropped 14p to 76p.
The company, controlled by Olivetti of Italy, remains the principal supplier
of computers to schools in the UK. Gross profit margins fell by 5 per cent
as the cost of key components, especially semiconductors, rose. Profits were
further hit by the Pounds 700,000 cost of establishing a new operation in
Germany.
Mr Ernesto Musumeci, chairman, said Germany was an important potential
market and that the investment had been important for the company's
longer-term development. Revenues from the new operation had, however, been
affected badly by the recession.
He thought it unlikely that margins would recover because of competitive
pressures and was taking steps to reduce overheads accordingly.
The company benefited from a Pounds 183,000 contribution to profits from
Advanced Risc Machines, a semiconductor company in which Acorn has a 42.86
per cent stake. ARM develops products that are being used, among others, by
Apple Computer of the US and Samsung Electronics of Korea.
Mr Musumeci said the company would continue to address the home computer
user as well as the schools market. It has launched a range of machines -
Risc PC - able to run both Acorn operating software and operating systems
from other suppliers and suited to publishing and interactive multimedia.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Barcom shares dive 30p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Barcom, the civil engineering and plant hire group, plunged 30p to
24p yesterday on news of a swing from profits of Pounds 757,000 to losses of
Pounds 1.49m pre-tax for the six months ended March 31.
First half turnover, however, improved from Pounds 13m to Pounds 15.3m.
Mr John Pinckard, chairman, said there had been a 'significant setback' in
the past few months. He also said there had been a need to reorganise
Hawkins, the plant hire fleet acquired early in 1993.
The reorganisation of Hawkins amounted to Pounds 716,000 and was taken above
the line. Pre-tax profits were also affected by a rise in interest charges
from Pounds 420,000 to Pounds 944,000.
The 'early promise' shown by Hawkins had not been sustained and the
'anticipated profitable utilisation' of the acquired plant fleet had 'not
been achieved'. Mr Pinckard said the effect of the problems encountered was
exacerbated, and to a considerable extent hidden, by persistent wet weather
over the winter months.
Losses per share of 8.5p compared with earnings of 4.05p. The interim
dividend is passed - 1.25p was paid previously.
In spite of pit closures, the group's predominantly coal industry business
had continued to make a positive contribution. The diversification of this
business into the power generation field and to other non-British Coal
customers was continuing as planned.
Mr Pinckard said that with the achievement of a more balanced plant fleet
and a lower level of operating costs there was a reasonable expectation that
levels of business normally experienced in the summer months should result
in a 'much improved' outcome in the second half.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Mattel bids Pounds 52m for Spear - The
scrap over Scrabble gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between America's two leading toy makers moved to the Scrabble
board yesterday after Mattel trumped Hasbro's bid for JW Spear, the word
game's UK maker.
In the corporate finance equivalent of getting all seven letters out on a
triple word score, Spear's advisers solicited a Pounds 52m bid from Mattel
which was launched just five minutes before Thursday night's deadline.
The offer of Pounds 10 a share beats the 900p bid from Hasbro and was
immediately welcomed by Spear's board. However, Action Man maker Hasbro,
which has the rights to Scrabble in North America, is widely expected to
return with a higher offer.
'There must be a pretty good chance,' admitted a member of the Mattel team.
The scrap over Scrabble continues a rivalry which spilled over into the law
courts 18 months ago when Mattel claimed Hasbro's Sindy doll looked too
similar to its own Barbie. Mattel dropped its lawsuit after Hasbro agreed to
give Sindy a facelift.
Hasbro, which has held a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear since 1990, launched
its bid after it received undertakings to accept the offer from Spear family
trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings were to
become irrevocable if a higher offer was not received by midnight on
Thursday. The trusts have little option but to accept the highest bid.
The original bid split Spear's boardroom with Mr Francis Spear, chairman,
saying it was 'fair and reasonable' and the other directors dismissing it as
'totally inadequate'.
Although welcoming the new offer Mr Spear has yet to join the other
directors in advising shareholders that the Mattel offer 'represents a
better prospect for the future development of the business of Spear'.
Mr Spear is close to the Hassenfeld family which founded Hasbro but the rest
of the management are understood to be worried that Spear would disappear
within Hasbro's international games business.
In contrast, Spear would be the first sizeable move into board games for
Mattel, which has previously expressed interest in the area. This made it a
natural target for Barings, Spear's advisers, when searching for a rival
bidder. Mattel finally responded at 5pm and Robert Fleming, its swiftly
appointed merchant bank, launched the bid six hours later.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's
offer represents 18.4 times Spear's earnings last year.

   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spargo Consulting is coming to the market by way of a placing which values
the computer software consultancy based in London's Docklands at about
Pounds 11.9m.
Some 3.18m shares, approximately 25 per cent of the issued share capital,
have been placed by Peel Hunt at 95p each.
All the shares were sold by existing shareholders and no money has been
raised for the company. Dealings are expected to begin on June 9.
Founded in 1989 by Mr Tony Spargo and Mr Bob Morton, chief executive and
chairman respectively, the company specialises in the design, implementation
and enhancement (maintenance) of software for large companies. Clients
include Bank of America, Bupa, Conoco and Elf.
In the 1993 year, the company made profits before tax of Pounds 483,000 on
turnover of Pounds 4.87m. Directors forecast that, excluding unforeseen
circumstances, profits before tax in the six months to end-June 1994 will be
not less than Pounds 600,000, giving earnings per share of 3.1p.
They anticipate a maiden interim dividend of not less than 1.6p, which would
represent a notional gross yield, at the placing price, of more than 2 per
cent for the half year.
Over the full year, analysts are suggesting a p/e of about 14.

Dale Electric International put out conflicting signals to shareholders
yesterday when it announced that an approach had been made which might lead
to an offer for the company, but followed this up with a profits warning.
The share price of the power systems manufacturer reacted accordingly,
rising 12p to 79p on news of the potential offer but falling back to close
at 71p.
The company stated that it was preparing a restructuring which was 'likely
to involve a material reduction in the value of the group's net assets as at
May 1 1994' and would result in heavier losses than anticipated. This
announcements came less than three months after it launched a Pounds 5m
rights issue to reduce debt and improve productivity.
Dale gave no indication of the nature of the offer, but it emphasised that
'discussions are at a very preliminary stage'.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pricing puts value of Pounds 45m on Amey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Amey Holdings, one of the UK's largest private construction
companies and the sixth biggest roadbuilder, were priced at 161p yesterday
valuing the group at Pounds 45m.
It is coming to market via a placing of 8.07m shares - representing 28.9 per
cent of the enlarged capital - with institutional investors. This will raise
Pounds 10m of new money for the company and Pounds 3m for existing holders.
Existing holders had hoped to raise Pounds 10m but scaled back their share
sale in the light of market conditions.
The Pounds 3m will be split equally between Close Brothers, which held a 25
per cent stake on behalf of some 30 investment institutions, and Amey's
existing directors and managers.
Mr Neil Ashley, chairman, said 'It has always been our intention to seek a
listing for Amey at this stage of the group's development. We are delighted,
in current market conditions, to have achieved our objective of raising
Pounds 10m of new money in order to strengthen the capital base of the
company and fund its future development.'
The company, previously part of the ARC building materials and construction
group, was briefly a Hanson subsidiary when ARC was acquired from
Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson in August 1989. Amey was then sold by
Hanson for Pounds 6.5m to a management group led by Mr Ashley.
Amey reported pre-tax profits on its continuing businesses of Pounds 4.7m
(Pounds 3.4m) last year on group sales of Pounds 210m (Pounds 162.5m). The
issue is sponsored by Barings and James Capel will act as broker. Dealings
are due to begin on June 10.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: DMGT's Pounds 93m for Nottingham newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail, yesterday emerged
as the victor in a controlled auction for T Bailey Forman, publisher of the
Nottingham Evening Post.
The group paid Pounds 92.9m cash for the Nottingham group and an associated
printing company, and beat off challenges from Emap, the newspaper and
magazine publisher, and the recently-floated Midland Independent Newspapers,
publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail.
The auction, organised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, produced a higher price
than widely expected, with the sum, 29 times earnings, being in line with
the valuation of a number of other regional newspaper groups coming out of
recession.
Two factors tended to push the price up - the fact that the company is one
of the most significant regional evening newspaper groups still in private
hands, and that DMGT has newspapers in the region in both Derby and
Leicester.
The completion of the sale is subject to the deal being cleared by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The aim is to make the business part of
Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional newspaper business of DMGT.
Mr Nicholas Forman Hardy, chairman of Forman Hardy Holdings, said yesterday
that his family's association with the Nottingham Evening Post dated back to
1878.
'The decision to sell the business has been a particularly difficult one to
make for me and my fellow shareholders', he added.
Some close to the sale believe that Mr Forman Hardy may now be more
interested in farming and land-owning than running a newspaper group. The
fact that the Nottingham Evening Post was in the vanguard of the
introduction of new technology in the 1970s probably means a degree of
re-equipping is now needed.
In the year to the end of 1993 the business made unaudited pre-tax profits
of Pounds 4.8m on turnover of Pounds 24.8m.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Weak market forces UPF to reduce flotation
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPF Group, the manufacturer of vehicle chassis frames, has cut the value of
its flotation by one third to Pounds 40.9m as a result of the weak new
issues market.
The Pounds 20m reduction in its valuation is another disappointment for a
company which has struggled since it won its independence through a Pounds
32m management buy-out from the collapsed Parkfield Group in 1990.
It was forced to refinance in 1992 because of bad debts and significant
problems with a new production line.
The refinancing diluted the management stake from 21 per cent to 4 per cent.
The past 18 months, however, have seen substantial growth in its core
business, manufacturing chassis for the 4x4 market, primarily for the Land
Rover Discovery and Vauxhall/Opel Frontera.
These account for 70 per cent of turnover, and UPF remains significantly
dependent on continued growth of the 4x4 market.
Mr Keith Evans, chairman and chief executive, said that BMW's acquisition of
the Rover group provided scope for increased sales, through improved
distribution in both the North American and German markets.
The company will raise Pounds 7.5m after expenses from the placing of 7.87m
new shares, out of the total 17.88m share placement, priced at 108p each.
The funds will help reduce bank debt to Pounds 5.5m.
Mr Evans and Mr Tim Bell, finance director, are selling half their 1.73m
shareholding, raising Pounds 933,736, compared with the original Pounds
75,000 cost of the entire stake.
The remaining shares are being sold by the venture capitalists, primarily
Phildrew Ventures.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m are forecast for the 12 months to end-August,
against Pounds 1.5m in 1992 and losses in the previous two years.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BZW criticised over Shoprite placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional shareholders have expressed concern over a recent BZW-led
placement of preference shares on behalf of Shoprite, the discount food
retail group.
It has emerged that BZW, sponsor to the issue and lead agent, retained 20
per cent of the Pounds 15m cumulative redeemable preference shares without
making this clear to subscribing institutions.
'If they had told us that they were going to end up with 3m shares then
there is no way that we would have taken any,' one fund manager said.
'The market's clear understanding of this placement was that they would end
up with some but nothing like this amount,' said another institutional
investor.
Credit Lyonnais Laing also acted as placing agents on the issue but only for
a small number of shares. Insiders say it did not retain any shares itself.
BZW's holding is revealed in the share register for Shoprite Finance (UK),
part of the Shoprite group which is based in the Isle of Man.
More than 3m shares were alloted to Wedd Jefferson, a nominee company used
by BZW. The holding has been reduced although BZW would not give any
details.
Since BZW's placement of the cumulative redeemable preference shares in
February the price of Shoprite shares has fallen from 100p to 88p.
Two weeks ago the company was forced to bring forward publication of its
interim results from mid-June because profits for the period were
substantially below expectations.
The company announced that operating profits had fallen by 17 per cent from
Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.02m while turnover for the six months to May 1 rose
by 59 per cent, from Pounds 66m to Pounds 105m.
BZW said yesterday: 'To retain 20 per cent of a placement is not unusual. We
never make it clear how much we will retain.' At least part of BZW's holding
was for price stabilisation.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo ordered to stop Enterprise
accusations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE, PEGGY HOLLINGER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent explorer subject to a Pounds 1.2bn hostile bid from
Enterprise Oil, has been told to stop repeating its accusation that
Enterprise had '. . . breached UK accounting standards'.
The move by the Takeover Panel is the second in a week which seeks to
clarify allegations by Lasmo over Enterprise's record.
Yesterday's statement related to a Lasmo document issued last month in which
Enterprise was accused of contravening UK accounting practices in its
treatment of acquisitions.
Lasmo said Enterprise's actions inflated earnings.
The Panel said it could not rule on the validity of the accusation.
But Lasmo should have used '. . . less definitive terms'.
The panel is believed to have been comfortable with the general tenor of the
document, which raises questions about the bidder's earnings record.
It is merely the conclusion, which might have implied there could only be
one accounting treatment for certain acquisitions, which caused a problem.
It is believed to be the first time the panel has had to rule on such a
precise allegation.
The panel said there was no dispute over the right of the companies to raise
accounting issues.
But it noted that 'Enterprise received unqualified audit opinions throughout
the relevant period,' and that '. . . Lasmo should have noted the
possibility of alternative views' on the way companies choose to treat
acquisitions in their books.
Enterprise said it was 'delighted' with the Panel's response. Mr Andrew
Shilston, finance director, said Lasmo's attack was 'a dead issue. Now we
can move back to having an intelligent debate with the institutions' over
the merits of the Pounds 1.2bn bid.
Lasmo disagreed, however, saying its claims that Enterprise had inflated
earnings remained a live issue and called into question the value of the
company's all-paper offer.
Institutional investors said that the retraction reflected well on neither
Lasmo nor Enterprise.
'We think the arguments on both sides have been of fairly low quality to
date,' said one. The strength of the allegation that Enterprise could have
breached accounting standards was blamed on Sir Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo
chairman, who 'just likes to fight dirty and create a big hooha'.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington sells insulation arm to
Owens-Corning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington has taken another step in reducing its debt and refocusing on its
core glass business through the Pounds 73.3m sale of Pilkington Insulation
to Owens-Corning, the US fibreglass group.
The disposal had been expected, but analysts said Pilkington had achieved a
good price for a company with net assets of Pounds 50m and pre-tax profits
of Pounds 3m. Owens-Corning will also assume Pounds 7m of financial leases.
Pilkington Insulation manufactures and sells rock wool and fibreglass for
the building and industrial insulation market in the UK, and has a large
share of a relatively mature market.
Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said: 'We didn't own the technology, and
we were restricted to the UK market, which is growing slowly.' He estimated
that the market would continue to grow at between 2 cent and 3 per cent a
year.
However, it provides a strategic entry to the UK market for Owens-Corning,
which has already established a substantial presence in continental Europe.
Pilkington Insulation will be renamed Owens-Corning Building Products (UK).
Mr Warren Knowlton, who will head the business, said: 'The deal gives us a
50 per cent share of a large market, excellent sales and manufacturing
capability, and the ability to leverage our existing technology in the
future'.
Owens-Corning is capitalised at Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) with insulation as
one of its core businesses. Mr Knowlton said it would continue to expand the
UK business, which should secure jobs for the 900 employees at Pilkington
Insulation.
The sale of the company continues a chain of divestments by Pilkington to
fulfil its stated aim of reducing gearing from a mid-1993 peak of close to
90 per cent to 50 per cent by March next year. Last September it sold Sola,
its spectacle lens business, for Pounds 200m and it has announced plans to
sell off 49 per cent of its Australian operations through a flotation.
The latest disposal will reduce gearing by about 8 per cent. Analysts expect
a number of other trading and service companies could be sold over the next
year.
Pilkington is due to announce its full year results on Thursday.

plus ca change . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RAYMOND NOTTAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Three bootleggers jailed for cross-Channel racket' (May
28/29), calls to mind the following passages in a letter sent by Tobias
Smollett from Boulogne in September 1763:
'The shopkeepers here drive a considerable traffic with the English
smugglers, whose cutters are almost the only vessels one sees in the harbour
of Boulogne.
'The smugglers from the coast of Kent and Sussex pay English gold for great
quantities of French brandy, tea, coffee and small wine, which they run from
this country.
'The custom-house officers are very watchful, and make a great number of
seizures; nevertheless the smugglers . . . are said to indemnify themselves
if they save one cargo out of three.
'After all, the best way to prevent smuggling is to lower the duties upon
the commodities which are thus introduced. I have been told that the revenue
upon tea has increased since the duty upon it was diminished.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Man in the News: Mythic hero's princely sum - Prince
al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz / The Saudi royal who has come to the
rescue of Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a prince, of course, to conjure up princely sums. But it takes a
very modern prince to invest them profitably in global banking and leading
US department stores, turn around a debt-laden Saudi Arabian bank and manage
a panoply of contracting, retail and property businesses.
Enter Prince al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz, 39-year-old nephew of King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia, grandson both of Saudi Arabia's founding monarch and
Lebanon's first prime minister, billionaire businessman and, this week,
financial saviour of Euro Disney.
Prince al-Waleed announced that he would buy up to 24 per cent of Euro
Disney, owner of the troubled EuroDisneyland outside Paris. He thus became,
to the joy of headline writers, the prince from the mysterious, silent
kingdom of flowing robes and mythical private wealth who swooped to rescue
the failing European outpost of the 20th-century's most potent purveyor of
fairy-tales.
But who is this latest Disney hero? And what is his mission? Prince
al-Waleed will not reveal this before autumn, when Image Sept, his French
public relations company, says it will 'launch' a series of interviews aimed
at presenting him as a businessman to be taken seriously in his own right,
not just for his royal connections. But this has been clear for some time.
It became apparent in 1991, when Prince al-Waleed snapped up Dollars
590m-worth of convertible stock in Citicorp in one of the biggest placements
with a private investor in US banking history. Early last year it emerged
that the prince had also snaffled an 11 per cent stake in Saks Fifth Avenue,
the US department store group. This year he teamed up with Accor, the French
hotel group, in a pending FFr1.6bn bid for Air France's Meridien chain. Then
came Euro Disney.
But his business reputation was established in Saudi Arabia before these
forays into the western business world. By the end of the 1980s Prince
al-Waleed had turned Dollars 15,000 granted in 1980 by his father, Prince
Talal bin Abdulaziz, into a figure he claimed surpassed Dollars 1bn. His
vehicle was Kingdom Establishment, a construction contractor, with which he
cashed in on Saudi Arabia's modernising spree during the early 1980s oil
boom.
Some in the kingdom wonder privately how, even given the dizzy spending of
those years, Prince al-Waleed managed to reap so fabulous a fortune from so
modest a start-up. But none among his friends or colleagues doubts for an
instant Prince al-Waleed's business acumen, or that he is quickly becoming
the consummate product of his generation of young, western-educated Saudis.
He appears as comfortable in a sharp suit and a New York boardroom as in a
white dishdasha robe and the hush of his 130-room Riyadh palace.
Like most Saudis his private life remains just that. He enjoys squash and
reads voraciously. A francophile, he intends to base his European operations
in France, home of his mother and aunt. He summers with his wife and two
children on the Cote d'Azur, where his yacht, Acajou - previous owners Mr
Donald Trump and Mr Adnan Kashoggi - is moored at St Tropez.
But work dominates his life. 'The first three things he will talk about are
business, business and business,' says one friend. And his work ethic is
fabled in Riyadh, where he spends most working days managing United Saudi
Commercial Bank. Although it is one of the kingdom's smallest banks, it is
becoming one of its most profitable under the prince's ownership (earnings
were up 25 per cent in 1993). 'He sets himself a very precise agenda for
each day,' says an associate. 'And you can set your watch by his arrival at
the office.'
His business meetings are notoriously crisp and shorn of customary Saudi
ceremonial: 'No coffee, no tea, no time for chat. Just business, and fast,'
says a colleague. He is notably solicitous to his staff: he reached into his
own pocket for the severance pay of employees he sacked while streamlining
USCB.
And, say colleagues, his business strategies are straightforward. In his
international investments - Citicorp, Saks and now Euro Disney - he looks
for big deals at bargain prices. The Citicorp investment was a 'classic
bottom-fishing expedition', says one banker. 'He took a good look, reckoned
the bank was undervalued, and pounced.' When he cut his stake last year to
9.9 per cent from 14 per cent, he netted Dollars 268m on the shares - two
and a half times what he paid for them.
His associates put the Euro Disney deal in this bracket. But they say the
venture's high profile will also have appealed to the prince. 'He's a
showman,' says a banker involved with the Disney talks. 'Look at the deals
he's done - Saks, Accor and now Disney. This guy likes to be in the
limelight.'
His Saudi concerns also have a simple pattern: he is attracted to
underperforming businesses in growth sectors, where he believes application
of US management principles will produce a turnround. 'He uses his bank,'
says one banker, 'as a sort of super-graduate training ground for these
ideas,' relying on his good name to attract high-calibre managers. Last year
Prince al-Waleed bought a majority share in Panda, an ailing retail chain in
the kingdom, for his next corporate resuscitation attempt.
The prince has made no secret of his ambition to become one of the world's
richest men, and a revered deal-maker. But it is his status within the Saudi
royal circle which, many colleagues suggest, provides a better explanation
of his motives - and also probably of his ability to summon vast amounts of
cash apparently at will.
He has won a considerable reputation within Saudi Arabia, and great
confidence within the royal family. One result of this, say associates, is
that the bottom of Prince al-Waleed's pockets need not prove the limit to
his available resources. Bankers and businessmen in Riyadh say there are
other wealthy royals, shy of publicity, who are happy to back a project with
the prince's name on it. 'There's nothing they like more than backing a
winner,' says one businessman. 'He's therefore got virtually unlimited
access to funds.'
It is this high-profile position as a trusted business figurehead for the
kingdom which the prince relishes above all, for family reasons. His father,
Prince Talal, was one of the heretical 'Free Princes' in the 1960s, who
embraced socialism, criticised the ruling family as undemocratic and called
for a constitutional monarchy. He was, for years, exiled and ostracised.
Prince Talal has since been fully rehabilitated into the al-Saud fold. But
many see the son's ambitions in the light of the father's past, and wonder
whether Prince al-Waleed's greatest desire is to establish his branch of the
family beyond any question at the heart of the kingdom.
'He wants above all,' says a businessman close to him, 'to be a prince
acting as a prince should - he's showing leadership qualities, and
generosity. He's quicker, richer, faster-thinking than others, and he
aspires to grow more.' In short, he aspires to be the quintessential modern
prince. Walt himself would probably have approved.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Federalism argument must be
confronted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORRIS MCWHIRTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The timely letter from the chief economist of the Bank of Ireland (May
31) points out that the agenda for economic and monetary union in Europe is
driven by political (especially federalist) aspirations which have little to
do with economics.
As those who promote federalism know perfectly well, economic union
inevitably leads to political union. Just as a family loses its independence
if its household budget is controlled by outsiders, so a nation loses its
freedom of action if decisions about taxation, public expenditure and
monetary policy are transferred to supranational institutions - in this
case, European ones.
The Maastricht Treaty ('Treaty on European Union') commits the EU to the
creation of a single currency by 1999. That alone practically guarantees the
development of a federal state and therefore a common European government.
Can Britain remain 'at the heart of Europe' - to use the prime minister,
John Major's phrase - without being pushed by these pressures down the road
to political union?
If Mr Major remains unwilling to put such an important constitutional issue
to the people in a referendum, it is vital that he sets aside considerations
of tactics and timing and starts to articulate a conceptually clear
understanding of the arguments for national self-governance versus
federalism. This debate should be open, honest and immediate. It should not
be obscured by the party political battle for seats in the European
Parliament which, in this context, is irrelevant.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: NVQs: teething problems, but real
progress too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH PITMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Over the last 10 years or so the UK has built an effective vocational
training structure that did not exist before. Like any new industry, it is
having teething problems, but real progress is being made, with the
Americans and Germans, for example, looking at our achievements with
respect.
The statement in the House of Commons last week that 'inadequacies in NVQ
(national vocational qualification) training systems are proving immensely
frustrating for the many thousands of honourable and decent people who work
in training nationally and in JHP Centres throughout the country', while
clearly supportive, neglected to recognise that these are very new systems
in the early stages of development ('Bogus NVQ claims raise alarm', June 1).
As the country's largest work-based training organisation, JHP has 1,200
training staff with extremely wide-ranging and demanding responsibilities.
These cover not only the instruction of 10,000 young people and adults a
year, but also guidance, counselling and support, together with arrangement
of work placements for them with 7,000 companies, and monitoring and
assessment of them in the workplace.
We work in partnership with the Training and Enterprise Councils and local
enterprise companies to enable people to achieve permanent employment
through the learning of vocational skills and attainment of qualifications.
Above all, we are in the job creation business.
NVQs were designed to set occupationally based standards, to recognise
competence in the workplace and to provide a ladder of achievement. Much has
been accomplished in work-based vocational training; we must now ensure that
the development of a well-conceived qualification system is taken forward by
use of uniform systems and procedures.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason for such fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RORY CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to the letter from the self-proclaimed 'silent industrial
majority' on supporting Europe (May 31), there is absolutely no evidence to
support their fear that European employment legislation would lead to higher
unemployment. In fact, the type of legislation proposed is a compromise that
is less rigid than the legislation in existence in many European countries
where unemployment is as low or lower than in the UK. And why would granting
rights to employees, such as works councils, be damaging to competitiveness?
Are we to believe that Germany and the Netherlands are not competitive?
However, it seems that the industrialists are happy to keep alive the
British tradition of social confrontation that has helped to wreck industry
in the UK. Unfortunately for the silent majority, the European legislation
is considered necessary precisely because, it seems, most industrialists do
not recognise 'the responsibilities of industry to its employees'.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Loaded dice in the cosmic void: The chances of something
going bump in the night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are you more likely to die in an aircraft crash or in a cataclysmic
collision between the earth and an object from space?
Amazingly, the two risks are similar - about 1 in 20,000 for an average
American - according to the latest astronomical calculations.
Although aircraft crashes kill hundreds of people a year and there is no
authenticated record of anyone on earth ever being hit by a heavenly body,
once every million years or so a collision with a comet or asteroid does
enough damage to wipe out a large fraction of the world's population. Over
the long term, therefore, the statistical hazard from cosmic catastrophes is
comparable to that from familiar natural and man-made disasters.
Astronomers expect to view a similar impact in mid-July - from a safe
distance of several hundred million miles - when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hits
the giant planet Jupiter with an explosive force equivalent to millions of
atomic bombs. Unfortunately they will not be able to see the collision
directly from earth because it will be on the far side of the planet, but
flashes will be reflected off Jupiter's moons and disturbances should be
visible in the Jovian atmosphere for weeks.
Scientists believe that similar collisions between the earth and comets or
asteroids - lumps of ice and rock a few kilometres wide - were responsible
for the mass extinctions that punctuate the palaeontological record. The
most celebrated instance killed off the dinosaurs 65m years ago, according
to a theory which is now generally accepted. Ironically, a cosmic collision
on that scale brings global catastrophe by ice rather than by fire. Although
the explosion which occurs on impact devastates thousands of square
kilometres, its secondary effects are more lethal. Billions of tonnes of
dust are thrown into the atmosphere, plunging the whole globe into a sunless
'impact winter' for many months. Few plants and animals escape death by
freezing or starvation.
Earth's fast-changing geology quickly heals scars left by cosmic impacts.
Even so, scientists have identified traces of 140 craters left by giant
meteorites, including the one that sealed the fate of the dinosaurs, which
stretches 180km across Mexico's Yucatan peninsular. Anyone wanting to see
the unhealed face of such bombardment need only look at the moon.
A detailed hazard assessment by two leading American space scientists, Clark
Chapman and David Morrison, published earlier this year in Nature, the
science journal, concluded that an impact with global repercussions is
likely every 100,000 years or so. There is one collision devastating enough
to kill at least a quarter of the human population (1.3bn people) every
500,000 to 1m years - and to wipe almost everyone out every 50m years.
The biggest extraterrestrial object to reach earth this century was an
asteroid, probably about 30 metres wide, which exploded in the air over the
Tunguska River region of Siberia in 1908, flattening hundreds of square
miles of uninhabited forest. Smaller meteorites have damaged buildings and
cars - in 1992, for example, a 12kg rock ruined a Chevrolet in New York
state - but fortunately not people. Others have reportedly come close to
setting off a nuclear alert by misleading American and/or Russian military
commanders into thinking an enemy missile was attacking.
But we may now be living through a relatively quiet period in the cosmic
bombardment of earth. Some astronomers believe large meteorites come in
cycles, rather like the streams of small meteors that cause periodic showers
of shooting stars. According to one theory, earth passes through the debris
of a huge comet every 3,000 years or so, producing more frequent
Tunguska-sized impacts; this would have occurred most recently in the Dark
Ages (about 500 AD).
'There is a lot of information buried in ancient annals about destruction by
fire from the heavens,' says Mark Bailey, an asteroid specialist at
Liverpool John Moores University. 'Until recently, scientists dismissed
these stories as figments of someone's imagination, but perhaps the
historical record is telling us about something that really happened.'
For example, Mr Bailey says, the account by Nenius in his 5th-century
chronicle of St Germanus, in which the fortress of the heathen king Vortigan
was suddenly destroyed by fire from heaven, sounds like a large meteorite.
Over the past decade, as cosmic collisions have moved from science fiction
to respectable research, astronomers have begun to realise that we are not
necessarily powerless to prevent a cataclysm. In principle, 21st-century
space and military technology could be used to detect a threatening asteroid
or comet in time to deflect or destroy it before it hit Earth - just as
Arthur C Clarke described in his recent book, The Hammer of God.
As a first step, scientists working for Nasa, the US space agency, have
proposed a 25-year Spaceguard survey. It would use powerful telescopes to
map all 1,000 or so large 'Earth-crossing' asteroids that could cause a
global catastrophe, at a total cost of just Dollars 300m. It would give a
warning time of several decades before an asteroid collision.
Comets, which have much longer and more elliptical orbits than asteroids,
present more of a problem. Even for the most elusive comet, however,
Spaceguard would give a few months' warning of impending disaster.
Most astronomers support the Spaceguard proposal. More controversial - and
far more expensive - is the idea of setting up a meteorite deflecting system
to keep on stand-by, just in case we find a comet or asteroid heading our
way. Some enthusiastic veterans of former US president Ronald Reagan's Star
Wars programme have taken up the idea as a way of developing nuclear and
laser technologies that can no longer be justified on defence grounds after
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
But others, such as Carl Sagan of Cornell University, warn that using
nuclear explosions to deflect cosmic bodies could pose more of a threat than
the asteroids and comets themselves. They say such a system could easily be
misused to deflect a previously harmless asteroid towards earth. As
Professor Sagan puts it: 'There is no other way known in which a few nuclear
weapons could by themselves threaten global civilisation.'
So, for the time being, we must live with the knowledge that we are as
likely to die in a cosmic cataclysm as in an aircraft. For the nervous
flyer, that should be rather a reassuring thought.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Lion eyes its share: A bumper crop of films at the US box
office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
June is shaping up as a more than usually magical month for Walt Disney. The
US entertainment giant got off to a nice start this week when a Saudi
Arabian prince swept to the rescue of Euro Disney, its financially troubled
French theme park associate.
Desert themes were already much on the mind of Mr Michael Eisner, Walt
Disney's chairman: the company has just released a low-budget sequel to its
hit animated movie 'Aladdin' directly into the US video market - bypassing
cinemas - and this follow-up, called the 'Return of Jafar', is proving a big
hit.
It is the first time Disney has made a full-length film purely for the video
market, a sector dominated by cheap children's fare and exercise tapes with
inspiring titles like 'Buns of Steel'.
The gamble is paying off. Across the US, children under the age of 10 are
pestering parents for a copy, and industry experts suggest 'Jafar' could
become one of the 10 best-selling videos of all time.
But Disney's biggest June success has yet to come: in the middle of the
month it will release its latest full-length animated movie, 'The Lion
King', the story of a young lion that becomes king of the jungle after
fighting off a wicked uncle who kills his father. In other words, Bambi
crossed with Hamlet in an exotic African setting.
It has superb animation, music by British pop star Elton John, and a strong
cast of actors' voices, which includes Jeremy Irons, Rowan Atkinson and
Whoopi Goldberg. No wonder Hollywood is confidently predicting it will be
the runaway hit film of the summer.
That would be no small achievement, because the summer season is one of
Hollywood's most important periods of the year, accounting for some 40 per
cent of the annual American box office take.
But this year the season - which began with last weekend's Memorial Day
public holiday and ends with Labor Day in early September - is producing
much more than the normal quotient of hysterical Hollywood nail-biting.
There are two reasons. First, spring was unusually bad at the box office,
with so few American-made hits that a low-budget British comedy, 'Four
Weddings and a Funeral', briefly became the most popular movie in the
country.
Second, the studios are releasing an extraordinary number of films this
summer - about 60 - and they cannot all be hits. Films that do not perform
well over the weekend they are released, or during the subsequent weekend,
will be quickly and cold-bloodedly yanked from cinema schedules.
Hollywood will be hard-pressed to match the success of last summer, when
'Jurassic Park', the dinosaurs-run-amuck movie directed by Steven Spielberg
and backed by Universal Studios, broke all box office records and powered
the industry to an unprecedented Dollars 2.1bn in ticket sales. This paved
the way for a record annual Dollars 5.1bn at the US box office.
But at least half a dozen films could break through the Dollars 100m barrier
for total US box office sales which traditionally marks a film as a
blockbuster - and they will need to if the studios are to make a decent
profit, since some of the most ambitious movies cost Dollars 40m to Dollars
50m to make.
'True Lies', a spy adventure from Rupert Murdoch's Fox group, starring
muscle-man Arnold Schwarzenegger, is rumoured to have cost more than Dollars
100m. Schwarzenegger, reunited with the director who made his big hit
'Terminator 2', will be trying to put behind him one of last summer's
biggest flops, 'Last Action Hero'.
The season has got off to a strong start. 'The Flintstones', produced by
Spielberg and distributed by Universal, took a record Dollars 37.5m at the
box office over the Memorial Day weekend. That just topped the Dollars
37.03m taken in 1989 by 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'. The film has
real actors playing characters from the 1950s cartoon series of the same
name, with its Stone Age setting and signature cry of 'Yabba Dabba Doo'. The
movie has been widely panned. Critics' barbed puns range from 'Yabba Dabba
Don't', to 'Yabba Dabba Doo-Doo'.
But it seems certain to maintain its strong run ('have legs', in the
industry jargon), thanks to a huge tie-in marketing campaign, involving
1,000 products ranging from McDonald's hamburgers to Flintstone catapults.
The success of the 'Flintstones' has overshadowed the strong start made by
Warner Brothers' 'Maverick'. Starring heart-throb Mel Gibson, this is
another in a long line of movies this year which revamp television series.
The trend has critics wondering about the paucity of Hollywood's
imagination.
Others with hit potential include 'City Slickers 2', a follow-up to the
success that comedian Billy Crystal had with the first modern-day western
with this title; 'Forrest Gump', the story of a simpleton starring Tom
Hanks; and 'Speed', about a bus rigged by a psychotic to explode if it slows
below 50mph.
But the season should still belong to 'The Lion King', which industry
observers think could top Dollars 200m in total US box office receipts. With
that and the Saudi rescue under his belt, Mr Eisner might be heard muttering
'Hakuna Matata', the Swahili motto adopted in the film by the would-be lion
king. It means 'no worries'.

Sir, With such age and distinction, Henry Grunfeld's words are likely to be
taken seriously ('Still warning and encouraging', May 31). Thus, it is a
pity that he thinks that in industry 'it's more or less the same every day'.
I can think of no more exciting and rewarding a career than running a world
business with new markets, products, technologies, customers, exchange rates

daily, while focusing on the creation and provision of resources for
long-term sustainable success.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Chill blows in from the west: Even though inflation
pressures still seem low, FT writers say pessimists are in the ascendant in
European bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the summer sunshine, a deep chill has descended over the European
capital markets. Fears of renewed inflation have crossed the Atlantic,
making an unexpected and disturbing entry in Europe's financial centres.
Across the continent, bond prices in the past month have suffered the
steepest fall since early 1990, when markets were unnerved over the
prospective economic impact of German unification.
Amid widespread concern about sharply rising money supply growth in Germany,
the sell-off has brought long-term bond yields in Europe's most powerful
economy to slightly above levels in the US. Hopes have evaporated that
Europe could be shielded from the long-term interest rate rise in the US
after the Federal Reserve started tightening credit in February.
Since economic recovery in Europe is still only hesitant - in contrast to
the US, now in the fourth year of upswing - the sharp rise in long-term
interest rates has come at a difficult time. Unemployment in the European
Union is a record 11 per cent.
Reflecting the turbulence, 10-year bond yields in Germany closed yesterday
at 7.07 per cent, up by 0.24 points compared with the previous week and 1.52
points compared with the end of last year. Yields on UK government bonds
(gilts) were up nearly 2 points compared with the end of last year, while
those in France rose 1.70 points.
Investors and traders have been badly unsettled. 'It's still gory out here,'
says Mr Sanjay Joshi, chief bond economist at Daiwa Europe, the securities
house, in London. 'Everyone is underwater.'
Pressure on French bonds have mainly come from futures contracts. 'It is
quite incredible,' said one Paris bond analyst. 'You could never have
predicted these levels a few months ago.' An economist at a French merchant
bank says: 'A lot of leveraged foreign investors, particularly in the US,
have been pulling their money out of French and other European bonds.'
Mr Christian Strenger, chief executive of Frankfurt-based DWS, the Deutsche
Bank affiliate which is Germany's biggest fund management group, says
fundamental economic factors do not justify the steep yield rise. But he
adds: 'A lot of people have been badly hurt. It will be a little while
before they get back into the game.'
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg, the merchant bank,
is still more pessimistic. 'We are seeing a very aggressive and painful
adjustment in real yields. This is a bear market that will have occasional
fierce rallies. But basically the trend will continue over the next six to
12 months.'
The interest rate squeeze spells bad news for European governments trying to
fund large budget deficits on nervous and volatile markets. If it persists,
the tightening could have repercussions for the European Monetary System,
which has been performing relatively smoothly since the abandonment of
narrow bands last August.
International financial uneasiness has brought acute consequences for
weaker-currency governments in Europe, penalised by financial markets for
failures to control budget deficits. As investors fret about poor European
economic convergence and the shrinking chances that economic and monetary
union will take place by the initial 1997 target date, a gap in bond market
yields between northern and southern Europe seems to have become permanent.
The bond market shake-up could add to political pressures on several
European governments. In Spain corruption scandals affecting the ruling
Socialist party have prompted rumours of a possible downgrading of Spanish
government debt. 'The fact that the Spanish market has fared worse (than
other markets) has little to do with fundamentals and more to do with the
political situation,' said Mr Jose Luis Feito of Madrid brokers AB Asesores.
In a week of contradictory economic data, the markets have been ignoring
good news and focusing on the bad. A post-unity inflationary fillip in
Germany - one of the main reasons for upward pressure on European interest
rates during 1990-92 - now seems to have ended. According to figures
published this week, the annual rate of German price rises has fallen to 2.9
per cent, the lowest for three years.
However, this development has been outweighed by worries about the
Bundesbank's cuts in short-term interest rates in the past two months, in
spite of soaring growth of M3 money supply. According to latest Bundesbank
figures, which have been distorted by exceptional factors, annualised M3
growth in April was 15.8 per cent, well above the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per
cent target. This year is almost certain to be the third in succession in
which the Bundesbank's money has been exceeded by a wide margin.
Mr Thomas Mayer, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, in
Frankfurt, believes the Bundesbank made a misjudgment in its latest  1/2
point cut in the discount rate in May. He predicts that 1994 growth in M3
money supply will be more than 10 per cent. 'This may or may not lead to
future inflation but for market participants it is deeply unsettling. It
would be reassuring if the Bundesbank would clarify its policy.'
On a broader front, the tactics of the Bundesbank have attracted unusual
criticism during the past fortnight. On May 23, ambiguous remarks by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, about a pause in cuts in interest rates
 -later clarified as referring simply to its official rates rather than
money market rates - depressed bond prices. Additionally, the Bundesbank has
twice during the past fortnight cancelled auctions of short- and long-term
German government bonds.
The German finance ministry justified the delay on the grounds that its
short-term financing needs had been fulfilled. But the Bundesbank's
cancellations were widely interpreted as confirming that investors had no
intention of returning to the market. Additionally, the Bundesbank's moves
disrupted bond auctions in France, Spain and Italy - governments with
considerable financing needs.
For many analysts, this week's bond market fright has been excessive. In
most of Europe, inflationary pressures are still thought to be low. 'I think
that fears of a resurgence of inflation in Germany are overdone,' says Mr
Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF Bank in Frankfurt. 'Our
prediction is that inflation will be about 2 per cent throughout much of
next year, and may even fall below that.' However, this week's worries over
the Bundesbank's policies have been just one of the factors weighing on the
markets.
Signs of a slight pick-up in economic recovery in Germany and France - the
subject of a confident communique from the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse
on Monday - have added to bond market fears about higher interest rates in
coming months. Growth in both France and west Germany may be 1.5 per cent or
more this year. These rates of expansion are moderate by comparison with
previous recoveries, but they are none the less higher than forecast earlier
in 1994.
In Britain, government bond prices fell particularly steeply in mid-week
after release of data showing a 7.1 per cent rise in Britain's narrow M0
money supply in the 12 months to May. In Italy, Mr Antonio Fazio, governor
of the Bank of Italy, issued a public warning to the new government about
the risk of increasing inflation through measures to revive the economy.
The biggest single concern for bond investors is the sheer weight of
government debt. Because of the size of debt interest payments in all EU
countries, this week's increase in interest rates will add to strains on
budgets - offsetting the positive effect on government finances of the
European economic recovery.
In a speech this week, Mr Tietmeyer underlined that 1994 budget deficits
across the EU would average more than 6 per cent of gross domestic product -
slightly down from last year. Total public debt, on the other hand, would
grow to more than 70 per cent of GDP. Mr Tietmeyer warned that governments
could become 'impotent prisoners in a budgetary debt trap'.
Fears like this have played a particular role in discouraging non-resident
investors from buying European government bonds this year. Reflecting
increasing globalisation of markets in recent years, a Salomon Bros study
estimates that investors from abroad last year accounted for 73 per cent of
net issuance of government bonds in Germany, 50 per cent in Italy, 48 per
cent in Spain, 34 per cent in Denmark, 25 per cent in the UK and France and
22 per cent in Italy.
Bond analysts report that US-based 'hedge funds', which were large buyers of
European government debt last year, have recently stopped purchases.
If, as many economists believe, German money supply figures show a marked
slowdown in coming months, allowing the Bundesbank to resume interest rate
cuts, the interruption in bond purchases by international investors could be
overcome relatively quickly.
On the other hand, as Mr Rolf-Gunther Thumann, a specialist on the German
economy at Salomon Bros, points out: 'No one knows how M3 will behave. The
uncertainty will not go away soon.' The nightmare for German policymakers is
that M3 will continue to misbehave throughout the summer - intensifying
fears among domestic German investors of a build-up in inflationary
potential.
Under these extreme circumstances, the Bundesbank might have little choice
but to engineer an increase in interest rates during the summer - at a
highly inopportune moment during the campaign for the German general
elections in October. 'At the beginning of the year, the possibility that
Germany would start to tighten policy was not on the agenda,' says one
London bond analyst. 'But now things have changed.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Cinderella rides the waves: The growth potential of UK
commercial radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 20 years, CanWest, Canada's largest privately-owned television
group, has been offered radio stations or stakes in stations. It has always
said No - until now.
The Canadian group, which also has television interests in New Zealand,
Australia and Chile, this week took a 24.5 per cent stake in Talk Radio UK,
the UK's third national commercial broadcaster; CanWest regards the deal as
one of the most exciting media investments it has made.
Mr Arthur Price, who used to run MTM, the Hollywood independent production
company responsible for the drama series Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant, is
equally enthusiastic. His money is behind the UK-controlled Media Ventures
International, the largest shareholder in the station, which saw off five
rivals to clinch the winning bid.
Mr Price may be running something of a risk with his share of the Pounds
6.5m equity. It remains unproved whether Talk Radio UK can replicate in the
UK the increasing success of talk format radio stations in north America. It
plans to mix news, controversy and debate with drama, comedy and quiz shows.
The station, due to be launched on February 4, and the interest it has
created among investors, is nevertheless the latest symptom of the
renaissance in commercial radio in the UK.
After more than a decade of trying, the Cinderella medium has broken free
from its financial straitjacket: commercial radio accounted for only about 2
per cent of total UK advertising revenue, even as the number of stations has
grown.
Last year radio advertising leapt to Pounds 178.9m, compared with Pounds
140.9m the previous year, while the proportion of total advertising rose
from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent - quite apart from a further Pounds 30m
received in sponsorship. Commercial radio has increased its share of total
listening to more than 45 per cent and on present trends should overtake all
the BBC stations combined sometime next year.
This overall improved performance has started showing through in the
industry bottom line, with the largest commercial radio group, Capital
Radio, reporting its best figures - a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.4m for the
six months to March - an increase of 80 per cent over the same period a year
before.
Investors in the City of London, like the advertising industry, are starting
to take radio seriously. 'Commercial radio has come of age. At the moment
everything is positive for radio,' says Ms Lucy Brooke, an analyst who
specialises in radio at the UK stockbroker James Capel.
The arrival of the national stations, in particular the first of them,
Classic FM, has been vital in raising the profile of an industry that was
previously local, fragmented and seen as rather downmarket.
'I do think Classic FM made commercial radio respectable,' says Mr Peter
Baldwin, director of the Radio Authority, the industry regulatory body. In
this case respectability led straight to earnings.
Commercial radio executives like to tell the story of how Barclays Bank
became a convert to their cause. Scepticism on the part of marketing staff
was overcome, it is suggested, by directors who were listening with pleasure
to the new classical music station. Last year, Barclays spent considerably
more than Pounds 1m on commercial radio.
While Classic, Richard Branson's Virgin 1215, the second national station,
and Atlantic 252, the other, 'unofficial' commercial broadcaster from the
Irish Republic, which transmits to a large part of the UK on long wave, have
been important in making radio a more central medium for advertisers, other
factors have also been significant.
One has been the creation of National Network Radio, an initiative by Mr
Richard Eyre, the managing director of Capital, which made it possible for
the first time to buy an advertising campaign on more than 120 local radio
stations from a single purchase point - campaigns that can be aimed at
targeted audiences such as football fans.
In another move that has boosted revenues from commercials, radio stations
set aside their rivalries to support the Radio Advertising Bureau, which
promotes radio as a medium and advises potential new advertisers on how to
make the most of commercial radio.
Commercial radio has also received a big boost from radical changes at BBC
Radio 1 taking the channel even further away from a hit music driven agenda.
The result has been the loss of more than 3m listeners in less than two
years.
Further growth is likely to come from a host of new regional and local
stations. Five regional stations launch in September - for example Heart FM
in the West Midlands. Chrysalis, the media and record group which won the
licence, plans to offer adult contemporary music.
Mr Richard Huntingford, head of Chrysalis Radio, believes the potential for
building assets is considerable. The franchise application - only national
stations go to the highest financial bidder - cost about Pounds 50,000. The
station will be worth, he believes, closer to Pounds 10m.
Chrysalis is also planning to take its adult contemporary music format to
London, where applications for four licences - two AM and two FM - are due
in by June 28. Chrysalis will face competition, not least from Transworld,
one of the largest commercial radio groups, which have been working on an
adult contempory music format for more than two years.
Mr Eyre of Capital believes that such initiatives will ensure that
commercial radio continues to leap forward. He says the European average of
5 per cent of total advertising devoted to commercial stations is attainable
in the UK - sooner than most people expect.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Bond storm falls on UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'The role of the central bank is to think - indeed worry - about inflation
before ordinary people start talking about it.' These words were delivered
by Professor Mervyn King, chief economist of the Bank of England, in a
lecture to the Institute for Fiscal Studies this week. His remark has two
important implications: first, that if a central bank (or finance ministry)
is not prepared to court unpopularity during a recovery, it is shirking its
responsibilities; second, that ordinary people should worry about the
possibility of higher short-term rates of interest before they hear their
friends talking about inflation. In the UK, the time to start thinking about
what higher base rates might mean is now.
The immediate background is what a Hollywood producer might call the
bloodbath on Lombard Street. Since just before the quarter point increase in
the short-term rate of interest, announced by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, back in early February, bond markets have tumbled
everywhere. The prices of 10-year bonds have fallen 11 per cent in France, 9
in Italy, 8 in the US and Germany and even 4 per cent in Japan.
Yet nowhere in the group of seven industrial countries, except for Canada,
have bonds been battered as brutally as in the UK. The prices of 10-year
gilts have fallen 15 per cent, while yields have gone from a reasonably
cheap 6.4 per cent, to an expensive 8.5 per cent, in these four months.
Moreover, the decline in gilts has been accompanied by an almost identical
proportionate decline in the FTSE-100, a greater fall than in the other G7
economies.
Speculative positions
Mr Greenspan was the matador who slew the bond market bull. He did so by
triggering a global margin call on speculators. While the unwinding of
speculative positions is, no doubt, the immediate cause for the correction,
more fundamental reasons can also be identified. These include faster than
expected growth in the US, economy, signs of recovery in continental Europe,
rising commodity prices (though from historically very low levels) and
relatively rapid monetary growth in several economies, notably Germany.
The most important implication is that no compelling reason can be found for
expecting markets to regain what they have lost, at least in the near
future. Before February, bond prices were being pushed up by the prospect of
early capital gains. Now prices are being held up mainly by investors
looking for yield. Unfortunately for borrowers, their desired yields are
painfully high.
Against current rates of inflation, real yields run from some 3 per cent in
Japan to 6 per cent in the UK, presumably because investors have rather
greater confidence that current rates of inflation will last in Japan. Italy
and Canada alone have higher nominal yields than the UK.
Confidence gained
The latter's poor reputation is hardly surprising. As Professor King notes,
over the past quarter of a century, inflation in the UK has averaged 9 per
cent a year. Now, judged by the gap between the yield on index-linked and on
conventional gilts, expected inflation is half that level. This is a
striking measure of confidence gained. But it is also a measure of how far
confidence falls short of the government's target of 1-2 1/2 per cent
inflation 'by the end of this parliament'.
Since its trough in January the yield on index-linked gilts has risen by
just over one percentage point, to 3.9 per cent, while the yield on 10-year
conventional gilts has risen by a little over 2 percentage points. Thus,
perhaps half of the total increase is due to higher real rates of interest,
presumably caused by prospects for improved global growth, while half is due
to what might be called an increased inflation premium.
The question is what the particularly adverse shift in the UK bond market
means for British government policy. It means, first of all, that the UK
government lacks credibility more than do most other G7 countries. This is
worrying enough in itself and particularly worrying for such a large
borrower. One implication is that the government needs to borrow as much as
possible in inflation-hedged instruments, such as index-linked gilts.
It means, still more, that the government has to err on the side of caution.
Narrow money is growing at more than 7 per cent a year. The tax increases do
not seem to have halted the growth in domestic demand, though higher
long-term interest rates will themselves have a deflationary effect, notably
on housing. The economy is growing at just a little above its probable
long-run potential, about as fast as the authorities can permit. Whatever
one's view of the economy's potential output, experience in the second half
of the 1980s demonstrates the inflationary costs of converging upon it too
quickly.
The conclusion is simple: the next shift in base rate must be up. The
question is not if, but when. The answer is sooner rather than later.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Rivals go for land-speed record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McLaren, the grand prix and electronics group, yesterday became locked in a
technology battle to take the world land-speed record beyond the sound
barrier.
Mr Richard Noble, the current holder, said that Castrol, TI Group and other
UK companies had joined to help him build a rival to a McLaren car intended
to travel at 1,000mph. It is being prepared by McLaren to break the 633mph
record set in Nevada's Black Rock desert 10 years ago.
The rivalry has led to a technological breakthrough for the Ministry of
Defence's Proof and Experimental Establishment at Pendine, south Wales.
RAF officers from the establishment were at the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders' London headquarters yesterday to demonstrate
equipment which generates precise data on the dynamic behaviour of vehicles
travelling at very high speeds in close proximity to the ground.
The MoD said the system and the information it was capable of generating
would be sold to commercial customers.
The equipment was used to accelerate a model of Thrust SSC, the intended
record vehicle, from standstill to 812mph in eight-tenths of a second.
The Noble team also unveiled the twin Rolls-Royce Spey jet engines which are
to propel the 54ft car and which will provide it with 100,000 horsepower for
a design speed of at least 850mph.
Mr Noble, whose first record attempt took more than seven years to complete,
said McLaren, in spite of its much larger resources than the Pounds 2m
Thrust project, was likely to find breaking the record 'a lot more difficult
than it might appear'.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Housing slowdown confirmed: New net mortgage lending falls
14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing concerns about a slowdown in the housing market after April's tax
increases were confirmed yesterday by figures on mortgage lending from the
Bank of England.
The statistics also highlighted a large drop in new net mortgage lending - a
figure which takes into account repayments of principal - being undertaken
by banks.
Seasonally adjusted figures showed a 14 per cent drop in new net mortgage
lending, to Pounds 1.61bn in April from Pounds 1.87bn in March, and a 9 per
cent fall in new gross lending over the same months, to Pounds 4.59bn from
Pounds 5.04bn.
While the statistics showed a fall in new lending undertaken both by banks
and by building societies, the steepest drop was in banks' new net lending.
That fell by more than 50 per cent - to Pounds 283m from Pounds 646m in
March.
The figures also showed the return to the mortgage market of specialist
lenders, such as centralised lenders which do not operate through branch
networks. The net lending they undertook during April totalled Pounds 266m,
while in the previous month it had amounted to only Pounds 11m.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said
that banks' apparent 'lack of aggression' in this area was surprising when
margins were still wide and were sufficiently attractive to bring specialist
lenders.
The total number of loans approved in April fell back on both seasonally
adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted bases to below the equivalent figure
for last year.
After seasonal adjustments, some 79,000 mortgage loans were approved
compared with 83,000 loans in April 1993. The total value of loans approved
totalled Pounds 4.60bn in April, while in the corresponding month last year
it amounted to Pounds 4.76bn.
Commenting on the figures, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents
banks, societies and other lenders, underlined the warning given to the
government on Thursday by Halifax building society, the UK's largest
mortgage lender. Mr Peter Williams, the council's head of research and
external affairs, said it was particularly important 'that income support
arrangements for the payment of mortgage interest are left intact and that
interest rates remain stable'.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Tories excluded in hung councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservatives have been excluded from power in most of the councils where no
party won an overall majority in last month's local elections.
In London four hung authorities, previously Tory-controlled, are run by
opposition parties. Barnet in north London is run by a Labour-Liberal
Democrat coalition, with a Labour leader.
Bexley and Redbridge are both run by Labour minority administrations, while
Liberal Democrats are running Harrow as a minority.
Labour minority administrations are also in place in Liverpool, Oldham and
the West Yorkshire districts of Calderdale and Kirklees, while a Liberal
Democrat-Labour administration, with a Liberal Democrat leader, runs the
previously Tory-controlled Southend. Epping Forest in Essex, also previously
Tory-controlled, has shared committee chairs between Labour, residents'
groups and Liberal Democrats.
The magazine Local Government Chronicle has also found examples of collusion
between Liberal Democrats and Tories.
In Lancashire both Rochdale and Pendle are run by Liberal Democrat
administrations with Conservative support, while the two parties have split
committee chairs between them on Broadlands district council, Norfolk.
But Liberal Democrats and Tories have failed to agree in the formerly
Labour-controlled London borough of Lambeth.

FT  04 JUN 94 / 'Misery line' bids invited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground has invited four companies to bid to supply it with new
rolling stock for its Northern Line. The contract will provide a test of the
government's commitment to involving private-sector finance in public-sector
transport projects.
The four are ABB Transportation, a Swiss-Swedish company; Bombardier
Eurorail, a Canadian company which is supplying trains to Eurotunnel; GEC
Alsthom Metro-Cammell, a Franco-British group; and Siemens of Germany.
They will be expected to file their bids by September. The contract will be
awarded before the end of this year.
The companies will have to frame their bids in a way which transfers
sufficient risk to the private sector to meet tough Treasury guidelines.
The guidelines are intended to ensure that financing deals involve more than
simple staged payments by, in this case, London Underground, because funding
could then be raised more cheaply by the government.
It emerged in March that an initial proposal from ABB to lease trains to
London Underground had fallen foul of the Treasury rules.
Strong pressure from Tory MPs, business organisations and government
advisers led to agreement to hold a bid competition. Rolling stock on the
Northern Line - dubbed 'the misery line' - is 30 years old.
The original ABB proposal was to supply 100 trains for Pounds 440m with a
20-year maintenance contract worth another Pounds 300m. London Underground
said it expected that new bids would be substantially different.
Delivery of the trains is to take place between one and three years.
Apart from the Treasury guidelines, bids will have to provide benefits for
travellers in the shape of extra capacity and speed.
ABB has warned that failure to win the contract could result in the loss of
600 jobs at its Derby factory. It is, however, just completing the delivery
of similar trains for the Underground's Central Line so would be spared the
cost of establishing a new production line.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Counties review 'is policy fiasco'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England's local government review is a 'policy fiasco' driven by
'doctrinaire' commitments, says a report by six academics.
They say the review is proceeding 'because continuing with it is seen by the
government as less politically embarrassing than stopping it'.
The independent Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has
to recommend alternative structures for non-metropolitan authorities to the
Department of the Environment.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, prefers all-purpose 'unitary'
authorities as replacements for the present two-tier system of counties and
districts.
Mr Steve Leach of Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government
Studies, who edited the report, said: 'The commission appears to be driven
by a doctrinaire commitment to the unitary concept for its own sake. This
leads to it having to argue the case for a size of authority which will
often neither reflect local community identity nor be able to carry out
strategic functions.'
The academics say the strongest options, using Mr Gummer's own criteria, are
'often the two-tier status quo, or a county-wide unitary authority' with
genuine devolution of power to local communities.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Gloomy forecast for Hualon plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kurt Salmon Associates, the independent advisers to the UK government on the
planned Hualon textile plant near Belfast, last month issued a statement
forecasting sharp declines in European production of the fabrics that will
be made at the Pounds 157m plant.
Mr Tim Smith, the economy minister for Northern Ireland, said this week that
KSA had been employed by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board to
provide 'specialist marketing and production/technical advice' on the plant,
which is to receive Pounds 61m in government grants.
Mr Smith said KSA had concluded in its report for the IDB that the market
for the Hualon plant's products was growing. The contents of KSA's report to
the IDB are not publicly available and are bound by customer
confidentiality.
The report was not part of the project appraisal - it was commissioned after
the UK government had approved the project, and after the European
Commission had announced a formal inquiry into the proposed plant. KSA said
yesterday that it had finished the report last December, a year after the UK
submitted the Hualon proposal to the Commission for approval.
Last month, however, KSA issued a statement in response to media inquiries
about the plant, in which it forecast a 22 per cent fall in synthetic fabric
production in the European Union between 1991 and 2001, and a fall of 26.4
per cent in cotton fabric production.
These forecasts were initially produced by KSA last year, in a special
report on the textiles industry, and were published by the consultancy
before it undertook the report for the IDB on the Hualon plant.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Blair says Scottish devolution a high priority for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour government would establish a Scottish parliament with 'strong'
powers over economic development and domestic affairs, Mr Tony Blair said in
Dundee yesterday. Mr Blair, the most likely successor to John Smith as
Labour leader, said a Scottish parliament was 'more vital than ever to
ensure that Scotland's voice is heard in Europe'.
His comments confirm that devolution remains a high priority for Labour, in
spite of the death of Mr Smith, one of the strongest supporters of a
Scottish parliament.
An opinion poll in Scotland today shows a 43-point Labour lead over the
Conservatives, who scored a record low of 10 per cent.
The System Three poll in Glasgow's The Herald newspaper suggests Labour has
gained nine points in a month, to 53 per cent, with the Tories down four
points.
The poll shows the Scottish National party still in second place with 24 per
cent, a fall of three points from last month, with the Liberal Democrats on
12 per cent, down two points.
The survey questioned 983 people in 38 Scottish constituencies from May 26
to 31.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Walker 'pretended dead friend carried out deals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker property and
leisure group, pretended that a dead friend had been responsible for
transactions in an attempt to head off inquiries into the fraudulent
inflation of his company's profits, it was alleged at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
Mr Walker also tried to distance himself from transactions at the centre of
the alleged fraud when first questioned by the Serious Fraud Office, Mr
Peter Rook QC, prosecuting, told the court.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former
Brent Walker finance director, fraudulently inflated the profits of both the
Brent Walker group and its media division by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and
1987.
This was done by falsely claiming film rights had been sold when Brent
Walker later secretly reimbursed the purchasers of the rights, so
fraudulently funding its own profits, the prosecution claims.
The former Brent Walker chairman denies four charges of theft involving a
total of Pounds 17m, two charges of false accounting and one of conspiring
to falsify the company's accounts. Mr Aquilina denies one charge of theft,
three of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify accounts.
Mr Rook said that after press articles questioned the validity of some of
the transactions in which rights were sold to Universal Talent Management
(UTM) Mr Walker told his auditors that these had been carried out by Mr John
Love, a business associate.
In fact, Mr Love, who had looked after the administration of a Bahamas-based
trust for Mr Walker and his family, had died a few months earlier, Mr Rook
said.
'It appears he had nothing to do with Universal but on the basis that dead
men don't talk, it was easy to attribute UTM transactions to him,' he said.
UTM was one of three apparent purchasers of the rights, the prosecution
says. When questioned by the Serious Fraud Office about transactions
concerning a second purchaser, a company called Alberta, Mr Walker sought to
distance himself from any direct involvement in the deals, Mr Rook said.
He told the SFO he knew nothing of a Pounds 4m loan from Brent Walker to
Alberta or that his company had fully guaranteed it. However, Mr Rook showed
the jury documents signed by Mr Walker which, he said, demonstrated that the
loan had been guaranteed.
The trial continues on Monday.

FT  04 JUN 94 / SNP hopes its May bandwagon will keep rolling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are eight Euro constituencies in Scotland but frontbench spokesmen are
focusing most of their energies on just one of them: North East Scotland.
This is because three parties could win it: Labour, which took the seat from
the Conservatives in 1989; the Scottish National party, which Labour
overtook on that occasion by only 2,613 votes; and the Tories, whose share
of the vote was less than 3 percentage points behind that of the SNP.
A victory for the SNP would have special significance. On the likely
assumption that the party retains Highlands and Islands, where Mrs Winnie
Ewing took more than 51 per cent of the vote in 1989, victory would give the
nationalists a second Scottish Euro-seat.
It could also boost an SNP bandwagon that began rolling in the regional
council elections last month - in which the party came second - and give it
a good chance of winning the by-election in Monklands East caused by the
death of John Smith.
The latter would entail wiping out a Labour majority of 15,712. But the SNP
has poured in activists to achieve such surges before - it took the Labour
safe seat of Glasgow Govan at a by-election in 1988. It also won a regional
council seat in the constituency in May. As a response to the SNP threat
Labour is likely, early next week, to call the by-election on June 30, the
earliest date possible. On Thursday night it selected Mrs Helen Liddell, a
former secretary of the Scottish party, as its candidate.
On the campaign trail in Aberdeen, Mr Allan Macartney, the SNP candidate for
North East Scotland, says the party has 'a Mexican wave effect' running in
its favour in the constituency, which runs from Peterhead down to the river
Tay, and includes both Aberdeen and Dundee.
'I thought we would have to crank the party up again for the Euro-elections
but because of our success in the regional elections they're raring to go,'
he says.
The party believes Mr Macartney will win the seat with a 5 per cent to 7 per
cent margin over Labour if people vote as they did in the regional
elections. But the psephology is complex and Labour claims the regional
results suggest it will win by 1 point.
Mr Macartney is a strong candidate. A vice-convener of the party, he is not
one of its tub-thumpers: he is a political scientist who tutors Open
University students and tends to eschew shallow debating points.
He says Labour, in spite of having seven of the eight Scottish Euro-seats,
has not acted in Scotland's interests at Strasbourg. 'I'm appalled that the
socialist group in the parliament voted to allow Spanish fish boats access
to the North Sea,' he says.
The SNP has an advantage in European elections, he says, because opinion
polls show most Scots believe Scotland would be better off if it were
directly represented in Brussels. 'We can only interpret that as meaning
they would like Scotland to be independent.'
His Labour opponent Mr Henry McCubbin is a hard-working MEP who shows
bundles of European legislation for which he has campaigned, and can point
to membership of parliamentary committees relevant to life in the
north-east, such as farming, fishing, and health and safety (for the oil
industry).
On the big European issue he is not afraid of raising the issue of
federalism, but sees it as 'a pooling of sovereignty, not as a loss of
sovereignty'.
The Tory candidate, Mr Ron Harris, appears quietly upbeat, in spite of the
fact that national opinion polls are running heavily against his party and
it is haunted by a disastrous performance in the regional elections. A
thoughtful businessman from Montrose and a former professor of chemistry, Mr
Harris believes constituency Tories are returning to the fold, having made
their protest about higher taxes and value added tax on domestic fuel last
month.
Labour privately fears that the collapse of the Tory vote in the regional
elections could be replicated to its disadvantage on June 9, with
disgruntled Tories going over to the SNP.
The Liberal Democrats, whose candidate Mr Simon Horner is a journalist, won
almost as many votes in the regional elections as the Tories. Each party
polled about 19 per cent of the vote.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Bombers target meat trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three people were yesterday injured by parcel bombs sent to five companies
involved in the meat trade. Police believe the attacks were linked and may
have been the work of animal rights activists, Jenny Luesby writes.
Four bombs exploded yesterday morning in Kent, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire
and Edinburgh, and a fifth was dismantled.
Nobody had claimed responsibility for the bombs by yesterday evening.
The bombs, which arrived in 12-inch cardboard poster tubes, were sent to two
meat-transporting companies, a ferry line that transports animals, a pig
breeding company and a chicken breeding plant.
Gloucestershire police warned the meat trade to be extra vigilant and to
contact police if anything suspicious was spotted.
Mr Robin Webb, spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front, said yesterday
that he was sure the devices were sent by the Justice Department, a group of
animal rights activists. Last year the group sent 13 parcel bombs to
scientists and suppliers of animals to laboratories.
'The group appears to concentrate each wave of devices on a specific area of
animal abuse,' Mr Webb said.
The Research Defence Society, a pressure group drawn from university and
commercial laboratories, which says that animals are essential for medical
research, has called on Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to look
urgently at the Justice Department group.
The group has not yet been publicly identified with any individuals,
although police have co-ordinated their efforts to track the group down.

FT  04 JUN 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Red rose party blooming
with confidence - Local activists astonished at the change in fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roy Kennedy, Labour's European campaign organiser in the east Midlands,
can hardly believe his luck. Until a few months ago he and his fellow
activists believed Labour had no chance of winning the redrawn constituency
of Leicester in Thursday's European elections.
They believed recent boundary changes had converted a safe Labour seat to an
equally safe Tory one. Local Conservatives thought they had acquired a nice
working majority of 60,000. Even the sitting Labour MEP, Ms Mel Read,
decided to seek election in the neighbouring constituency of Nottingham,
believing that she had no hope in Leicester.
But this week Mr Kennedy was ebullient. 'It is becoming increasingly clear
that we are going to win here,' he said, running through canvass returns in
his campaign office.
With less than a week to polling day Mr Kennedy's confidence is typical of
Labour campaign managers and candidates nationwide. In many of the party's
target seats Labour activists believe they are on the verge of victories
which would have seemed unthinkable this time last year.
In Cumbria, a tight Tory marginal, Labour's Mr Tony Cunningham predicted
this week that he would win with a 10,000 majority. In Hertfordshire Mr
Andrew Dodgson, Labour campaign manager, was yesterday confident of victory,
saying there were repeated signs of Tory voters moving to the Labour camp.
Even in Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes the Labour team is confident of
success against Mrs Edwina Currie, the high-profile Tory candidate. Mr Janos
Toth, local Labour organiser for the European elections, said: 'We are about
to have the first Labour representative in this part of the world since
1979. The party has never been in a better position than this.'
The optimism may be pre-election bravado. But in all these constituencies
Labour activists who were cautious during the local elections are pointing
to the same factors pushing the vote their way.
By attacking the government on domestic issues Labour has focused the
electorate's mind on unpopular Tory policies.
In Milton Keynes, for example, Labour has concentrated on attacking tax
rises which affect middle-class voters. In Cumbria the party has highlighted
job losses in defence-related industries.
Yet although Labour is certain to take a handful of seats, two factors may
stop the party making the more sweeping gains needed to prove it can win the
next general election.
First, Labour must ensure that it can get its supporters out to vote in what
has been a lacklustre election campaign. In some constituencies Tories
believe the turnout on polling day may save them from defeat. Mr Paul Ellis,
Tory agent in Cumbria, said: 'If we can get out just half of our people on
the day, we will win.'
Labour officials are also concerned that their supporters may not bother to
vote because they are so confident of victory. According to one constituency
agent yesterday an opinion poll showing Labour with 54 per cent of the vote
was 'as much a matter of concern as congratulation'.
Secondly, there is uncertainty over whether Labour can throw off the Liberal
Democrat challenge where it exists.
The result in Hertfordshire, where the parties are locked in a close
three-way contest, will be an important test of whether Labour can withstand
that pressure. Throughout the past few weeks Mr Peter Truscott, the Labour
candidate, has tried to underline that he is the main challenger to the
Tories. But yesterday the Liberal Democrats were not giving up hope,
claiming that disaffected Tories were more likely to come over to them.
In neighbouring Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes, campaigners for Mrs Currie
believe that the Liberal Democrats could foil a Labour victory.
One thing is clear. There are few signs of Tory party workers going out to
battle with Labour. Mr Michael Cufflin, president of the Tory
Euro-association in Leicester, said: 'We are finding it difficult to
motivate our workers in the same way we did for the last general election.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / Bank data plan criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A note of controversy has emerged over UK monetary statistics after the Bank
of England announced yesterday that it would change its system of seasonal
adjustment next month.
City analysts and banking officials fear that revising the monetary figures
monthly, instead of six-monthly, could add more uncertainty to the monetary
series and undermine public confidence in the data. The Bank argues that
monthly revisions to its estimates will be relatively small and insists that
the updating system will provide accurate data more quickly.
The British Bankers' Association said it had reservations about the new
system, which is being forced on it as a result of the Bank's changes. It
admitted that the system would pick up seasonal trends more quickly, but
said it would make it harder for City analysts to produce forecasts.
The association added: 'The big disadvantage, especially to commentators who
are expected to analyse the latest month's figure, is that they will not
necessarily know where they are starting from, since the previous month's
figures will have been revised - perhaps significantly.'
These fears were echoed by City analysts. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist
with Saloman Brothers, said: 'I would rather that (the revisions) were done
every year, not every six months. Doing it every month will add more
uncertainty.'
Mr Bob Pannell, economist at the Building Society Association, said: 'In my
own view this is an unhelpful development.'
Bank officials insist these fears are exaggerated. After running test
dummies of the new system for the past two years, it predicts that revisions
will initially change M0, the narrowest measure of money supply, by 0.3 of a
percentage point a month. M4, the broadest measure of money supply, is
likely to change by 0.1 percentage point a month.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Sceptics purr over Major's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's Euro-sceptic election strategy was strongly backed by the
Tory right yesterday as ministers launched a fierce attack on the patriotism
of opposition leaders.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said the concept of a multi-speed
European Union was 'a coherent policy around which the Conservative party
can unite with enthusiasm'.
Mr Howard is the first cabinet rightwinger to comment publicly on the
multi-speed concept since it was launched last month by Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary.
His backing follows earlier endorsement of the strategy by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
the leading cabinet pro-Europeans.
Cabinet support for the strategy reflects the judgment of Conservative
Central Office that attacks on Europe offer the best hope of avoiding
electoral disaster on Thursday.
However, there is considerable unease among backbench pro-Europeans about
the extent to which the prime minister has adopted the tone of the party's
Euro-sceptic wing.
Speaking to Conservatives in Hythe, Kent, Mr Howard combined support for the
prime minister's call for a multi-speed Europe, one with 'variable
geometry', with a coruscating attack on opposition plans for a 'European
superstate'.
He said the opposition parties had 'lost confidence in the British people to
pass their own laws and to govern themselves. Nothing else can explain their
newly found enthusiasm to rush headlong into a federal European state'.
Mr Hurd yesterday defended the prime minister's vision of a multi-speed
Europe, saying that Britain would take the lead on some issues while opting
out on others. The reaction of opposition parties showed that they were
thinking 'in terms of a single European blueprint in which nation states
give up their individual powers and identity to an anonymous centralising
force.'
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, said the Conservatives were
'telling ever greater lies'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader,
said the prime minister was trying to appeal to the 'rabid' right.

FT  04 JUN 94 / BBC makes 'final' offer in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC yesterday unveiled its 'final' offer to resolve its industrial
dispute with staff. The three unions concerned said they would give their
response by Tuesday.
The BBC presented the package after four days of discussions with the unions
at the offices of Acas, the conciliation service.
Union negotiators told the BBC they wanted to consult their officials before
deciding whether to ballot staff over the offer or reject it and resume a
series of one-day strikes.
The BBC said in a statement that it had been 'constructive' and had sought
'to address the unions' concerns'.
The BBC insisted yesterday it had not backed down on its two main
objectives, which are to devolve conditions of service agreements to lower
levels of management and to maintain the link between pay and performance.
If the unions reject the corporation's offer plans for further stoppages
next Thursday and Sunday remain in place.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Labour says Treasury will broaden VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday put tax back at the centre of its European election
campaign as party leaders warned activists not to believe opinion poll
forecasts of a landslide victory.
Amid growing fears of complacency among party workers, Mr Jack Straw,
Labour's campaign manager, dismissed a Gallup poll putting the party 33
points ahead of the Conservatives.
Mr Straw said Gallup had 'a history of being the most erratic poll'.
The poll, published in the Daily Telegraph, suggested that Labour's strategy
of presenting the election as a referendum on the government's record was
succeeding.
Labour officials were keen to play down the survey because of fears that it
might encourage Labour voters to stay at home or cast a tactical vote for
the Liberal Democrats.
In a clear attempt to refocus the campaign on domestic issues, after a week
dominated by exchanges on the future of the national veto, Labour accused
the Tories of preparing to extend value added tax to zero-rated goods.
The accusation followed BBC radio interviews in which Mr John Major and Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, refused to rule out imposing VAT on food,
public transport, children's clothes, newspapers, books and periodicals.
Mr Clarke said such issues were a matter for the November Budget. Mr Major
said the government had 'no plans' to extend VAT, but 'these are matters the
chancellor has to consider'.
Mr Brown told an election press conference: 'Having made absolute,
unconditional and personal promises at (previous) elections, Mr Major and Mr
Clarke are now attempting to change ground and run away from yet another
promise betrayed.
'We will not allow the Conservative party to escape their election promises.
They must tell us now whether they repeat their pledges not to extend VAT,
or whether they have abandoned them.'
Mr Brown said Labour 'stands by and repeats its pledge not to extend VAT to
food, children's clothes, public transport or to books and newspapers'.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said it was
'very unwise' for Mr Brown to suggest that Labour would never extend VAT.
He said: 'It is the sort of word politicians sometimes find comes home to
haunt them. We are certainly not proposing to extend VAT. We don't have any
great enthusiasm for extending the base. But it would be dishonest to say it
will never happen.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / N Korea faces punishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, South Korea and Japan are seeking ways to punish North Korea's
obduracy, after the International Atomic Energy Agency declared Pyongyang
had broken the continuity of nuclear safeguards inspections by unloading
spent nuclear fuel from a reactor without supervision.
As the 15-month dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme reached a
critical phase, President Bill Clinton said in Rome he expected to discuss
the crisis with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Hans Blix, IAEA chief, last night briefed members of the United Nations
Security Council, which may next week consider imposing economic sanctions
against Pyongyang.
Mrs Madeleine Albright, US envoy to the UN, termed Mr Blix's report
'alarming'.
She said US, Japanese and South Korean officials, who held talks in
Washington yesterday, would hold further discussions at the weekend. The US
would then begin consultations in the Security Council on 'timing,
objectives and substance of a sanctions resolution in the near future'.
The IAEA wanted to select and analyse the spent fuel rods to see whether
North Korea had diverted plutonium from the reactor in 1989 to develop at
least one atomic bomb, as claimed by US intelligence. It said it was no
longer possible to verify independently if North Korea had diverted
plutonium.
Pyongyang has warned that sanctions will be considered 'an act of war' and
threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT),
expanding its nuclear programme. But both China and Russia, which wield veto
power in the Security Council, suggested yesterday they would not support
immediate imposition of sanctions.
Mr Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign minister, said on a visit to Seoul
that negotiations with North Korea must continue and sanctions 'may only
complicate matters.'
In Moscow Mr Yeltsin told visiting South Korean President Kim Young-sam that
the Security Council must issue an explicit warning to North Korea before
resorting to sanctions. But he said Russia would back sanctions if North
Korea withdrew from the NPT.
The US, Japan and South Korea are considering imposing their own economic
embargo if China blocks a sanctions resolution in the UN.
South Korea is preparing measures to wind down its trade with the North,
which amounted to Dollars 180m (Pounds 120m) last year. Japan may try to
shut off cash remittances by Korean-Japanese, Pyongyang's largest source of
hard currency. The three countries will consult on increased defence
measures in preparation for a possible conflict on the Korean peninsula.

FT  04 JUN 94 / IRA outdone by tragedy: Helicopter deaths leave hole in
intelligence operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, MICHAEL CASSELL and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In human terms the helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre was a bigger blow
to Northern Ireland's security forces than any single terrorist act since
the Troubles began 25 years ago.
Beyond the grieving, a complex debate was under way about the precise
implications that such a loss would have on Britain's ability to deal
effectively with the IRA.
With the exception of the four RAF crew, all the victims were in important
positions in intelligence - the most crucial area of counter-terrorist
operations.
They included 10 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch,
nine army officers linked to military intelligence and six members of the
Northern Ireland Office, among them representatives of MI5.
The most senior of the named victims was the RUC's assistant chief constable
Brian Fitzsimons. As head of the RUC's 'E' Department, Mr Fitz-simons was
responsible for co-ordinating intelligence gathering with other agencies and
police units. His department controls specialist SAS-trained surveillance
units and runs undercover agents.
Also killed was Det Chief Supt Maurice Neilly, head of Special Branch
(Northern Region) which covers one of the traditional republican strongholds
in the Londonderry area. Other regional middle-ranking special branch
officers were killed.
Combating the loss caused by the crash will be high on the agenda at the
next meeting of the low-profile Province Executive Committee, the body in
charge of day-to day operation of anti-terrorist activity.
The committee comprises the RUC deputy chief constable (operations), the
army commander of land forces and high-ranking intelligence officers. It
emerged last night that Mr Fitzsimons served on the committee.
One senior RUC source spoke yesterday of the 'tragic act of God' which 'had
done what the IRA had failed to do for 25 years'. This view was echoed by Mr
Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, who said: 'They are going to be very
difficult to replace.'
Other senior anti-terrorist sources were more measured in their assessment
of the longer-term implications of the crash. One insisted that all the
information known to the victims was 'fully documented and computerised'.
Mr Fitzsimons was due to leave the RUC shortly to take up a post as chief of
security for Ulster Bank. His deputy - who was not involved in the crash -
and other officers of similar grade are understood to have been briefed
about some key Special Branch operations.
Many senior RUC officers have specialist anti-terrorist expertise. As one
anti-terrorist source said yesterday: 'There will be a slight hiccup, but
otherwise people should be able to rearrange their desks fairly smoothly.'
Within the army, Northern Ireland operations have for years involved
relatively short-term postings for intelligence personnel. Replacement of
those killed is also likely to involve minimum disruption.
At MI5's London headquarters replacements would have been lined up by as
soon as last night.
In the coming days one of the top priorities for people such as Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable
of the RUC - who both said the deaths had been a shattering blow - will be
to regain the propaganda initiative from the IRA as the peace process enters
a potentially crucial stage.
The crash was not the result of sabotage, and no security was breached by
the terrorists. But security sources fully expect that IRA leaders will now
test the operational resilience of the counter-terrorist effort as it comes
to terms with the tragic human loss.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Risk managers incredulous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to fly a group of top security chiefs in one helicopter has
astonished leading risk managers and advisers working in the private sector.
The Ministry of Defence said yesterday that there were no formal procedures
governing the travel plans of senior members of the armed forces. Air travel
was far safer than the alternatives and it had no immediate plans to
introduce procedures in the light of the crash.
Mr Laurence Law, national services director with Alexander &amp; Alexander, the
insurance broker which advises leading multinationals, said: 'I find it
unbelievable. The basic thing you do is spread the risk.' His company
insisted that no more than two executive directors travelled on the same
aircraft.
Mr Geoff Saunders, risk manager with RTZ, the mining company, said: 'It is
the number one rule in corporate travel policy. You never double up on key
personnel. You just wouldn't put the whole board on one 'plane. It is a well
established principle at our company and most corporations share the same
philosophy.'
Another company official said: 'It's just common sense. You don't suddenly
want a huge hole in your hierarchy.'
Mr Peter Lerwill, risk manager with British Airways and chairman of the Risk
Managers Association, said: 'This is just terrible from a risk-management
point of view.'
Professor Brian Toft, risk analyst at Sedgwick (UK), an insurance broker
which advises a number of leading UK companies, agreed. He said: 'I find it
absolutely incredible that they could put all these people in the same
aircraft. I can think of no large company who would put all their key
players on the same flight.'
At least one UK company has negotiated an arrangement with its insurers
under which personal-accident cover available to senior employees is
restricted if more than two executives travel on the same flight.
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, said it had a limit of 10 partners
travelling on the same aircraft, or three senior executive partners.
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, said it had a policy
that no more than two directors travelled together by air.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Heseltine chides chambers for poor business support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday criticised
chambers of commerce for providing inadequate support services to business.
Mr Heseltine, speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce conference in
Birmingham, urged chambers to get into partnership with other support
agencies.
Mr Heseltine topped a poll of the 500 delegates by Ernst &amp; Young, the
accountants, as the best person to lead the UK. He won 23 per cent of the
votes, compared with 16 per cent for Mr John Major and 14 per cent for Mr
Tony Blair.
He told the conference some of the larger chambers had a tradition of
high-quality support through the provision of information and advice to
companies. They had been drumming up export business since the days of Queen
Victoria.
But, he said, this was not the case in the newer industrial regions.
'Outside the industrial heartlands the chamber network is patchy,' he said.
This meant that service was 'something of a lottery'.
Mr Heseltine plans 200 Business Links all over England by the end of next
year - one-stop support shops offering information, advice, business health
checks and training by pooling the local resources of the government, the
chambers and the training and enterprise councils which deliver government
training schemes.
He warned the chambers not to be parochial. He said: 'You cannot allow
yourselves to be seen as watching on the sidelines like a pack of vultures
waiting to make a hearty meal of the carcass. I urge you now to join with
your partners.'
The theme of support for small businesses was the strongest to emerge from
yesterday's discussions.
Mr Eric Swainson, vice-chairman of Lloyds Bank, said: 'Banks want and need
industry to succeed.' Mr Pen Kent, executive director of the Bank of
England, referring to the hostility between some companies and their bankers
during the recession, said: 'In the next decade we want to get much more
right than we got in the last one.'
Both made clear that there was money available for small businesses. Mr Kent
said: 'The banks have the headroom to lend if they see opportunities. The
shortage now is of demand.' Both urged companies to break away from
dependence on the overdraft. Mr Kent said it was 'a false economy - it
sometimes looks cheaper, but it does not have the commitment of both sides
of a term loan'.
Mr Swainson said: 'The more structured borrowings are, the easier it is to
adopt an effective financial plan.' But he came out against bank support for
companies through the long-term holding of equity.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, favoured encouraging
local investors to invest in local companies.
Calling for tax changes, he said: 'A capital gains tax regime which allowed
an investor to ringfence his gains when he sold one share and reinvested in
another would stimulate that sort of investment.'

FT  04 JUN 94 / MoD defends the Chinook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence yesterday replied to criticism that the crashed
Chinook helicopter had no 'black box' flight recorder or all-weather radar
to assist navigation in poor conditions.
The MoD said all-weather radar, useful for large commercial jets flying at
height to avoid large storms, would be 'more or less useless' for military
low-level helicopter operations. Any weather signals would be confused by
reflected ground noise.
It said Chinooks had pressure altimeters and downward radar sensors to
estimate their height above ground, which should allow them to fly in poor
visibility.
The MoD said that few military aircraft carried flight recorders - other
accident investigation techniques were considered sufficient to determine
the cause of any crash.
But Mr William O'Brien, a lawyer who specialises in air accident claims for
solicitors Russell, Jones and Walker, said the lack of a flight recorder
would slow the investigation.
He said: 'It can be important, particularly in crashes such as this where
the wreckage is widely spread and the airframe badly broken up.'
Mr O'Brien, who acted for the captain of the worst Chinook accident in the
UK - when 45 oil-rig workers were killed off Shetland in 1986 - said a
longer investigation would also slow the victims' families claims for
compensation.
Apart from yesterday's crash there have been three bad accidents in UK-owned
Chinooks. The Shetland accident was caused by a mechanical problem which has
been rectified.
Poor weather was a factor when three servicemen were killed in a Chinook
crash in the Falkland Islands in 1986. In that accident, 'white-out'
conditions made it impossible for the pilots to get their bearings.
Another Chinook was lost in the Falklands a year later, with seven killed,
thanks to a different mechanical failure from the one that caused the
Shetland crash.
The MoD is happy with the helicopter and is considering ordering more for
Royal Air Force transport needs. A mixed order, probably for Chinooks and
EH-101 helicopters, manufactured by Westland, is expected to be placed next
year.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Workers in public sector 'take more sick leave'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public-sector workers take an average of 10 days sickness absence a year
compared with 7 1/2 days in the private sector, according to a survey for
the Confederation of British Industry.
Overall absence through sickness costs employers Pounds 11bn a year, says
the survey. However, it acknowledges that this could be an underestimate
because it takes no account of lost production.
If the public sector were brought into line with the private sector, says
the CBI, the saving for taxpayers could be Pounds 640m.
But the survey also shows that while the cost of absence has fallen by
Pounds 2bn, from Pounds 13bn in 1992, the number of working days lost has
increased by 5m to 166m. This reflects the growth in part-time work and the
fact that the cost of providing cover is lower for part-timers.

FT  04 JUN 94 / UK draws back over rights: The Tiananmen Square killings,
five years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government has drawn back from inflaming its delicate relations
with China, rejecting calls for the establishment of a human rights
commission in Hong Kong and denying visas to two leading Chinese dissidents
ahead of today's fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre.
Governor Chris Patten declined visa requests by Mr Liu Binyan, a
distinguished Chinese journalist, and Mr Ruan Ming, the former private
secretary of Mr Hu Yaobang, China's former communist party chief. A senior
official said Hong Kong could not become a base for 'subverting' the Chinese
government.
The UK government is expected to formally reject the creation of a human
rights commission when it replies later this month to a Commons committee
report which endorsed the idea. China has made it plain that such a
commission would be abolished after its 1997 takeover.
Hong Kong and British government officials indicated that Beijing's
'neuralgia' about Tiananmen and human rights had prompted the government to
seek different ways of achieving civil rights gains in Hong Kong other than
high profile commissions. This has been rejected by liberal groups in the
colony who believe their interests are being sacrificed in favour of better
Anglo-Chinese ties.
Meanwhile, in the past two weeks there has been a change in attitude by
Beijing on social and economic issues in Hong Kong. Mr Lu Ping, China's top
official on Hong Kong affairs, has suggested solutions to financing the
colony's multi-billion dollar airport project, the composition of Hong
Kong's top court post-1997, and the development of a container port.
Pro-Beijing legislators yesterday raised no objection to the government's
request for funds to build a tunnel under Hong Kong harbour for the new
airport's planned railway. The vote providing HKDollars 715m (Pounds 61.6m)
without dissent was seen as evidence that a solution to financing the
airport was within sight.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Mother's crusade to expose death toll: The Tiananmen Square
killings, five years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Ding Zilin grieves to this day, with an intensity that is almost
palpable, the death of her son slain by the Chinese army in the Tiananmen
Square protests that erupted in Beijing in the late spring and early summer
of 1989.
Five years after Jiang Jielan, a 17-year-old high school student, left his
parent's modest apartment for the last time to join the student protests,
his mother has not forgotten nor has she forgiven those responsible. This
year, she and her husband are fasting for the day to mark the occasion.
In the years since the death of her only child, Mrs Ding, a 57-year-old
professor of aesthetics, has conducted what has been virtually a one-woman
campaign to highlight the extent of the killing and to expose the
perpetrators.
It has been a lonely crusade for which she has paid a price. She has been
banished from the Communist Party and 'retired' from her teaching job at the
People's University of China. Her apartment, which features a small shrine
to her son's memory, is under constant surveillance and her every move
monitored by security personnel.
'The shedding of my son's blood awoke me,' she says. 'It was the loss of my
son that touched my conscience as a naive Chinese intellectual. I was too
passive.'
If information is power in a system accomplished at restricting its spread,
then Mrs Ding's campaign, which involves seeking to record details of every
Tiananmen death, could be more threatening to the state than other forms of
protest.
Ever since the Tiananmen massacre, the most bitter controversy has swirled
about exactly how many were killed on June 3-4. The government claims
victims numbered between 200-300, but Mrs Ding says the figure was close to
2,600.
In a letter to last year's United Nation's Conference on Human Rights, she
urged that the Chinese government be asked to release lists of people killed
and wounded. She also demanded that an independent body be established to
conduct an investigation of each victim, and that China be obliged to
provide support and compensation for the families of those who perished.
And finally, she is calling for the law to be use to punish those
responsible for ordering the army to crackdown on the demonstrators.
There could hardly be a demand more likely to rile the authorities, since
some of China's most senior figures, including top leader Deng Xiaoping,
were intimately involved in the decisions which led to the army firing on
student protesters.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Air of stability belies leaders' nervousness: The Tiananmen
Square killings, five years on - Why China's government is wary of the
increasing boldness of dissidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Beijing's vast central Tiananmen Square, crowds of holidaymakers in the
hot sun of early summer went about their business this week seemingly as
usual.
They stood before the statue to the revolutionary martyrs, had their
photographs taken beneath the late Chairman Mao's portrait on the Gate of
Heavenly Peace, and gazed at the imposing Great Hall of the People.
These scenes of quiet coming and going might have been unexceptional if it
were not for pervasive security on the square and in surrounding areas.
As the anniversary approached of the 1989, June 4, Tiananmen massacre, the
authorities were prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that no
incident would disturb an appearance of calm.
Among the concerns preying on the minds of the leadership is that this year
marks the fifth anniversary of the crushing of the student rebellion. More
important, perhaps, is the emphasis that China's leaders have placed on
political stability since a meeting last November of the Communist party's
central committee.
This gathering approved a batch of sweeping economic reforms, including a
belated assault on inefficient and overstaffed state enterprises. These risk
antagonising a restless workforce at a time of cost of living increases and
growing joblessness in cities.
Officially, China's urban unemployment stands at 2.6 per cent, but this
vastly understates numbers of unemployed and under-employed workers. Some
estimates put jobless rates in the cities at more than 20 per cent.
'This is a whole body of people just ripe for revolution,' said a western
official in Beijing who specialises in issues of social stability and human
rights.
Sporadic workers' disturbances have become a fact of life in towns of the
north-east and Yangtze River valley dominated by state-run heavy industries.
Peasant farmers are also angry over rising prices and poor returns.
China's dissidents, in spite of a government crackdown including the recent
arrest of their unofficial leader, Wei Jingsheng, have also been speaking
out.
This new boldness among political activists includes petitioning China's
parliament, the National People's Congress, for the release of jailed
dissidents.
Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 movement, commented adventurously
in a western publication this week that China's economic reforms would not
succeed without progress in political reform and, in particular, a
re-assessment of the Tiananmen massacre.
'After Deng Xiaoping's death, the first issue China will face will be
re-addressing the June 4 events, not only at the top levels of the Communist
Party but also among ordinary people,' he wrote. 'Unless it does this, China
will find it impossible to make a smooth transition to a modern society.'
These views will certainly not find favour with a Chinese leadership seeking
to put the events of June 4 as far behind it as possible. Indeed, President
Jiang Zemin, who also heads the Communist Party, sought last month in a rare
direct reference to the Tiananmen massacre to argue that the crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters had yielded positive benefits.
'A bad thing has been turned into a good,' Mr Jiang told the visiting
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
'As a result, our programme of reform and opening has forged ahead with
steadier, better and even quicker steps, and our advantages have been
brought into even fuller play. History shows that anything conducive to our
national stability is good,' he added.
Mr Jiang's remarks were interpreted by western officials as a toughening of
a self-confident government's warning to dissidents in light of China's
'victory' over the US on the Most Favoured Nation trading status issue last
month, when Washington abandoned attempts to use trade to pressure China on
human rights.
But the government's seeming nervousness over internal threats - its
official statements are marked by constant reference to the need to maintain
stability at all costs - suggests that it is far from certain about keeping
disaffected workers and peasants in check.
These concerns also coincide with worries about a protracted transition to a
new generation of leaders.
Uncertainties about Mr Deng's health and the factional disputes that might
follow his death are not the least of factors at play in a complex political
game now being waged on several fronts.
Signs of weakness at this delicate stage would risk the government's
survival. The crackdown on political dissent, and on worker and peasant
agitation is set to continue long after June 4.

industry, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The state will provide half of
the SKr180m (Pounds 15.5m) to be spent on the project over the next three
years, adding to the SKr600m already spent annually by the government on
industrial research and development. Scania, one of the world's leading

at the forefront of technical developments in environmental issues, safety,
transport economics and production technology.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the pro-Iranian Hizbollah group remained in a tense stand-off
yesterday, after an overnight exhange of salvoes during which Israel moved
tanks and artillery up to its border with Lebanon.
Residents of northern Israel emerged yesterday morning from a night spent in
bomb shelters. Salvoes of katyusha rockets, fired by Hizbollah in
retaliation for Thursday's devastating Israeli air strike on its training
base in the Bekaa Valley, landed inside Israel overnight, but caused no
injuries and only little damage.
Israel and its proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, hit back by shelling
the sources of rocket fire. There were no further rocket barrages during the
day, however, and the threat of an escalation of hostilities appeared to be
receding.
Nevertheless, many residents of villages in southern Lebanon were reported
to be fleeing north for fear of further Israeli air raids.
Many families from the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmonah were also
heading away from the border area, spending the weekend with friends and
relatives.
A Fijian member of the United Nations peacekeeping force was killed last
night when guerrillas in a car opened fire at a Fijian-manned checkpoint in
a village near the southern port of Tyre.
The attackers were reported to be Hizbollah guerrillas angered by the death
of one of their comrades in an outbreak of fighting with Fijian peacekeepers
earlier in the day.
Thursday's air raid was the heaviest blow suffered by Hizbollah at Israeli
hands, but the group's secretary-general, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, pledged
yesterday to intensify its anti-Israeli actions.
Lebanon's schools, banks and shops stayed closed yesterday as thousands of
Hizbollah supporters filled the streets of Beirut in funeral processions for
the 26 guerrillas killed in the Israeli raid.
Mr Amr Mousa, Egypt's foreign minister, yesterday condemned the Israeli
strike as 'not acceptable' and warned of the potential negative implications
for the peace process.
But Israeli officials said that they hoped the peace process would not be
affected and that Syria would now exert its influence to rein in Hizbollah.

<TEXT>
Japan's current account surplus in April was up a larger-than-expected 22.6
per cent on the same month a year ago, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The
surplus widened to Dollars 13.98bn (Pounds 9.24bn) in April, breaking a
declining trend shown in the previous two quarters.
This comes in the wake of the relaunch of US and Japanese efforts to break
their deadlock on ways to open Japan's market more to imports. Officials say
talks on insurance, one of the three areas at stake, started constructively.
A sharp rise in exports of semiconductors and oil tankers and a decline in
the value of oil imports were behind the growth in the surplus, said a
finance ministry official.

<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, (pictured left) yesterday
signalled the US would continue to press Japan to boost its economy with the
aim of lowering its trade surplus.
Speaking ahead of next week's talks among leading industrialised countries
at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, Mr
Bentsen said he would like to see Japan cut its income tax soon, then at a
later stage move to raise consumption taxes. 'Hopefully that would further
stimulate their economy and help in the balance of trade,' he told a
Confederation of British Industry lunch in London.
Mr Bentsen stressed the US was pressing Japan to open markets for the
benefit of all nations. Emphasising US determination to encourage global
recovery, he said the adminstration was committed to having Uruguay Round
trade liberalisation measures in effect as quickly as possible and 'well
before the European Union ratification is complete'.
Mr Bentsen said US Treasury economists calculated the Uruguay Round would
have the same effect as tax cuts of Dollars 975bn (Pounds 645bn) in
industrialised countries between 1995 and 2004. Including developing
nations, the Round would yield a 'global tax cut' of Dollars 1,500bn-Dollars
2,000bn over a decade.
He gave an upbeat appraisal of the US economy. The recent rise in US long
term interest rates was not a major constraint, although there was a 'modest
lessening' of activity in the housing sector. The increases in employment,
highlighted by yesterday's new payroll figures, had not caused inflationary
pressures. The US economy had accommodated the rise in employment through
increases in productivity and capital expenditure.
'Inflation does not seem to be a factor now. It looks like it will stay that
way for some time.'
Nearly 3m new jobs had been created since the Clinton administration took
office and it was 'well on the way to the 8m' target set for the four-year
presidential term. 'The fundamentals of our economy are in great shape. I
haven't seen it this good for 20 years,' he said.
Mr Bentsen said he was encouraged by economic developments in the UK and the
rest of Europe. Britain had resumed its position as the biggest foreign
direct investor in the US last year, he disclosed.
'The preliminary numbers show that UK investment in the US is up by nearly
Dollars 10bn for 1993, with total investment of well over Dollars 104bn,
again exceeding Japan,' he said.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Jakarta relaxes rules on foreign investment limits

<TEXT>
The Indonesian government has slashed limits on foreign investment in an
effort to compete with neighbouring Asian economies offering more attractive
investment packages.
The deregulation package has been welcomed as a breakthrough by Indonesia's
international business community. 'It is very, very big news for us and it
will make a difference to the amount of companies investing here,' said a
Jakarta-based Japanese investor.
Foreigners will be allowed to own 100 per cent equity in a company. At
present a maximum of 85 per cent is allowed for investors setting up in Java
or Bali, the two preferred destinations, and full ownership was permitted
only for ventures worth Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) or more on outlying
islands.
The new laws also open up sectors as diverse as nuclear power, mass media,
ports, telecommunications, railways and civil aviation to partial foreign
ownership - the government did not specify what percentages it would permit
 -and lift restrictions on the region and minimum capital requirement.
The package also ends compulsory equity divestment for foreign companies, an
issue which has frightened off many investors. Before, foreign companies
were required to reduce their stake in joint ventures to 49 per cent, 20
years after their start-up date. Under the new laws, foreign investors may
determine independently what size of stake to hand over to their Indonesian
partner after 15 years of operating in the country, allowing foreigners to
retain majority ownership.
In addition, foreign companies will be granted 30-year licences to operate
in Indonesia compared with 20 years at present.
'The teeth of the divestiture laws have been removed and divestiture was
always a real problem for investors here,' said a Jakarta-based economist.
The loosening of restrictions comes after foreign investors complained that
the government's previous deregulation package of last October was not
thorough enough. It was also sparked off by an unexpected drop in foreign
investment last year.

FT  04 JUN 94 / FDP in vote to support Kohl coalition

Germany's Free Democrats yesterday voted overwhelmingly to support
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition after Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign
minister and chairman of the party, delivered a blistering attack on the
policies of the opposition Social Democratic Party.
In the keynote speech in the opening day of the FDP's three-day congress in
the northern port of Rostock, Mr Kinkel warned the 660 delegates to pull
together and support continuity rather than face the prospect of a
government ruled by the SPD and Greens, or a grand coalition comprising the
Christian Democratic Union and SPD.
Opinion polls ahead of the federal elections on October 16 show growing
support for Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
However, the FDP, in power as a junior partner with either the CDU or SPD
for a quarter of a century, has still to move above the 5 per cent threshold
necessary to gain representation in the Bundestag, the lower house.
Mr Kinkel's speech, which received a standing ovation, was aimed as a
warning to the FDP that it faced possible political isolation if it did not
pull ranks together, support the CDU and drop any lingering sympathy for an
SPD/FDP coalition.
'We have been a successful balance in difficult times (with the current
coalition). A strong FPD is the guarantor against a Red/Green or a Grand
coalition,' he said.
Only 16 of the delegates voted against the motion, which asked the congress
to support 'on the basis of the FDP's liberal programme, a successful
coalition with the CDU/CSU in the next legislative period.'
Earlier in the week, Mr Kinkel and his supporters had to persuade the rank
and file to stick with the status quo even though the party's two
ideological wings failed to unite during the presidential election last
month of Mr Kohl's candidate, Mr Roman Herzog. Nearly 40 per cent of the FDP
delegates voted for Mr Johannes Rau, the SPD candidate.
The SPD yesterday called for a pact between government, unions and the
Bundesbank to create jobs, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD challenger to Chancellor Kohl, told a gathering
of 600 labour representatives that industry would continue to cut jobs this
year, despite signs of a moderate economic recovery.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Aden calm despite attacks

<TEXT>
The civil war between north and south Yemen continued to rage yesterday,
despite a UN Security Council resolution earlier this week calling for an
immediate ceasefire. The southern stronghold of Aden, for weeks the main
objective of the north's military offensive, now resounds hourly with the
thud of distant explosions.
But Adenis are continuing their daily lives convinced that their defences
will hold and their city will not fall.
Most observers in the port city consider northern units at Zinjibar the
greatest threat to Aden. Located about 60 km to the east, the northern units
numbering some 10,000 troops have been held in check for over a month,
pinned down by a combination of southern ground, air and naval forces.
The power of those forces remained evident yesterday as southern jets flew
repeated sorties from Aden airport towards the east, the reports of their
bombs soon reverberating throughout the city. Accompanied by sudden flashes
lighting up the distant sky, the echoing explosions carried on well into the
night.
But the northern army continues to push. Frustrated by southern resistance
lasting nearly two weeks at Al-Anad, a key defensive position 60 km north of
Aden, northern army units on Tuesday opened a new offensive a few kilometres
to the east at Tur Al-Baha.
The move seems to have taken southern defenders by surprise. They are
reported to have responded quickly, though, and to have slowed the northern
drive. But northern artillery fire was just out of range, falling just 10 km
short of Aden's oil refinery and outlying suburbs.
Adenis are angered by the northern assault on their city. 'We did not ask
for this war, but we will not accept such attacks ' said Mr Ahmed Kassim, a
35-year-old father of four. He was standing in the front room of his modest
house, shattered just hours before by the impact of bombs dropped by
northern jets.
Southern political leaders have likewise remain undaunted by stepped-up
northern attacks on their capital, continuing their efforts to form a
functioning state in defiance of the north. The ruling presidential council,
itself established just 10 days ago, announced on Thursday formation of a
30-man cabinet of ministers to run the government.
The northern government in Sanaa accused southern separatists of violating
the UN ceasefire call by setting up such a government.
The southern leader Mr Ali Salem al-Baidh announced on May 21 that the south
was setting up a separate state after four years of union with the north in
a united Yemen.
Full of faces already familiar to most southerners, the new cabinet held few
political surpises and was clearly designed to maintain public confidence in
the face of advancing northern hostility.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Ripa di Meana says Berlusconi cheating in poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister and media tycoon, is
illegally using his dual position 'to steal an advantage and cheat the
electorate' in next week's elections to the European Parliament, Mr Carlo
Ripa di Meana, the former EU environment commissioner, alleged in Brussels
yesterday.
Mr Ripa di Meana, now standing as an MEP at the head of the Italian Greens'
list, presented a list of alleged infractions to the European Parliament,
and demanded Mr Berlusconi's disqualification as a candidate for Strasbourg
under EU electoral rules.
He also said lawyers acting for the Greens were trying to bring a case
against the Italian premier's tele-vision monopoly under EU treaty
competition rules.
The former commissioner called for an immediate inquiry by the European
Parliament into the 'black-out conditions' for opposition campaigning
because of the broadcasting monopoly exercised by the three private channels
owned by Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest holding company, and the three RAI
channels controlled by the government.
Campaign broadcasting had been cut by 30 per cent on RAI channels and 80 per
cent on Fininvest stations, he claimed, although it is understood both
groups agreed before last March's Italian general election to cut costs by
cutting Euro-election coverage.
The Italian premier is heading his Forza Italia list in all five of Italy's
electoral colleges. So too, in line with traditional practice in Italy, are
a dozen other prominent politicians for their parties.
But Article 6 of the 1976 Act laying down rules for European elections,
transposed into Italian law in 1979, states that members of national
governments are ineligible for election as MEPs.
Only in Luxembourg are existing ministers, including prime minister Mr
Jacques Santer, heading lists for Strasbourg. But there, by contrast, the
government is up for re-election in national polls the same day.
Mr Ripa di Meana made clear this was 'only the first round' in his
movement's attempt to impugn the Berlusconi government. The second round
will focus on persuading Brussels to bring a court case against the
Fininvest/RAI duopoly.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Airbus seeks orders for new jumbo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOULOUSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Airbus consortium is to start marketing a new jumbo aircraft
with 500-600 seats to challenge the Boeing 747's monopoly of the large
airliner market.
Airbus will start serious discussions with a selected group of airlines on
its proposed A3XX large aircraft project soon after Britain's Farnborough
Air Show in early September, Mr Jean Pierson, chief executive, said
yesterday.
Although he did not expect airlines to rush in immediately with orders, he
believed there was likely to be demand for a new jumbo by about 2002.
'Our supervisory board last week decided we are now ready to be serious
about this project,' he added.
He estimated development costs for A3XX at around Dollars 8bn (Pounds
5.3bn). The aircraft would have two decks running the full length of the
fuselage, powered by four engines and would have a range of 7,000-8,000
nautical miles. Its cost to airlines would be below Dollars 200m (Pounds
132m) and it would have 20 per cent lower operating costs than the current
Boeing 747-400, he said. The 747-400 can seat between 450 and 500.
British Airways and Singapore Airlines have already expressed interest in
super jumbos. Mr Pierson said Airbus was 'in regular contact' with BA on its
new project.
Before launching a new jumbo development, Airbus would have to get a
significant number of firm commitments from airlines.
The four Airbus partners (Aerospatiale of France, Germany's Deutsche
Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain) have been jointly studying
with Boeing for the past two years the development of an even larger
880-seat airliner.
But these studies did not prevent both Airbus and Boeing pursuing
independent studies to develop new jumbo aircraft, Mr Pierson stressed.
He noted that Boeing had recently stepped up studies on a larger version of
its 747-400 jumbo with a new wing.
This has increased suspicion among Airbus partners over Boeing's motives for
collaborating with the Europeans on a joint super jumbo project.
The Airbus partners are worried Boeing is trying to use the joint studies to
delay Airbus's entry into the jumbo market while the US manufacturer
prepares the next generation 747 to consolidate its hold of the very large
aircraft market.
Mr Pierson also said Airbus wanted to match Boeing's latest productivity
targets aimed at driving down production costs by 25 per cent and reducing
production cycle times.
For Airbus narrow-body aircraft, the target was to reduce production cycles
from 12 months to nine months next year and six months by 1996. For larger
widebody aircraft, Airbus wants to reduce the cycle time of 15 months to
nine months by 1996.

FT  04 JUN 94 / US jobs point to solid economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US economic expansion remains robust, but the pace of growth is not
accelerating, official figures indicated yesterday.
The Labour Department said the jobless rate fell to 6.0 per cent last month
from 6.4 per cent in April, a much steeper decline than financial markets
expected. Officials said this probably overstated the strength of the
economy, partly because of recent changes in the way unem-ployment data are
collected.
Figures for payroll employment - based on a different and generally more
reliable series - pointed to a slight deceleration in economic growth.
Non-farm employment rose by 191,000 to 112.8m in May, considerably weaker
than the consensus projection of an increase of about 285,000.
The increase would have been only 120,000 but for an artificial boost caused
by the return of striking members of the Teamsters' union.
Job creation in May was sharply lower than in March and April, when payrolls
increased by a revised 379,000 and 358,000 respectively.
Jobs gains last month were overwhelmingly concentrated in service
industries. Manufacturing employment fell slightly and construction
employment expanded only modestly after impressive gains in March and April.
Ms Katharine Abraham, a senior Labour Department official, said the labour
market had improved last month but warned that the scale of the jobless
decline might be misleading. 'Whenever unusually large movements occur in a
single month, the magnitude of those changes often turns out to have been
overstated once additional data become available,' she said.
On a longer view, the figures confirm the strength of US economic expansion.
Roughly 1.2m jobs have been created since January, a faster pace than last
year, when the economy grew by 3 per cent.
Many economists believe the jobless rate is now close to the level
historically associated with upward pressure on wage and price inflation.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Mayhew pledge on Ulster security: Chinook tragedy 'will not
halt' drive against terrorists - Three inquiries launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JIMMY BURNS and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday pledged to maintain the fight against the IRA as
three inquiries were launched into the Chinook helicopter crash in Scotland
which killed 25 senior security experts and dealt a blow to anti-terrorist
efforts in Ulster.
After a day of emergency meetings in Belfast, at which politicians, army and
security chiefs tried to assess the impact of the accident, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, stressed that the tragedy would not
undermine the government's anti-terrorism drive.
Sir Patrick said the accident, on the slopes of the 1,405ft Beinn na Lice on
the Mull of Kintyre, was 'a dreadful and tragic event'. However, he
emphasised that the 'operational effects' of the crash would be overcome.
Mr John Major, prime minister, said those killed would be replaced and the
work of the security forces would continue.
Among the victims of the crash were Assistant Chief Constable Brian
Fitzsimons, head of the RUC special branch, and Colonel Chris Biles, the
most senior army officer to be killed while serving in Northern Ireland.
Also on the flight were nine other senior and middle-ranking special branch
officers, six Northern Ireland Office officials - including members of MI5 -
and eight senior military intelligence officers. Four crew members also
died.
A senior Stormont official with security responsibilities said: 'It is a
terrible blow at a time when we have a clear, upper hand. We will double
efforts to demonstrate that we intend to stay on top.' Sir Hugh Annesley,
Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable, said the crash was as 'a
catastrophic loss'.
Despite the blow to morale in the security forces, officials believe any
disruption to anti-terrorist operations will be short-lived and that the IRA
is unlikely to benefit from the setback.
Security chiefs have ruled out the possibility that the Chinook fell victim
to sabotage. Among the most likely reasons for Thursday's disaster - which
happened as the helicopter took its passengers to a security conference in
Inverness - are mechanical failure or the poor flying conditions at the
time.
The aircraft, which had recently been refurbished by Boeing, the
helicopter's manufacturers, with new avionics, engines, transmission systems
and rotor blades, was not fitted with all-weather radar or a 'black box'
flight recorder.
Last night Labour challenged the decision to allow a large number of
top-rank security personnel to travel together. Dr John Reid, Labour armed
forces spokesman, said he hoped the decision was not affected by financial
considerations. Dr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, claimed there
was 'a shortage of helicopters' and that to save money the government
delayed ordering new ones.
Sir Patrick defended the practice of allowing so many senior personnel on
one flight as 'quite normal'. One senior anti-terrorist source said such
flights were judged to run the least risk of successful attack by the IRA.
Inquiries into the crash will be conducted by the Department of Trade and
Industry's air accidents investigation branch, Strathclyde police and by the
RAF for the defence ministry.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Sharp decline in US jobless rate unsettles bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading government bond markets swung wildly yesterday as traders struggled
to interpret US employment data which seemed to signal a stronger than
expected improvement in the labour market.
Bond prices at one stage were down by more than a point on both sides of the
Atlantic on fears that the sharp fall in the US jobless rate, to 6 per cent
last month from 6.4 per cent in April, would lead to higher inflation and
interest rates.
Investors were disturbed by upward revisions in April and March payrolls,
which left the three-month average in line with expectations. The markets
found the sharp drop in the unemployment rate even more troubling because it
suggested greater upward pressure on wages.
The falls were wiped out by a strong rally as analysts focused on other
aspects of the employment report, including weaker than expected employment
growth last month. Non-farm payrolls rose by only half as much as the
consensus forecast. The upturn in prices was also said to have been
influenced by rumours that the US Federal Reserve was buying shorter
maturity bonds and a spurt of retail buying. Dealers in US Treasuries
attempted to cover their short positions in a rising market.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year bond was trading up nearly a
point at 87 21/32 , pushing the yield down to 7.268 per cent. The so-called
'short squeeze' triggered rebounds in European government bond markets. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year UK government bond slipped to 8.33 per cent
from 8.47 per cent on Thursday as the price rose to 89 3/32 from 88 5/32.
The yield on 10-year German government bonds fell to 6.97 per cent from 7.04
per cent on Wednesday, the previous trading day. Bond prices were also
buoyed by technical factors caused by the imminent expiry of futures
contracts.
On Liffe, London's financial futures exchange, the September long UK
government bond futures contract fell as low as 99 13/16 before rebounding
to 102 3/32 in heavy volume for a gain of 1 15/32 points. Stocks partly
followed the movement in bonds. After opening with a 15-point decline, the
Dow Jones industrial average pushed into positive territory and then
hesitated.
An unexpected decline in manufacturing employment contained in the May
report may have restrained enthusiasm. Later, however, the Dow gathered
fresh strength and finished up 13.23 at 3,772.22.

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, yesterday admitted its
new generation washing powder could damage clothing under 'extreme
laboratory conditions' and unexpectedly dropped a court case against Procter
&amp; Gamble.
Unilever had accused the US company, its bitter rival in the global
detergents market, of making 'untruthful and misleading' statements.
The case, which had been scheduled to be heard in the Netherlands next week,
centred on alleged claims from a P&amp;G executive that Unilever's new
super-concentrated detergent could damage clothes.
The two companies compete fiercely in the Pounds 6bn European detergents
market.
Unilever said P&amp;G's comments about the new detergent, called Omo Power in
the Netherlands and Persil Power in the UK, had been based on trials
conducted by the US company in extreme laboratory conditions that were
divorced from normal washing conditions. 'We do not believe P&amp;G's technical
analysis can be generally applied to real life,' said Mr Willem Selman,
chairman of Unilever's Dutch arm, Lever Nederland.
Unilever said it had recreated extreme conditions in its own laboratory and
found that under some exceptional circumstances a degree of wear and tear
could be detected. It had therefore decided to 'fine-tune' the vital
ingredient in the detergent, a manganese-based compound that accelerates
washing action, to remove any doubt.
Unilever said that before it launched the new powder it had tested the
product with consumers in real-life conditions for more than two years and
never encountered any problems after well over 10,000 washings.
Unilever also dropped a second part of the suit involving trade market
infringement after P&amp;G gave assurances that it would stop putting stickers
with the word 'power' on the packaging of its own Ariel powder in the
Netherlands.
'Some of the more lurid press reports apparently did not originate with them
(P&amp;G), and there is little public sympathy for two large companies
squabbling through the courts,' Mr Selman said. 'Accordingly, we would
prefer the consumer to deliver the verdict,' he said. 'The product launch
has been a success, and we appear not to have suffered any damage.'
The detergent has been launched in 10 European countries at a cost of
several hundred million pounds.

FT  04 JUN 94 / Hanson angered by Dorrell query over 'too high' dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hanson, the chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate, has accused Mr
Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, of 'sounding like a
socialist' in questioning the wisdom of high dividends.
In a letter to the minister, Lord Hanson, whose company donated Pounds
100,000 to the Conservative party during its last financial year to
September, said the issue of dividends was a matter for shareholders and
their company. 'It has nothing to do with the government,' he added.
Mr Dorrell angered Lord Hanson by suggesting recently that UK dividend
pay-outs, which have risen significantly over the past decade, may have
become too high and inflexible.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour trade and industry secretary, has also drawn attention
to the high proportion of profit companies spend on dividends, prompting
Lord Hanson to observe that Mr Dorrell 'sounds like a socialist'.
Mr Dorrell said yesterday he 'wholeheartedly agreed' with Lord Hanson that
the level of dividends was a matter for companies.
However, he said the Treasury had decided to review savings and investment
to see whether the rise in dividends had come about because of the tax
structure set by the government.
'After 15 years of deregulation, there's no question of us regulating
dividends,' Mr Dorrell said.
'What we are looking at is whether companies are paying high dividends
because of what we are doing - in terms of the tax system - and whether
companies would continue to pay out the same level of dividend if things
changed under a more level playing field.'
Lord Hanson made clear in his letter to Mr Dorrell that he believed the
Treasury was wrong to be concerned about the growth of dividends through
recession.
He described high dividends as a 'good discipline' for companies, providing
they did not strip them of cash and restrict corporate investment. He also
argued it was not helpful for companies to be 'awash with cash'.
Lord Hanson also referred to the government's desire for wider share
ownership and asked Mr Dorrell how this policy sat with his comments about
the rise in dividends. His criticisms underline growing concern that the
Treasury may change dividend taxation in the next Budget.

FT  04 JUN 94 / A second D-Day invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Normandy is bracing itself for this weekend's commemorative assault, writes
David Buchan in Caen.
The combined force includes some 14 heads of state and governments, 40,000
D-Day veterans, 100,000 tourists and battalions of broadcasters and press.
To ensure it does not finish off in the next few days what Operation
Overlord began 50 years ago, France has just declared the remains of
Hitler's Atlantic Wall defences an historic monument.
But the region will take a pounding before the main commemoration ends on
Monday night in a peace extravaganza in Caen. US, British, Canadian and
French paratroops are to re-enact tomorrow their 'drops' on the western and
eastern edges of the invasion zone. Most will be serving troops. But the
landing may feel on the hard side for the 38 veterans of US 82nd Airborne
Division, aged between 68 and 83, who have persuaded reluctant French
authorities that they are fit enough to fall out of the sky over
Sainte-Mere-Eglise, just as they did 50 years ago.
On Monday, the five kings and queens, five presidents, four prime ministers
and one governor general will criss-cross the area in a complicated
quadrille of bilateral ceremonies. One, France's 76-year-old President
Francois Mitterrand, will have to be virtually everywhere as host, while all
will be at the 'international' ceremony on Monday afternoon at Omaha Beach,
the scene of the worst allied casualties on June 6, 1944 with the deaths of
3,000 Americans.
Absent, perforce, will be any official representatives of Germany, which
lost 58,000 men in the Battle of Normandy to the 37,000 allied dead, even
though there will be at least one small unofficial American-German ceremony
at the private initiative of veterans of both sides. But Mr Mitterrand has
invited German troops belonging to the Eurocorps, and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, to attend France's Bastille day parade in Paris next month. Germany
will be present, too, at next May's ceremonies marking the end of the second
world war.
Meanwhile, however, this weekend's events will require considerably more
troops than the free French were able to muster for D-Day - 15,000 soldiers
to ensure the logistics, 7,000 gendarmes to guard the roads, and 4,000
police controlling crowds. 'It's a bit like organising a summit meeting in
the middle of the Olympic Games,' says Mr Roger Gros, the harassed prefet of
Lower Normandy, referring to the problem of trying to ensure the safety of
so many bigwigs among so many other people in such a large area.
But he will have, as the allies did half a century ago, the advantage of air
superiority. An air exclusion zone will prevent anything but VIP helicopters
from circulating over the Normandy coast.
Controlling the sea may be harder. In the royal yacht Britannia, Queen
Elizabeth is expected tomorrow to lead a small armada from Portsmouth, where
tonight she is to host a state dinner. Her Majesty should have no problem.
Pressure on her civil list is not such that Britannia has had to take on
cheap Chinese crew, which is the reason that French sailors gave for
preventing two P&amp;O ferries from docking at Cherbourg on Thursday.
The presence of 45 warships, as well as several thousand private boats, will
ease the hotel squeeze in Normandy. The Queen will stay on the Britannia
moored in the port of Caen, while President Bill Clinton will repair, aptly,
to the Dwight Eisenhower aircraft carrier.
Other dignitaries have had to settle for staying in Paris, so as not to
disrupt long-made hotel reservations by D-Day veterans. On Wednesday a Caen
tribunal ordered a local hotel to pay 50 British veterans from the Lancaster
Regiment FFr1,500 each in compensation for cancelling their bookings.
In general, the welcome has been warm - and commercial. All sorts of
souvenirs for D-Day, or Jour-J as it is known in French, are on sale,
including Bordeaux and Beaujolais under the 'Debarquement 44' label.
Luckily, it is not actually that vintage, which would not have aged as well
as the veterans.

Cable and Wireless(C&amp;W), the British telecoms company, says it will probably
have to revise its offer for a minority stake in Ireland's state Telecom
Eireann, following the government's decision earlier this year to invite
other bids for a joint venture with Telecom.
Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, in Dublin to talk to institutional
fund managers, said C&amp;W was keen to establish a tie-up with TE.
But its proposal, made three months ago to the Irish government to take a
minority stake in Telecom Eireann through a new joint venture, 'should
probably be put aside' in favour of a revised offer, since the decision to
invite other bids.
The offer is thought to be worth up to IPounds 500m (Dollars 742.5m). C&amp;W's
interest would be to develop TE's customer service.

Leif Hoegh, one of Norway's largest shipowners, has agreed to acquire
control of Arcade Shipping, a small Norwegian shipowner, for NKr195m
(Dollars 26.3m).
It is buying 83 per cent of Arcade from Reading and Bates, the US-based
drilling contractor, and plans a full takeover of the company.
The deal is part of a package in which Reading and Bates has agreed to
acquire a 46 per cent stake in an Arcade unit, Arcade Drilling, for NKr6 a
share or an estimated NKr300m.
In addition, Reading and Bates will acquire Arcade Shipping's minority
shareholding in Dragon Oil for NKr18.26m, representing book value of the
interest.
Arcade's shareholders must agree to withdraw a legal claim against Reading
and Bates for the US group's earlier purchase of Arcade Investment.
Leif Hoegh is paying NKr1.80 a share. Arcade's shares prior to news of the
deal were trading on the Oslo bourse around NKr1.45. Leif Hoegh will make a
similar offer to minority shareholders.
The deal brings to Leif Hoegh one bulk ship and three smaller RoRo ships.
Leif Hoegh said that Arcade's fleet fits well with its own activities.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Japan looks to low-cost Asia: Yen strength fuels shift of
manufacturing industry abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies plan to boost low-cost production in other Asian
countries next year, when their overall capital spending is expected to rise
for the first time in three years, according to a government survey released
yesterday.
Corporate Japan plans to increase total investment in plant and equipment by
1.1 per cent in the year to next March, according to a study of 1,615
companies by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
This is a sharp change from the 0.1 per cent investment decline forecast in
Miti's most recent survey of this type, released last October, and the
latest in a recent series of moderately bright economic indicators. Capital
investment fell by 8.7 per cent last year.
Direct investment in other Asian countries in the coming year will leap to
37.5 per cent of total foreign investment, up from 16.4 per cent in the
previous year, emphasising the Japanese focus on expansion in China and
south-east Asia.
Investment in new plant in other Asian countries is forecast to rise 26 per
cent, a spectacular turnround from last year's 2.6 per cent fall, according
to the Miti survey. Within this, manufacturing industry is forecast to
increase Asian investment outside Japan by 56.1 per cent.
The long-term shift of production out of Japan paused slightly during the
recession. But the Miti survey suggests it is now on the verge of a second
advance.
This is a response to the yen's renewed strength in the past year and
reflects manufacturers' strategy of adding component plants to the basic
assembly lines they established in east Asia during the late 1980s.
This trend has already prompted concern within Japan that its manufacturing
industry will be 'hollowed-out' by the shift of production abroad.
Japanese investment in China is now aimed at capitalising on the strong
growth of domestic demand, along with taking advantage of the country as a
low-cost production site for exports.
In areas outside Asia, improvement in corporate investment appears to be
patchy. Manufacturers expect to cut spending by 3.5 per cent across the
board this year, a less severe reduction than the 19.6 per cent cut last
year. Service industries and utilities forecast a 3.6 per cent rise.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Brussels calls for new GSP trade plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday recommended an overhaul of trade benefits
for around 60 developing countries, with new incentives for improving
environmental and labour standards.
The guidelines are part of a review of the generalised system of preferences
which grants tariff advantages to developing countries to help them export
to the EU market.
The GSP review, which takes place every 10 years, is part of a wide-ranging
Brussels effort to update trade policy toward the developing world.
The Commission is waiting to hear views from EU ministers and the European
Parliament before it decides on how to apply the new GSP scheme to specific
countries and sectors. But the broad outlines of reform are already clear
ahead of the Commission's ambitious deadline of January 1 1995 for starting
the new scheme.
First, the Commission wants to offer extra trade benefits to encourage
countries to pursue sound environmental policies and follow international
labour agreements on the lines of the ILO convention. Brussels officials
argue that this amounts to 'positive' discrimination which should not
therefore arouse opposition from Gatt.
Mr Pierre Defraigne, senior Commission official in charge of North-South
relations, added that Brussels had deliberately underlined the link between
social and environmental policies and trade.
Second, the new guidelines are supposed to be simpler to manage. Starting
with Gatt's Most Favoured Nation status as a baseline, Brussels wants to
offer new flexible rates which will decline progressively from 50 per cent,
75 per cent and 100 per cent of MFN.
Third, the goal is to reduce the number of countries eligible for GSP, with
'super-competitors' such as fast-growing east Asian economies dropping out
of the running. The criteria for GSP eligibility will be per capital GDP and
the proportion of manufacturing for exports which directly competes with
European products in the EU market.
Fourth, the Commission wants to introduce a safeguard clause 'very close to
the Gatt safety clause', said Mr Defraigne. This would operate against as
yet unidentified 'sensitive' products.
China can expect to benefit from GSP, though Brussels will put a ceiling on
benefits because of the size of the Chinese economy. Similarly, Mr Manuel
Marin, the EU Commissioner in charge of the exercise, is expected to press
ministers to continue extra trade benefits for the Andean countries fighting
drug trafficking. Venezuela and, possibly, Panama may also benefit.
GSP was long the favoured alternative for developing countries not advanced
enough to take advantage of the Gatt multilateral trading system, which
relies on members offering reciprocal concessions. In the wake of the
progressive dismantling of tariffs under the Uruguay Round agreement, GSP is
viewed as a complement to Gatt.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Venezuela restores right of economic freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government has restored a constitutional provision granting
the private sector freedom of economic activity, writes Joseph Mann in
Caracas.
Wednesday's action, praised by businessmen, lifted the February 26
suspension of so-called 'economic guarantees', which enshrine the
individual's right 'to freely engage in the economic activity of his choice'
without undue government interference.
At the time of the suspension, the government of President Rafael Caldera
said the measure would be temporary.
Businessmen were worried, however, that the government would use the
suspension to wield special economic powers, such as extensive price
controls. The previous suspension of economic guarantees lasted 30 years.
Ironically, on the same day as this move toward economic liberalisation, the
cabinet approved a three-month extension of price controls on a wide range
of pharmaceutical products.
Mr Alberto Poletto, industry minister, said however, that some 'moderate'
price increases would be permitted for medicines, and that it was not the
government's 'style' to decree price controls on a general basis.
Venezuela's central bank revealed on Wednesday that the consumer price index
rose 5.2 per cent in May, the highest monthly increase in recent years. Most
of the May rise was due to higher import costs related to a rapid
devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar during April and most of May.
Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said inflation this year was now expected
to reach 50-60 per cent, compared with 46 per cent in 1993.

FT  03 JUN 94 / US workers 'must share in decisions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sustained employee participation in decision-making is a critical factor in
increasing economic performance, a panel appointed by the Clinton
administration reported yesterday.
The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, chaired by
former labour secretary John Dunlop, over the past year undertook one of the
most comprehensive examinations of US labour-management relations in 60
years.
In its 150-page report the Commission found that viable, high-quality
employee participation arrangements are rare because the structure of US
labour law, which has not changed much since the 1930s, makes managers wary
of changing traditional decision-making hierarchies.
A survey by the commission shows that 40m to 50m US workers would like to
participate in critical decisions on their job but have no opportunity to do
so.
'Employee participation has grown and is designed to increase efficiency,
performance and quality,' Mr Dunlop said. '(But) the high performance
workplace may well be limited in the eyes of employers by our existing
statutory arrangements.'
The report says only 5 per cent of employee participation programs can be
classified as 'high performance' - a full partnership between management and
labour resulting in increased productivity - even though one fifth to one
third of all employees are involved in such programmes.
The Commission has not yet published its recommendations, which could change
such fundamental aspects of US law as the National Labour Relations Act
passed under the New Deal. The Dunlop Commission's recommendations are due
out this autumn.
The Commission also found that most sectors of American society support
workers' right to unionise and participate in collective bargaining.
In practice, it discovered employees cannot always organise and elect
representatives in a manner free from coercion and interference, by either
management or union officials.
The labour secretary, Mr Robert Reich, said yesterday cases of illegal
employment practices had increased recently among a small number of US
employers.
Mr Dunlop also said his panel found that the tremendous increase in rights
and protections granted to individual workers in the last 50 years by both
state and federal legislatures has led to a flood of litigation that could
often interfere with workplace productivity.
Mr Reich said that last year 46,000 complaints of alleged labour law
violations were brought to the Department of Labour alone.
The Dunlop Commission report explains this on US reliance on the civil court
system to resolve labour disputes and rights violations, whereas other
nations use specialised, tripartite employment courts.
At time of decreasing rates of productivity growth and stagnating inflation
adjusted wages (wages for males actually fell for the first time in 75
years) the Commission hopes to be able to find common ground between
management and labour unions, Mr Dunlop said.
Mr Reich also said business and government should be alarmed by Commission
findings on the growing income gap in the US, currently the largest of any
industrialised nation. Over time, this increasing difference between rich
and poor, and educated and uneducated, would lead to a sharp erosion in both
productivity and competitiveness, he said.

<TEXT>
Banking group National Westminster rose 20 to 444p and saw trade of a hefty
10m shares, making it one of the day's most active stocks, after UBS turned
buyer of the shares and upgraded profits and dividend expectations.
Mr John Aitken, at UBS, who previously had the stock marked as a hold,
lifted his current-year profits expectations by Pounds 150m to Pounds
1.55bn, and by Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.9bn for the following year.
The broker also raised its dividend forecast for the current year by 17 per
cent to 21.5p.
Hints from Granada at its results meeting on Wednesday that it would be
interested in bidding for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV, should the government
relax the current industry takeover rules, had a predictable effect on the
latter's shares, which shot forward 24 to 300p. Worries over funding for
such an expansionary strategy hemmed in Granada, which paid Pounds 760m for
LWT earlier this year, to a penny rise at 502p.
Slow advertising volumes at Scottish TV were reported at the group's agm and
the shares slid 15 to 399p.
A stock overhang continued to depress British Aerospace, which declined 7 to
448p. Sentiment was further damaged by worries over leasing contracts.
Engineering group Siebe, which reported a 19.7 per cent increase in
full-year profits to Pounds 217.2m, remained in the doldrums for most of the
session but managed to close 2 ahead at 549p after trade of 2.8m.
Several brokers upgraded profits expectations for the current year,
including NatWest Securities, which now expects profits to be Pounds 5m
higher at Pounds 257.5m. However, Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest said: 'The
shares will be a good recovery play provided the company can improve on the
margins.'
Profit-taking at submarine builder VSEL, which reported figures in line with
market expectations, saw the shares tumble 50 to 928p. Hoare Govett also
weighed in with a profits downgrade, trimming its current-year estimate by
Pounds 2m to Pounds 65m.
The news that shipping and engineering group Vosper Thornycroft had failed
in its joint bid for a five-year contract to supply minehunters to the
Australian navy sent the shares into retreat and they closed 24 down at
740p.
Fears that the UK may be forced to change over to Continental electrical
plugs and sockets hurt electricals group Delta. The shares relinquished 17
to 517p.
The regional electricity company stocks were a weak feature as some
pronounced selling defied the usual trend of following the gilts market,
which yesterday was higher.
However, the strong market was proving irresistible towards the close and a
sector-wide rally saw the shares come off their worst. Among the sector
leaders, Eastern lost 10 at 575p, London 8 at 544p and Southern 6 at 559p.
Water issues, on the other hand, were underpinned by continuing hopes that
the 'K factor' - the amount by which the industry regulator allows water
companies to raise prices over and above inflation - will be higher than
analysts forecast. Yorkshire, boosted by good results, advanced 17 to 512p,
South West 13 to 516p and Anglian 11 to 486p.
The strong performances seen in Bass in recent sessions continued, the
shares adding 15 at 534p.
News that a Saudi Arabian prince is to take a stake of up to 25 per cent in
Euro Disney sent the shares sharply forward by 15 to 365p. Rank Organisation
surged 20 to 379p, with house broker SG Warburg said to be recommending the
shares. Profit-takers took the shine from Stakis results, the shares
slipping 2 to 85 1/2 p.
British Airways hardened 6 to 380p on turnover of 4.5m ahead of today's
passenger traffic figures for the month of May. Figures for April
disappointed the market, leading to a slide in the shares. One analyst said
yesterday: 'I shall consider anything above a 7 per cent increase to be
really good.'
Vague bid talk returned to Royal Insurance and the shares appreciated 17 to
259p. The stock is favoured by BZW, which issued a note earlier this week
saying the shares were 'undervalued'.
Buying said to have started in the US encouraged support in London for
tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries, which finished 17
higher at 419p.
An upbeat statement at engineering group Glynwed International's annual
meeting saw the shares improve 7 to 355p.
UK airports operator BAA was said to have been recommended by James Capel.
The stock put on 25 at 933p.
News that the latest survey from the Halifax Building Society will show
house prices again in decline contributed to weakness in several
housebuilding stocks.
McAlpine dropped 18 to 241p after announcing a return to profitability, but
accompanying it with a Pounds 25m two-for-nine rights issue. Contracting
margins were also said to be under pressure. Elsewhere, John Laing weakened
9 to 298p and Bellway softened a penny to 233p.
A sharp jump in profits at Kalamazoo, the computer services group, saw the
shares gain 6 at 135p.
However, a fall in profits at Control Techniques sent the stock retreating
45 to 442p.
There were positive market debuts from publisher Cassell, placed at 143p and
ending the session 8 ahead at 151p, and tableware manufacturer Denby Group,
which came to the market at 130p and closed 7 ahead at 137p.
Relief that MEPC maintained the interim dividend, together with a positive
trading statement, helped the shares firm 5 to 455p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Analysts upgrade Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results ahead of market expectations lifted Boots, the high street retailer,
and prompted a series of profits upgrades from stockbroker analysts. The
results also brought a measure of relief to the stores sector after
disappointing remarks from Kingfisher at its annual meeting on Wednesday.
Profits of Pounds 484.4m, up 19 per cent from last year, came against
forecasts of Pounds 455m to Pounds 470m. Boots took an expected Pounds 68.5m
in exceptional charges for its Manoplax drug and Do It All home improvement
business. But strong cashflow transformed a Pounds 203.8m net debt position
to a Pounds 69m cash balance at the year-end.
Forecasts for 1994-95 were upgraded by around 5 per cent to the Pounds 550m
mark. The shares jumped 22 to 527p on turnover of 3.2m. Kingfisher weakened
7 to 515p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie records strongest daily gain
this year - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market took the opportunity of yesterday's holiday closure
in Frankfurt to mount a determined rally after its prolonged run of weak
trading sessions. The FT-SE 100 Index recorded its best daily gain for the
year as a strong recovery in UK government bonds, together with a better
performance from stock index futures, signalled growing suspicion among fund
managers that the near 5 per cent fall in share prices over the past two
weeks may have been overdone.
Buyers appeared as soon as the market opened and the pace quickened in the
second half of the session when gains in UK gilts were extended to nearly 2
1/2 points as US Federal bonds opened higher and the German bund, trading on
the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), reversed early
losses to forge ahead.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100-share Index at 2,980.8, the gain of
48.9 representing a recovery of all, and more, of the loss on the previous
day; it was the highest daily advance since December 29 last year when the
Footsie jumped by 49.7 points.
As so often in current market conditions, much of the lead came from stock
index futures, where the June contract narrowed its discount to the cash
market and recorded heavy trading volume.
With the focus on the futures-related blue chip stocks, the broader market
had a less dramatic session. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was finally a net 18.6
up at 3,556.3.
Bargain hunters appeared as soon as the market opened, following morning
meetings at most market firms at which buying recommendations had
predominated. Share gains were extended when the June stock index future
opened at a smaller discount to the underlying Footsie index than had been
seen for some days. This, in turn, pushed market firms to buy the underlying
stocks.
However, the advance was fairly restrained at first and it was only when the
UK gilts market turned sharply ahead that the gain on the Footsie moved
above the 20-point mark. There was little response to a modest fall in
Britain's longer leading economic indicator, nor to details of UK gold and
currency reserves, neither of which contained any surprises for the market.
It was left to the bond sector to give the final boost to a stock market
which turned strongly ahead in the final hour of trading to close at the
best level of the day.
Seaq volume of 613.9m shares compared with 530.7m on Wednesday but was
unexceptional; retail business was worth Pounds 1.12bn on the previous day,
also a modest total in spite of the sharp fall in the stock market.
Traders admitted to being caught out by the strength behind what was
generally categorised as a technical rally. The near term outlook still
depends on trends in the German bond market when it reopens this morning and
in the US markets' response to the payroll and unemployment data, due today.
One factor behind the recent weakness in the Footsie has been the absence of
support levels on the equity charts. For similar reasons, any recovery in
the market could run as far as Footsie 3,050 before being seriously
challenged.
Wall Street was showing a gain of only 1.23 on the Dow Average as London
closed for the day and some UK traders expressed concern over weakness in
some Far Eastern markets.

FT  03 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures bounced from recent lows to move sharply ahead,
encouraging a recovery in the cash market. However, the June Footsie futures
contract remained at a discount throughout the session, writes Terry Byland.
The discount against the cash market recorded by the June futures contract
was much reduced from the 30 points seen on Wednesday and trading volume
remained healthy.
Traders commented that selling had been overdone this week and that
investors were in the mood to test the market.
Some further selling from US sources was seen at the opening but, in the
absence of the Frankfurt markets, London futures soon rallied. For most of
the session the discount on the June future was cut to around 11 points and
the day's low of 2,923 on the contract was reached very early.
Buyers continued to appear throughout the day and the final official
quotation of 2,968 on the contract was 60 points higher than its previous
close and showed a discount reduced to 10 points against cash. Turnover at
the close was just above 17,500 lots.
However, in traded options, volume dipped from Wednesday's 36,389 contracts
to 30,170 yesterday, and the Footsie option recorded only 13,076, against
18,189. Among stock options, British Gas (1,819) headed the list.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail stocks decline on
sales figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices held steady yesterday even though bonds moved higher ahead
of today's crucial economic news, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.84 off at 3,758.99, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up a scant 0.02 at 457.65.
Advances led declines on the Big Board by 1,275 to 866 after moderate
turnover of 271.6m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched ahead 0.65 to
440.53 and the Nasdaq composite added 3.98 at 739.50.
Early on, stocks were firmer, as the Treasury debt market built upon its
solid advance in the previous session.
But the mood in equities was decidedly more restrained, especially when the
moderate gains struck by bonds began to be eroded near midday. Later, the
long bond moved upwards again, but share prices nudged into negative
territory where they tended to remain.
On balance, the day's economic news was neutral for stocks. The Commerce
Department said new orders of factory goods had slipped 0.1 per cent in
April, against forecasts of a slight upturn. The data suggested that the
economy was beginning to slow, perhaps in response to the series of interest
rate increases init-iated by the Federal Reserve this year.
While slower growth may eventually hold back corporate earnings - an obvious
negative for equities - a moderating trend also increases the likelihood of
the Fed delaying any additional rate actions.
A better gauge of the economy's strength was looming just ahead. May
employment data, due out this morning, may give investors more insight into
the impact of the Fed's move to tighter money.
Economists were forecasting an increase in non-farm payrolls of between
275,000 and 300,000, which would suggest steady, moderate growth.
A figure that exceeds expectations could bring forward the Fed's next move.
That prospect would probably trigger a fresh sell-off in stocks and bonds.
In the meantime, the market had to be content with digesting monthly sales
figures from the leading retail chains. The results were generally
lacklustre and most retailing stocks dipped on their release.
JC Penney posted a 5 per cent gain in sales for stores opened at least a
year. But the market appeared dissatisfied, as its stock was marked down
Dollars 2 to Dollars 49 3/4 .
Sears Roebuck also disappointed investors with its hefty 8.8 per cent
improvement. The stock dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50.
Best Buy, an electronics retailer, advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 30 3/8
on news of a 30 per cent jump in same-store sales.
Wal-Mart, the session's most active issue, slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
22 5/8 after posting same-store sales growth of 4.7 per cent.
US Surgical, which climbed Dollars 2 1/2 in the previous session on takeover
speculation, gave back Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 after Ciba-Geigy
denied that it was seeking to acquire the company.
On the Nasdaq, most technology issues were flat. Oracle was an exception.
Its share price added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 37 1/8 after its chief
executive said that he expected the software company's database business to
grow by 40 to 50 per cent in the new fiscal year.

Equities in Caracas recorded their fifth consecutive rise as foreign
investors, particularly from the US, were seen buying heavily. The market
has been attracting overseas interest following the decision earlier this
week to replace a capital gains tax of up to 37 per cent with a 1 per cent
share transaction levy.
The Merinvest index climbed 11.49, or 8.2 per cent, to 150.80 in turnover
that was reported to be above Dollars 6m, compared with a recent average of
some Dollars 3m.
Caracas is one of the smallest of the Latin American markets, with a total
capitalisation of some Dollars 6bn, and, in dollar terms, has underperformed
the region in the IFC emerging markets index.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Strength in De Beers and Anglos lifts
Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong showing by De Beers, the diamonds combine, and Anglos, the mining
finance house, took Johannesburg's overall index up by nearly a percentage
point yesterday, while gold shares and industrials floundered.
De Beers closed R7, or nearly 7 per cent, higher at R109 and Anglos gained
R5.50, or 2.5 per cent, at R224.40. Reflecting this the overall index
advanced 53 to 5,473. The industrials index was unchanged at 6,563 and
golds, weighed down by the weaker bullion price, declined 8 to 1,940.
Anglos produced better than expected full-year results on Wednesday. Of the
market as a whole, Mr Nick Harwood at Fleming Martin in London said the
International Finance Corporation's inclusion of South Africa in its
emerging markets index with a weighting of 13 per cent should be good for
sentiment.
'A weighting in a range of 13 to 16 per cent puts South Africa in line with
Malaysia and Mexico,' added Mr Harwood. 'It raises the Johannesburg market's
profile, and should attract fund managers who run passive, or index linked,
funds.'

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Euro Disney stars as Paris
clears 2,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late-closing markets had the best of the day's trading, writes Our Markets
Staff. Frankfurt was closed.
PARIS rose above 2,000, a semblance of confidence returning after a brief
sojourn below the support level on Wednesday.
The CAC-40 index finished 27.70, or 1.4 per cent, up at 2,007.38, with help
coming from the futures exchange and a 10 basis-point cut, albeit expected,
in the Bank of France's intervention rate at midsession.
Euro Disney was once again on investors' minds follow-ing the news that
Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, was to
buy between 13 and 24 per cent of the troubled theme park, and invest a
further Dollars 100m in the construction of a conference centre.
Coming just a few days before Euro Disney's extraordinary general meeting,
at which it was due to announce the terms of its FFr6bn rights issue, the
news was welcomed with a rise in the shares of FFr1.85, or 6 per cent, to
FFr32.00.
As James Capel noted, the shareholding of Walt Disney, the US parent, could
fall as low as 36 per cent if the rights issue is heavily subscribed by
existing shareholders. In that eventuality, Walt Disney has said that it
would be prepared to sell part of its own stake, up to a maximum of FFr1bn.
Mr Nigel Reed of Paribas Capital Markets commented that the impact of this
news would be felt following the rights issue since it was now less likely
that there would be an overhang of shares.
Schneider suffered a difficult day, with the shares losing FFr21.60 to
FFr368.90 following their suspension on Wednesday as investors reacted to
news that the group's chairman had been kept in custody in Belgium pending
further investigations over allegations of fraud, and that French police had
searched the group's Paris headquarters.
AMSTERDAM was encouraged by better than expected results from both KLM and
ING, the financial services group. As a result the AEX index, which had
suffered a fright on Wednesday, recovered most of the lost ground, closing
2.24 higher at 399.76.
Hoare Govett said it expected the market's consolidation to continue in the
short term, particularly as cyclical stocks had outperformed the average by
between 20 to 50 per cent in the year to date. 'This period of consolidation
will allow relative gains in defensive stocks, such as food and beverages,
publishers and (when the bond market recovers) financials,' they added.
The financial sector came into play as ING's first-quarter results exceeded
analysts' expectations and moved the shares 80 cents higher to Fl 76.10. The
group noted that it had lost some Fl 99m from trade in emerging market debt
and foreign exchange arbitrage, compared to a profit of Fl 261m the previous
year.
KLM was down by the end of trading, off 50 cents at Fl 51.40 after a day's
high of Fl 52.70, with traders noting profit-taking following gains in
recent days. The airline, which turned a loss in the same year-ago period of
Fl 562m into a profit of Fl 103m, said that in spite of the results it would
be proposing to omit the dividend when shareholders meet in August.
ZURICH showed some resilience, but it closed too early to enjoy the final
kick which was seen in later closing bourses.
The SMI index eased 5.6 to 2,725.9. Volume was thin, said Mr Frederick
Hasslauer of Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich, reckoning on between SFr600m and
SFr700m against Wednesday's SFr1.05bn.
Weakness in cyclicals continued and an early rise in Roche, a major index
component, turned to weakness in the afternoon as the certificates closed
SFr10 lower at SFr6,790.
Among the cyclicals, BBC Brown Boveri lost another SFr20 to SFr1,215 and
Holderbank SFr16 at SFr929. At Sulzer, down SFr10 at SFr905 and SFr74 lower
over the past five trading days, a heart valve scandal in Germany has been a
drain on sentiment. However, said Mr Hasslauer, Sulzer's US subsidiary,
which makes the valves, has only had a presence in the German market since
January of this year.
MADRID's general index ended higher after a see-saw day, up 2.78 at 324.16
after a low of 319.57. Santander lost out on the technical and bond market
considerations which took most blue chips higher, falling another Pta155, or
3.2 per cent to Pta4,730.
HELSINKI closed higher following four-month figures from Nokia, the
electronics and industrial conglomerate which was a major outperformer in
the share price charts, both in 1993 and early in 1994.
Nokia reported a 136 per cent jump in operating profits, and its share price
rise of FM11 to FM419 was almost entirely responsible for taking the Hex
index out of the doldrums early in the day to close 8.25 higher at 1,779.6,
in turnover of FM147m.
TEL AVIV fell to an 18-month low, the Mishtanim index losing 6.51, or 3.6
per cent to 176.21 as turnover rose from Shk219m to Shk273m.
On Wednesday Mr Sam Bronfeld, director general of the Tel Aviv stock
exchange, dismissed hopes of a Middle East 'peace dividend', describing as
an 'illusion' the Israeli government theory that the peace deal with the PLO
will bring about investment and increased growth.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim quivers but
Nikkei stays above 21,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks declined somewhat following four days of strong gains, but the Nikkei
225 average managed to stay above 21,000 on hopes that it could rally again,
writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The index slipped 44.11 to 21,009.00. An afternoon high of 21,198.11,
topping last year's closing peak of 21,148.11, was followed by a wave of
profit-taking and a day's low of 20,965.69 just before the close.
The Nikkei 300 receded 1.12 to 308.77. Volume, down from Wednesday's 691m
shares, remained heavy at 650m. The Topix index of all first section stocks
lost 3.92 at 1,689.66, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.02 firmer
at 1,396.12.
Most analysts remained cautiously optimistic. Mr Keiji Ikeda, a trader at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, said that the day's modest decline was no
more than 'a digesting process after four days of rising prices'.
Mr Ikeda viewed the continued strong volume in the market as positive. 'This
is the third time the market has tested the 21,000 level,' he said, 'but,
this time, the volume looks stable.'
Oils were mixed. After gains in the morning session, Nippon Oil ended a net
Y2 off at Y776 and Japan Energy also Y2 down at Y456. Cosmo Oil benefited
from a report that the company had won a concession from the Abu Dhabi
government to develop a new oil field in the United Arab Emirates, the first
such concession won by a foreign company since the 1973 oil crisis. At the
close, Cosmo was up Y7 at Y881.
Mitsubishi Oil retreated Y26 to Y955 on rumours, which it denied, that it
had suffered losses on foreign exchange transactions.
Multimedia related shares gave back most of Wednesday's gains. Hitachi was
down Y20 to Y1,080, Fujitsu dipped Y10 to Y1,120 and the telecommunications
giant NTT declined Y9.000 to Y883,000.
In Osaka the OSE average was 76.87 higher at 23,388.06. Volume for the day
amounted to 45.1m shares.
Roundup
Rumours, technical selling and adverse corporate reports gave a number of
Pacific Rim markets an uncomfortable day.
HONG KONG dropped 3 per cent, brokers blaming a spate of covered warrant
issues and the market's failure to break out of its current trading range.
The Hang Seng index closed 289.73 lower at 9,224.44 and turnover eased from
HKDollars 4.04bn to HKDollars 3.60bn.
The view was that by issuing covered warrants, shareholders had locked in
profits while taking money out of the market, and that traders were now
wondering where buying support would come from.
Among heavily traded third-party warrants, Smart-Hopewell '94 lost 16 cents
to 92 cents, Fleming-Cheung Kong '95 fell 14 cents to 73 cents, SBC-Wharf
'95 dipped 13 cents to 69 cents and BZW-HSBC '96 shed 22 cents to HKDollars
1.19.
In the share market, conglomerates were hit by worries that covered warrants
were likely to be issued on their shares. Swire 'A' fell HKDollars 2.50 to
HKDollars 58.50, Jardine Matheson HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 59 and
Hutchison HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 32.25.
KUALA LUMPUR plunged nearly 3 per cent, driven lower by rumours and by
technical selling. The composite index lost 27.36 at 955.44 as volume rose
to 131.5m shares from 93.7m. Turnover was MDollars 621m.
Speculative stocks were most affected, especially those associated with
Samsudin Abu Hassan. Granite Industries, in which he holds a controlling
stake, was the day's most active issue, dropping 38 cents to MDollars 3.80
on rumours that it could lose its licence to operate gaming machines in
China.
After hours, the KLSE executive chairman, Nik Mohamed Din Nik Yusoff, denied
stories that several brokerages face financial difficulties.
SINGAPORE saw negative sentiment spill over from the heavy liquidations in
the Malaysian stock market, and the Straits Times Industrial index fell
15.50 to 2,252.38.
Brokers said, however, that the declines in Singapore blue chips were
contained since volume was only 105.92m shares. Malaysia's Idris Hydraulics,
Mulpha International, Promet, Renong and Landmarks were among fallers, and
led volume.
SEOUL staged a rebound in most telecommunications related shares and, while
concerns about North Korea's nuclear programme still overshadowed the
market, the composite stock index rose 4.66 to 937.43.
The state-funded Korea Telecom sold off 1.16m shares in Korea Mobile Telecom
much more quickly than planned. Both Korea Mobile and Dacom went the day's
limit up, gaining Won6,000 and Won3,000 at Won295,000 and Won132,000
respectively.
Posco led a blue-chip rebound, adding Won2,000, limit-high, at Won69,000.
Taekwang Industry, South Korea's most expensive share, also sparked
high-price buying, closing Won10,000 higher at Won430,000.
SYDNEY was upset by a sharp decline in News Corp on reports that the US
Federal Communications Commission might be conducting an investigation into
the media group's activities there. The stock receded 30 cents, or 3.2 per
cent, to ADollars 8.90 in volume of some 3.2m shares.
The All Ordinaries index retreated 20.2 to 2,077.0 in turnover of ADollars
435m.
Retailers lost ground on poorer than expected retail sales data: Coles shed
5 cents to ADollars 4.28 and Woolworths 1 cent to ADollars 3.00.
TAIPEI was generally lower, although export-related stocks advanced
following the recent depreciation of the Taiwanese dollar.
The weighted index relinquished 4.83 to 5,956.62 in turnover of TDollars
57.5bn.
BOMBAY was lifted by heavy buying from foreign institutions on the last day
of the account. The BSE 30-share index finished 61.83 ahead at 3,895.32.
Brokers said that market fundamentals were strong at the moment because of
recent good corporate results and forecasts that the monsoon rains were
likely to be normal this year.
WELLINGTON improved, with domestic investors encouraged by reports that
there had been an uplift in foreign investment following news that the
government expected to report its first budget surplus for 17 years.
The NZSE-40 capital index added 11.55 at 2,147.76, with Telecom gaining 9
cents at NZDollars 5.02 in thin volume.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Firmer tone to dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar finished firmer yesterday ahead of the release today of important
US labour market data, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency tested the upper limits of its recent trading range to close
in London nearly a pfennig higher against the D-Mark at DM1.6515 from
DM1.6428. It was also firmer against the yen at Y104.930 from Y104.650. In
New York it ended at DM1.6532 and Y104.80.
Trading, however, was fairly thin, with many large investors out of the
market attending the Forex 94 conference which is under way in London.
Analysts said it was unlikely that the firmer tone represented the beginning
of a new trend for the dollar.
The interest rate futures markets were again very active. Short sterling
contracts regained some of the ground lost recently, while Euromark
contracts saw heavy volumes.
In Europe the Swedish krona recovered slightly from recent weakness to close
at SKr4.756 against the D-Mark from SKr4.787. The Bank of France cut its
intervention rate to 5.30 per cent from 5.40 per cent.
Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank, said there had
been a 'very corrective feel' about a lot of the trading yesterday, with
most markets retracing the moves of earlier in the week. Currencies again
took their lead from the more turbulent bond markets.
'You cannot have the sorts of falls in credit markets we have seen recently
and not experience some sort of correction,' said Mr Barr. It was a classic
case of markets where there was lots of 'noise', and few firm trends to
follow.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London, said there
had been cautious dollar buying, which probably reflected that the market
had been short at the beginning of the week. He said dollar purchases had
also been prompted by indications earlier in the week that the US non-farm
payroll figure today might be quite strong.
Mr Barr added that the US employment data were unlikely to give the dollar
fresh impetus but, if anything, this would be on the downside. The recent
pattern has been for strong figures to cause a slide in bond prices, which
has then fed over into a weaker dollar.
The futures markets were again very active, partly for technical reasons as
investors rolled over positions in the June contracts, which will soon be
expiring. With considerable cash buying seen across the yield curve, traders
were also hedging positions through the futures market.
The December short sterling contract settled at 93.61, up 12 basis points
from Wednesday's close. More than 27,000 lots were traded. The December
Euromark contract saw nearly 69,000 lots dealt and ended slightly easier at
94.78 from 94.81.
Following recent reversals in the market, dealers were reluctant to predict
that the sharp rally in short sterling would be sustained. But the return of
genuine buying interest was reported. Traders said the market had also been
ripe for a correction after sharp falls earlier in the week.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 15m. The central bank had earlier provided Pounds 335m of liquidity
to the market after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. Over-night money
traded between 3 per cent and 5 1/8 per cent.
Money markets in most German centres were closed on account of the Corpus
Christi holiday. Trade resumes today.
The pound finished the day with the sterling index unchanged, after earlier
testing the psychologically important DM2.50 barrier against the D-Mark. The
UK currency closed at DM2.4977, up from DM2.4922 on Wednesday and off a high
for the day of DM2.5020.
Mr Hawkins said most of the potentially bad news about the currency appeared
to have been discounted, while recent economic figures were on the strong
side of expectations. Even allowing for stronger German growth, interest
rate differentials were still likely to move in sterling's favour.
The main constraint on the UK currency, said Mr Hawkins, was its close link
to the dollar.
Analysts said the rate cut by the Bank of France showed that it was sticking
to the pattern of tracking the Bundesbank. Mr Hawkins said the central bank
tended to move when the spread between the intervention rate and the German
repo rate was more than 20 basis points.
He added, though, that the current spread of 15 basis points was 'about as
tight as they would like to go'.
In Greece, meanwhile, Mr Yannos Papandoniou, the economy minister, declared
that the recent drachma crisis was over. 'Markets have now understood that
our foreign exchange policy is, and it will remain, unchanged.'
The drachma was fixed at Dr149.50 against the D-Mark from the previous fix
of Dr149.150. Interest rates continue to fall. The Athens Interbank Offered
Rate (ATHIBOR) for one month dropped to 60.46 per cent, from 78.75 per cent
on Wednesday and 120 per cent on Tuesday.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traditional suppliers seek EU
sugar supply priority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Union's traditional raw sugar suppliers have asked to be given
first call on any new import quotas required and have started negotiations
to supply about 260,000 tonnes per year of raw sugar which will be needed by
Portugal.
The price which the EU has suggested for additional sugar imported from the
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group is based on a formula which adds
four cents to the going world market price, which would currently be about
nine cents less than the ACP gets for its guaranteed sales of 1.3m tonnes
per year.
Officials of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean, who reported on the
talks with the EU, said that the expected expansion of the Union would
create to the prospect of 'additional access for ACP sugar to the EU of
possibly between 330,000 to 400,000 tonnes each year at preferential
prices'.
In particular, the group is targeting Portugal which has been receiving
about 75,000 tonnes per year from four ACP states - Cote d'Ivoire, Malawi,
Swaziland, Zambia.
Portugal needs 260,000 tonnes per year of raw sugar which it now gets from
the world market, according to the Sugar Association. ACP members want to be
given first call on any quotas issued for imports by Portugal.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oslo deal on oil development in
the Skagerakk
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The dispute over oil drilling in the Norwegian sector of the environmentally
sensitive Skagerakk reached new heights yesterday after the minority Labour
government cut a deal to gain backing for the move from the opposition
Conservative party, which on Wednesday had vowed to block the proposal.
In an about turn, the Conservative party decided to support Labour's
proposal to open the Skagerakk for limited drilling, and eventually
development, as a trade off for the government agreeing to undertake fresh
environmental studies to assess the potential impact of oil activity there.
As part of the deal, the government also agreed to re-examine its stand
against lifting the so-called sliding scale. The measure allows the state to
increase its shareholding in oil and gas fields once they have been declared
commercial.
Environmentalists, outraged by the Conservatives' move, described it as a
political sell-out.
The government two years ago removed the sliding-scale for licenses offered
in the 14th licensing round and onwards, but the measure still exists for
acreage allotted prior to the 14th round which has been proved commercial
and is currently in the queue for development.
Oil companies have repeatedly warned the government that such discoveries
would not be developed unless the sliding scale was dropped and the
draconian petroleum tax regime adjusted to take into consideration
prevailing low oil prices. The government proposed opening the Skagerakk for
limited drilling in March as part of a plan to expand drilling acreage by up
to 16 per cent to stem a steep decline in oil production expected after
1996.
The proposal has been met with wide-spread criticism from environmentalists,
the fishing industry and the state pollution board.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee bounces back as roasters
return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Coffee market returned to the offensive yesterday with London prices
shooting up and traders predicting more gains as supplies remain tight.
Coffee prices recovered much of Wednesday's losses with the September
futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange up Dollars 44 a tonne to
Dollars 2,080 a tonne.
Traders said that much of the speculative and hedge fund selling which had
pushed prices down on Wednesday was absent from the market and that roasters
were buying again.
'We are not seeing much new coffee come on to the market, the speculators
have taken their profits and prices look ready to move up again,' one trader
commented.
However, Mr Rubens Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador to Britain said yesterday
that producers would be damaged if prices went up much more.
The cocoa market rose higher on the coat tails of coffee with the September
futures contract increasing by Pounds 10 a tonne to Pounds 1,041 a tonne.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Why jute is made to feel a poor
relation - The IJO's problem financing even modest development programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US, one of the largest importers of jute goods, has announced that it is
to give up membership of the 10-year-old International Jute Organisation by
the end of June. Its departure will leave the IJO - set up to promote the
second most important natural fibre after cotton - with five jute producing
countries and 22 importers.
The development takes place at a time when the IJO is planning to intensify
efforts to recruit new members from among the 'many important importing
countries and producers who remain outside the organisation,' in the words
of Mr KM Rabbani, its executive director. He says that the 'proposed US
withdrawal from IJO is part of that country's policy to stay away from
commodity related organisations.'
Its decision, he believes, may not have got anything to do with the working
of the organisation 'which has managed to stay extremely lean'. He says that
the cost of running the Dhaka-based IJO is about Dollars 1m a year.
Undoubtedly, however, the US pull-out will make the task of enlarging the
membership of IJO difficult.
The IJO is primarily concerned with the identification of projects relating
to 'agriculture, industry and market promotion', arranging funds for them,
and ensuring that the research results lead to the improvement of jute's
competitiveness in relation to other packaging materials. But mobilisation
of finance has proved increasingly difficult.
Mr Rabbani says that four agricultural, four industrial and four market
promotion projects are awaiting funding of a little over Dollars 7m. Of the
12 projects, the IJO has strongly recommended three to the Common Fund for
Commodities (CFC). They are the varietal improvement of jute and kenaf for
increased productivity; development of jute based packaging and jute
intermediates as substitutes for wood, plywood and other packaging
materials; and market development and promotion of jute goods in western
Europe.
The estimated cost of the three projects is a mere Dollars 2.17m. The CFC is
expected to be the main source of funding and the fact that it cannot meet
the requirements for these modest projects has now become a matter of
serious concern to the IJO. The member countries of the IJO seem unlikely to
enlarge their project-related financial assistance, but they may help the
IJO in obtaining funds from multinational organisations.'
The annual funding requirement for projects is between Dollars 3m and
Dollars 4m, says Mr Rabbani. In spite of the financial constraint which IJO
has lived with since it was established it has been able to implement a
number of projects involving a total funding of nearly Dollars 5.5m. The
most important of them was the collection, conservation and exchange of
germplasm (part of the genetic material) for the development of improved
varieties of jute, kenaf and allied fibres. A bank with 2,600 varieties of
germplasm has been created at the Bangladesh Jute Industries Research
Association headquarters in Dhaka.
Mr Rabbani expects that in the 'next three or four years, it should be
possible to produce seeds through cross breeding which will lead to a
significant improvement in the productivity of jute'. He says that 'the
improvement in agricultural productivity at a low cost to the farmer' is
vital in view of the 'declining trend in the real price of jute.'
The only way for the jute producers to sustain their income is by getting
higher yields, at a time when more and more land is being switched from jute
to food crops. Jute is increasingly concentrated on marginal and less
fertile land which has placed a premium on productivity. Two IJO projects
relating to the strengthening jute and kenaf seeds (Dollars 651,107) and the
improved retting, or softening, and extraction of jute (Dollars 895,000) now
under implementation could help productivity.
Mr Rabbani says: 'We will be preparing a manual for the processing, grading
and storage of seeds. If the farmers can be persuaded to use the jute seeder
machine developed by the IJO, it would lead to better germination of seeds.
In the traditional system of broadcast of jute seeds, the wastage factor is
high.'
The quality of jute in all producing countries suffers because of
unscientific retting and manual extraction of fibre from the plant. Retting
of jute in clean water and extraction of fibre by mechanical means will
automatically improve the quality of the crop.
Mr Rabbani is giving high priority to the retting project. The IJO has so
far assigned the projects to the jute research institutions of the member
countries. It thinks, however, that there is scope for collaboration with
'scientific institutions that have no direct connection with jute', but
which have the capacity to undertake work on the development and promotion
of the fibre which producers must feel at present is something of a poor
relation in the world of soft commodities.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cargill biodiesel-from-rape
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cargill, one of the world's largest privately-owned agriculture and
commodities companies, is joining United Oilseeds Marketing, a co-operative,
in a project to produce up to 100,000 tonnes of biodiesel a year from
oilseed rape.
'Two years ago if you mentioned industrial crops you were a bit of a crank,
but since then we've seen huge demand from farmers and industrial customers
to get to grips with non-food crops,' said Ms Ann Gutteridge, an oilseeds
trader at Cargill.
Farmers are able to grow non-food crops on land set-aside as part of the
European Union's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy without giving up
subsidies.
French farmers have been growing oilseeds for the production of biofuels for
the past three years. But in the UK the industry has not got off the ground,
mainly because of scepticism by the government over its viability.
Cargill says it can use its own funding to show that biodiesel could be made
viable in the UK, but it also wants to open a discussion with the government
about opportunities for use of the fuel.
The company said that the project would involve 'millions of pounds
expenditure', but said it was too soon to put a final figure on it.
The scheme could be in place by next year's harvest, the company says, if it
can secure commitment from farmers to grow enough oilseeds and if it can
find a market for the fuel. Cargill will then commission a biodiesel
conversion plant at either Hull or Liverpool. It plans to guarantee farmers
up to Pounds 120 a tonne for the oilseeds.
Biodiesel is expected to be 10p more expensive to produce than conventional
diesel but could be made competitive if the government was prepared to take
a lower tax levy on the fuel.
A recent report from the British Association for Bio Fuels and Oils called
on the government to tax biodiesel at 10 per cent of the rate on fossil
fuel. This would mean the Treasury giving up on revenues of Pounds 28m. It
suggests the government could recover this by adding 0.20p per litre tax on
conventional diesel.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers to double Akwatia
output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ACCRA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers is installing a new process at Ghana's Akwatia diamond mine which
will soon double its output to 40,000 carats a month as the government
prepares to divest from Ghana Consolidated Diamonds (GCD) next year.
The new process will treat and recover more diamonds, improve their quality,
reduce losses by increasing security and cut the operating costs, according
to Mr J Ansafo-Mensah, GCD's managing director.
De Beers took over interim management of Ghana's only large-scale diamond
mine last October, after Inckel International withdrew from a proposed joint
venture with the government and the US gem marketing company Lazare-Kaplan
in 1992.
Under the new agreement, which has to be approved by Ghana's parliament, GCD
will be restructured by September 1995 as a new company in which De Beers
and Lazare-Kaplan will each own 40 per cent.
The government of Ghana will retain 20 per cent of the assets, and De Beers
Central Selling Organisation will take over the marketing of the diamonds
from Lazare-Kaplan.
When De Beers took over the management last October it increased production
from about 10,000 carats a month to 20,000 carats and from about July output
is expected to reach 40,000 carats a month.
De Beers is reducing the two plants at Akwatia to one and replacing the
bore-milling and pan processes with a dense media separation plant which
will feed a concentrate into an X-ray sorting machine. The equipment is
exclusive to De Beers and is due to begin operating in June on lease to GCD
until the new company is formed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The official Australian market indicator closed this week at 628 cents a
kg., 11 cents higher than a week before and at a new high for the season.
The market cannot however be described as outstandisgly buoyant. Finer
Merinoes were again in strong demand, and there were price increases
affecting other categories, but New Zealand was a cheaper market. An erratic
and uncertain market impression is not unusual towards the end of a selling
season, but it is making the task of passing on recent wool price rises to
retailers a good deal more difficult. For wool the rises in price has been
enhanced by currency changes, with the Australian dollar strong against the
US dollar as well as against sterling.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Short-covering lifts prices after volatile
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The heavy selling that has battered European government bond markets in
recent days abated yesterday, allowing several markets to edge higher.
After a volatile session, prices were lifted in the afternoon by
short-covering in the futures markets as traders squared positions ahead of
today's US employment data.
The UK gilt market, which had dramatically underperformed the rest of Europe
in the last few days, outperformed its neighbours in a sharp rebound,
especially among longer-dated maturities. Supported at the open by firmer US
Treasuries, longer-dated gilts were further boosted by investors shifting
funds from the short end of the yield curve to the long end.
However, many saw the gains as largely technical after the recent sharp
declines. 'There hasn't been a huge amount of cash buying - the market
outperformed today because it massively underperformed in the last few
days,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets.
Moreover, many traders were squaring their positions ahead of the US data,
causing a short-squeeze in the gilt future.
Despite the market's strong performance, few felt it heralded the end of the
sell-off.
The long gilt futures contract jumped by more than two points to 101 29/32 ,
while the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose by more than three points to
around 103 1/2 , its yield falling by 36 basis points on the day to 8.41 per
cent.
The sharp recovery caused the 10-year benchmark's yield premium over its
German counterpart to narrow by some 30 basis points to 160 basis points.
French bonds ended lower despite the Bank of France's 10 basis point cut in
its intervention rate to 5.30 per cent.
The auction of FFr19.9bn of debt, including FFr16.5bn of the new benchmark 6
3/4 per cent bonds due October 2004, went relatively well, with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1 on the 10-year bond and a 3.1 bid-to-cover ratio
on the 6 per cent bonds due October 2025.
However, according to one Paris trader 'it was a purely professionally
driven auction'. He added that the lack of retail demand for the paper put
heavy pressure on prices after the auction announcement.
The June notional bond contract on Matif fell by 0.68 points to 115.88,
although it recovered to around 116.30 in after-hours trading on Globex.
With most parts of Germany closed for Corpus Christi holiday, the bund
market was somewhat calmer, although the bund futures contract on Liffe
remained volatile. By late trading it had risen 0.30 points to 92.52.
Italian bonds also staged a cautious recovery, mainly on short-covering in
the futures market. The June BTP future rose by 0.39 points to 107.43.
In Spain, the Treasury at its latest auction allotted around Pta90bn in
three and five-year paper but accepted no bids for 10 and 15-year bonds.
This put a damper on market sentiment, and the June bond future fell by 0.15
points to 93.60.
US Treasury bond prices improved yesterday ahead of this morning's crucial
jobs data.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  17/32 at
86-29/32, with the yield slipping to 7.338 per cent.
At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/8 at 99 15/16 , to yield 5.891
per cent.
Although the fundamental factors pushing European bonds lower this week had
no direct influence on Treasuries, analysts are beginning to see the trend
overseas as positive for the US market.
The retreat in Europe could bring an influx of funds into US government
securities, according to this view, especially if today's data on labour
market conditions in May proves favourable.
This prospect appeared to have played some part in the rebound on Wednesday
afternoon. The improvement had come even though that morning's economic news
contained a red flag on inflation.
Yesterday, the news was more positive for bonds. The Commerce Department
said new orders for factory goods had dipped by 0.1 per cent in April.
Economists had forecast a slight gain.
The decline suggested that the Federal Reserve's moves to tighter money this
year are having the desired effect of slowing the economy and easing any
incipient inflationary pressures.
The April index of leading indicators told much the same story. It held
steady after a gain of 0.7 per cent the previous month.
The data, combined with fairly stable commodity prices, brought a
constructive mood to the market. There was still an air of restraint,
however, with the May employment data looming today.
Analysts are expecting an increase of 275,000 to 300,000 in non-farm
payrolls. Bonds are likely give back all of the week's price gains and more
if the figure exceeded expectations.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: ISMA moves on settlement
period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Securities Market Association (ISMA) is to move to a
three-day settlement period for all international securities trades with
effect from June 1 1995.
The change, announced at ISMA's annual meeting, coincides with a reduction
to three-day settlement in the US corporate bond market.
Currently, the standard settlement period for international bonds is seven
calendar days. The reduction to three business days, rather than two, was
favoured due to time zone, funding and foreign exchange difficulties.
'It became apparent early on in our meetings that (two-day settlement) would
not be a realistic option for all ISMA members, due to the passing of
information such as settlement instructions in different time zones,' said
Mr John Dowsett, chairman of the settlement working committee.
For three-day settlement, a business day is defined as 'a day when both the
major international clearing systems (Euroclear and Cedel) and the relevant
cash markets of the underlying cash transaction are open.' Allowance will
also be made for public holidays falling between trade and settlement dates.
There are three main reasons for the change, according to Mr Dowsett: it
will reduce systemic risk (the potential knock-on effect created by the
failure of one institution to meet its obligations); market risk (the effect
of price swings between trading and settlement dates); and counterparty risk
(the risk of the financial failure of one party).
The shorter settlement period will also apply to domestic securities traded
under ISMA rules, subject to local rules.
The working committee's decision was not unanimous. Mr Alain Servais, of
Dewaay Servais, a Belgian broking firm, registered reservations on behalf of
members from his region. A shortening of the settlement period presents
special difficulties for Belgian members as many Belgian retail investors
hold their bonds in physical form.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Rare two-year offering from the
Province of Manitoba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issuance in the eurobond market was muted yesterday due to the continued
volatility in financial markets.
Choppy conditions this week have forced Salomon Brothers to delay the launch
of a Dollars 250m five-year issue for Japanese Development Bank because a
fall in Japanese government bond prices played havoc with a currency swap
linked to it.
However, syndicate managers believe issuance will pick up in the next few
weeks. There are rumours that the Province of Ontario is close to coming to
the market now that the uncertainty over its rating has been dispelled.
Mr John Madden, Ontario's assistant deputy minister of finance, confirmed
yesterday that he was looking closely at the euroyen sector but he declined
to comment further.
Among yesterday's deals, continued demand from retail investors in
continental Europe for Canadian dollar paper prompted a rare CDollars 150m
two-year offering from the Province of Manitoba, which last tapped the
euro-Canadian dollar sector six years ago.
Redemptions of Canadian dollar eurobonds are estimated at CDollars 1.9bn
this month, CDollars 500m in July and CDollars 1.9bn in August, and holders
are keen to roll over their positions rather than realise the currency
losses they have suffered.
Manitoba's bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the 7 3/4 per
cent Canadian Treasury due 1996, which syndicate managers said was too
tight, even taking the borrower's rarity value into account.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened out as far as 34
basis points over Treasuries, according to some dealers, before coming back
in to around 28 basis points.
However, lead manager Wood Gundy said the spread had widened only to around
26 basis points, which partly reflected the stronger underlying market.
By contrast, the pricing on the CDollars 100m five-year offering from GE
Capital Canada, at 18 basis points over Canadian Treasuries, was thought
fair.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread widened only marginally to 20
basis points while the price rose to 99.70 from a fixed re-offer level of
99.55. The proceeds are thought to have been swapped into floating-rate
Canadian dollars.
Elsewhere, Japan's Sapporo Breweries issued the first eurodollar warrant
bond since March.
Yamaichi, the lead manager, said that demand for the Dollars 200m four-year
offering came from across the board
It added that investors that did not want the equity exposure in the issue
had swapped the bonds for floating-rate dollars, achieving a yield of Libor
plus 20 basis points in the process.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Hoare Govett returns to
gilt-edged market making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker which now belongs to ABN Amro, the Dutch
Bank, has received approval from the Bank of England to become a gilt-edged
market-maker (Gemm). It will start operations on June 6.
Hoare Govett was a Gemm at the time of 'Big Bang' in the City of London, but
withdrew from the gilts market in 1988 as part of cost-cutting measures by
its then owner, Security Pacific of the US.
Several other foreign houses also stopped dealing in gilts in the late 1980s
in the face of tough competition in an overcrowded market.
However, an improvement in conditions in the market in recent years has
prompted some to return.
There are 20 other Gemms, the most recent entrants being Merrill Lynch of
the US, which pulled out in the late 1980s after incurring heavy losses, and
Yamaichi of Japan.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Murdoch's Fox network under
scrutiny by FCC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Communications Commission, the US government agency which
oversees media industries, is re-examining Mr Rupert Murdoch's ownership of
American television stations to determine whether this conforms with US laws
restricting foreign ownership of broadcasting businesses.
Mr Murdoch is himself a US citizen but his main corporate vehicle, News
Corporation, is headquartered in Australia.
The six wholly-owned stations were bought by Mr Murdoch in 1985 and form the
core of the Fox television network he has built into a challenger to
America's big three networks - ABC, CBS and NBC.
US law restricts foreign ownership of broadcasting stations to 25 per cent.
In order to comply with the rules and build his broadcasting empire, Mr
Murdoch changed his citizenship from Australia to the US in the 1980s and
ensured that he held 76 per cent of the voting rights in the company which
owns Fox's broadcasting interests. News Corp holds 24 per cent of the votes.
However, FCC officials are reviewing the case following a complaint by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which campaigns
for minority businesses and is opposing an attempt by Fox to buy a
Philadelphia television station. It emerged during the FCC review that News
Corp holds more than 90 per cent of the broadcasting company's equity.
News Corp yesterday confirmed that an FCC inquiry was under way, but said Mr
Murdoch had clearly stated in 1985, when seeking FCC approval to buy the
stations, that the funds for the acquisition would be supplied by News Corp
through loans and capital contributions. Nothing material had changed since
then.
It said it was confident that the FCC review - which Fox had itself
requested - would 'not result in any negative consequences' for Fox's
ownership of broadcasting stations.
The FCC has the power to order Fox to sell its stations, but the company has
enjoyed good relations with the commission and observers think this outcome
is unlikely. At worst, Mr Murdoch might be required to transfer control to
another investment vehicle.

deficit as sales continue to drop

Borland International reported heavy losses for its fourth fiscal quarter
and year. The personal computer software company is restructuring its
operations and trying to stem a sharp decline in sales.
Net losses for the quarter ended March 31 were Dollars 76m, or Dollars 2.84
a share, compared with net income of Dollars 5.1m, or 19 cents, in the same
period last year.
The losses included a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 14m covering
about 300 job cuts and the closure of some facilities. An additional charge
of Dollars 8.2m was recorded for the write-down of real estate assets that
the company plans to sell.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 51.0m, a 56.4 per cent decline from
Dollars 117.1m in the same period last year.
In March, 10 days before the end of the fourth quarter, Borland announced
plans to sell its spreadsheet product line, Quattro Pro, to Novell, another
software company, for Dollars 145m. The transaction is expected to be
completed this month.
Borland said lower sales were in part attributable to a significant decline
in sales of Quattro Pro following the announcement of the proposed sale. The
company also blamed its revenue drop on customers waiting to buy new
versions of some of its products that are to be introduced this summer.
Borland said it expected a further operating loss in the current quarter and
that sales would be adversely affected by the same factors, as well as by
disruptions from the restructuring of its European operations.
The company plans to take a one-time charge of about Dollars 16m for the
acquisition of Report-Smith, a software company.
Borland amended results for the third quarter ended December 31 to include a
Dollars 3.3m charge for marketing commitments that had not been accounted
for previously. The charge resulted in a net loss for the third quarter of
Dollars 2.9m, compared with net income of Dollars 419,000, as originally
reported.
For the year, it reported a net loss of Dollars 69.9m, or Dollars 2.62 a
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 49.2m, or Dollars 1.87 for fiscal
1993. Revenues for the year were Dollars 393.5m, a 15.2 per cent decrease
from Dollars 464m.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kmart faces defeat over plan to
sell share stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the US discount store group, was last night facing an embarrassing
defeat in today's vote over its plan to sell stakes of up to 30 per cent in
its four specialty retailing subsidiaries.
A growing rebellion against the board by Kmart's institutional investors
gained another influential recruit when it was joined yesterday by the
California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the biggest US
public pension fund.
The fund said it had decided to vote against Kmart's plan because it could
dilute Calpers' holdings and 'may preclude management from considering other
better alternatives'.
Calpers said it was withholding its support for the re-election of five
directors to the board to express its dissatisfaction over the 'persistent
poor performance' of the company. 'We have serious questions about who is
minding the store for shareholders at Kmart,' it said.
Calpers is one of six institutional investors to signal dissatisfaction with
Kmart's board and management over the last few days by denouncing the
company's plans.
The others are the College Retirement Equities Fund, the biggest US
institutional investor; the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the
10 largest US pension funds; the Florida State Board of Administration; the
Ohio State Teachers Retirement System; and the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Union. They hold a small percentage of Kmart's stock -
Calpers holds 2.8m of the 455.9m issued shares - but their hostility could
swing other shareholders.
Kmart earlier this week said the rebel investors were only a tiny minority
of the company's 460 institutional investors, and it hoped for a majority of
support.

Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), the quoted Australian soft drinks group which is 51
per cent-owned by the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company (CCC), is to expand
its presence in central and eastern Europe by buying out its parent's
interests in Poland in a cash deal. No financial details have been
disclosed.
CCC made its first direct investment in Poland three years ago. It is one of
three franchise owners for Coca-Cola brands in the country - the others
being Ringes, a Norwegian bottler, and Brau, an Austrian brewer. Ringes also
owns a 51 per cent interest in a Warsaw bottling joint venture, with CCC
holding the rest.
CCA declined to say how much it expected to pay for its parent's interests,
which cover brands such as Fanta, Sprite and Bonaqa as well as Coke and Coke
Lite. It said only that total investment in the Coca-Cola 'system' in Poland
had amounted to around Dollars 300m, of which Coca-Cola had contributed 'a
fair amount'.
CCA said the purchase would give it access to 22.4m consumers, plus a
further 6m through the 49 per cent interest in the Warsaw joint venture.
CCA has been steadily amassing Coca-Cola franchises in Austria and eastern
Europe, as well as the Asia-Pacific region. The company said it expected
further overseas expansionary moves - which could involve either
parent-owned or independent franchises and would not necessarily be in
eastern Europe.

Australia Air, the only potential new Australian international airline to
emerge since the country the start of a competitive, deregulated aviation
market looks set to abandon its efforts to take to the skies, writes Nikki
Tait.
The fledgling company has admitted that it has little hope of raising the
necessary start-up capital via a stock market flotation. Since a portion of
its equity funding must come from within Australia, the only remaining hope
is that a domestic investor steps forward. Given that Australia Air has been
searching for capital for months, this seems unlikely.
Australia Air was awarded rights to fly between Australia and China in March
last year.

Earnings per share are forecast at Bt1.25 this year which puts the offer
price on a 40 times price-earnings multiple. However, the company said this
price reflected the demand shown by investors during the company's roadshow

Siam Makro, a joint venture between the SHV group of the Netherlands and the

<TEXT>
Tata Chemicals, one of India's largest chemicals makers and a member of the
Tata industrial group, has reported a 94 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits for the year to the end of March to Rs2.2bn (Dollars 70.9m), due to
higher demand and gains from investments, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New
Delhi.
The company made Rs682.6m profit from investments, mainly the sale of a
stake in Tata Oil Mills, another Tata group member, which was sold to
Hindustan Lever, the Indian affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine.
Without the investments gains, pre-tax profits rose 35 per cent to Rs1.5bn
on a 31 per cent increase in sales to Rs6.4bn. Net profits rose almost
threefold to Rs2.15bn.
Tata Chemicals said the results did not yet include contributions from new
detergent, cement and fertilisers plants or from a recent expansion of soda
ash capacity. These would all start contributing in the current financial
year.

CCA, despite its Antipodean base, has been steadily amassing Coca-Cola

The company said it expected further overseas expansionary moves in the

Mr Dean Wills, Coca-Cola Amatil's managing director, yesterday announced

Mr Bill Gibson, currently deputy managing director, and Mr Norborne Cole, at
present chief executive officer of Coca-Cola Beverages in France. Mr Wills

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Life insurers selling despite
Nikkei's rally - Japan's biggest investors need to lift declining returns on
assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something has been missing from the Tokyo stock market's rally this week.
Japan's biggest investors, its life insurers, who own 12 per cent of the
equity market's capitalisation according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, have
on the whole continued to sell shares even as the Nikkei index hit new highs
for the year for four days running.
Nippon Life, Japan's largest institutional shareholder, admitted it planned
to sell at least Y315bn (Dollars 3.01bn) of shares before building up its
equity portfolio again. Daiichi Life says it is a small net buyer, yet
insurers in general have stayed on the sidelines.
Foreign institutions, convinced that Japan is in the early stage of a
recovery, have greedily snapped up the unwanted stock, not the first time
this year that they have provided the impetus for a rise in prices.
Other Japanese institutional investors, formerly sellers, have also turned
buyers for fear of missing out on the share price rises.
Traditionally, life insurers have an unspoken public responsibility to
support the market. Why have they changed?
Life insurers are selling shares because they badly need to boost their
declining return on assets, according to a recent study* by Mr Andrew
Smithers, a London economist. They can be expected to take every chance
presented by a new rise in share prices to sell more, he predicts.
He cites a valuation by Tillinghast, a UK actuary, which suggests that the
Japanese life insurance industry's liabilities may exceed its assets, if
judged under more stringent international standards than used in Japan.
Japan's life insurers are mutual organisations and hence unquoted, so their
financial pressures are less widely broadcast than is the case for banks and
industrial companies.
According to the study, the problem is that over-dependence on low yielding
equities (a consequence of a rush into the stock market during the
*something in here (HP) *
share price rally in the late 1980s) has left the 27 leading life insurers
with an average 4.3 per cent return on their Y148,000bn assets at the latest
count in 1992.
A return of 4.3 per cent however, is well below the 4.96 per cent return the
study estimates they needed last year to cover payouts to policy holders.
Insurers have reacted to the problem by obtaining finance ministry
permission to reduce guaranteed returns to corporate annuities, so requiring
companies to increase direct contributions to their own pension funds, and
by increasing premiums.
Japanese insurance portfolio managers have already started to switch
strategy in response to the collapse of asset prices, but probably not
enough, the study suggests.
They have become as stringent as Scottish investment trusts in valuing
shares, according to stockbrokers in Tokyo. 'If a company can't give its
depreciation charges for the past 10 years down to the last yen, they won't
even look at it,' jokes one US broker.
Insurers have, as their recent share sales show, started to reduce their
proportional exposure to equities, in the search for better performing
investments. Equities accounted for 8 per cent of their net outflows last
year, well below the 26 per cent of assets or Y40,000bn held in shares at
estimated market value, the survey estimates.
But this moderate change in new investment flows is insufficient to lift the
return on assets enough to meet current liabilities, says Mr Smithers. A
wholesale portfolio reorganisation, away from low yielding equities into
higher yielding bonds, is needed, he argues.
If life insurers were to move more equity funds and some of their Y9,700bn
in cash and loans into government bonds, total returns could rise to 5.3 per
cent, well above the required minimum, he calculates. This assumes equities
yield 0.8 per cent and allows for the yield on the benchmark 10-year
government bond to fall to 3.6 per cent, from its current 3.9 per cent.
The freedom of Japan's top investors to unload shares will however, be
limited by their own and the finance ministry's desire, to avoid hitting
prices. Yet the life insurers' asset problems are applying a little
publicised brake on the Nikkei's ability to rise.

Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency, yesterday reported its third
year of profit decline, due to continued cuts in corporate advertising.
Pre-tax profits fell 16.7 per cent to Y13.1bn (Dollars 125m) in the 12
months to March, on sales down 4 per cent to Y1,196bn, the second year of
declining turnover.
Dentsu said large clients in basic industries ranging from motor vehicles
and appliances to banks and securities firms had reduced advertising budgets
in response to the adverse economic climate. Television advertising revenues
declined by 2.9 per cent, while newspaper advertising was down 6.2 per cent.
Magazine and radio advertising also fell.
For the current fiscal year, however, Dentsu, which is unlisted, projects a
4 per cent rise in sales to Y1,164bn.
According to the company, big sporting events in 1994, such as World Cup
soccer this summer in the US and the Asian Games this autumn in Hiroshima,
will generate substantial advertising revenues for the firm. In addition,
Japanese industry is assuming a more confident tone.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bridge urges shareholders to

Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company which is the subject of a
ADollars 295m (USDollars 226.9m) unsolicited bid from Texas-based Parker &amp;
Parsley, said yesterday that independent valuations had suggested that
Bridge shares were worth between ADollars 0.95 and ADollars 1.13.
It noted that this was substantially higher than the current 70
cents-a-share cash offer from the US oil independent, and urged shareholders
to reject the bid.
'The offer is a blatantly opportunistic attempt to get you to sell your
shares at a price well below their true value,' commented Bridge directors.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: HK shipping group to seek
listing in Oslo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Jinhui Shipping &amp; Transportation, a Hong Kong-based company with a large
fleet of dry bulk freighters, plans an Oslo Stock Exchange listing. It will
be the first Asian company to be quoted on the Norwegian market.
Jinhui, which is incorporated in Bermuda, will issue up to 49m shares to
raise USDollars 90m after costs at an indicative price of between Dollars
1.70 and Dollars 2 a share.
The company, which forms part of the Hong Kong-listed Jinhui Holdings, plans
an international share offering as well as a smaller public offering in
Norway. It will issue shares equivalent of up to 49 per cent of its equity.
The Jinhui move follows a recent trend for private shipping groups to seek
public listings to raise their profile and improve their ability to raise
funds to finance the renewal of their fleets.
Jinhui made a pre-tax profit of Dollars 11.6m on net revenues of Dollars
18.2m in the year ended March 1994. It expects to make a profit of Dollars
18.4m on net revenue of Dollars 30.5m in the year ended December 1994 after
a change of its year-end.
The company has a fleet of 35 vessels active in trade with China. It also
trades commodities such as steel products and non-ferrous metals and has
investments in Chinese transport infrastructure projects.
The shares will go on offer to institutions from June 6 with the final price
to be set on about June 20. The offering is being co-ordinated by Nomura
International and Christiania Fonds.
In a separate move, Stolt Partner, an Olso-listed shipping company,
announced plans for a Dollars 75m rights issue.
It will issue 15 new shares for every four held to fund, with additional
loan finance, the purchase of five second-hand tankers valued at Dollars
121m and two new tankers from Stolt Parcel Tankers.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal to raise R300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglovaal, one of South Africa's leading conglomerates with interests in
mining, food and diamonds, is seeking to raise R300m (Dollars 82m) through
an international offering of low-voting 'N' shares.
According to bookrunner SG Warburg, this is the first international equity
offering by a South African company since the country's general election in
April.
The proceeds will be used to finance Anglovaal's planned acquisition of
Willards, a South African potato-crisp manufacturer.
The issue's performance is likely to be closely monitored by other South
African companies which are considering similar deals.
A total of 2.5m 'N' shares will be sold on a global basis, and they will
also be available to US investors under the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission's Rule 144A, which allows exemption from many normal disclosure
requirements.
The shares closed at R130 in Johannesburg yesterday.
The company is due to start an international roadshow next week and the
shares are likely to be priced on June 23, the day after the South African
budget. The offer closes on June 30.
News that the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of
the World Bank, will include South Africa in its global index with a
weighting of 13 per cent has increased international investor interest in
the country.

<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Canada has attributed a a 12 per cent gain in
second-quarter profit to strengths in retail and investment banking and the
contribution from Royal Trust, acquired last September.
The bank, Canada's biggest, said net profit advanced to CDollars 273m
(USDollars 196.9m), or 74 cents a share, up from CDollars 243m, or 64 cents,
a year earlier. Total assets at April 13 stood at CDollars 168bn, compared
with CDollars 143bn.
Return on average assets was 0.67 per cent, against 0.72 per cent last time.
The 1993 period did not include Royal Trust.
Return on equity was 16.1 per cent, up from 13.7 per cent.
Mr Allan Taylor, chairman, said loan quality was improving, costs were being
reduced, and Royal Trust operations were being integrated quickly. By June
30, the Royal Trust network will have been reduced by 41 units to a total of
101.
Net interest income at the bank itself was 2.87 per cent of average assets,
against 3.09 per cent a year earlier.
Other income was up 33 per cent, with strong brokerage, investment banking
and money management results. Royal Trust's contribution was CDollars 84m.
Non-interest expense dipped 2 per cent and total payroll was down 5 per
cent.
Provision for credit losses was CDollars 205m, up slightly, and the total
fiscal 1994 provision is forecast at CDollars 820m, down from CDollars
1.75bn. Total non-performing loans were CDollars 5.8bn at April 30, down 24
per cent. The reduction was due partly to the fact that Brazilian debt now
has performing status.
First-half net profit rose to CDollars 573m, or CDollars 1.56 a share, up
from CDollars 497m, or CDollars 1.35, a year earlier. Return on assets was
0.70 per cent, against 0.72 per cent, and on equity 17 per cent compared
with 14.3 per cent.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Italian bank approves plans for
fund-raising
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the newly privatised Italian
bank, have formally approved plans to raise up to L2,362bn (Dollars 1.5bn)
through the issue of new shares and warrants.
BCI said the fund-raising proposals would be put to shareholders next month.
The group said the cash raised would be used 'to ensure the balance of the
structure of the group, faced with further development of its activity as a
'universal bank', and to consolidate the traditional leadership position of
BCI'.
The bank issued a statement last week outlining the plans, following
increasing market speculation about a rights issue. Shareholders will also
be asked to approve further capital increases of up to L2,000bn over the
next five years.
BCI is negotiating to buy a 1 per cent stake in Commerzbank of Germany, and
is part of the consortium bidding for a large minority stake in
Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank set for privatisation.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades Canadian
debt rating
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's, the New York-based rating agency, has downgraded Canada's
foreign-currency debt to reflect concern over growing federal and provincial
borrowing requirements.
The downgrade, from AAA, the highest rating, to AA1, affects about USDollars
8.5bn of securities, issued by the federal government as well as agencies
such as the Export Development Corporation and the Canadian Wheat Board.
Loans denominated in Canadian dollars, which make up the bulk of government
borrowings, are not affected.
Prices on the domestic bond market fell slightly after the Moody's
announcement. Standard &amp; Poor's, the other large rating agency, lowered its
rating early last year.
Moody's said the federal government and the provinces face a 'long and
difficult' task in containing their respective debts. While recent
deficit-cutting measures were expected to continue, the agency said that
there was a risk 'that a deviation from the medium-term programmes of a
number of important public sector issuers could occur'.
