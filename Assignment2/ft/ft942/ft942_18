FT  02 JUN 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Euro-sceptics hail
Major's new stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's tough stance was warmly embraced last night by the
Conservative party's leading Euro-sceptics as he staunchly defended his
suggestion that Britain might opt out of the next stage of European
integration. But the prime minister's vision of a multi-speed, multi-track
Europe provoked anger among pro-European Tories and blistering attacks from
Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to dampen the controversy by
insisting that in many areas Britain would welcome closer co-operation with
its EU partners.
Speaking in Derby, Mr Hurd singled out Britain's strong support for European
policy co-ordination as an example of where 'we are leading the pack in an
area of crucial importance to Europe'.
But Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman and a prominent sceptic, said the
sentiment and tone of Mr Major's remarks were 'clearly incompatible' with
the Maastricht treaty which had been forced through parliament.
Welcoming the prime minister's apparent conversion to the Euro-sceptic
cause, he said that the speech would persuade many Conservatives not to
abstain in the June 9 European elections.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, insisted that Mr Major had
put his own position ahead of the interests of the country.
Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Ashdown added: 'Its historic importance is that Mr
Major, in order to save his own skin in the short-term, is now preparing the
way in which the Conservatives - if they lose the next election - will risk
becoming the anti-European party in Britain.'
Members of the Conservative party's pro-European wing also privately
attacked the prime minister for ceding ground to the sceptics. They warned
that his stance would significantly weaken his support from the centre-left
in any contest for the Tory leadership.
But Mr Major was unrepentant over his suggestion that Britain might opt out
of any further moves by its EU partners towards a centralised European
state. He said in London that there was no contradiction between his
oft-stated commitment to keep Britain at 'the heart of Europe'.
Mr Major said the Conservative party alone was committed to 'a realistic
assessment of the future of Europe and of Britain's place in Europe'.
Underlining his determination to preserve the national veto, Mr Major said:
'I approach this question as someone who wishes to see Europe succeed.' But
that did not mean that Britain had to accept every idea that came from its
European partners. Sometimes it would stand aside from 'the nonsense'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Lang move hits Scottish Nuclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, yesterday dealt a blow to Scottish
Nuclear's commercial strategy by deferring a decision on whether to approve
construction of a dry store for spent fuel at the Torness power station in
East Lothian.
Mr Lang said he would wait until the Department of the Environment finished
the review of radioactive waste strategy announced by Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, last month. The review, which will feed into the
overall nuclear review, will consider whether Britain should have a single
dry store for nuclear waste or stores at individual plants.
The review could delay approval for another year.
Last night Mr Robin Jeffrey, chief executive of the government-owned
Scottish Nuclear (SNL), called Mr Lang's announcement 'deeply
disappointing'. It would set back SNL's progress towards becoming fully
commercial, he said, and open up 'a totally irrelevant question'.
The dry store involves keeping spent nuclear fuel on the site of a power
station to let its radioactivity decline naturally rather than sending it
for more expensive reprocessing to British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp plant at
Sellafield, Cumbria.
If SNL built dry stores at both Torness and its Hunterston plant in Ayrshire
it would cut its operating costs by Pounds 45m a year. It has a target
cost-reduction figure of Pounds 100m a year. SNL has indicated that the
policy was favoured by the Scottish Office.
SNL had hoped to begin building the Pounds 80m-Pounds 100m dry store in late
summer for completion in just over two years.

FT  02 JUN 94 / No answers at VAT gripeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt by HM Customs &amp; Excise to boost its caring image ran into
embarrassing early difficulties yesterday as the agency tried to unveil
details of an initiative designed to show its new-found helpfulness to
business.
The department said that from Monday companies would be able to gripe over
the telephone about their concerns in handling value added tax.
But in an omen of things to come, the agency said yesterday that it was
unable to provide further information such as the number or type of calls it
expected to receive because all the relevant officials were out of the
office.
After failing to raise any officials yesterday an exasperated press officer
said: 'I think they took advantage of the bank holiday and are not back
yet.'
The 'business-views hotline' will be open for three months for ideas on ways
to make VAT more 'user-friendly for business'.
Businesses hoping for proof that Customs staff are human will be
disappointed - the service will be in the form of recorded messages.
The department hopes that businesses will use the telephone to make
recommendations on improvements to the VAT system. Last month consultants
completed a survey of 1,000 businesses for Customs &amp; Excise to judge how it
could improve its quality of service, fulfil its commitments and keep
compliance requirements to a minimum.
One piece of good news is that rather than try to cash in on the
premium-rate charges often levied on recorded messages, the department has
arranged for calls to be free, on 0800 132384.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Scoring points with Essex man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We should never have expected enlightenment. British election campaigns have
long since lost the central democratic purpose of illuminating the choices
before the electorate. That sort of politics is too complex for a generation
weaned on the tabloid press and the 15-second television sound-bite.
But even by the standards of the recent past, the European election campaign
has been an unedifying spectacle.
Around the country, candidates for the Strasbourg assembly have dutifully
knocked on doors, climbed on to platforms in village halls and picked up
babies in market squares.
But at a national level the campaign has produced an entirely predictable
game of charge and counter-charge in which important issues have been
trivialised and trivial issues elevated.
So far the voters have been offered a synthetic dispute about the national
veto, a protracted row over begging and a fruitless argument about the
definition of federalism.
Other, real European issues have occasionally intruded - the social chapter,
the path towards a single currency, the shape of Europe's future defence
among them. But the tactics adopted by all three parties have ensured that
rational debate is minimised in favour of cheap sloganising.
So nobody should be surprised if, once again, the great mass of the
electorate decides on June 9 that there is nothing, or nobody, worth taking
the trouble to vote for.
The Labour campaign understandably has lacked political focus. The death of
John Smith left the party's leading figures pre-occupied with the
succession.
In any event Labour has yet to work out the difference between a strategy of
attacking the Conservatives for leaving Britain in Europe's slow lane and a
discriminating approach to the policies of other European Union governments.
After some initial slip-ups, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have
looked effective in promoting themselves as the party to beat the
Conservatives in the south-west. But like Labour, the party has been wary of
sounding too positive about Europe. It has looked more comfortable when
attacking Mr John Major over domestic policy.
On a technical rather than intellectual level the Conservative campaign
cannot be faulted. The strategy has been to prevent a bad result from
turning into a catastrophe. The judgment from the outset was that the party
needed to counter the disgruntled apathy of its hard-core supporters.
The instincts of these voters are those of the Tory Euro-sceptics. They are
reflex chauvinists, suspicious of most things foreign and of all things
emanating from Brussels. They believed Baroness Thatcher when she told them
that a Britain free of the shackles of Europe could rediscover its past
greatness. Coincidentally they also favour a hard line against beggars.
To win them back, the Conservatives concluded their best role in this
campaign was not that of a government but of an opposition party. The
central message has been constant: Mr Major would persuade the Europeans
from doing that, would veto this, and would opt out of whatever else proved
unpalatable.
If Central Office is to be believed, the strategy is working. Even those
Tory MEPs who find the focus of the campaign distasteful are acknowledging
that many of the punters like what they are hearing.
It is against this backdrop that Mr Major sketched out the possibility of a
multi-speed, multi-track Europe. This so-called variable geometry - a
ghastly phrase first uttered in public by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary - would allow a wider, more flexible union to operate with the
grain of public opinion.
All would participate in core activities such as the single market. In other
areas - defence, monetary union, social policy - individual nations would
choose whether or not to enhance co-operation.
It is an idea with merit. In some respects it is a reflection of the status
quo. In any event the cohesion possible among 12 states will not be so in a
union of 20.
But the context and tone in which such arguments are framed are as important
as the actual words. In Mr Hurd's multi-speed Europe, Britain would play a
positive part, setting the pace of co-operation in defence and foreign
policy.
Mr Major, locked in the poisonous embrace of his party's Euro-sceptics,
appears more interested in opting out than opting in when the union reshapes
its future in 1996. The national veto - threatened by nobody in Europe - has
become a virility symbol.
The prime minister is right to argue that Europe has changed during the past
few years. But scoring easy points with Essex man sits uneasily alongside a
pledge to keep Britain at the heart of Europe.

FT  02 JUN 94 / TUC marshals cash for adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress is co-ordinating a Pounds 100,000 advertising
campaign to urge voters in next week's European parliamentary elections to
back candidates who support the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
The advertisements are being paid for by unions which have political funds
but are not affiliated to the Labour party.
The bulk of the campaign's finance is from Unison, the public service union.
Another important contributor is the IRSF, the tax officers' union.
The TUC said last night that the unions involved were not calling on voters
to back Labour or any other political party.
It said Britain was alone among European Union countries in opposing legal
rights which made 'workers safer, more secure and more effective at work'.
The campaign is aimed at women voters. It suggests that the government is
opposing 10 ways under EU legislation to protect and improve the conditions
of female workers.
The TUC said: 'We are not endorsing Labour but we are saying that the views
of candidates on the social chapter ought to be of paramount importance on
who people vote for.
'We would expect all Labour candidates to back the social chapter. We think
most Liberal Democrats probably would. We think some Conservatives might,
despite the party's official line at national level. We don't know the
attitude of the Greens, the nationalists and the other parties in the
election.'
The TUC has taken legal advice to avoid any charge by government ministers
that unions are interfering in the European elections and misusing their
political funds for that purpose.
The TUC co-ordinated a similar campaign during the 1989 European
parliamentary elections, when it urged voters to vote for candidates who
backed workers' rights.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Big companies oppose social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's big companies are overwhelmingly opposed to the social chapter of
the Maastricht treaty, according to a Gallup poll for the Conservatives
published yesterday.
The poll of 301 top companies also reveals opposition to proposals by the
Socialist Group in the European parliament for a minimum wage and cuts in
working hours to reduce unemployment.
Mr John Major said the poll showed that the social chapter was 'a licence to
mess up the British recovery'. He said Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who
support the social chapter, were 'stuck in the groove of the old corporate,
centralised, over-regulated Europe'.
Labour said the economy was being severely damaged by the government's lack
of concern for public health and social welfare. Mr David Blunkett, shadow
health secretary, said Britain's rate of sickness absence from work was
twice as high as Germany's.
'The need for the social chapter to be implemented here is matched by the
crying need for Britain to lift its standards to those of a first-rate
nation rather than an offshore tax haven,' he said.
Gallup interviewed companies with an average payroll of 5,500 and average
turnover of Pounds 220m. It found that 79 per cent support the UK opt-out
from the social chapter.
Nearly 80 per cent believe Labour's plan to adopt the chapter would damage
British business, and 73 per cent believe it would cause a substantial loss
of jobs.
More than 80 per cent oppose European Union legislation on industrial
matters within the UK; 74 per cent oppose a minimum wage; and 66 per cent
believe wages legislation would increase unemployment. Nearly 90 per cent
believe compulsory cuts in working hours would harm competitiveness.
Gallup said 53 per cent of respondents believe that Britain has most
effectively enforced EU legislation. Italy, France, Greece and Spain were
the countries most widely regarded as ineffective in this respect.
The poll also indicated that political integration is well down the list of
business priorities for the EU. It showed that 73 per cent want improved
competitiveness; 43 per cent seek more flexible labour markets; and 37 per
cent want reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Just 22 per cent favour economic and monetary union; 12 per cent want an
enlarged community; 3 per cent want implementation of the social chapter;
and 2 per cent back political integration.
Mr Major said the survey supported the government's claim that the economy
had benefited from the opt-out from the social chapter. 'We are doing
relatively better because we have the right ingredients for jobs and growth.
The social chapter will put that at risk. It is the very last thing that
Britain needs.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Unionists angry at Adams demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unionist politicians yesterday reacted angrily to the latest preconditions
for peace in Northern Ireland spelled out by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president.
With unionist leaders warning that support for loyalist violence is growing
in the community because of its growing sense of alienation, the Rev Ian
Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party leader, attacked the 'sell-out' which
he claimed would see the British government give in to the latest republican
demands.
Mr Adams called in a speech to European election workers in Belfast for a
full amnesty for IRA prisoners, whose 'speedy release' was a matter of
urgent concern.
He said the government would have to legislate away provisions which gave
unionists a veto over political and constitutional change. It would also
have to accept the right of the Irish people to national self-determination.
Sinn Fein has said that it would respond to the Downing Street declaration
after next week's Euro-elections, although the government says acceptance of
the document is not a prerequisite for republicans to join the peace
process.
Mr Paisley said he feared that Mr Adams would succeed in his request for the
speedy release of all long-term prisoners. The government, however, has
committed itself against any amnesty for convicted terrorists.
Mr Paisley said the call for an end to the unionist veto meant that the
majority unionist vote in Northern Ireland had to be subverted and the
province forced into an all-Ireland republic.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish deputy premier, yesterday criticised Sinn Fein for
delaying its response to the Downing Street declaration and again stressed
that the IRA would have to enact a permanent cessation of violence before it
could join the peace process.
He told the Dail: 'It has to be permanent; there can be no equivocation
about that.'
He added: 'There is little point in attempting to bring people into
political dialogue if they are doing so on the basis of 'we will give it a
try, but if it does not work, we will go back to the bomb and the bullet'.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Support found for dispute mediation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British industry could save millions in legal costs each year by resolving
contractual disputes through mediation rather than litigation or
arbitration, says a survey of publicly quoted companies by Herbert Smith, a
City law firm.
Support for the concept of alternative dispute resolution from 60 companies
in the computing, construction, insurance and oil sectors will boost
mediation in the UK.
Since the CBI-backed Centre for Dispute Resolution was launched in 1990 to
promote ADR, the use of mediation services by industry has been small. The
centre has handled just 400 cases involving about Pounds 1.5bn.
The Herbert Smith survey showed that almost all the companies had been
involved in litigation in the past two years, with 44 per cent expressing
some dissatisfaction with the cost and time involved. A typical court case
was said to take up to two years to resolve.
Satisfaction with mediation among the 10 per cent of the companies which had
tried ADR was high. ADR users found mediation saved time and money and was
less confrontational, allowing the parties to maintain relationships.
The main disadvantage of ADR was the uncertainty of the outcome in the
absence of the structured nature of litigation, although the Centre for
Dispute Resolution claims a successful outcome in more than 90 per cent of
cases. Paradoxically, the lack of a structured approach was identified as
one of its main advantages.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Work tensions 'growing': Acas chief says demands on
industrial tribunals remain high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tensions are increasing beneath the surface in the workplace because of
growing pressures on business in Britain's economic recovery, Acas, the
independent conciliation and arbitration service, warned yesterday.
In its annual report published today, Acas says the number of individual
conciliation cases has reached record levels for the third consecutive year.
There has been a 4 per cent rise in such cases to 75,181 from 72,166 in
1992.
Acas says: 'If not channelled into creative ends, these tensions could
increase the level of conflict. Often during 1993 managements were compelled
to deal with immediate pressures rather than managing change in a positive
way. In such situations tensions were almost inevitable.'
Mr John Hougham, chairman, said yesterday: 'Industrial tribunal work shows
no signs of any downward trend. We remain very busy.'
In 67 per cent of cases a settlement was reached or an application to an
industrial tribunal withdrawn. Only one in three cases proceeded to an
industrial tribunal.
As many as 62 per cent of the cases concerned unfair dismissal. There were
1,852 race discrimination cases, the highest recorded - and a 6 per cent
increase on 1992.
Sex discrimination cases totalled 5,772, six fewer than in the previous
year. There were 1,601 equal-pay cases, of which 859 were claims for equal
pay for work of equal value.
Acas reported a 1 per cent fall in public inquiry calls about industrial
relations matters to 481,392 last year.
Demands on the organisation's collective conciliation service remained high
at 1,211 requests - four more than in 1992 - in spite of a continuing fall
in recorded strikes.
The government has already announced that Acas's budget is to be cut by
nearly 15 per cent during the next four years, from Pounds 23m in 1993-1994
to Pounds 20m in 1996-1997.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Tax credit on dividends defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abolition of the tax credit on dividends would 'blow a Pounds 50bn hole in
pension funds', says a research note published today by Kleinwort Benson,
the merchant bank.
City concern about government taxation policy has risen in the wake of
speeches from Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury,
linking high dividend payouts to a lack of UK investment.
Investors fear that the tax credit on dividends, which was cut from 25 per
cent to 20 per cent in the March 1993 Budget, might be reduced further or
even abolished.
'Abolition of the tax credit on dividends would slash 20 per cent off the
gross yield on the UK equity market,' says Kleinwort Benson. The average
pension fund holds 56 per cent of its assets in UK equities, so such a
change would knock about 11 per cent off the actuarial value of the fund.
This would create a shortfall of about Pounds 50bn because the current
market value of UK pension funds is about Pounds 500bn. Kleinwort Benson
says UK companies would have to increase their pension-fund contributions to
fill this hole, and this would reduce their ability to invest. Furthermore,
the fall in equity markets that would follow would make equity funding for
companies more expensive. Mr Dorrell has said tax changes would not be made
until the government could 'identify the improvement we seek' and 'establish
that tax changes are the best means of achieving it'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / BT makes more price cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications yesterday announced price cuts worth Pounds 46m
in a full year. The main beneficiaries will be heavy residential users and
businesses which make many international calls.
A new residential discount scheme, to be called PremierLine, will give
customers 15 per cent off all direct-dialled calls in return for an annual
fee of Pounds 24. Subscribers will also be eligible for Air Miles and other
benefits.
The scheme is aimed at residential customers with bills of more than Pounds
100 a quarter, many of whom have moved their long-distance calls to Mercury,
BT's main competitor.
Mercury responded by pledging to maintain its guaranteed savings on
long-distance and international calls when the price changes take effect at
the end of the month.
BT is also cutting the cost of international calls to Japan, the Republic of
Ireland, Israel, Hong Kong, Bahrain and a number of European countries
outside the European Union.
From the end of the month the off-peak period for weekday international
calls will start at 6pm, as for national calls.
Changes to the discount schemes for high-volume business customers will also
be introduced, but with a broadly neutral effect in price terms.
The reductions take to Pounds 550m the total annual value of price cuts over
the past year.
Under the price cap agreed with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, BT
has to cut prices in the year from July 1 by a further 7.5 per cent after
inflation.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Rover increases output by 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent, and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover increased car production by 26 per cent year-on-year in the first
quarter, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
Overall UK car output was virtually unchanged in the first three months at
362,536, a decline of 0.5 per cent from the corresponding period a year ago.
Higher output by Rover, the leading UK vehicle maker and a subsidiary of BMW
of Germany, together with the rapid build-up of production by Toyota and
Honda at their UK assembly plants, helped to offset declines at Ford and
Vauxhall and a sharp fall at Nissan.
The rise in Rover output has been driven by the introduction of its Rover
600 executive car range, launched last spring, as well as by rising sales of
the Land Rover Discovery and the Rover 200/400. The company recently
introduced a Sunday shift to increase output of the 200/400.
Production at Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant fell by 45 per cent
year-on-year in the first quarter. The company was forced to halve
production for nearly four months until early March in order to cut stocks
and bring output into line with lower demand in continental Europe. The
luxury carmaker Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a
subsidiary of Vickers, are both regaining ground lost during the US and UK
recessions.
Jaguar, which increased output by 43.5 per cent last year, raised production
by 11 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, while the maker of
Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars - whose sales worldwide more than halved
between 1990 and 1992 - raised output 44 per cent in the first three months.
Production of commercial vehicles has begun to rise slowly, albeit from a
very low level. Output in the first four months was 5 per cent higher than a
year before.
The two vehicle sectors are experiencing sharply contrasting production
fortunes. Car output rose last year by 6.5 per cent to 1.376m, the highest
level since 1974, and is forecast to exceed 2m for the first time towards
the end of the decade. By contrast, commercial vehicle production fell by
22.2 per cent last year to only 193,414, the lowest level of output since
1948.
Rover Cars is halving the dealers' profit margin on its flagship executive
car range, the Rover 800, to 5 per cent, John Griffiths writes.
The move, which takes immediate effect, brings Rover into line with Vauxhall
and Ford, its main rivals in the executive sector, which have introduced
similar margins on their respective Omega and Granada/Scorpio executive
models.
Rover acknowledged yesterday that its action was intended mainly to reduce
list prices, making the cars more attractive to company car drivers under
the new tax regime.
Transaction prices - the amount actually paid for cars - are unlikely to
change. Rover said yesterday there were no plans to halve the profit margin
on other models.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Fresh row erupts over London radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in London Broadcasting Company have called for the licence of
its successor, London News Radio, to be revoked before the company even
begins broadcasting.
Lawyers representing Chelverton Investments, which controlled LBC until it
went into receivership, have written to the Radio Authority saying the two
London commercial speech-based services should be re-advertised.
SJ Berwin, the lawyers, say they want either to hear within seven days that
the licence will be revoked or to receive reasons why the authority has
decided not to revoke it.
If the reply is not satisfactory, the lawyers say they will advise their
clients of their right to apply for judicial review of the authority's
decision.
The row over the London commercial radio licences has blown up again because
of the announcement last week that Reuters Holdings, the news and
information group, is proposing to acquire LNR, the Guinness Mahon-backed
company which was awarded the licence last September in preference to LBC.
Reuters was part of the London Radio Company, another unsuccessful applicant
for the two franchises.
Before the Reuters plan to buy LNR for Pounds 5m, LNR had already acquired
the assets of LBC from the receivers.
Chelverton, whose main investors include Mr John Porter, son of the
controversial Conservative politician Dame Shirley Porter, clearly hopes to
persuade the LBC receivers and other applicants for the London licences to
join in a judicial-review application.
Chelverton claims through its lawyers that, before the Reuters announcement,
LNR had been unable to raise its financing. LNR said it had been well
advanced in putting together a syndicate to fund the station when it
received 'an offer it couldn't refuse'.
Chelverton argues that the licence should be revoked under the 1990
Broadcasting Act because the 'nature and characteristics' of LNR are now
completely different from the time of the licence award. Apart from the
proposed acquisition by Reuters, Guinness Mahon had failed to comply with a
statement in the LNR application that it would issue shares in LNR by way of
a private placement.
'The consequence of the acquisition of LNR by Reuters is that the licence
will be held by an entity which, when the statutory scheme for the award of
the licence was followed, was unsuccessful,' the letter to the Radio
Authority says.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Construction groups to lobby with one voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The formation of a powerful trade association to act as a single voice in
Whitehall and Brussels for a large part of the UK construction industry was
announced yesterday.
The move is in line with a drive by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to reduce the number of trade associations with access to civil
servants and ministers by restricting contact to a smaller number of 'lead
asso-ciations'.
The establishment of an umbrella body to represent the industry was
supported by two of its largest employer organisations, the Building
Employers Confederation and the Federation of Civil Engineering Employers,
and by Major Construction Groups, which represents 11 of the country's
largest contractors.
It is hoped that other trade organisations and professional bodies will
eventually support the initiative.
The sector, with sales of about Pounds 50bn a year, is one of Britain
biggest industries, contributing up to a tenth of gross domestic product.
It is represented by several lobby groups which look after the diverse
interests of quantity surveyors, architects, building-material producers and
large international contractors.
This has led to duplication of effort and in some cases has caused confusion
among ministers and civil servants who have been listening to conflicting
messages.
The new body - given the working title Newco - will be expected to provide a
focal voice for the industry's lobbying efforts and to lead industry
thinking on strategic issues.
It will continue to recognise the independence of member organisations such
as the BEC and FCEC.
PA Consulting Group has been appointed to draw up a series of aims and
objectives for the trade association. Its report is due by late summer 'with
the intention of establishing the new organisation before the end of the
year'.
Mr Heseltine has said that where lead trade associations emerged he would
expect officials to 'refer to me only proposals from that lead association'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Oil industry to share database
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil companies active in the UK are to set up a common database to store
geotechnical data. The proposed scheme is part of a trend towards greater
co-operation in areas where there is no competitive advantage at stake.
The Common Industry Data Access Initiative might eventually eliminate the
need for oil companies to retain paper copies of all technical data on
individual wells in which they are financial partners.
The industry spends between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a year in reproducing
well logs.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Business failures lowest for 4 1/2 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of business failures last month dropped to the lowest level since
December 1989, Andrew Jack writes.
Corporate collapses in May totalled 157, down from 171 in April and 229 in
May last year. In December 1989 there were 90 failures.
Data on receiverships and administration orders is prepared by Touche Ross,
the accountancy firm, from figures in the official London and Edinburgh
Gazettes. Until 1991 it covered only England and Wales.
Mr Ralph Preece, partner in charge of Touche's corporate special services
department, predicted that total failures for the year would be as low as
2,000 compared with 3,226 last year. The cumulative total for 1994 until May
was 1,001. The largest fall in failures was in the south-east of England.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Crest wins excess of financial support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England said yesterday there had been substantial
oversubscription by institutions committed to supporting its proposed Crest
paperless share settlement system.
It said 74 firms and institutions had expressed willingness to be
shareholders by the end of May, the closing date for subscriptions to raise
the Pounds 12m for the 'building' phase of Crest, which is due to be
completed by the end of next year.
Commitments will be scaled back pro rata in accordance with the four tiers
of support, from Pounds 375,000 for those in tier 1 to Pounds 30,000 for
those in tier 4.
Crestco, a new company, will be formed by October using the share
subscriptions.
It will own and run Crest, while the Bank will build the core system and
provide legal and business support - for fees of Pounds 10m - until the end
of next year.
The prospective shareholders include 21 of the 28 marketmakers, 28 firms
specialising in retail broking and a number of custodians, payment providers
and institutional fund managers.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Halifax about to report fresh house price fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First signs that the pace of the housing market recovery may be faltering
are expected to emerge this week when Halifax building society announces
that house prices fell in May.
The society's latest housing figures are expected to be published tomorrow.
They represent the second successive month in which Halifax, Britain's
largest mortgage lender, has reported a fall in prices compared with the
previous month.
The decline in the past two months has coincided with the introduction of
tax increases in April. There have been fears that the increases could
inhibit returning consumer confidence.
Signals from the housing market remain very mixed. Nationwide, Britain's
second-largest building society, said yesterday that according to its
mortgage figures house prices had risen by 1.4 per cent in May compared with
the previous month.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'May is
traditionally a strong month for the housing market and the relatively large
rise in prices recorded should be seen in that context.' The average price
of a home had risen by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 54,617 during the previous
three months.
But Mr Davis agreed that 'recent indicators of market activity have been
mixed'.
He said: 'The underlying strengthening of the market which began in the
spring of last year is likely to be maintained, but progress is steady
rather than spectacular and heavily dependent on local conditions.
'The underlying trend over recent months has been broadly flat though prices
continue to show positive gains compared with the same period last year.'
Halifax had been prepared to regard a 0.2 per cent month-on-month price fall
in April as a blip but has become more worried at a second successive
monthly decline.
As a result it is expected to warn that its forecast of an average 5 per
cent price rise this year is less likely to be achieved. Nevertheless, it
still expects to see some small increase.
It is likely to wait for three or four months of falling prices before
revising its forecast. It believes that it is still too early to determine
the outcome of April's tax increases on housing market confidence although
it is concerned that the rise in sales by estate agents may also be
faltering a little.
The Halifax house prices are seasonally adjusted, unlike Nationwide's
survey. Halifax also uses a larger sample of mortgage loans.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Woolworths to drop vinyl singles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Woolworths, the high street retailer, is to stop selling vinyl single
records.
All 7-inch and 12-inch singles are being cleared from the shelves and no new
stocks will be bought after Monday. The 788-shop chain stopped selling vinyl
LPs last year.
The company said: 'The single isn't commercially viable because not enough
people are buying it for us to continue sales. Vinyl is in the past and is
dying out. This may well be its death in retail terms but in the customer
sense it had already died.
'People are more geared up towards CD and tape singles.'
In 1990 vinyl made up 95 per cent of the stores' singles sales but in the
past four years it has fallen to just 16 per cent.
HMV, with 94 shops, said demand was dwindling for vinyl except in the dance
music market.
The CD format was its biggest seller with 65 per cent of album and half of
singles sales. Vinyl LP's had less than 5 per cent of the market while vinyl
singles still had a respectable 23 per cent.
The company said: 'Vinyl singles and albums are being phased out because
more companies are bringing them out on tape and CD only. You can't sell
what doesn't exist.'
Virgin said that it planned to sell vinyl in its 24 shops as long as it was
produced.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Imro discipline system outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, is to have
more scope to explain the reasoning behind disciplinary actions against its
members.
The move will come as part of the new disciplinary regime which will take
effect for all cases opened after August 1.
Issuing a statement on its disciplinary policy yesterday, Imro said that it
wanted to bring greater openness into the process.
Its statement sets out the four principles underlying the system, and the
considerations - such as the number of investors suffering losses, and
whether previous warnings were given - which affect the penalties imposed.
This is the first time a self-regulatory organisation has published such a
comprehensive statement of its disciplinary process - although earlier this
year Lautro, the regulator for the life insurance industry, issued a
statement warning life offices that, as a matter of policy, rule breaches
un-covered in the second round of routine inspection visits would attract
more severe penalties.
Imro also published yesterday a guidance note setting new minimum standards
on how unit trust managers should deal with pricing errors and compensate
investors significantly affected.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Union chief wants unopposed crowning of Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leader of one of Britain's biggest unions last night called on other
possible leadership candidates to follow Mr Gordon Brown's example and not
to stand against Mr Tony Blair, the favourite for the job.
'They should take a leaf out of Gordon's book,' said Mr Bill Jordan,
president of the AEEU engineering and electrical union. 'This is an act of
true statesmanship, true leadership, bringing the party together, showing
the country what is needed.'
Mr Jordan's call is likely to be echoed by other union leaders who believe
Mr Blair is virtually unstoppable - and there is therefore little point in
proceeding with an expensive election.
However, union leaders on the centre-left believe Mr Blair must be
challenged if only to ensure that a real debate can be held on the future
policy direction of the party. Many of them believe that Mrs Margaret
Beckett is now the only possible serious challenger.
Some union leaders fear that if Mr Blair wins a landslide victory as an
uncompromising moderniser he may attempt to reduce the power of the unions
in the Labour party.
Others are confident that Mr Blair supports the party's commitment to full
employment and the introduction of a national minimum wage. They also
believe he would not wish to re-open the controversial issue of the role of
the unions in the Labour party this side of the next general election.
Last night a spokesman for Mr Brown said that Mr Blair had agreed to back
the employment agenda outlined by Mr Brown in his recent speeches.
Union leaders on the centre-left are becoming reconciled to the prospect of
Mr Blair as leader - but they remain determined to uphold their authority in
the party and hold him to Labour's current economic policies.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Signals strike threat to railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail workers have voted for strike action in a pay dispute, it was announced
last night.
The industrial action by signalmen could bring Britain's rail services to a
standstill later this month.
The RMT main rail union last night said that signalmen employed by
Railtrack, the newly formed company responsible for rail infrastructure, had
voted in a secret ballot by four-to-one to support strike action.
RMT is demanding an 11 per cent increase in basic rates for signalmen in
recognition of their improved product-ivity and to restore their relative
wage position in the industry.
The union claims that the 4,700 signalmen are earning lower rates of pay
than the vast majority of railway workers and substantially lower rates than
signalmen working for London Underground. On average a Railtrack signalman
earns a pre-tax basic salary of Pounds 183 a week.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT, said Railtrack needed to 'sit
up and take notice of the longstanding crisis of low pay within singnalling
grades. With a postal ballot turnout of 80 per cent the overwhelming
majority of our signalling members are saying they deserve the right rate
for the job. We will be seeking an urgent meeting with Railtrack.'
Railtrack last night said that it was disappointed by the outcome of the
ballot and added that talks with RMT would be held as soon as possible.
The union must by law give the company seven day's notice of any disruption.
The last dispute on the railways was in the spring of last year when RMT
called two one-day strikes over redundancies.
Industrial action planned for last night by BBC journalists and technicians
was called off as peace talks aimed at settling a pay and hours dispute
continued at Acas.
Leaders of the National Union of Journalists and the broadcasting union
Bectu were meeting BBC managers for a third round of talks at the
conciliation service Acas.
The unions had warned of further industrial action today but decided to call
off the threat because of the continuing discussions. 'It would be
impractical and improper to call another strike,' said one union official.
Journalists and technical staff have already staged a 24-hour strike and
have drawn up plans for further walkouts unless the dispute is settled.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Painful decision of a friend and
pragmatist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always the most likely outcome. After three weeks of agonising Mr
Gordon Brown has accepted that he cannot become leader of the Labour party -
at least this time round.
Mr Brown's fulsome statement of support for Mr Tony Blair, his main rival on
the party's ascendant modernist wing, is in line with their longstanding
political alliance.
It also underlines the continuing friendship between the two men, although
their relationship has been strained by Mr Blair's emergence as the runaway
leadership favourite.
Most of all, however, Mr Brown's announcement reflects his reluctant
acceptance of the Labour party's judgment that Mr Blair looks more likely to
win a general election.
It was a painful decision for a man who has devoted his adult life to the
Labour party, and who was regarded until recently as a more heavyweight
figure than Mr Blair.
Mr Brown, shadow chancellor, has borne the brunt of Labour's determination
to avoid damaging spending commitments before the next election. His
handling of the key economics portfolio has avoided the spending traps that
cost Labour dear at the 1992 election - but left him looking mean and
cautious to the party rank and file.
By contrast, Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, has built a reputation for
common sense and moderation with an effective attack on government law and
order policies.
Mr Brown's friends said he wanted to avoid a battle with Mr Blair which
could have done 'enormous damage' to the winner's hopes of defeating the
Tories in the next general election.
They admitted that he was trailing Mr Blair among constituencies and union
members, but claimed that support was equally split among backbench MPs,
shadow ministers and union leaders.
One close friend said: 'He believes he could have beaten Tony over the six
weeks of the campaign, but it would have been too damaging to the party.'
Much of this was taken with a pinch of salt by supporters of rival
candidates, who believe that Mr Blair has established an almost unassailable
lead in all sections of the party.
There was also some irritation at the timing of the announcement, which will
inevitably detract from coverage of Labour's European election campaign. One
MP said acidly: 'I thought the agreement that no-one would comment on the
leadership covered withdrawals from the race as well as campaign
statements.'
The mood of the party was more accurately expressed by Mr Donald Dewar,
shadow social security secretary, who was a prominent supporter of Mr Brown.
Mr Dewar, who will now switch his support to Mr Blair, said the decision
would remove uncertainty and enhance Mr Brown's position and stature in the
party.
It will certainly do that. As part of a deal with Mr Blair, Mr Brown has
been guaranteed the job of shadow chancellor until the next election, and
chancellor if Labour wins.
That was expected. But he will also have control of Labour's wider economic
policy, including issues such as business competitiveness and social
justice.
This wider brief will make Mr Brown by far the most influential member of Mr
Blair's team. If it works, it could promote a cohesive economic approach
across the shadow cabinet. But it could also lead to clashes with other
shadow ministers, including Mr John Prescott, employment spokesman, and Mr
Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary.
The two men, both seen as traditionalists, have a difficult relationship
with Mr Brown and there have been angry arguments about the development of
economic policy.
Both remain potential candidates for either the leadership or deputy
leadership, with Mrs Margaret Beckett, the traditionalist acting leader, and
Mr Jack Cunningham, the rightwing shadow foreign secretary.
Labour MPs said all four were still considering their positions, although Mr
Cunningham was regarded as highly unlikely to risk contesting either post.
Mr Cook is being wooed by Mr Blair's camp, which believes that his support
would remove any lingering doubts about the outcome of the election.
Mrs Beckett is widely expected to stand for re-election as deputy leader,
possibly as part of a balanced left/right ticket with Mr Blair.
Mr Prescott's friends say he is determined to stand for one of the
leadership posts, if only to force the modernists to debate the party's
future before Mr Blair is crowned leader.
Mr Prescott is unlikely to defeat either Mr Blair or Mrs Beckett, but his
standing might be strengthened if he were seen to have prevented a ritual
anointment of the new leader.
For Mr Brown, the immediate battle is over. He will work for Mr Blair in the
knowledge that victory for the shadow home secretary would leave the party's
modernists in virtually unchallenged control.
But if the battle is over, the war is not. If Mr Blair won the leadership
but lost the general election his hold on the job would be vulnerable to
challenge within three years.
If Mr Blair won the election he could be Labour leader for a decade. But at
43, Mr Brown could be in the party's top ranks for another 20 years. He
knows that his time may come.

Baroness Cumberlege, junior health minister, will tell a Royal College of

part of a doctor's life.
The Royal College of Physicians says in a report published yesterday that
the needs of doctors who want part-time specialist posts are not being met

Mr Charles Garside, former editor of The European, is about to return to the

Mr Garside's appointment was announced last night as it was revealed that Mr
Greg MacLeod, chief executive, had left. Mr Herbert Pearson, editor, will
switch to the new role of associate editor.
Mr Garside resigned eight months ago as editor of the weekly title, which
was founded by Robert Maxwell and is now owned by the Barclay brothers, who
live in Monte Carlo and whose interests range from hotels to shipping. Mr
Garside was said to have been forced out in a dispute with Mr MacLeod.
Mr MacLeod was originally brought in by Mr Garside from administrators
Arthur Andersen to manage the paper after the collapse of the Maxwell empire
at the end of 1991.
Mr Garside last night said: 'Mr MacLeod has been responsible for
implementing an efficient commercial system and preparing the way for the
next stage of development of the paper.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Army of volunteers may be called up: A national
community-service scheme for young people is gaining support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is the only country in western Europe not to have either military
national service or a civilian equivalent for young people. Politicians -
especially Labour ones - are wondering whether this anomaly should end.
This week the party's Commission on Social Justice backed the idea of a
citizens' volunteer service to encourage thousands of school-leavers to
spend three months on community projects.
It is an old debate, triggered by every wave of high youth unemployment or
fears about a youthful underclass slipping through the employment and
training net.
But the idea of some sort of national scheme has a better chance of taking
off now than in the early 1980s, when youth unemployment was even higher and
inner-city riots more frequent.
That is partly because the political tone has shifted against individualism
and the main political parties are all looking for ways of expressing a new
relationship between the citizen and the state which stresses both rights
and duties.
Mrs Elisabeth Hoodless, executive director of the lobby group Community
Service Volunteers, believes there is also more interest now because fewer
people believe that full employment will return.
'This is an idea whose time has finally come,' she said.
'There is a feeling that has not been so evident before of a huge gap
between civil society and a large group of young people. A lot of young
people in our big cities are just disappearing,' she added.
Youth civilian service schemes can be divided into three categories:
'Elite' schemes such as the Peace Corps in America or Voluntary Service
Overseas, for middle-class young people.
The safety net schemes designed to catch inner-city youth before they slip
into a life of crime.
The most ambitious option, a compulsory national scheme for, say, those aged
between 18 and 21 lasting between three months and a year.
Two recent reports suggest that the net cost of such a national scheme - for
anything up to 250,000 young people at any one time - would be less than
Pounds 300m per year, including a small allowance for the young people. But
that includes some big assumptions on savings from reductions in crime -
Pounds 1.3bn over five years.
There are also questions about the management of such schemes and how to
prevent volunteer workers, in the health service for example, replacing paid
workers, especially in the more aggressive commercial climate created by the
purchaser-provider split.
In Germany, which has military service, with the option of social service
for a slightly longer period, a recent report warned that the health service
would fall apart if the volunteers were removed.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Unions see Beckett as only challenger to Blair

Union leaders believe Mr Tony Blair is virtually unstoppable in the election

Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU craft union, said last night that Mr

courageous and confident man' who 'put the good of the party first'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Jamaica will help US in processing Haitians
</HEADLINE>

Jamaica and the US will sign an agreement this week for the Caribbean island
to be the first country to help Washington in processing Haitians seeking
asylum in the US.
Haitian refugees intercepted at sea by US forces will be questioned on ships
anchored in Jamaican territorial waters.
Mr P J Patterson, Jamaican prime minister, told parliament last night that
the agreement will involve the stationing of 'one or two boats', and that he
expected the operation to last 'no longer than six months.'
There were reports last night that the US was considering the use of three
vessels - two cruise ships and a floating hospital.
The agreement concludes discussions between the two countries which started
a fortnight ago when President Bill Clinton wrote to Mr Patterson to ask for
Jamaican assistance in the new US policy of processing Haitian
asylum-seekers at sea or in a third country, rather than returning them to
Haiti without a hearing.
The prime minister did not say when the agreement will take effect and when
the processing will begin. Jamaica had agreed to its territorial waters
being used because of its concern for the humanitarian problems caused by
the present Haitian situation, and because of the Jamaican government's
support for the restoration of democratic government in Haiti, Mr Patterson
said. Haiti is one of Jamaica's closest neigbours.
The US-Jamaican negotiations gathered steam this week with visits to Jamaica
by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, and Mr William Gray,
President Clinton's special advisor on Haiti.
It seems the US had sought permission from the British government to use the
Turks and Caicos Islands, a British archipelago to the north of Haiti in the
Caribbean, as a station for processing Haitians. However, there was deemed
to be not enough room on and near those islands, according to Jamaican
officials.
The agreement by Jamaica and the US will not commit the island to admit any
Haitian refugees, and all costs of the operation will be met by Washington,
Mr Patterson said.
The US president's decision to have requests by Haitian refugees for asylum
processed at sea or in a third country followed criticism of the US
government's policy of intercepting Haitian boatpeople and returning them to
their homeland without hearing their claims for political asylum.
Human rights groups have consistently charged that some of the Haitians who
were returned by the US Coast Guard have been killed or otherwise abused by
the Haitian military, which has been running the country since it overthrew
and exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two and a half years ago.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Every day is Clinton's D-Day: Misgivings as the US president
visits Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This ought to have been one of Bill Clinton's easier trips abroad. When he
made his maiden presidential voyage to Europe in January, he was a man with
a discernible and difficult mission - to set Nato on a new path and to
stiffen the forces of reform in Russia - and at least he achieved mixed
results.
This time, nothing on the agendas with the Italian, British and French
governments, and even the Pope, compares in weightiness, unless it be
Bosnia. Instead, his principal purpose is ceremonial, to represent his
country at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy
landings.
But there is an edgy sense of foreboding in the Clinton camp about the week
that began in Rome with his arrival early today and will involve hopping
back and forth across the English Channel. This president has a multitude of
problems on his back. His poll ratings have started to slip again, a White
House aide has resigned for improper use of a presidential helicopter, his
personal life and character are under legal and populist attack, his foreign
policy (on his own admission) is subject to 'relentless criticism', and the
centrepiece of his domestic programme, healthcare reform, has just been
deprived of the full services of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski.
The last thing Mr Clinton needs in these circumstances is a foreign foray
that can be portrayed as a foul-up by increasingly hostile US media eager to
pounce on any pratfall. In this respect, the ceremonial aspects of this
visit are the most fraught with danger.
To put it crudely, the concern is whether Mr Clinton - who never served in
uniform, was born three years after D-Day and opposed the Vietnam conflict -
can play the public part of commander-in-chief as well as did President
Reagan on the Normandy beaches 10 years ago, even though he fought the last
war in the studios of Hollywood.
Late changes in Mr Clinton's itinerary demonstrate high sensitivity by White
House planners. His first British landfall is to be at Cambridge, where
there is a US military cemetery, not, as first intended, at Oxford, from
where in 1969 he wrote his famous letter explaining why he did not want to
be drafted.
Every move he makes will be watched for signs of unease or disaffection
between him and the old soldiers gathered to celebrate a great expedition;
Mr Clinton's natural milieu is not that of men in uniform, nor do such men
mix easily with him.
The White House is also patently nervous about his treatment in the British
press, particularly its lurid emphasis, far greater than most of its US
counterparts, on the sexual harassment suit against him. Aides recently
surveyed several weeks of UK cuttings and found virtually nothing positive.
They fear an eruption of bimbo stories while Mr Clinton is in Britain - but
at least they now accept that would not be orchestrated by Conservative
Party central office.
Even the session with the Pope today is not risk-free from a media
standpoint. Mr Reagan was once able to nod off with impunity in a Vatican
exchange but the pontiff is expected this time to complain loudly about US
abortion policies, specifically the more liberal approach the US is
recommending for adoption at the UN population conference in Cairo in
September. The nuances of any presidential meeting with new neo-fascist
members of the Berlusconi government of Italy will also be closely watched.
Beyond the particular and the ceremonial, Mr Clinton must have a broader
purpose in all his public comments while in Europe - which is to give a
sense that he does have a coherent foreign policy. Mr Henry Kissinger, whose
own reputation for a cool, calm and collected strategic vision has just
taken a fearsome battering in H R Haldeman's diaries of the first Nixon
presidential term, was still able to write, in the current Newsweek
magazine, in terms that resonate in Washington and around the world.
'Will we be driven to decisions in a way that makes us appear weak and
rudderless - and tempts intransigent foreign leaders to test us - or can we
formulate a basis of US policy that allows us to anticipate the challenges
of the new international situation before they erupt into crisis? Most of
the administration's shortcomings are remediable  .. but answering that
basic question requires more discipline, organisation and focus than has
been demonstrated so far.'
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Senate armed services
committee, was more to the point. Mr Clinton 'is involving himself more, and
that is essential. But we expect too much of the president .. If he's not
going to spend a great deal of time on foreign policy he's got to designate
one person to be in charge - and that hasn't happend yet.'
The target of both was Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, now under
fire yet again for what is seen as bungling of policy on China. But the
president told the Los Angeles Times last Friday: 'The last thing I need to
be doing is considering changing my team.' Mr Christopher is going to be
doing most of the technical heavy lifting on this European trip, after Mr
Clinton has returned home, at ministerial meetings of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, Nato and the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council on three consecutive days.
To be fair, Mr Clinton, whose decision-making processes can be as
agonisingly slow as his mind and mouth can be fast and loose, recognises the
problem - 'lack of confidence in me,' he told the Los Angeles Times. He has
also begun to speak more frequently about the US role in the world - on
Monday, for example, equating past sacrifices and present challenges.
Clear contradictions persist, even so. The recent presidential directive on
peace-keeping was more intent on defining where US troops would not be used
rather than where they might. Yet the administration seems to be now
investigating an invasion of Haiti, mostly on the grounds that it is in the
US backyard and because the domestic pressure for intervention has been
rising.
If US critics are frustrated, and if the Senate is so confused that it
passes contradictory motions on the Bosnian arms embargo, it is hardly
surprising that a rudderless Europe, accustomed to the lead and protection
of the US, wonders what to expect.
Presidential foreign trips are usually good for domestic ratings. But, this
time, Mr Clinton had better not put even the occasional foot wrong on a
beach, in a pub, or in palaces and boats beyond number.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Indictment seen as a blow to 'politics the old-fashioned
way': Every aspect of Congressman Rostenkowski's personality and career
reflected the old ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski has never made any secret of his belief that he
is worth a great deal more than his congressional salary of Dollars 133,600.
'In being shy about declaring our worth in an honest way,' he said some
years ago in a rare speech on the floor of the House of Representatives
defending a pay rise for members of Congress, 'all we are doing is
reinforcing the impression that that is all we are worth.'
He has frequently taken steps to stretch his congressional salary: in 1990,
before new rules on members of Congress accepting fees for speeches to
private groups, Mr Rostenkowski set a record with Dollars 310,000 of
honoraria.
Other members have their own techniques for making a dollar go further.
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the deputy Republican leader and one
of the House's most outspoken critics of ethical lapses, uses a private
political action committee to finance his trips to lengthy seminars and
brainstorming sessions in holiday resorts.
Mr Rostenkowski could have retired in 1992 and pocketed more than Dollars 1m
from his campaign funds perfectly legally under now-expired rules that left
long-serving members of Congress subject to older, looser campaign finance
restrictions.
But a 17-count indictment filed in Washington DC on Tuesday by the US
prosecutor charges that Mr Rostenkowski's efforts to stretch his salary went
far outside the law.
'The allegations contained in today's indictment,' said Mr Eric Holder, the
US district attorney, 'represent a betrayal of the public trust for personal
gain. Mr Rostenkowski used his congressional office to perpetrate an
extensive fraud on the American people.'
Among other charges, Mr Rostenkowski is accused of drawing cash in exchange
for stamp purchase vouchers at the House of Representatives post office, of
padding his congressional payroll with people whose tasks were to mow the
lawn at his holiday home in Wisconsin or take photographs at his daughter's
wedding, and of buying expensive gifts for friends and political allies on
his office stationery account.
Mr Holder rejected suggestions that Mr Rostenkowski, who has sat in the
House for 35 years, was simply doing business the old-fashioned way.
'This is not, as some have suggested, a petty matter . . . . This was not
conduct that was ever acceptable,' he said.
Yet every aspect of Mr Rostenkowski's personality and career represent
politics the old-fashioned way, and that is the main reason why the sweeping
indictment filed on Tuesday caused such distress among his fellows on
Capitol Hill.
Congressman Charles Rangel, a colleague on the Ways and Means committee
which Mr Rostenkowski has chaired for the last 13 years, said yesterday that
the indictment had 'hurt the committee and the Congress'.
'He is the best there is,' added Congressman Michael Andrews of Texas,
another member of the Ways and Means committee, in which all US tax
legislation must start.
What made Mr Rostenkowski so good was his ability to gauge exactly how far
each member could be pushed or pulled to put together a majority for
legislation.
Even political opponents, such as Mr Gingrich, acknowledge Mr Rostenkowski's
skill at getting bills through the House.
That skill existed before he took the Ways and Means chairmanship -
then-Speaker Tip O'Neill relied on him in the 1970s to take the pulse of the
House on important issues - but it has been reinforced by his ability as
chairman to return favours and settle scores.
Congressman Sam Gibbons, a courtly 74-year-old Floridian who took over the
chairmanship yesterday after Mr Rostenkowski's indictment, has neither his
predecessor's political sense nor his ruthlessness.
But dire predictions that Mr Rostenkowski's fall would doom the Clinton
administration's efforts to draw up healthcare reform legislation have, as
is usual in Washington, been exaggerated.
The heart of the healthcare battle is, in any case, the Senate, not the
House, and particularly the Senate Finance committee, the House Ways and
Means' counterpart.
The tax lawyers who throng the lobbies outside the Ways and Means and
Finance committee rooms always complain that everything will fall apart
under a new chairman; yet business continues.
Similar forebodings prevailed a year and a half ago when Senator Pat
Moynihan took over the chairmanship of the Finance committee from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, who left Congress to become Treasury secretary.
Although Mr Moynihan has not been exactly the chairman the White House might
have hoped for, thwarting the administration on several issues, he has
certainly not been an incompetent flop.
The same is likely to be true of Mr Gibbons. The institution of the Ways and
Means committee carries an authority that transcends each successive
chairman.
That is, perhaps, as Mr Rostenkowski, long one of the staunchest defenders
of Congress as an institution, would like it.

<TEXT>
Hundreds of Los Angeles police officers called in sick again yesterday, the
third day in a row of mass 'sick-outs', as an acrimonious contract dispute
with the city continued, AP reports from Los Angeles.
Mayor Richard Riordan has urged the officers to accept mediation. The Police
Protective League, the officers' union, did not favour this but was expected
to reply later yesterday to the mayor's offer.
Only 105 of the 317 officers and sergeants scheduled for the early shift
yesterday arrived, the police department said.
Officers from the Tuesday evening shift were kept at work to cover.
The city estimates that the 'sick-outs' are costing it nearly Dollars 1m
(Pounds 662,000) a day in overtime.
The city has nearly 7,700 officers who have worked without contract for two
years. Los Angeles has been reluctant to offer police more money because of
budget constraints. Last week, they rejected a 6 per cent rise over two
years.
Starting pay for a new officer is Dollars 33,157 a year.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Chileans start US trade talks
</HEADLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Preliminary talks about the possibility of Chile's accession to the North
American Free Trade Agreement, or of a bilateral trade accord with the US,
are due to start in Washington today.
Discussions between the five-member Chilean mission and the US trade
representative's team will focus on investment protection issues. Although
Chile has signed investment protection agreements with several countries, a
US official doubted whether these met the stringent criteria demanded by
Washington.
Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's finance minister, stressed that today's talks
were strictly technical and that formal negotiations could not begin until
the US Congress had passed enabling, fast-track legislation. Once that had
been done, Mr Aninat expects negotiations will proceed much more rapidly
than they did with Mexico. 'We can learn from the Mexican negotiations,' he
said.
The US administration hopes to add fast-track to ratification of the Gatt
Uruguay Round, now before Congress, but controversy over approval of the
round could overshadow discussion of Chile.
The Clinton administration, which has repeatedly stressed its commitment to
sign an accord with Chile, has not yet decided whether this should take the
form of a bilateral agreement or full access to Nafta.
Canada, now the second most active foreign investor in Chile after the US,
has pushed for Chile's integration to Nafta. Mexico, which already has a
free trade agreement with Chile, in principle favours extending Nafta to
other Latin American states.
The AFL-CIO, the US labour organisation, has come out in favour of a
bilateral accord on the grounds that protection of labour rights contained
in Nafta is not sufficiently rigorous. Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic
leader in the House of Representatives, has proposed that labour clauses be
written into the text of any agreement with Chile rather than negotiated as
side issues.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Industrial price increases revive fears of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new survey from the National Association of Purchasing Managers yesterday
showed prices in the manufacturing sector continued to rise last month.
The NAPM said its composite index of activity in the manufacturing sector
remained steady last month at 57.7, the same as April and a level that
generally indicates an expanding economy.
But another sharp jump in the price component of the closely watched survey
helped to revive inflation fears in a nervous bond market. The NAPM price
index rose last month to 71.5, its highest level in four years and a marked
increase from 63.2 in April and 49.9 six months ago.
'Economic growth continued at the same strong rate in May as in April,
resulting in the broadest increase in manufacturing employment since late
1988 and the most widespread price increases paid by the manufacturing
sector since October 1990,' said Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM's
business survey committee and manager of procurement at Oryx Energy.
Although the price index showed a sharp increase, economists cautioned that
that does not necessarily indicate sharply higher prices. Rather, the survey
assesses how widespread higher prices are across the economy by measuring
the percentage of purchasing managers questioned who reported that they were
paying higher prices for their raw materials.
Nevertheless, some analysts said the NAPM's supplier deliveries index rose
in May to 60.7, its highest level in six years, pointing to the difficulty
suppliers are experiencing in meeting their customers' orders. Although some
of this increase may be attributed to a road hauliers' strike, it could also
herald price pressures.
Many stock market economists had anticipated an increase in the broader
composite NAPM index, so yesterday's stable result provided less fuel for
fears of overheating in the economy.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose
in April by 0.6 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of Dollars
508.5bn. The department also revised upwards its estimate of March
construction spending to an annual rate of Dollars 505.4bn, a 1.9 per cent
jump from February.

FT  02 JUN 94 / OECD pressed on Pergau Dam

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was yesterday
coming under pressure to publish a long-delayed report thought to be
critical of the controversial Pergau Dam project.
Mr Bernard Wood, director of the OECD's Development Corporate Directorate,
justified the delay on 'production difficulties' and said there were no
'sinister' or 'political' reasons behind it.
But the World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World which
has strong parliamentary backing, described the delay as 'extraordinary'.
The OECD has been reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK and
Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau project. But privately some
senior OECD aid officials are believed to be sympathetic with UK criticism
of the Pergau project, which involved a link between aid and military
contracts.
Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia says it is ready to sign an
agreement with Russia on the sale of 18 MiG-29s for use by the Malaysian air
force.
It is believed a quarter of the Dollars 615m (Pounds 410m) cost will be
covered by Malaysian palm oil exports to Russia. Malaysian companies will be
involved in some parts manufacturing for the fighters.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Algeria in Paris Club deal: Creditor countries reschedule
Dollars 5bn of debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria's foreign official creditors last night agreed to reschedule some
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) in debt principal and interest that the
beleaguered north African government was due to repay over the coming year.
The move by western governments to give Algeria relief on its official debts
follows its agreement last month with the International Monetary Fund to
devalue its currency by 40 per cent and to liberalise trade and prices, in
return for an IMF credit of Dollars 1bn.
Officials of the Paris Club of creditors said last night's accord was
expected to pave the way for Algeria to get similar debt relief terms from
commercial banks and to unblock a credit from the European Union as well as
fresh trade credit from France.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said this week the aim was to
'play the economic card' in Algeria's favour in the hope that a boost to the
economy might prevent political 'destabilisation' by the government's
hardline Moslem fundamentalists who have been involved in a violent campaign
of opposition.
With its total Dollars 26bn debt having an average maturity of only three
years, Algeria has faced a crunch in debt servicing that consumed 86 per
cent of its export earnings last year. The Paris Club is expected to halve
this debt service burden in the year up to May 1995. Some Dollars 5bn of the
total Dollars 8bn due in that period is to be repaid over 15 years after a
grace period lasting until 1998.
Algeria had requested - but failed to get - a rather longer repayment
period, perhaps because its official creditors remain unsure of the
long-term survival prospects of a government that two years ago had to annul
elections the fundamentalists were winning.
Its largest creditors are France, the US, Italy, Germany and Japan, while
its main commercial creditors are Japanese banks. The Paris Club deal was
much delayed by the reluctance of the Japanese to grant rescheduling and
Algeria's reluctance in seeking it.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Australian growth rate surges to 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's economic growth rate surged to 5 per cent on an annualised basis
in the March quarter, well in excess of both federal government and private
sector economists' forecasts.
The previous set of data, for the 1993 calender year, had indicated that the
economy was growing at 4 per cent - itself the best figure clocked up for
five years. But, according to data published by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics yesterday, there was even stronger growth in the March quarter,
with gross domestic product rising by 1.9 per cent in that three-month
period alone.
The first quarter increase was driven primarily by government and private
consumption, rather than business investment or net export performance.
The government's own budget estimates, published last month, suggested an
annual growth rate of 4 per cent for the year to end-June, followed by 4.5
per cent in 1994-95.
News of the surging economy exacerbated worries that interest rates might
have to rise fairly soon, prompting a fall in bond prices and a sharp rise
in the Australian dollar. The dollar reached a 20-month high, closing in
London at 74.07 US cents, up from 73.83 cents.
Interest rate policy, the pessimists argue, could become a dilemma for the
government, since business investment remains at very low ebb (and actually
fell in the March quarter). The government, therefore, could have
difficulties restraining private consumption without choking off business
expansion.
Yesterday, however, Mr Ralph Willis, the federal treasurer, claimed that
there were no signs that inflationary pressures were increasing, and hence
that the data had no implications for interest rates.
'One can determine movements in interest rates as when we see a likely
pick-up in inflation. We are not looking at anything here which shows you
some pick-up in inflation,' he said. The government was still comfortable
with its inflation forecast of around 2 per cent in 1993-94, Mr Willis
added.
The treasurer also noted that the 'early' Easter had affected consumption
data, and contributed to the unexpectedly high growth figure.
The federal government meanwhile announced yesterday that it had reached
agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the umbrella body for
labour organisations, on minimum national wage increases to apply in 1994
and 1995. The deal was reached under an accord unveiled in early 1993 and
the latest in a series of compacts between the ruling Labor government and
Actu.
The agreement provides for a ADollars 16-a-week 'safety net' wage rise to be
paid to low income earners, spread across two years. This follows an
ADollars 8 'safety net' increase awarded in last October's national wage
decision - representing a ADollars 24-a-week wage rise over three years for
workers who are not covered by individual 'enterprise-based' agreements.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the deal should 'deliver wage
restraint that will lock in the low inflation rate'. But the Australian
Chamber of Manufacturers attacked the deal, saying the across-the-board
rises, unrelated to productivity gains, would discourage business from
employing more people or investing.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Britain, Iran exchange diplomat expulsions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between Britain and Iran deteriorated further yesterday as both
governments announced the expulsion of a diplomat.
The Foreign Office in London yesterday made public its decision to expel Mr
Vahid Belourchi, a first secretary at the Iranian embassy, for allegedly
distributing forged documents about British policy in Bosnia. Iran had been
told of the British decision last week, when it was agreed that no publicity
would be given to the expulsion in the hope of avoiding further
repercussions.
However, Tehran said yesterday it was retaliating by expelling Mr Hamish
Cowell, the deputy head of the British mission in Tehran. No further
official explanation was offered by the Iranian government, but Iranian
newspapers linked the expulsion to 'extensive British propaganda against
Iran, designed to please the US'.
The latest downward turn in relations between the two countries began in
April when Britain accused Iran of establishing links with the IRA, and of
planning to provide weapons and training for Irish republican extremists.
Iran denied that any contacts had taken place and suggested instead that a
listening device had been found implanted in the wall of its refurbished
embassy in London.
The Foreign Office said the Iranian diplomat had been asked to leave
'because members of the Iranian embassy had been involved in attempting to
distribute forged documents purporting to show that Britain's policy in
Bosnia was directed against the Moslems'.
Iran has become frustrated at its inability to aid Moslems in Bosnia and the
refusal by western powers to accept the deployment of Iranian peace-keeping
forces in the former Yugoslavia.
The regime in Tehran also believes that Britain is playing a key supporting
role in the US policy of denying Iran access to international financial
markets at a time of growing economic difficulties in the Islamic republic.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Resignation of party leader may help Hata
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A leading member of the Japanese minority coalition is to resign his party
post because of supporters' anger over his part in the Socialists' departure
from the government.
Mr Keigo Ouchi said yesterday he would step down as chairman of the
Democratic Socialist party, a small centre-right party, because of criticism
over his support for the recent behind-the-scenes creation of a conservative
alliance called Kaishin (innovation). He will, however, stay on as health
and welfare minister.
The gesture is a step in the government's strategy of trying to win back the
much larger Social Democratic party, the key to its hopes of surviving for
more than a few months.
The walk-out by the socialist SDP in April, in protest at what it saw as a
conservative bid to dominate policy, deprived the government of a majority,
so paralysing such crucial but controversial legislation as plans for a
permanent cut in income tax and a rise in sales tax. Without the socialists'
support, Mr Tsutomu Hata, prime minister, had at the latest count just 202
seats in the 511-seat parliament, 54 short of a majority.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a close and powerful ally of Mr Hata, is generally accepted
as the inspiration for Kaishin.
Even so, Mr Ouchi's move is likely to help assuage socialist ire, the latest
in a series of surprisingly favourable developments for the five-week-old
Hata administration.
Socialist leaders have hinted in recent days that they might consider
rejoining the coalition if Mr Hata first resigned, in a symbolic act of
contrition for allowing the Kaishin grouping to be formed, and then stood
again for the leadership.
The prime minister's recent decision to freeze a planned rise in utility
prices has gone down well with SDP supporters. He yesterday vowed to produce
plans this month to streamline the administration and cut state spending,
another popular policy.
Japanese businesses will welcome any sign that Mr Hata can delay another
political crisis. They need a stable government to engineer a recovery and
resolve the trade dispute with the US, on which the yen's value partly
hangs. Yesterday's restart of shelved trade talks in Washington has done no
harm to Mr Hata's standing in that respect.
The new government has also managed to unblock progress on the long-delayed
national budget for the current year, another obvious concern for business.
This is now heading for passage this month.
But to unfreeze the budget, Mr Hata has riskily had to agree to opposition
demands to step up a parliamentary inquiry into political corruption. This
will probably entangle Mr Ozawa and so risk giving the opposition an excuse
to initiate a no-confidence vote.
The three main opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic party, SDP and
Communists, yesterday agreed that Mr Ozawa should be called to testify
before parliament on allegations of illicitly receiving political funds from
construction companies. Their demand is hard to resist, given the
government's minority position.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Manila GNP up 4.8% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philippine gross national product grew by 4.8 per cent in the first quarter
over the comparable period last year, a leap from the previous 0.3 per cent
rise, government data published yesterday show.
The growth rate surpassed earlier estimates of 3 to 3.5 per cent, and gave
rise to expectations of exceeding the 4.5 per cent target for all 1994.
The report confirms recent observations of a revival in the Philippine
economy, following enhanced political stability and an end to the electric
power shortages that bedevilled industries last year.
The policy-setting National Economic and Development Authority said a surge
in industrial activity, along with increased remittances from Filipinos
working overseas, spurred the first-quarter advance.
The internal economy, as measured by gross domestic product, went up by 3.8
per cent, a turnround from a 0.01 per cent decline the year before.
Industry output rose 7.6 per cent, behind brisker activity in construction
and manufacturing. This is largely attributed to the restoration of normal
electric power supply during the period, in contrast to the power
disruptions of up to 10 hours a day last year.
A number of new power stations were put up last year, mostly undertaken by
private groups under build-operate-transfer schemes with the government to
plug the supply shortages.
The agriculture and fishery sector provided the dampener, declining by 0.9
per cent in the quarter as the effects of the typhoons that pummelled many
parts of the country in late 1993 lingered in the first three months of
1994.
Mr Cielito Habito, Socio-Economic Secretary, said with the early onset of
the local rainy season the agriculture sector should be able to recover and
help 'further accelerate GNP growth'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Taiwan promised liberalised markets: New central bank
governor wants to make island a regional financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's new central bank governor, Mr Liang Kuo-shu, took over yesterday
with a pledge to liberalise Taiwanese financial markets with the aim of
transforming the island into a regional financial centre during his
five-year term.
He promised to push on with reforms in order to upgrade Taiwan's regulatory
framework and bring more foreign financial institutions, capital and
expertise into the country.
Mr Liang - who in his previous position as chairman of Chiao Tung Bank, a
state-owned development institution, last year scuppered a planned joint
venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace to produce short-haul
passenger jets - vowed to boost lending to local manufacturing and industry.
The accession of Mr Liang, 63, who holds a doctorate in economics from
Vanderbilt University in the US, to the top banking job is viewed favourably
by analysts and bankers. His experience in commercial banking was acquired
during stints at the helm of each of the three leading state-run commercial
banks. Mr Liang also served as deputy central bank governor from 1975 to
1979.
Known for speaking his mind, Mr Liang might have become central bank
governor several years ago had he not made enemies along the way.
Soft-spoken but strong-willed, he is likened by one financial sector
operator in Taipei to a 'thunderstorm' when angered.
His predecessor, Mr Samuel Shieh, at times become embroiled in public
stand-offs with the Finance Ministry and other government agencies. However,
Mr Liang has close personal ties to President Lee Teng-hui, under whose
auspices the central bank falls. He has been a financial adviser to Mr Lee
for some time. Mr Liang's wife, Ms Hou Chin-ying, is an economics professor
and belongs to one of Taiwan's most influential families.
Analysts cautioned that while Mr Liang was firmly in the camp of the
reformers, it would be difficult to change quickly the thinking of the
central bank bureaucracy.
Saying that 'we have to invite more international financial institutions to
introduce more financial products to Taiwan', Mr Liang told a news
conference yesterday: 'To do so, we have to accelerate revising many
out-of-date rules and establish new systems to attract them.
'The first step is to expand our foreign exchange market as a regional
funding centre.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / UN meeting on N Korea reactor rods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, South Korea and Japan will consult tomorrow at the United Nations to
discuss their response to North Korea's refusal to allow full international
inspection of its nuclear programme.
North Korea has so far failed to comply with a statement issued by the UN
Security Council on Monday urging it to stop removing spent fuel rods from
its 5MW reactor.
The International Atomic Energy Agency wants to select and examine the spent
nuclear fuel to determine whether North Korea has diverted plutonium from
the reactor for its suspected nuclear weapons programme.
In an apparent show of force, North Korea on Tuesday conducted a test launch
of a domestic version of the Chinese-designed Silkworm anti-ship missile.
Meanwhile, South Korean armed forces were placed on a routine high state of
alert following the departure of President Kim Young-sam on a week-long
visit to Russia and Uzbekistan.
North Korea may be within days of completing the removal of the fuel rods
and ending any chance of the IAEA conducting an independent analysis of them
to trace past nuclear activities.
The US has warned if North Korea passes this threshold, its negotiations
with Pyongyang will be broken off and Washington will ask the UN Security
Council for economic sanctions against the North.
The North has warned that sanctions would be considered 'an act of war'.
The IAEA on Tuesday urged North Korea to accept 'technical options which
might still at this late stage of discharge. . . preserve the agency's
ability to verify the history of the (reactor's) core.'
The IAEA rejected North Korea's proposed procedures to select and store the
fuel rods for later examination, explaining that it 'would not enable the
agency to identify' where the rods had been located in the reactor core.
'Without such identification, future measurements (of the fuel rods) would
be meaningless and the agency's ability to verify non-diversion would be
lost,' it said.
North Korea is putting the discharged fuel rods into a storage tank 'after
writing the location and serial numbers on the rods, with monitoring cameras
operating', a North Korean diplomat was quoted as saying in Vienna.
The IAEA will be able to examine the fuel rods once North Korea and the US
conclude a package deal on diplomatic normalisation and economic aid, he
added.
North Korea is refusing the IAEA's demands because it claims a special
status under the nuclear safeguards treaty since it has only 'suspended' its
threatened withdrawal from the treaty last year.

FT  02 JUN 94 / OECD pressed on Pergau Dam document: No political reason
behind the delay, says directorate official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was yesterday
coming under pressure to publish a long-delayed report thought to be
critical of the controversial Pergau Dam project.
Mr Bernard Wood, director of the OECD's Development Corporate Directorate,
justified the delay on 'production difficulties' and said there were no
other 'sinister' or 'political' reasons behind it.
But the World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World which
has strong parliamentary backing, described the delay as 'extraordinary',
given the continuing public interest in debating the Pergau project.
The OECD has been officially reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK
and Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau project.
Privately however, some senior OECD aid officials are believed to be
sympathetic with the domestic UK criticism of the Pergau project which
involved a linkage between aid and military contracts.
The OECD report is thought to have identified the conflict of interests that
arose in the decision by the British government to approve the Pergau
project after overruling advice from its own civil servants responsible for
aid.
The Overseas Development Administration, the government department
responsible for overseeing the UK's aid programme, said: 'We are happy for
the OECD report to be published as soon as possible.'
An ODA official said it was pressing the OECD to explain what the production
difficulties involved.
The OECD's report was completed in March, following a critical review from
Finnish and Belgian examiners appointed by the organisation's development
assistance committee (DAC). A draft report was circulated soon afterwards
and approved by member countries with minor amendments to its wording.
In the OECD's latest newsletter, Mr James Michel, DAC chairman, refers to
strong support among members for the principle that all aid be subjected to
the full standards of normal assessment, and that 'aid quality should
predominate' in decisions.
A report by the House of Commons foreign affairs committee is in process of
being completed and is due to be published before the start of the summer.
Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur: After several months' negotiations,
Malaysia says it is ready to sign an agreement with Russia on the sale of 18
MiG-29s for use by the Malaysian air force.
Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysian defence minister, said the purchase
agreement would be signed with the Russians next Tuesday.
Malaysia originally announced plans to buy the MiGs in the middle of last
year. But final negotiations were complicated by Malaysia's wish for
extensive technology transfer and a stipulation that part of the purchase
would be paid for in palm oil.
It is believed about a quarter of the Dollars 615m (Pounds 410m) cost of the
MiGs will be covered by Malaysian palm oil exports to Russia. The Russians
are said to be offering a maintenance and training package with the MiGs.
Malaysian companies will also be involved in some parts manufacturing for
the fighters.
The first MiGs are likely to be delivered to Malaysia by mid-1995. The deal
is the first big arms sale by Russia in the Asean region.
Malaysia's armed forces are going through an extensive modernisation
programme.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UN index points way to future civil wars: Canada tops
quality of life assessment, but many other countries are heading for
disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persistent threats from hunger, violence and illness to individuals'
security in their daily lives are the root cause of increasing numbers of
internal conflicts worldwide, according to a report released yesterday by
the United Nations Development Programme.
The Human Development Report 1994, the fifth annual assessment of quality of
life in 173 countries, draws its conclusions from its key instrument, the
Human Development Index (HDI). A total of 17 countries are heading for the
kind of national breakdown witnessed in Somalia as a result of critically
low levels of human development, it says.
The HDI, which ranks countries by a measure combining life expectancy,
educational attainment and basic purchasing power, is intended to add
another dimension to World Bank reports on economic indicators by seeing how
economic growth translates into people's lives.
This year, Canada tops the HDI list - scoring 0.932 on a scale of 0 to 1 -
up from second place behind Japan in 1993, and Barbados, on 0.894, is ranked
first for developing countries. A new measure showing HDI progress between
1960 and 1992 reveals that among the 114 countries where data were
available, Malaysia, Botswana, South Korea, Tunisia and Thailand showed the
most progress.
Life expectancy in the developing world rose from 46 years in 1960 to 63
years in 1992 and the infant mortality rate was halved. The adult literacy
rate in the same countries increased from 46 per cent to 69 per cent.
But Afghanistan, Angola, Haiti, Iraq, Mozambique, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan and
Zaire face disaster as a consequence of critical levels of socio-economic
deprivation. A bloodbath has happened in Rwanda while other countries which
could face national breakdown include Algeria, Burundi, Ivory Coast,
Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.
Of the 82 conflicts between 1989 and 1992, 79 wars have been within nation
states and the report argues that national collapse has tended to follow
persistent threats to the human security of the people. In the 1980s,
military spending to social spending ratios were among the highest in Iraq
(8:1), Somalia (5:1) and Nicaragua (3.5:1).
Current patterns of aid distribution promise little remedy. Many nations
have sacrificed human security for more sophisticated weaponry. India
ordered 20 advanced MiG-29 fighters at a cost that could have provided basic
education to all the 15m girls now out of school, the report says. Though
global military spending has been falling 3.6 per cent a year since 1987,
the cumulative 'peace dividend' estimated at Dollars 935bn (Pounds 623bn)
has not been harnessed for human development needs.
Patterns of development funding still bear the scars of the cold war,
reflecting donors' strategic interests rather than development requirements.
On average, high military spenders receive about 2 1/2 times as much per
capita as low military spenders. El Salvador, for example, gets 16 times
more aid per person than Bangladesh, even though Bangladesh has just half
the per capita gross domestic product.
The report suggests new financial arrangements for human development to be
put into action at the World Summit for Social Development in March 1995,
hosted by Denmark on behalf of the UN.
The core proposals are:
A cut of 3 per cent a year in future global military spending, with a fifth
of the savings by rich nations and a tenth by poor nations earmarked for
global human security.
A global compact to provide basic education, primary health care, safe
drinking water and family planning services by earmarking at least 20 per
cent of the existing developing country budgets and 20 per cent of donor aid
allocations to these human development projects.
A global human security fund, financed from means such as a tax on the
speculative movement of international funds, as suggested in a contribution
to the report by Professor James Tobin, 1981 Nobel prizewinner for
economics.
The report also proposes the establishment of an Economic Security Council
in the United Nations to become the highest decision-making forum to
consider issues such as poverty, unemployment, food security, drug
trafficking, pollution and population migration.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Pirate disc sales double to 75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide sales of pirate compact discs doubled to 75m units last year,
almost exclusively as a result of unauthorised production in China,
according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
The IFPI said it expected CD piracy to increase further, unless China took
steps to enforce copyright law.
The federation, along with Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has
proposed that legitimate manufacturers mark CDs with a four-digit code which
would indicate where they were made.
Sales of unauthorised music cassettes fell last year, however, to 675m units
from 680m in 1992. There were substantial falls in pirate cassette sales in
Mexico and Poland. The level of pirate music sales in both countries
remained high. Unauthorised sales accounted for 62 per cent of all
recordings sold in Mexico last year and 67 per cent in Poland.
The value of pirate recordings sold last year on either CDs or cassettes
fell to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 2.1bn in 1992. The federation said it
would be wrong to draw any comfort from the decline, which was the result of
lower retail prices and exchange rate movements.
The federation said the pirates appeared to be getting less for their
recordings. The average worldwide price of a pirate cassette, outside China,
fell 10 per cent to about Dollars 2.70 last year. The price of a CD outside
China fell from just under Dollars 13 in 1992 to just under Dollars 12 last
year.
Chinese pirate producers saw CD prices fall even more sharply, from nearly
Dollars 11 in 1992 to Dollars 4.50 last year.
Despite the activities of unauthorised Chinese manufacturers, the US was the
biggest market for pirate products last year in value terms.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: EU to back Ruggiero to head the WTO -
Veteran Italian diplomat emerges as front-runner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is set to back Mr Renato Ruggiero, a veteran Italian
diplomat and former foreign trade minister, to become head of the World
Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade next year.
Mr Ruggiero, who is 64 and has been a director of Fiat, the Italian motor
manufacturer, since 1991, is the first candidate to win official support for
the post from any Gatt member.
Though the EU has yet formally to declare his nomination, Sir Leon Brittan,
the European trade commissioner - who this week ruled himself out of the
running - plans to canvass backing for Mr Ruggiero from the US and Japan.
Sir Leon is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Mickey Kantor, President
Bill Clinton's trade representative, and Mr Koji Kakizawa, the Japanese
foreign minister, at next week's ministerial meeting in Paris of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Commission threw its weight behind Mr Ruggiero after the Italian
government notified it yesterday that it would support his nomination. When
the matter was discussed by officials from the 12 EU governments, none
indicated that it intended to field a rival candidate.
Mr Ruggiero was Italy's trade minister between 1987 and 1991, critical years
for the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. He was one of the
first to espouse the idea of a powerful world trade organisation to replace
the Gatt, a proposal later supported by the EU.
Mr Ruggiero spent much of his 30 years with the Italian foreign service on
European policy issues. He served successively as the European Commission's
director-general of regional affairs, its official spokesman, and as Italy's
permanent representative in Brussels.
He also represented his government in preparations for several world
economic summits before becoming foreign trade minister and then
co-ordinator of Fiat's international activities.
All the directors-general of the Gatt to date have been Europeans. Mr Peter
Sutherland, the present incumbent, was previously Ireland's commissioner, in
charge of European competition policy.
However, a growing number of Gatt members believe the time has come to break
with tradition. Developing countries, who account for most of the
membership, believe they have a strong case for providing the first WTO
head, though they have yet to rally behind a candidate.
Latin American candidates put up a respectable showing last year against Mr
Sutherland, and the name of Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister
and a former Gatt ambassador, is being canvassed. There are also suggestions
that the job should go to a nominee from the Asia-Pacific region.
Two New Zealanders have been mentioned - Mr Philip Burdon, the trade
minister, and Mr Mike Moore, an ex-prime minister.

<TEXT>
The new South African government and the country's private-sector Foreign
Trade Organisation yesterday announced a big trade and investment initiative
to strengthen ties with the US after years of economic isolation and
sanctions.
In Washington yesterday, Mr Trevor Manuel, South African trade and industry
minister, said that the US and South African governments are working on
various bilateral initiatives, including an investment pact, a double
taxation treaty, and a conference in Atlanta to start tomorrow.
South Africa plans to hold its largest trade exposition ever, on September
20-23 in New York City's convention centre. This will feature 150 South
African businesses from a broad range of industries, including clothing,
textile, furniture, domestic appliances, base materials, agricultural and
industrial equipment, banking and financial services.
Mr Manuel said the new government expects companies doing business in South
Africa to adhere voluntarily to affirmative action plans for women and black
people.
The US commerce department, believing South Africa to be the key to trade in
all of southern Africa, has marked the country for special attention by
putting it on its list of 10 Emerging Markets, where it expects exports to
grow the most.
Also, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation is increasing its
investment insurance in South Africa to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m). The US
Export-Import Bank last year lifted conditions imposed because of apartheid.
US exports to South Africa stand at Dollars 2.2bn, with South African
exports to the US at nearly Dollars 2bn.

Motorola, the US electronics and wireless communications manufacturer, has
announced a IPounds 110m (Pounds 108m) investment in the Republic of
Ireland, to expand its operations serving the European market.
Its Dublin plant, making pagers and two-way radios, will be extended to
include the manufacture of batteries and battery chargers, as well as
crystal oscillators which are also used in the company's communications
equipment.
The project has been backed by Ireland's Industrial Development Authority
and is expected to create 2,000 jobs over the next five years, one of the
largest projects in job-creating terms that the IDA has been able to attract
to Ireland in recent years. As much as a third of the additional workforce
being taken on is expected to be made up of university graduates.
Mr Dominic Layden, Motorola country manager in Ireland, said that workforce
skills were an important factor in choosing Ireland.
The IDA does not release details of grant support to individual projects
until the publication of its annual report but, in general, grant support
tends to average about 25-30 per cent of overall investment in a project and
will be directly linked to the achievement of job-creation targets.
In announcing details of the project, Mr Ruari Quinn, minister for
employment and enterprise, said that the IDA had succeeded in creating
nearly 4,000 new jobs in Ireland's electronics sector last year through
attracting new investments, and that some 30,000 people are now employed in
the sector in more than 300 companies. Output from the sector now accounts
for more than a quarter of Ireland's manufactured exports.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Worldwide pirate disc sales double to 75m
 -China mainly to blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide sales of pirate compact discs doubled to 75m units last year,
almost exclusively as a result of unauthorised production in China,
according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
The IFPI said it expected CD piracy to increase further, unless China took
steps to enforce copyright law.
The federation, along with Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has
proposed that legitimate manufacturers mark CDs with a four-digit code which
would indicate where they were made.
Sales of unauthorised music cassettes fell last year, however, to 675m units
from 680m in 1992. There were substantial falls in pirate cassette sales in
Mexico and Poland. The level of pirate music sales in both countries
remained high. Unauthorised sales accounted for 62 per cent of all
recordings sold in Mexico last year and 67 per cent in Poland.
The value of pirate recordings sold last year on either CDs or cassettes
fell to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 2.1bn in 1992. The federation said it
would be wrong to draw any comfort from the decline, which was the result of
lower retail prices and exchange rate movements.
The federation said the pirates appeared to be getting less for their
recordings. The average worldwide price of a pirate cassette, outside China,
fell 10 per cent to about Dollars 2.70 last year. The price of a CD outside
China fell from just under Dollars 13 in 1992 to just under Dollars 12 last
year.
Chinese pirate producers saw CD prices fall even more sharply, from nearly
Dollars 11 in 1992 to Dollars 4.50 last year.
Despite the activities of unauthorised Chinese manufacturers, the US was the
biggest market for pirate products last year in value terms. Although pirate
sales accounted for only 4 per cent of the US market, their total value was
Dollars 413.4m, compared with Dollars 347.8m in China. Chinese pirate sales
by value accounted for half the country's music market.
Mexico was the third biggest pirate market at Dollars 196m, followed by
Germany at Dollars 132.3m and Italy at Dollars 111.1m. Pirate sales
accounted for only 5 per cent of the German market by value. In Italy, they
represented 20 per cent of sales.
The federation said a change in piracy in recent years had been that
unauthorised recordings were increasingly being sold in countries other than
those in which they were manufactured. 'Such product has been traced, for
example, from its point of manufacture in China through Europe to its
destination in South America.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ARAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1980s, Astra, Romania's leading railway rolling stock manufacturer,
helped the country fill its export quotas to the Soviet Union by designing
special freight wagons strong enough to withstand Siberia's sub-zero
temperatures.
Then came the collapse of communism and Comecon, the former East Bloc
trading organisation, and Astra discovered that its expertise in building
made-for-Siberia rolling stock was no longer of any value. To survive,
Astra, like most factories in eastern Europe, had to make a radical turn to
the west.
As it turned out, Astra - still owned by the state and run by its old
managers - is one of the rare Romanian heavy industrial companies that is
successfully making this switch. Before 1989, about 90 per cent of Astra's
exports went to Comecon countries. Now, around 90 per cent of its exports go
to western markets. And the company will export more than 70 per cent of the
450 wagons it expects to produce this year.
Under licence from French company De Dietrich, Astra, based in Arad, on the
border with Hungary, 300 miles east of Bucharest, will begin production this
year of Corail cars - top of the range passenger coaches capable of
travelling at 125mph an hour - which it plans to export to western Europe,
once it has built 200 for the Romanian railway company.
'It all started in 1990 when we were allowed to make contracts on our own
and not through the ministry of trade or foreign trade companies as before,'
says Mr Sandu Albulescu, trade manager. 'Until then, we were obliged to give
priority to Comecon countries. Now, we make deals on a commercial basis. We
had to find new markets in the west due to the severe recession in this
region.'
Unlike their comrades in the former Soviet Union, Astra's managers do not
long for the 'good old days' of central planning, but they say their new
freedom has its costs.
'We prefer the current conditions - we have got rid of a lot of the
bureaucracy - the party, the ministries, the trade unions,' says Mr Georghe
Toduta, deputy manager. During President Nicolae Ceausescu's iron reign,
managers had to report production levels daily to Bucharest and, as Mr
Toduta says, 'the stress was much greater then'.
The challenge for post-communist managers now, Mr Toduta says, is that while
'the degree of freedom is much greater, so is the responsibility. If we work
badly and make bad decisions, the factory will close down.'
Astra already has contracts with German, Swiss, Austrian and Kazakh railways
for 1,000 light oil transport wagons, a new model which it developed after
1989. To keep up with demand, Mr Albulescu says the company needs to set up
a new production line for the wagon and for a similar model for heavier oil
products.
Western contracts mean that Astra, which first started manufacturing rolling
stock in 1891, has had to upgrade its production to meet the high technical,
quality and environmental standards required by its new customers.
Under the deal with De Dietrich, the French company has begun to transfer
technology to Astra in Arad where the company can draw on a pool of some 300
engineers and designers at the local rail engineering institute. De Dietrich
is supplying Astra with a new production line, machine tools and components
for the first 50 Corail coaches. It is also training Astra staff at its
headquarters near Strasbourg.
Mr Albulescu says the company's competitive edge comes from the labour
force: 'Wages for skilled workers are a fraction of those in France. The
average wage in this country is less than Dollars 100 a month.'
He says the company has also become much tougher on its domestic suppliers,
frequently sending back sub-standard goods. It sources the majority of its
inputs locally with just some high-technology parts imported from abroad.
Mr Albulescu says the new technology and emphasis on quality have lifted the
value of Astra's exports even though it has shed a third of its workforce,
produces fewer wagons than in 1989 and is working at just 60 per cent
capacity. Exports were Dollars 19.7m in 1993, up from Dollars 16.8m in 1989.
The management, which has begun a restructuring plan, says it would like to
see the company privatised, preferably by bringing in a strategic partner to
help it update its technology. This is likely to take some time under
Romania's slow-moving, bureaucratic privatisation programme, but Mr
Albulescu says De Dietrich and Bombardier of Canada are already interested.
'The west is scared that Astra will soon be serious competition,' Mr Toduta
says with a grin.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese trade surplus forecast to fall by
6.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's politically troublesome trade surplus will shrink by 6.1 per cent in
1994, the first drop in four years, according to the country's nine largest
trading companies.
A survey by the Foreign Trade Council, the trading groups' industry body,
predicts the trade surplus will fall to Dollars 114.3bn (Pounds 76.2bn) in
the year to next March.
The forecast, a welcome sign as the US and Japan make a fresh attempt to
break the deadlock in trade talks, is however a slight increase on the
council's estimate in December of a Dollars 113.5bn surplus.
This reflects the fact that Japan's main foreign markets are recovering
faster than domestic demand. The council based its forecast on 1 per cent
economic growth this year - and that is well above average market
expectations.
The surplus started to fall from the third to the fourth quarter of last
year, but picked up again slightly, to the Japanese authorities' concern, in
the first three months of 1994.
Exports will rise by 2.8 per cent to Dollars 376.5bn this year, the council
forecasts. The yen's strength will stimulate demand for imports, expected to
rise by 7.4 per cent to Dollars 262.2bn.
Semiconductor sales to US and Asian computer makers will be the star export
performers, up 12.3 per cent, according to the survey. But it predicts that
car exports will rise by a mere 0.4 per cent, due to the shift in production
to lower-cost foreign plants.

<TEXT>
Employees of the Italian state are rushing to cash in on early retirement
pensions, for fear of cuts in the current generous system of benefits. In
the first four months of this year, INPDAP, the entity responsible for
public sector employees' pensions, yesterday reported it had received 29,260
requests for retirement. This compared with estimates, drawn up for
budgetary purposes, of 14,580 and of 43,700 for the year as a whole. The
increase has been caused by the previous government's warnings on cuts in
pension benefits and the new government's election pledge to end generous
early retirement pensions. INPDAP said more than 90 per cent of the requests
had come mainly from people working in local government and municipally run
bodies who had been in their jobs for only 20 years on average.

<TEXT>
Poland is to press ahead with painful reforms of the welfare system, aimed
at cutting budget spending, as well as the consolidation and privatisation
of the banking system. The capital market is to be strengthened through the
development of investment and pension funds, according to a medium-term plan
prepared by Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the new deputy premier and finance
minister.
The outlines of the plan were published yesterday as Poland started talks
with a team from the International Monetary Fund on a new one-year stand-by
agreement. The government plan, which runs until 1997, foresees an average
annual growth rate of 5 per cent. It forecasts the achievement of
single-figure inflation in 1997, compared with its present 25 per cent rate.
The government also wants to see a reduction in the spread between lending
and deposit rates.
The unemployment rate is forecast to fall from 16 per cent to 14 per cent,
while the budget deficit is to reach no more than 3 per cent of GDP in 1997,
from its present 4 per cent.

The German government yesterday approved sharply scaled-down plans for
moving to the capital, Berlin, cutting back on housing ministries in new
buildings. In an effort to trim the costs, many ministries will be put into
old buildings which housed the former imperial, Nazi and communist
administrations.
However, the chancellory will be one of the few institutions to be given a
new site, close to the former Reichstag parliament building. The foreign
ministry, which had lobbied hard to have a new headquarters, will be given
only a new extension in the Mitte, the heart of old Berlin before the second
world war. The finance and economics ministers will move to the building
which now houses the Treuhand privatisation agency, but which was the
headquarters of the Luftwaffe. The construction minister, Mrs Irmgard
Schwaetzer, said the new plan will save the government around DM1bn,
reducing the total costs to around DM20bn.

<TEXT>
A former business colleague of Mr Jurgen Schneider, the German property
entrepreneur whose disappearance in April triggered Germany's biggest
property crash since the second world war, has been arrested on suspicion of
helping Mr Schneider to transfer up to DM750m (Pounds 300m) of company funds
out of Germany.
The Cologne-based businessman, who was not named, is believed to be an
Iranian who was managing director of a company within the Schneider group up
to March this year. According to the state prosecutor's office in Frankfurt,
the person arrested had established contacts with an unnamed Swiss bank and
is alleged to have helped Mr Schneider to transfer the funds. He was
arrested on Tuesday morning.
Mr Schneider, whose whereabouts are still unknown after he failed to come
back from holiday in Tuscany at Easter, has been accused by the Deutsche
Bank, the property group's biggest creditor, of misappropriating at least
DM218m of the group's funds. Other estimates suggest that he took up to
DM750m from the group, which collapsed with debts of DM5bn.

Industrial production in western Germany rose by 2.5 per cent in April
compared with the previous month, with the main sectors showing signs of
emerging from the recession, the Federal statistics office reported
yesterday. The sharpest increases occured in mining, which rose by 6.5 per
cent over the same period. Electricity and gas grew by 4.5 per cent. Even in
the manufacturing sector, one of the areas worst hit by the recession, there
was an increase of 3 per cent. The combined industrial production figures
for March and April also compare favourably over the corresponding period of
1993, with overall growth rising by 1.9 per cent, and the manufacturing
sector increasing by 2.1 per cent. However, utilities fell by 4.5 per cent,
largely due to weather conditions and high prices.
Dutch consumer borrowing rose 7.7 per cent year-on-year to Fl 3.2bn (Pounds
1.2bn) in the first quarter of 1994, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
Spain's trade deficit widened to Pta273.4bn (Pounds 1.32bn) in April from
Pta163.276bn in March and was up 30.2 per cent year-on-year, the Economics
Ministry said.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Top Swiss banker backs derivative regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The chief executive of Swiss Bank Corporation has backed the main
recommendations of the US General Accounting Office for regulation of the
controversial financial derivatives sector.
SBC, one of the top international banks in the mushrooming derivatives
field, has thus distanced itself from US banking and securities industry
representatives, who condemned the GAO's report.
The report came at a time of growing alarm that the increasing complexity,
leverage and volume of futures, options and swaps contracts could in extreme
circumstances lead to a collapse of the world financial system.
According to one estimate, the volume of contracts outstanding exceeded
Dollars 18,000bn (Pounds 12,000bn) at the end of last year. Several
industrial companies have reported huge losses in the past year arising from
the unexpected behaviour of derivative contracts.
Echoing the GAO, Mr Georges Blum, SBC chief executive, said in a speech at
the International Management Symposium in St Gallen that supervisors and
regulators in different countries 'needed to be more in line with each other
on what their aims and instruments should be'.
Mr Blum also supported the GAO call for identical regulation of all types of
firms active in derivatives.
He criticised regulators and supervisors everywhere for dragging their feet
on agreeing accounting and disclosure rules on derivatives, and for not
legislating to reduce the risk in so-called netting of contracts. 'If
lawmakers are concerned about derivatives, these are the obvious areas they
should look at first.'
Mr Blum also denounced those financial companies who claimed that only low
levels of capital were needed to cover their derivatives activities, saying
they were 'wishing to have your cake and eat it too'. 'If the stress tests
advocated by traders as a way to simulate the extent of the risks occurring
in unusual circumstances have any utility, capital must cover the losses
derived by the simulations,' he said.
'We agree with the regulators when they say that the system should be able
to weather a severe storm, even if there is only a remote possibility that
it will occur.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Scalfaro denies misuse of secret funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is becoming increasingly embroiled in a
controversy over the use of secret funds during his time as interior
minister in the 1980s.
Rather than stay aloof from damaging allegations that he was aware of the
misuse of the secret funds by the security services, President Scalfaro has
been drawn into making a series of rebuttals. These rebuttals have in turn
raised more questions than answers.
The alleged misuse of these funds by interior ministers over the past decade
has been under investigation by Rome magistrates for a year, and seven
former top domestic intelligence officials are on trial for embezzlement. At
various stages all the accused have sought to implicate four former
Christian Democrat interior ministers, including Mr Scalfaro, for operating
a secret payments system from unaccountable ministry funds. Mr Scalfaro held
the portfolio from 1983 to 1987.
The Rome magistrates last week issued a statement saying they were not
investigating the president after further accusation had been made in court.
This prompted President Scalfaro to make an angry unprepared statement to
journalists. 'I defy anyone to prove a single lira was spent by me or other
interior ministers for anything other than institutional purposes.'
Ever since then the opposition Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the
former communists, as well as the governing Northern League and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, have been calling for explanations of
what these 'institutional purposes' were. Having admitted he knew about the
use of these funds it will be difficult for him to avoid demands to be more
specific. No one has denied the need for discretionary funds at the interior
ministry, but the president's critics argue there should be some proof the
monies were not being misused.
The raising of the temperature on this issue could make the president
vulnerable on the question of his tenure. Even before the elections,
politicians across the political spectrum had started to question whether Mr
Scalfaro, elected by the discredited old parliament, should be allowed his
full seven-year term. both the Northern League and the MSI have been giving
ever stronger messages that the president can only remain as long as
parliament deems fit.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Lines open up to Europe's information society: The
long-awaited Bangemann report says liberalisation of telecoms is unstoppable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too late for member states of the European Union to stand in the way
of telecommunications liberalisation, Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry
commissioner, insisted yesterday.
Presenting a summary of recommendations from his long-awaited 'Information
Society' report, Mr Bangemann said: 'Our purpose is to make clear that we
cannot hold up this process. Nobody can.'
To be presented to EU leaders at next month's summit in Corfu, the report
says member states must accelerate the process of liberalisation by opening
up to competition those infrastructures and services that remain
monopolistic.
Flanked by senior figures from the electronics industry, Mr Bangemann said:
'Private investors will only get involved in a market which promises a
return on their investment.'
The report highlights some of the challenges that lie ahead for the Union if
it is to keep abreast of rapid developments in the field of
telecommunications. For example, it raises the prospect that out-dated and
anachronistic laws in areas such as media ownership, intellectual property
rights and security of information will have to be replaced if the EU is to
have an appropriate regulatory framework.
It identifies a number of areas where cross-border differences could
continue to hinder an internal market in telecommunications. It recommends,
for instance, that urgent attention be paid to the problem of media
ownership, where divergent national legislation could undermine the free
movement of information.
Currently, rules governing media ownership between the member states differ
widely. With different media services gliding ever more easily across
frontiers, failure to harmonise these rules could lead to problems of
access. The report adds that effective rules to ensure that ownership is not
concentrated in one or two powerful hands must also be put in place.
On intellectual property protection, the report lacks specifics but
highlights the need to adjust the present outdated rules, many of which were
invented before information and creative products could be dispersed as
easily as they are now.
The report also urges the EU to speed up the process of European
standardisation, making interconnection of networks a primary objective.
And, as a matter of urgency, international long-distance and leased-line
tariffs should be adjusted to bring them into line with rates practised in
other advanced industrialised regions, it says.
The group of industrialists that helped Mr Bangemann have also recommended
that tariffs for mobile telecommunications be reduced, and that a regulatory
framework for satellite be established.
As for funding, the report says that 'the creation of the information
society should be entrusted to the private sector and to market forces'.
However, the recommendations are vague on the issue of existing public
funding, saying only that it should be 'refocused more specifically to
target the requirements of the information society'.
Finally, it recommends that, given the urgency of the tasks ahead, member
states should now nominate individual ministers to represent it at a new
council of ministers dedicated to the information society.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Move to cool Crimea row thrown out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's divided parliament yesterday rejected a proposal by President
Leonid Kravchuk to set up a constitutional court to resolve the status of
the disputed Crimean peninsula. Instead, it voted for a four-point
resolution which suspended the quasi-independence constitution reintroduced
by Crimea two weeks ago and called on the president to come up with a list
of 'concrete measures' by June 6 to ensure Crimea's compliance with Kiev's
wishes.
It also set up a parliamentary commission to seek ways of harmonising
Ukrainian and Crimean legislation within the next month.
The rejection of Mr Kravchuk's proposals was another step in the internal
power struggle between parliament and president but merely led to the search
for another formula which gave the semblance of activity while holding back
from actions which carry the risk of conflict between Ukrainians and ethnic
Russians.
The long-standing dispute between Kiev and the ethnic-Russian dominated
Crimean parliament reignited earlier this month when the latter unilaterally
reintroduced a constitution which barely stops short of bestowing full
sovereignty on the region.
The peninsula, a holiday area, was part of Russia for two centuries until
transferred to Ukraine in 1954. A 10-day Ukrainian-imposed deadline to
rescind the constitution passed unobserved two days ago.
Mr Kravchuk's attempt to cool the temperature of a dispute which threatens
to grow into violent conflict between Russians and Ukrainians earned a
contemptuous response from many Ukrainian nationalist MPs in the deeply
divided Ukrainian parliament. It was interpreted as a sign of weak
leadership from a lame duck president hobbled by the proximity of
presidential elections on June 26.
The Crimean dispute is closely linked to the status of the former Soviet
Black Sea fleet which is based in the peninsula. Three days of talks between
the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers last week failed to remove the
impasse.
Mr Kravchuk stated yesterday that while Russia had no objective need for a
fleet based on Ukrainian territory it was unrealistic for it to be withdrawn
immediately.
Yesterday was doubly humiliating for Mr Kravchuk as rejection of his
constitutional court proposal by the bitterly divided Ukrainian parliament
was matched by the studied indifference of the Crimean parliament to his
repeated call for Crimea to rescind its quasi-independence constitution.

FT  02 JUN 94 / VW expects early accord on Seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAMBURG, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen said yesterday it hoped to end talks with the Madrid government
'in the next two weeks' to clear the way for further restructuring at Seat,
its loss-making Spanish subsidiary.
The company said it wanted Spain to contribute DM820m (Pounds 328m) to fund
redundancies at Seat. It claimed there were 'positive signals' that the
government would make funds available and a further meeting was scheduled
for next week.
However, in Madrid, the industry ministry said it would only be willing to
pump more money into the Barcelona-based car company for new development
projects. The government also argues that its scope for providing help is
limited by European Union rules.
Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, secretary of state for industry, told VW
representatives on Tuesday that the government was not prepared to fund
redundancy packages. Excess labour was 'a problem for private sector
management'.
Seat plans to shed about 4,600 workers, leaving it with a workforce of
around 9,500 by 1996. The company expects to end the year with losses of
about DM1bn, but should become profitable again in 1995.
Meanwhile, VW announced that it had had 'positive results' at company and
group level in April and May but would not give details of profits. The
company has already said it hopes to improve on its 1993 profit of DM71m
(Pounds 28.4m) at company level this year and to break even at group level
following a loss of DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) last year.
Worldwide deliveries in the first five months rose 6.1 per cent over the
year before to total 1.4m units. Germany was the only market where
deliveries fell - by 4.1 per cent - a fact VW blamed on weak demand there
generally and poor sales at Audi.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Bosnian talks to reopen amid warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnia's warring parties were due in Geneva today for talks on the
republic's future which diplomats are describing as virtually the last
chance for a negotiated settlement.
While Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his military chief
Radko Mladic said they would certainly attend, there was uncertainty up to
the last moment as to whether, and at what level, the Moslem-led government
would be represented.
The talks have been arranged amid warnings from western observers that the
conflict could soon escalate, and a series of grim new revelations about the
scale on which ethnic cleansing has been practised in Bosnia.
'People who are close to the peace process give the current talks about a
one-in-four chance of succeeding,' said Mr Michael Clark, director of the
Centre for Defence Studies in London. France, and to a lesser extent
Britain, were growing doubtful about the feasibility of retaining troops in
Bosnia for another winter.
Meanwhile, the latest revelations about ethnic cleansing were reinforcing
the determination of the Moslems and their international sympathisers to
resist any settlement that appeared to reward Serb military gains.
The UN said 550 people crossed into Croatia yesterday, the latest in a
stream of Croats and Moslem civilians who have been leaving the Serb
stronghold of Banja Luka under pressure from local warlords.
Separately, a UN commission on war crimes, in a report published in part by
Reuters news agency, said 50,000 people had been killed or deported in one
relatively small area of north-west Bosnia, around Prijedor. 'It is
unquestionable that the events in the Prijedor region since April 30, 1992
qualify as crimes against humanity. Furthermore, it is likely to be
confirmed in court under due process of law that these events constitute
genocide,' the commission found.
Despite the gloomy background, Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy
to Bosnia, sounded a more optimistic note after two rounds of talks with
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade. He said he thought the
Geneva talks would lead to a ceasefire.
However, the government in Sarajevo, bolstered by the new alliance between
Croats and Moslems, has expressed reluctance to take part in further talks
unless the Serbs withdraw fully from the UN 'safe area' of Gorazde in
eastern Bosnia. The Serbs say their troops in the Gorazde area have a
legitimate function of maintaining order and protecting Serb refugees.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Warning on finance for EU networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union must act now to ensure that there will be no shortage of
finance for constructing transport, energy and communications networks in
Europe, Mr Henning Christophersen, European Commission vice-president, said
yesterday.
In a report to next week's meeting of economics and finance ministers on the
funding of so-called transeuropean networks, Mr Christophersen said possible
financing problems for the projects were already so alarming, that he was
inviting member states, EU institutions and private operators to consider
what action is necessary to maintain adequate investment.
He stressed again the the need to attract private finance, his comments
coming in the wake of another recent sharp rise in long-term European
interest rates, pushed higher by investor nervousness about inflation.
Mr Christophersen said market trends this week made it ever more important
to get a clear signal from next week's meeting of EU economy and finance
ministers, and from the Corfu summit later this month, that ministers were
planning to step up their anti-inflationary policies.
'This message is even more important than two weeks ago because the market
fears that inflation is going to come back,' he said.
The recent rise in long-term borrowing rates will strengthen the position of
those member states that are wary of Commission proposals to raise an extra
funds through the issue of 'Union bonds'.
However, Mr Christophersen retained the prospect of Union involvement,
saying that where other financing sources were not available, the EU should
be able to co-finance, with the European Investment Bank, loan packages to
priority projects.
Another option for capital market funding would be for the EU to underwrite
private sector projects. Such guarantees could be made available to loans
specific to projects that were co-financed with the EIB.
Mr Christophersen also pointed out that there was likely to be a shortfall
in financing of up to Ecu6.4bn (Pounds 4.9bn) for Europe's 10 priority
transport projects. Projects receiving public assistance would have to
satisfy economic viability tests. 'They should be expected to produce a
substantial net benefit to society, taking into account also the external
costs and benefits,' he said.
He added that at Union level, the EIB would be the largest single source of
finance for the transeuropean networks. The European Investment Fund, now
operational, would work with the private sector in helping to allocate and
manage risks.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Bond prices fall again in Europe on inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets posted further declines yesterday amid
renewed fears of inflation. But the US Treasury market rebounded from a
morning sell-off triggered by evidence of growing price pressures in the
manufacturing sector.
In Europe, dealers reported selling mainly by institutional investors who
had been sitting on loss-making positions for months. This combined with
technically-driven selling in the futures markets to push prices in many
markets to new lows for the year.
Shares in London and Paris were dragged lower by the weaker bond prices,
while German stocks edged higher but finished well below their best. The
FT-SE 100 index closed down 38.6 at 2,931.9, its lowest finish since July.
French shares ended with sharp losses, with the CAC-40 closing 50.22 lower
at 1,972.18, below 2,000 for the first time since July.
US shares lost ground in the morning but recovered in tandem with US bond
prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down as much as 25 points during
the day, finished up 2.46 at 3,760.83.
An unexpected jump in prices paid by US manufacturers in May, revealed in a
survey by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, set off the early
weakness in US bonds. The rally came amid further declines in commodity
prices and talks of unannounced bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. US
bond traders were awaiting tomorrow's May employment data. The Commerce
Department report is expected to provide further clues on US monetary
policy.
Higher-than-expected German industrial production data con-tributed to the
fall in European bonds. The UK gilts market was one of the worst performers,
plagued by fears that the economic recovery will fuel inflationary pressures
and lead to monetary tightening.
The June contract of the UK government bond future traded on Liffe, the
London futures and options exchange, broke through 100 and fell as low as 99
17/32 before closing around 99 25/32 , down 1 1/32 .
Despite a small reduction in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase rate, by
5 basis points to 5.15 per cent, sentiment remained negative on German
interest rate movements. The repo rate is used as a benchmark for interest
rates in German money markets. German government bonds were also sold
following remarks by Mr Guntram Palm, a member of the Bundesbank's
policy-making council, indicating that interest rate cuts in the near term
were unlikely.
German bonds did not suffer as much as other European bonds. The June Bund
futures contract on Liffe fell to around 92.30, down 0.54. Bond markets in
Scandinavia and southern Europe were hit by heavy foreign selling.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Euro Disney's prince has come - bearing cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi prince who is one of the Middle East's
most aggressive investors, yesterday came to the rescue of Euro Disney, the
leisure group, by announcing plans to buy up to 24.5 per cent of the company
on the eve of its emergency financial restructuring.
The prince, who is also prepared to invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) to
build a second conference centre at the EuroDisneyland theme park near
Paris, has been negotiating for six weeks with Euro Disney and Walt Disney,
its US parent company, to thrash out the terms of a deal.
Prince Al-Waleed, 37, a nephew of King Fahd, first surfaced on the
international investment scene in 1991 by buying a 14.88 per cent stake in
Citicorp, the US banking group. He has interests in finance, media and
construction and recently joined with Accor, the French hotel group, in its
bid to buy the Meridien luxury hotel chain from Air France.
The prince, together with United Saudi Commercial Bank, of which he is
chairman, has negotiated a complex deal with Walt Disney whereby he can buy
between 13 per cent and 24 per cent of Euro Disney's shares after the
completion of its forthcoming FFr13bn (Pounds 1.53bn) emergency financial
restructuring.
He has offered to buy any shares left on the market after Euro Disney's
imminent FFr6bn rights issue. He will be allowed to retain only up to 24.5
per cent of the group, so that his holding is no more than 50 per cent of
that of Walt Disney's 49 per cent stake.
If the rights issue is heavily subscribed, which is considered to be
unlikely given the gravity of Euro Disney's recent financial difficulties
and the steep fall in its share price, Prince Al-Waleed will be able to
acquire a stake of up to 13 per cent from Disney.
The US group, which has already suffered heavy losses on its Euro Disney
holding, is willing to reduce its investment to 36 per cent, providing the
prince's stake is worth no more than half that.
The prince's emergence comes only a few days before Euro Disney's
extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday when the terms of the rights
issue are expected to be announced.
In a statement yesterday Prince Al-Waleed said: 'I believe the long-term
prospects for Euro Disney are bright. The quality of what has been
constructed at Euro Disneyland Paris makes me optimistic about the future.'
A Disney official in Los Angeles said: 'The prince came to us . . . We had
already done the financial restructuring with the banks and other interested
parties. He then approached us.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Brown gives Blair clear run at party leadership:
Modernisers' pact makes Labour succession 'a formality'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's bid for the Labour party leadership looked unstoppable last
night after his close friend and ally, Mr Gordon Brown, bowed out of the
race to succeed Mr John Smith.
Mr Brown's decision means he will now give his full backing to Mr Blair and
will in turn be guaranteed his current post of shadow chancellor.
It is understood in talks between the two - the party's leading
'modernisers' - Mr Brown has been promised the pivotal role in shaping
economic and social policy in any future Labour government led by Mr Blair.
Mr Blair, currently shadow home secretary, now has the overwhelming support
of the shadow cabinet and of Labour MPs in the leadership race. A
substantial majority of trades union leaders also support him.
That raises the possibility that the 41-year-old MP for Sedgefield could
become the youngest party leader this century after only a token contest.
One member of the shadow cabinet said last night that the party's choice was
now 'a formality'.
Last night the head of one of Britain's biggest unions, Mr Bill Jordan, of
the AEEU engineering and electrical union, called on possible leadership
candidates to follow Mr Brown's example by not standing against Mr Blair.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, Mr John Prescott, shadow
employment secretary and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary,
are all potential contenders for the leadership. Mr Cook was last night
understood to be keeping his options open and Mrs Beckett has said she will
not reveal her intentions until after the European elections on June 9.
But senior figures in the party last night appeared confident that both Mr
Cook and Mrs Beckett would decide eventually not to run against Mr Blair.
That would leave Mr Prescott, the standard-bearer of the party's
'traditionalist' wing with a difficult decision of whether to contest the
leadership or whether to stand against Mrs Beckett for the post of deputy
leader.
Left-wing Labour MPs believe a contest is vital to test Mr Blair's stance on
the key economic and social decisions the party must take before the general
election.
Mr Prescott has supported that view but must now assess the risk to his
political career that a defeat would cause .
In a brief statement, Mr Brown said that he had taken his decision to clear
up 'the confusion' over whether he would fight Mr Blair for the leadership.
He had only one consideration in mind - 'to ensure the election of a Labour
government to improve and regenerate our country'.
Close friends insisted that Mr Brown had won equal support from MPs, members
of the shadow cabinet and union leaders for his own candidacy. But he
recognised Mr Blair's stronger appeal to the electorate. Mr Blair accepted
that under his leadership the 'fairness' agenda developed by Mr Brown to
link economic and social policies would be the basis for Labour policy for
the next election.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Power plug change 'would cost UK consumers millions'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British consumers face costs of Pounds 78m a year for 40 years if the UK
backs a changeover to continental electrical plugs and sockets, according to
an independent report commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The report by the Building Services Research and Information Association
estimates that a 'big bang' changeover, backed by legislation, would cost
consumers:
Pounds 56m a year for rewiring.
Pounds 7m a year for the replacement of old plugs.
Pounds 15m a year in conversion costs passed on to the consumer by industry.
An alternative would be a voluntary changeover, which would take longer but
be cheaper to the consumer, at an estimated cost of Pounds 19m a year.
The DTI has commissioned the report as it is considering whether appliance
manufacturers should be required to fit British or continental plugs to
products sold in the UK.
It makes little sense to fit appliances with British plugs if a changeover
to European standards is is to be made soon. But the UK has not yet decided
that a changeover would be beneficial.
Cenelec, the European standards-making body, was yesterday meeting in Ulster
to approve the final draft of the standard for harmonised plugs and sockets
across Europe.
The standard will then go to national standards councils for their approval.
In assessing the overall benefits of a changeover, the Building Services
Research and Information Association concludes that the Cenelec system would
eventually lower the cost of plugs, but the consumer unit - the distribution
box where the mains electricity enters the home - would be more expensive.
British homes are wired in rings, with the numerous sockets on each ring
made safe through a fuse in every three-pin plug. However, the European
system is a radial system.
Each socket is connected directly to the consumer unit by its own lead,
removing the need for fuses in the two-point plugs, but also preventing the
fitting of different fuses to suit each appliance.
To convert to the continental system, every house would need to be rewired.
After the transition appliance manufacturers would need to fit only one type
of plug to supply markets throughout Europe.
However, building contractors would incur higher costs for the installation
of the continental type of consumer units.
The makers of plugs, sockets and leads for the British market - which
currently benefit from what is in effect a protected market - would also
face much greater competition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Maculan, the Austrian building group with significant interests in eastern
Germany, reported an 11.6 per cent rise in 1993 net income to Sch260m
(Dollars 179.3m) on turnover up 19 per cent to Sch13.9bn.
The group said business growth had been strongest in Austria, due to buoyant
residential construction, and in eastern Germany, partly due to the
first-time consolidation of 90 per cent owned TB Tief-und Verkehrsbau
Berlin.
Turnover in the former Soviet Union fell by about a third. Maculan has filed
a force majeure claim with the German government over a Sch1.9bn contract
for a Russian military housing project financed by Bonn.
The project has been delayed by spiralling costs due to inflation and the
declining value of the rouble.
The group, which has grown rapidly in the past five years, said its primary
focus in the current year would be 'consolidation and optimisation of
existing activities'. Still, it expected both turnover and earnings to grow
by about 10 per cent.
Orders on hand at March 31 were 10 per cent lower at Sch9.4bn because of the
removal of the Russian contract.
Current orders represent eight months' work.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Prodi quits as Iri loses L10,230bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iri, the Italian state holding company, yesterday said 1993 losses had
reached a record L10,230bn (Dollars 6.4bn), more than double the L4,809bn
for the previous year.
At the same time, it was announced that Mr Romano Prodi, chairman, had
handed in his resignation to Mr Lamberto Dini, minister for the treasury,
the sole shareholder of Iri, which transformed in 1992 into a
Treasury-controlled public company with a current capital of L15,000bn, Of
the losses, L8,317bn was attributed to the reorganisation and restructuring
of Iri's subsidiaries in the steel and construction/engineering sectors -
Ilva and Iri-Tecna.
But the heavy financial charges resulting from its L75,000bn debts, which
include those of telecommunications and autostrada subsidiaries, also played
a part. Debt directly attributable to the holding company was L18,085bn,
against L20,000bn the previous year.
Iri indicated that some L5,000bn of losses was due to the reorganisation of
its Ilva steel group and at Iri-Tecna, its construction/engineering arm.
Ilva is in the process of being privatised and an announcement is close on
the sale of its special steels operations.
Coinciding with yesterday's meeting, the Official Gazette published details
of the decree approved by the previous Ciampi government allowing Iri to
restructure some of its debt. This involves the issue of up to L10,000bn in
bonds by the treasury-controlled Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.
The departure of Mr Prodi has been widely foreshadowed. He agreed a year ago
to return to Iri having been chairman from 1982-89. However he has found
himself out of sympathy with the Berlusconi government.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new prime minister, has made no real effort to
retain his services at Iri and is even reported to have offered him a
European Commissioner's job in Brussels.
Mr Prodi, who nurtures political ambitions, is expected to return to his
economic research institute in Bologna in the short term.
His departure raises big questions about the future direction of Iri,
especially as the Berlusconi government is pledged to accelerate
privatisation.
During his chairmanship, Mr Prodi has overseen the privatisation of part of
the foodstuffs group SME, and two banks - Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana.

FT  01 JUN 94 / S Korea considers early OECD entry: Government advised to
hasten pace of de-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea is considering an unexpectedly early entry into the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, which yesterday urged the country
to hasten deregulation to ensure continued growth.
The South Korean finance ministry said the government was contemplating a
December application to the OECD, which it was hoping to join in 1996. The
entry will mark another important step in the country's rapid economic
progress.
In a survey released yesterday, the OECD gave good marks to a comprehensive
package of economic deregulation and financial liberalisation measures
proposed last year. But it added several caveats to its approval,
particularly in the area of financial liberalisation.
'In contrast to false starts in the past, it is important that this
(deregulation) programme be implemented in full, and at a pace which leaves
markets in no doubt that the process is irreversible,' the report said.
It said that even if the reform plan was implemented by 1997, the South
Korean financial system will still have a higher degree of control than is
found in most OECD countries.
It suggested, for example, that controls on capital inflows should be
further loosened in spite of South Korean fears that such a move could lead
to inflationary pressure resulting from an increase in money supply. Other
recommendations included a quickening of interest rate deregulation and
allowing financial institutions more freedom to introduce new products.
The South Korean government has used its tight control over the financial
system to guide industrial policy, and an easing of controls will be seen as
a challenge to its authority.
The OECD was critical that 'some elements of the old credit allocation will
remain at the end of the liberalisation period'.
These include a requirement that banks extend 45 per cent of their loans to
small companies to promote their growth, while restricting loans to the 30
largest conglomerates, or chaebol. The OECD suggested the government's
efforts to curb the economic power of the chaebol through credit
restrictions were misguided.
'An economically more efficient policy would give the chaebol complete
freedom to determine their activities. This considerable power over private
companies is not only at variance with the concept of a free-market economy
but may also put domestic firms at a disadvantage' in competition with
foreign rivals, it stated.
It recommended that the government should instead focus on 'preventing
actual abuse of market power' by the chaebol.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US takes harder line on Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and the US have very different approaches toward gaining access to
Japanese markets, British Trade Minister Richard Needham, said yesterday. Mr
Needham was speaking at the launch of an 'Action Japan' campaign.
A Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) panel said in
a report released yesterday the US is 'without parallel' in imposing
measures that force its trading partners to abide by unilateral judgments.
It said the US shows no signs of abandoning this practice.
Asked why the US has received lucrative orders from Japanese businesses, Mr
Needham said: 'I don't think you can in practical terms play the part of the
bully, unless you're bigger than the other guy. If the other guy's bigger
than you, and you try and be the bully, you're likely to end up on your
back.'
The Action Japan campaign, which follows on from the Opportunity Japan
(1988-91) and Priority Japan (1991-1994) campaigns, aims to increase British
visible exports to Pounds 3.5bn by 1996, up from Pounds 2.6bn in 1993.

FT  01 JUN 94 / NZ 'heads for first budget surplus in 17 years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand will show a budget surplus of NZDollars 420m (Dollars 246m) for
the year to June 30, the first it will have achieved for 17 years, Mr Bill
Birch, finance minister, said yesterday.
The forecast is a sharp turnaround from the Treasury prediction made last
October before the general election which returned the National party
government.
The Treasury then had predicted a deficit of NZDollars 1.4bn for the June
year.
Mr Birch said that because of the rapidly improving economy, tax receipts
would be NZDollars 2bn higher than expected, while government spending and
other costs had been held down.
The projected surplus was the latest in a string of good news items on the
New Zealand economy. Other recent statistics have shown a steady improvement
in the balance of payments, continued low inflation, and strong job
creation.
National Bank, a Lloyds Bank subsidiary, in its latest survey released
yesterday, reported that business confidence remained buoyant.
Optimism was increasing in the more densely populated North Island, which
until now had been slower to enjoy the economic revival.
Two former senior executives of Fortex, a collapsed New Zealand meat
company, were yesterday charged with 27 accusations of fraud totalling
NZDollars 42m. The charges included publishing a false statement.
They were Mr Graeme Thompson, the chief executive and a former New Zealand
Businessman of the Year, and Mr Michael Millin, general manager for finance.
The Securities Commission and other New Zealand authorities are
investigating the company, whose sudden and unexpected collapse in March saw
suppliers, farmers and other lenders lose up to NZDollars 160m.
Fortex was known internationally for developing new slaughter operations and
24-hour production in an industry that for decades had been in the grip of
tough unions.
It had an international marketing network, with plans to open a
slaughterhouse in Britain.
Mr Alan Isaac, the receiver, says he has had over 40 expressions of interest
in the company's two plants which are being offered for international
tender. They are worth an estimated NZDollars 100m.

Amnesty International, the human rights group, demands today that China
release political prisoners and end torture in its prisons, saying thousands
arrested in the crackdown five years ago continue to be imprisoned and in
some cases maltreated, Reuter reports from Beijing.
In a report issued to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the bloody army
attack that crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square on June 4 1989, '' the London-based group said: 'Arbitrary arrests,
unfair trials and torture continue to be widespread and the death penalty is
used extensively for a wide range of offences.'

The export of German weapons systems made with foreign partners will no
longer need special approval following measures intended to make German
companies more competitive. The economics ministry said projects undertaken
with companies in the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development could now go ahead without approval if German
components made up less than 20 per cent of the product. Previously, all
weapons exports had to be cleared by the Federal Security Council, which
oversees defence policy. Such international projects would only be allowed
if Nato saw a need for the weapons systems and companies involved would have
to agree in advance where the finished product would be sold, a measure
designed to prevent sales of arms to so-called 'crisis zones' like the
Middle East. The new rules will not apply to nuclear, biological or chemical
weapons or their delivery systems.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Hitch in plan for US-Russian exercises: Nationalist
sentiment may compel change of venue
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A joint peacekeeping exercise between US and Russian troops, planned for
this month in Russia and meant to symbolise the closer co-operation between
the two former antagonists, is now likely to take place in the US, in
deference to Russian nationalist sentiment.
Mr Sam Nunn, chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, said in
Moscow yesterday that he had proposed the change of venue after learning
that the exercise had been 'indefinitely postponed' by President Boris
Yeltsin.
A senior Pentagon official said last night that 'Senator Nunn's proposal is
one possibility. We are following on with conversations with the (Russian)
defence ministry about a possible postponement'.
Mr Nunn said the incident did not necessarily mean Russia would not take a
full part in the Partnership for Peace - the Nato plan to draw former
communist countries into association with it, which Russia has said it will
sign this month. He said that the Rusian government 'must do a vigorous job
in explaining things to its people'.
The shift of venue, and the victory of the nationalists in having the
exercise moved, was lambasted yesterday by Mr Yegor Gaidar, former deputy
prime minister and leader of the liberal Russia's Choice party, as 'a
syndrome of paranoid re-militarisation' - in contrast to the 'steadfastness
and courage' of the US in proposing to host the exercise.
'Our military men would be happy to act like Enver Hoxja (former leader of
Albania), to sprinkle pillboxes all over Russia and to protect us with sharp
barbed wire and rows of tanks from the rest of the world'.
Mr Nunn said that 'because it had become a political issue and there were
local objections, we agreed to go back and recommend to President Clinton
that the joint exercise be held on US soil. This should take away the most
sensitive thing - because somehow the US is seen as victorious in the cold
war. That's the feeling that was expressed to us.'
The exercise, which would have included only 250 unarmed troops from both
sides, was designed for training in peacekeeping techniques - now
increasingly required by Russian military engaged in such missions in the
former Soviet states on its borders.
It had been agreed earlier this year in talks between Mr William Perry, US
defence secretary, and General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, but
has been a controversial issue in parliament ever since.
Mr Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the duma's foreign relations committee and a
former Russian ambassador to the US, said yesterday that partnership with
other countries, including the US, required 'delicacy and tact' because of a
growing feeling that 'national pride was being humbled'.

FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weighty note from BZW highlighting the fundamental valuation story drove
shares in the composite insurance sector forward.
The detailed piece of research, published annually, includes alternative
valuation models of normalised earnings and projected total returns in an
attempt to highlight the relative long term attractions of the stocks in the
sector.
Analysts Mr Trevor May and Mr Andrew Pitt at the investment bank conclude:
'Although there are disparities in the relative company ratings, we now
consider that the sector as a whole is cheap and rate all five composites a
buy.'
BZW was particularly keen on Royal Insurance, which it said was
fundamentally undervalued. The shares surged 8 ahead to 242p in trade of
2.5m, while Commercial Union hardened a penny to 525p.
The broker promoted Sun Alliance and General Accident to its buy list. The
former firmed 6 to 293p, on volume of 2.6m, after BZW said it stands to reap
returns from record 1994 underwriting margins; while the latter jumped 13 to
554p as the analysts pointed to its yield attractions.
Shares in engineering group Siebe moved sharply forward ahead of today's
figures, as analyst Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais Laing took the stock
off the sell list. The stock closed 21 ahead at 556p, with Kleinwort Benson,
the group's broker, also reported to have been recommending the shares.
Reports of a sign of an improvement in European car sales boosted GKN, a
leading components manufacturer and supplier to several car makers. The
shares gained 15 at 584p.
News of a Pounds 93m contract for its Balfour Beatty subsidiary lifted BICC
and the shares finished 4 1/2 firmer at 418p.
A profits warning from Hall Engineering saw the shares tumble 71 to 169p, to
make it the day's worst performing stock. The company said 1994 profits
would be worse than the previous year's because of a postponed contract and
pressures on steel margins. Hall reported a sharp increase in profits last
year from Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 8.56m.
British Steel eased a half-penny to 136p, with Nomura said to have urged
investors to sell the stock. Reports that engineering group FKI had
abandoned plans for a Pounds 400m US acquisition cheered the market. FKI put
on 2 at 182p.
Kingfisher weakened ahead of the company's agm today, with a variety of
concerns exercising dealers' minds.
Worries that trading at B&amp;Q, the home improvement business, had not picked
up, and that Woolworth would prove disappointing, were being dismissed by
the stock's supporters. However, even they were admitting to hoping for some
calming words today - which are likely to be accompanied by a more detailed
sales picture than normal - to steady the recently volatile share price.
Yesterday it closed 6 down at 543p.
UBS was reported to have increased its Next profits forecast, the shares
edging up a penny to 238p. Negative weekend press comment on Body Shop was
said to have contributed to a fall of 4 1/2 to 235 1/2 p.
Discount supermarket group Shoprite was the best performing stock in the
market as the shares jumped 10 per cent, with bargain hunters moving in
following last week's profits warning, which saw the stock virtually halve
in value. The shares added 9 at 89p.
Hotel group Forte gained 3 1/2 at 229p, with traders citing recent
institutional presentations, last week's positive agm and lingering hopes
that the bid for French chain Merdien will be successful. Weekend press
reports over plans to link up with the Savoy Group were dismissed as well
known within the market. Savoy shares receded 5 to 1020p.
In a quiet drinks sector, Bass proved to be the highlight, the shares
climbing 10 to 518p, with SG Warburg reported to be positive on the stock.
Among telecoms stocks, Vodafone was a strong feature, with US buying
combining with positive sentiment among UK analysts over the upcoming
subscriber figures for May. The shares moved forward 12 to 531p on moderate
turnover of 2.2m.
The regional electricity companies rode along with the volatilities in the
bond market, ending a weak session well below the market. Eastern declined 6
to 598p, London 6 to 564p and Midlands 10 to 595p.
Beazer Homes slipped 2 to 154p after announcing interim results largely in
line with market forecasts. The company was floated by Hanson with a price
tag of 165p in March.
The announcement of an oil discovery in Colombia by bid target Lasmo left
the market unimpressed. The shares eased 3 to 145p, on volume of 2.6m, on
the first closing day of Enterprise Oil's bid.

FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Printing group De La Rue was one of the few shades of blue on dealers'
screens in early trading after turning in a solid set of full-year results.
Underlying profits jumped 20 per cent to Pounds 123.3m, with analysts moving
their forecasts for the current year by around 8 per cent to a range of
Pounds 133m to 140m. The shares strengthened to close 16 up at 859p on 1.5m
traded.
Speculation over how the company intends to spend its cash pile,
particularly in the wake of the failed talks with Portals, was prominent
among dealers, although they added that criticism over De La Rue's handling
of the affair had adversely affected City opinion. Portals' shares continued
to suffer from the fallout of the aborted merger talks, dropping a further
10 to 643p.

FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA firm on Orly opening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Airways were strong, closing 8 ahead at 378p, with the
day's trading boosted by a broker's recommendation and news that France had
agreed to open its Orly airport to UK airlines.
France had previously resisted a European Union directive to open the
lucra-tive London to Orly route, a move which nearly provoked a
confrontation with the UK.
The recommendation came from long-time bull Strauss Turnbull, which said:
'The stock is a good recovery play. The yield is attractive and the rating
undemanding. Also, British Airways is well positioned to take advantage of
European deregulation.'
Full-year profits of Pounds 301m reported last week were at the top end of
expectations and saw the stock return to favour after a sustained period of
weakness.
Transport analyst Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss predicts profits for the
current year will jump by nearly 50 per cent to Pounds 450m.

FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures came under renewed selling pressure, taking their cue
from international bond markets, writes Steve Thompson.
A steady opening at 2,941 by the June contract on the FT-SE 100 quickly gave
way as big sellers moved into the market. This followed a slide in German
bunds and UK gilts after news that the Bundesbank had withdrawn the bund
issue scheduled for this month.
With selling pressure building up during the mid-morning period, June fell
sharply to trade at a discount of 30 points to the cash market, reaching a
low point of 2,901 around lunchtime. This level triggered substantial bear
closing and a squeeze developed. June was subsequently driven up to a
closing level of 2,959, a discount of 14.5 points to the cash market, with
sentiment helped by a better than expected opening on Wall Street.
Dealers described the market as extremely nervous and driven by worries of
increasing inflation in the US and the UK. Turnover in the June Footsie
future reached a heavy 21,246 contracts.
Traded options were dominated by the FT-SE 100 and Euro-FT-SE contracts,
which together accounted for 26,019 trades out of a total turnover of 38,302
lots.
J. Sainsbury was the most heavily traded stock option.

FT  01 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally after early
bond-induced setback - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further bout of substantial weakness in international bond markets led to
yet another turbulent trading session in UK equities yesterday, with share
prices fighting off waves of futures-induced weakness to finish marginally
higher on balance.
At the close of a difficult trading session, the FT-SE 100 Index was 4.1
firmer at 2,970.5. The final reading masked big swings in sentiment across
international markets still beset by worries about inflation pressures and
rising interest rates.
The latest slide in bond prices followed in the wake of the cancellation of
a June bund issue in Germany, hard on the heels of last week's cancelled
bund auction. The news stunned European bond and equity markets, which were
looking to open in good order after relatively steady performances during
the closure of US and London markets on Monday and after the heavy losses in
markets last week.
Adding to the UK market's discomfort was a report published by National
Westminster, the UK clearing bank, which forecast a rise in UK interest
rates to 5.75 per cent by the end of this year and to 6.75 per cent by
mid-1995. And sentiment was also affected by news that provisional MO money
supply in the UK rose by more than 7 per cent last month.
There were few signs of selling pressure when London marketmakers opened
their books for trading. Share prices were marked higher, reflecting the
relatively good per-formances from European bourses over the holiday period
and the encouraging move by the Tokyo market to a 1994 high.
The FT-SE 100 kicked off 10 points ahead at 2,976.4, seemingly in good
heart. Within five minutes, however, share prices were on the slide, upset
by rapidly falling bunds and gilts as the news of the cancelled German bund
issue became known. Plunging bonds - the German long bund was up  5/32 for
around five minutes before dropping like a stone - were the trigger for
another large-scale sell-off in the Footsie future, which fell to a discount
of some 30 points shortly after trading began.
There was very little evidence of actual selling in the cash market, where
marketmakers were obliged to chop their dealing prices as the future
continued to give way. At its worst, in mid-morning, the FT-SE 100 was down
41.4 at 2,925.0.
It then embarked on a sustained recovery, helped, dealers said, by a
substantial trading programme across the range of leading stocks. It
included heavy buy trades in stocks such as Cable and Wireless, Coats
Viyella, GEC, Ladbroke, Rolls-Royce, Sears, Smith &amp; Nephew, Tesco and Thorn
EMI.
With Wall Street opening only modestly easier - it moved into positive
territory shortly after London closed - the UK market stabilised and began
to rally in the wake of hurried bear closing.
Senior dealers remained extremely nervous about the market's ability to
rally further. 'The German bund looks sickly and will take gilts with it; I
am not convinced we'll be able to make worthwhile progress until the
European elections are out of the way and bonds are much more stable,' was
the view of the head of marketmaking at a leading UK investment bank. Others
took the view that last week's 5 per cent retreat was far enough and
discounted much of the potential bad news.
Turnover was a low 505.2m shares. Customer business value on Friday, when
the market came under severe pressure, was Pounds 1.08bn.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stocks mixed as data fail to
lift bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were mixed yesterday as a batch of weaker than expected economic
data failed to lift bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.23 better at 3,758.37, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 0.83 at 456.50. Declines on the New York SE
outpaced advances by 1,193 to 950 after modest volume of 216m shares. The
American SE composite slipped 0.49 to 440.45 but the Nasdaq composite
improved 2.05 to 735.19.
After the extended holiday weekend, the trading week opened with a barrage
of economic news, which mostly pointed to a moderating economic trend.
The Conference Board, an industry trade group, said its May index of
consumer confidence slipped after advancing in the previous two months.
The Commerce Department announced that personal income in April was up 0.4
per cent, a little less than expected, while personal spending dipped 0.1
per cent, against expectations of no change. New home sales in April showed
a 6.8 per cent decline.
None of these indicators of slower growth - a favourable development for
fixed-rate investments - could generate any enthusiasm among bond traders.
The US Treasury market was showing moderate losses near the end of the day,
as the market watched commodity and gold prices rise and European bonds
extend their losses.
A report showing Chicago's purchasing managers paying higher prices last
month was another negative factor. The data may have provided a preview of
today's critical National Association of Purchasing Management survey.
There is also concern in the financial markets over May employment data, due
out on Friday. A strong reading on non-farm payrolls could trigger a big
sell-off in bonds. Stocks are sure to follow.
Blue chips were down 15 Dow points near the opening, as equity investors
pondered the weakness in bonds. But share prices later recovered to near
their opening levels as the session progressed.
American Express showed the best gain among the Dow components, up Dollars 1
5/8 at Dollars 27 5/8: the company completed the distribution of 98.2m
shares of Lehman Brothers (off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 18), finishing the
spin-off of the investment banking firm. McDonald's added Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 62 1/8 on the heels of announcing a two-for-one stock split and a
heftier dividend. Merck was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 62,
On the downside, Walt Disney shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 1/4 and Union
Carbide lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 27.
Blockbuster Entertainment, whose proposed takeover by Viacom has become
uncertain, was near the top of the NYSE's most active list. It rose Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 on volume of 3.2m shares after Robertson Stephens &amp;
Company lifted its rating on the issue. Two entertainment software companies
also announced a marketing pact with the video rental chain.
Bombay, a home-furnishing retailer, jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 7/8
after posting a 23 per cent increase in May sales for stores opened at least
a year.
CBS suffered a further fall in the aftermath of last week's announcement
that several television stations were switching their affiliation to the Fox
network. The issue dropped Dollars 8 7/8 to Dollars 261.

end-of-month portfolio adjustments.
The IPC index of 37 top shares lost 1.68 points at 2,483.73. It rose to
2,498.74 initially before falling back due to technical resistance at the
2,500 level.
Turnover amounted to 93.72m shares, of which 54m corresponded to the heavily
weighted Telefonos de Mexico, whose 'A' and 'L' shares both ended up 0.19
per cent.
In the broader market falling issues outscored advances by 46 to 38.
Declining issues were led by Grupo Financiero Interacciones 'B' shares, down
9.21 per cent, followed by rival group Internacional BCP series, which slid
4.98 per cent, Autlan 'A' shares, off 4.61 per cent, and Apasco 'A' shares,

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil rises through resistance
barriers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Sao Paulo closed 1.6 per cent higher after moderate trade on
selective portfolio-squaring by institutional investors in blue chips and
major second-tier stocks at the end of the month.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares added 388 points at 24,672.
Turnover was Cr406.1bn (Dollars 216.5m).
A senior broker said: 'We noted a lot of equity and pension fund managers
buying after the market broke some resistance barriers earlier today.'
Brokers commented that optimism remained high ahead of the adoption of the
country's new currency on July 1 which could pave the way for a significant
drop in the 45 per cent monthly inflation level.
They added that a forecast rise in consumer spending, taken together with
lower export tariffs, were also expected to boost cyclical shares, such as
retail and mining companies.
Smith Barney Shearson has initiated coverage of Cemig, the electric utility,
with a neutral, speculative risk rating. The broker said it believed that
the company had a good potential, but maintained a neutral weight because of
the country's general economic and political uncertainty.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying noted as
Nikkei hits third new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by foreign investors and some domestic financial institutions left
equities with a third day of gains after a strong close, writes Robert
Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 134.62 up at 20,973.59, its third new high for
the year in as many days. At one point in the early afternoon a rally sent
the index above 21,000 to a day's peak of 21,048.61, where it encountered
heavy selling pressure from Japanese non-financial corporations. The low for
the session was 20,857.07.
Volume eased from 594.8m shares to an estimated 530m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained 4.17 at 1,682.50, while the Nikkei 300 firmed
0.61 to 307.79. In the first section, rises led declines by 691 to 329, with
164 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.51 at
1,391.93.
Most heavy electricals continued to advance, Hitachi adding Y10 at Y1,080
and Toshiba Y7 at Y845, but Mitsubishi Electric lost Y9 at Y688.
Major industrials and shipbuilders were mixed. Kawasaki Steel, once again
the day's most active issue, moved up Y3 to Y426 on a volume of 15,450
shares. Kawasaki Heavy Industries rose Y2 to Y477.
The morning's trading started on a quiet note. With markets in London and
New York closed on Monday, fewer foreign investors were active.
The market heated up in the early afternoon, fuelled by very large buy
orders from a foreign brokerage house for leading stocks. Other dealers
followed suit, stepping up their purchases. The more positive tone of the
market was largely a reaction to projections of corporate profitability in
the current fiscal year, and to Monday's release of stronger than expected
industrial output figures for April.
Most foreign analysts continued to maintain a bullish stance. Mr Rod Smyth
of Baring Securities argued that the combination of positive economic data
released in the last two days with the technical strength of the market made
a breakout above 21,000 'only a matter of time'. But some analysts pointed
to the continued absence of individual investors as a negative factor
weighing on the market.
In Osaka the OSE average rose 104.04 to 23,162.36 as volume of 38.2m shares
topped Monday's 35.9m.
Roundup
The Monday closure of US markets had a dampening affect on activity
yesterday.
HONG KONG was firmer in muted trading, with the Hang Seng index ahead 29.93
at 9,553.56 but down from the day's high of 9,568.78. Turnover slipped to
HKDollars 3.1bn from the previous day's HKDollars 3.5bn.
Property issues remained strong following recent weakness, with Cheung Kong
and Henderson Land both rising 50 cents to HKDollars 39 and HKDollars 41
respectively.
San Miguel, the Philippine-based brewer, shed 10 cents to HKDollars 6.85 on
news that it had sold its site in Hong Kong for HKDollars 3.5bn to Wheelock
Properties, up 20 cents at HKDollars 19.
China Light saw brisk European-led buying push the shares up HKDollars 1.25
to HKDollars 43.
MANILA gained 2.6 per cent, with San Miguel leading the way on news of the
property sale in Hong Kong. The composite index advanced 79.38 to 3,030.77
as San Miguel 'A' shares jumped 7.3 per cent to 102 pesos and the 'B' stock
2.2 per cent to 141 pesos. PLDT climbed 30 pesos, or 1.6 per cent, to 1,940
pesos.
Turnover slipped to 1.2bn pesos from Monday's 1.3bn.
TAIPEI fell on profit-taking following rises over the past two days. The
weighted index was finally down 42.94 at 5,891.56 after an earlier high of
5,960. Turnover was TDollars 53.96bn.
Paper shares were the worst hit: Wan Yu receded 80 cents to TDollars 23.60
and Cheng Loong 70 cents to TDollars 37.30.
In the electronics sector, Acer declined TDollars 1 to TDollars 64, while
United Microelectronics went against the trend with a rise of TDollars 2 to
TDollars 104.50.
KUALA LUMPUR slipped back as volume hit the year's lowest point at just 50m
shares. The composite index ended off 4.00 at 996.11. Lion Land retreated 13
cents to MDollars 2.77 on profit-taking after sharp gains last week.
SINGAPORE eased on light selling of blue chips, the Straits Times Industrial
index declining 24.22 to 2,281.67.
SEOUL retreated for the third consecutive session in reduced volume as
manufacturing stocks continued to consolidate. The composite index lost 6.15
at 939.49.
SYDNEY was lower in the absence of major corporate news. The All Ordinaries
index dipped 10.0 to 2,081.8 in light turnover of ADollars 354m.
CSR, the building products, aluminium and sugar group, remained under
pressure, falling a further 13 cents to ADollars 4.80, in spite of
announcing strong earnings results on Monday. Analysts commented that
investors were disappointed by dividend tax considerations.
BOMBAY declined as profits were taken, particularly in the heavily weighted
ITC and Reliance Industries late in the session. The BSE index relinquished
4.99 to 3,823.06.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Vacillations leave US equities higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vacillations in New York bond markets, successively depressed by
interest rate worries, lifted by the US Treasury bond auction and dropped
again by an upward revision in GDP data, actually left US equities higher
last week as Europe fell 4 per cent. Kleinwort Benson strategist Mr Albert
Edwards says strong global growth will continue to drive up bond yields and
that investors have yet to realise that the transfer of manufactured
production to the Pacific Rim will exacerbate the inflation upturn over the
next few years.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cyclicals top Dax performers
despite correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of bourses staged intraday recoveries as selling pressure ran out
of steam, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was weak again at the outset after a sharp drop in bond prices,
but short-covering left the Dax index with a 9.55 gain at 2,127.70; by the
end of the post-bourse it had risen another 10 points to an Ibis-indicated
2,137.74.
Turnover increased from DM5.1bn to DM6.7bn. The Dax lost 5.3 per cent in
May, precisely what it had gained in April, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck
Finck in Dusseldorf. It suffered most of all, he said, from weakness in US
bonds and the correction in cyclicals from mid-month following a double top
in low volume.
However, extended weakness in carmakers did not prevent them leading the Dax
top performers for the first five months of 1994: BMW, ex- rights, down a
net DM7 yesterday at DM820, was up 13.6 per cent this year; and Volkswagen,
DM1.50 lower at DM484.50, still 10.1 per cent to the good. The two leaders
were ahead by 24.8 and 19.5 per cent respectively after the first four
months.
The mid-May corollary, a switch into defensive stocks, was ruined for banks
by bond market weakness. Bayerische Vereinsbank, Dresdner and Bayernhypo all
showed the strain, leading the Dax losers with falls of 21.2 per cent, 19.1
per cent and 18.2 per cent in the five months to May.
PARIS remained uneasy, with the CAC-40 index at one point falling to an
inter-session low of 2,013.61, before finding fresh support on the opening
of Wall Street. The CAC-40 index ended the day down 22.61, or 1 per cent, at
2,029.90, with equities continuing to be pressured by futures. The expiry of
the May futures contract yesterday also added an extra dimension to the
day's volatility.
Turnover improved to FFr4.5bn from Monday's FFr1.6bn.
According to Nikko Europe, US investors have been seen recently switching
out of cyclicals and into the financial sector.
Schneider, off FFr9.40 at FFr390.50, remained beset by uncertainty among
investors following the arrest in Belgium last week of its chairman. After
the shares had been suspended briefly, the group issued a statement denying
any allegations of financial wrongdoing.
ZURICH adopted the recent German attitude towards cyclicals, taking profits
as pressure on the domestic bond market and from weakness in equities abroad
left the SMI index down 20.0 at 2,722.9.
Among cyclicals, BBC Brown Boveri lost SFr20 at SFr1,260, Georg Fischer
SFr30 at SFr1,480 and Sulzer registered SFr28 at SFr928; Alussuise, the
metals company which forecast substantial recovery this year after hours,
fell with the pack, shedding SFr9 to SFr658.
Here, too, the financial sector offered little relief. Among insurers,
Winterthur fell SFr22 to SFr690 although it produced a first quarter rise of
9 per cent in premium income, and was bullish about 1994.
MILAN recovered from an early fall with the Comit index hovering close to
the 720 support level before picking up again on technical buying.
The Comit index finished down 4.19 at 731.31.
The day's main feature was Mediobanca, up L225 at L15,950 following
confirmation that a number of leading executives, including the honorary
president Mr Enrico Cuccia, were under investigation in relation to the
bank's role in the structuring of Ferruzzi. Observers said that the news had
been in the market for some days, which explained the upward movement in the
shares.
AMSTERDAM also recovered later in the day, having earlier fallen through the
400 level for the first time since December 1993 as the equity market came
under renewed pressure from bonds. The AEX index ended off 1.65 at 400.77,
having seen a session low of 397.26.
One of the day's main features was a Fl 2.30 drop in DSM, the chemicals
group, to Fl 134.00 on news that it was buying for an undisclosed figure the
outstanding 40 per cent share in Curver Rubbermaid from Rubbermaid of the US
that it did not own.
Elsewhere KLM retreated a further 90 cents to Fl 51.30 ahead of tomorrow's
fourth quarter results.
MADRID, yet again, spiced a desolate platter of blue chips with big rises in
speculative stocks, Amper and Prima Inmobiliaria, the property company, each
rising about 15 per cent - by Pta71 to Pta546, and by Pta30 to Pta232.
The general index closed down 3.81 at 327.00 in moderate turnover of
Pta25bn. Some brokers were beginning to see danger in the speculators'
attachment to secondary issues.
STOCKHOLM led the way down in a mostly weak Nordic sector, the Affarsvarlden
General index losing 27.10, or 1.8 per cent at 1,479.00. However, COPENHAGEN
recovered dramatically after an equally severe intraday decline with the KFX
index a token 0.02 higher at 100.95, buyers coming back and an almost
euphoric mood in evidence.
ATHENS stayed in volatile form, the general index rising 14.77, or 1.75 to
860.10 on buying in the recently embattled construction sector.
WARSAW eased in mixed trade, the Wig index falling 182.9, or 1.5 per cent to
12,036.7. Elektrim, the trading company, fell 10 per cent after yesterday's
20 per cent cut in its rights issue price.
TEL AVIV dropped again after the central bank indicated a small decline in
economic activity, the Mishtanim index closing 7.21, or 3.7 per cent lower
at 187.61.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Currencies subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges took a back seat yesterday, with market attention focused
on the weakness in UK and German interest rate markets, writes Philip
Gawith.
The focus of activity was the short sterling futures, where a combination of
factors caused prices, especially in the longer contracts, to fall sharply.
The dollar had a quiet day with the market constrained from selling the US
currency, following weak economic data, by fears of central bank
intervention. It finished in London at DM1.6435 from DM1.6444 and against
the yen at Y104.655 from Y104.400. It closed in New York at DM1.6458 and
Y104.78.
The D-Mark had a mixed day in Europe, while the sterling index closed at 80
after finishing on Friday at 79.8.
The bearish performance of the futures markets, particularly short sterling,
laid further to rest any recent optimism that sentiment in the market might
have turned. The December contract ended at 93.59, down 19 basis points from
the Friday close. Most of the longer contracts were off by more than 25
basis points.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, described the market as a
'bloodbath', with lots of distress selling. The volumes were not especially
large - the December contract traded nearly 34,000 lots - but prices moved a
lot.
Weakness in Eurosterling was a spillover from bearish sentiment in the gilts
market. Traders cited a number of factors as contributing to this: weekend
newspaper reports that the Treasury had upward revised its growth forecast
for 1994 to 3 per cent; rumours about a rise in the pricing component of the
May purchasing managers' survey; and the M0 measure of money supply growing
by 7.1 per cent in the year to May, compared to a government range of nil to
4 per cent.
Traders said investors were also clearing up end of month positions and this
contributed to price movements.
Movement in the futures market was not reflected in the cash markets, with
three-month interbank sterling quoted at 5 3/16 -5 1/8 , after Friday's 5
3/16 -5 1/16 . Mr Phillips said the failure of traders to arbitrage the
markets suggested either that they were nursing heavy losses, or that their
attention was elsewhere. In this regard, he said the hedge funds, previously
very active in these markets, had recently been 'noticeable by their
absence'.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said the weakness in
interest rate markets seemed to be related to the recent trend of hedge fund
investment in commodity markets. This triggered a rise in commodity prices,
which then fed over into the sale of bond futures as markets expressed
concern that higher commodity prices meant higher inflation in future.
Sterling had an uneventful day, closing at DM2.4846 against the D-Mark from
DM2.4806. Against the dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5118 from Dollars 1.5086.
Mr Norfield said the interest rates discounted in the futures markets
increasingly favoured sterling and this was supporting the UK currency.
The December contracts, for example, project UK three-month money to be 128
basis points above German money by the end of the year. By December 1995
that gap has jumped to 251 basis points.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 771m of
assistance after forecasting a Pounds 750m shortage. Overnight money traded
in the 3 to 5 per cent range.
In German money markets, call money rose to 5.75/5.95 per cent, near to the
6 per cent Lombard rate ceiling, as a temporary outflow resulting from
pension payments caused a cash squeeze. Call money was at 5/5.25 per cent on
Monday.
The Bundesbank has again announced a variable rate repo, and the market is
expecting a fall of about five basis points at today's allocation, from 5.20
per cent.
The dollar had a quiet day, unmoved by a weaker than expected set of
economic data. Among the figures released, April personal consumption
expenditure declined by 0.1 per cent, consumer confidence fell to 87.6 in
May and new single-family home sales dipped in April by 6.8 per cent.
Commenting on the data, Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank, said:
'What we are seeing is the pace of economic growth slowing in response to
tax increases and a rise in long-term interest rates since last October.'
Most analysts believe the market would like to take the dollar lower, but is
wary of the central banks.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said that for
intervention to have a significant and sustainable effect, 'the market will
need to be short of dollars, which currently does not appear to be the
case'.
The two weak currencies of Europe, the Greek drachma and the Portuguese
escudo, had quieter days. Against the D-Mark, the escudo closed at Es103.7
from Es104 and the drachma was fixed at Dr148.100 from Dr147.970 at the
previous fix. The German currency closed at FFr3.419 from FFr3.417 against
the French franc, and against the lira at L968.2 from L967.4.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Softs take off in US and London
on Chicago rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corn and soyabean futures prices at the Chicago Board of Trade surged by
their allowable daily limits just after the opening yesterday, triggering a
renewed rally in soft commodities in the US and London after last week's
profit-taking.
Chicago traders sent prices up in response to an absence of rain in the main
midwestern crop areas over the long holiday weekend. The National Weather
Service on Friday issued 30-day and 90-day forecasts that predicted
near-normal moisture patterns in the midwest. But traders are reacting to
short-term dry weather because of a shortfall in last year's US crop.
'It's still May and we've already had two weather scares,' said Mr Vic
Lespinasse, a Dean Witter Reynolds trader, referring to a similar jump in
grain prices on Monday last week. 'The market is reacting to every little
worry.'
Last Tuesday, Chicago grain markets tumbled back down again, setting off
long-awaited profit-taking in other softs.
At midday yesterday, July soyabean futures were up the maximum allowable 30
cents per bushel at Dollars 6.73 3/4 . Trading had halted. November Maize
futures were up by their 12 cent limit at Dollars 2.78 3/4 per bushel.
Investment and hedge funds have bought heavily into commodities in recent
weeks, feeding a general buying spree that started with coffee futures. The
early excitement in Chicago yesterday spilled over into silver and gold in
New York, and into coffee and cocoa.
'It's just a technical, speculative binge that we're seeing here,' said Mr
Bill O'Neill, analyst with Merrill Lynch.
He underlined that the coffee market had strong fundamental support from the
supply shortage. The July arabica contract in New York was up 5.10 cents in
afternoon trading at 126.40 cents a pound.
In London, robusta coffee futures had a strong day, but with bouts of
profit-taking and very thin volume, which left traders nervous. The July
futures contract closed Dollars 132 higher at Dollars 2,118 a tonne. Last
week the price plunged by over Dollars 360 a tonne from its seven-year peak
of Dollars 2,348.
London cocoa futures picked up strongly, with July Pounds 39 higher at
Pounds 1,027 a tonne.
Against the trend, nickel prices tumbled on the London Metals Exchange
following the weekend agreement on a new contract between Inco, the world's
second-largest nickel producer, and labour leaders at its Sudbury, Ontario,
metals complex. Three-month nickel closed Dollars 102.50 a tonne lower at
Dollars 6,325.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold fever returns to Ghana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ghana, once called the Gold Coast, is going through the third gold mining
boom in its history and its output of the precious metal will reach 2m troy
ounces in 1996, according to Mr Godfried 'Geo' Kesse, who recently retired
after 20 years as director of the Ghana geological survey. He was also an
adviser to the minerals commission and a director of Ghana's state gold
mining corporation.
Since its first gold rush started in 1880, Ghana has produced at least 41m
ounces but output dropped to an all-time low of 280,000 ounces in 1982-83.
Then a new government launched an economic recovery programme, changed the
mining laws and made other moves to attract foreign capital into mining in
Ghana.
These changes, and the country's relative political stability, encouraged
phenomenal growth in the past seven years, Mr Kesse points out in a paper
prepared for the Investment in Mining conference in New York this week.
In a country where no new gold mines had been brought into production since
1940, six have been opened since 1988. And at least USDollars 800m has been
invested in the gold sector alone with 66 Ghanaian and 19 foreign companies
being issued with prospecting licences (mainly for gold) and 10 companies
winning mining leases.
Gold output surged to 1.2m ounces last year and is on track to reach 2m
ounces in 1996. Much of the production will still come from Ashanti Gold
Fields, recently privatised by the Ghanaian government, with the rest coming
from new projects and big expansion and rehabilitation programmes at other
mines, says Mr Kesse, 61, who was awarded his geology degrees at
universities in California.
He has now joined the Ghanaian gold rush as chairman of African Star
Resources which has a 76 sq km concession near the Ashanti mine at Obuasi.
African Star's parent company, Pacific Comox of Canada, recently raised
CDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.8m) which will mainly be spent on the Andansi
Asaasi project where there are old underground workings developed between
1900 and 1930.
'There are 1,000 feet of underground workings but there has never been any
drilling or geophysical work,' says Mr Douglas MacQuarrie, president of
Pacific Comex.
African Star is also participating in an initial 16,000 sq km airborne
geophysical survey, the first high-resolution survey ever carried out in
Ghana. It will cover most of the gold bearing greenstone belt in south
western Ghana.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Twenty years of oil for Cote
d'Ivoire - Two offshore fields could bring self-sufficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Meridien Corporation, a US-based company, is developing two offshore
oil and gas fields which by early next year would make Cote d'Ivoire
self-sufficient in oil and supply natural gas to its expanding energy and
power sectors.
UMC, in partnership with the Ivoirian state oil company Petroci, has tested
14,000 barrels of oil a day, with enough reserves to supply the whole
country for the next 20 years, at the Lion One field, over a well drilled by
Philips Petroleum in the 1980s. The well also has a large volume of
associated natural gas.
UMC has also tested 30m cubic feet a day of natural gas and 732 barrels a
day of condensate at its Panther One field.
UMC expects to complete negotiations with the Ivoirian government for a gas
supply contract end-user by June, although the end-user is not yet known.
Associated gas cannot be separated from the oil, so if there is no gas
contract by January, the gas from the Lion field would have to be flared,
which is environmentally damaging and a waste of resources.
Compagnie des Energies Nouvelles de Cote d'Ivoire (Cenci), a French-led
consortium, also plans to supply gas but has so far failed to find finance
to develop its offshore gas field, Foxtrot. Partners in Cenci include SAUR,
the local subsidiary of Electricite de France and the French construction
firm Bouygues; Petroci; and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
A spokesman for UMC says that that there is enough domestic gas demand for
both its own and Cenci's projects.
Cote d'Ivoire's electricity is very expensive and the power generation
sector is trying to reduce both its costs and eliminate its imports. A large
part of its electricity is imported from Ghana's big hydro-electric plant
and it relies on energy imported from Nigeria for its local generation. The
proposed nickel mine near the north-western border with Liberia, which a
Canadian group plans to develop, would need 100 MW of power. Gas is also
needed for the state's 50,000 barrels a day oil refinery at Vridi near
Abidjan.
UMC signed production sharing agreements for its two fields with the
government in late 1992, after amendments to Cote d'Ivoire's antiquated
mineral laws, under terms which it says are favourable for both sides and
will encourage further oil exploration and production.
'We believe there are several other exciting prospects along the coast of
Cote d'Ivoire and are negotiating for more blocks,' said a company spokesman
in Abidjan.
UMC is also carrying out seismic testing for oil in Equatorial Guinea and
will start drilling later this year.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper miners need to raise
Dollars 10bn by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International copper miners require more than USDollars 10bn by the year
2000 for projects which have been announced but for which funding has not
yet been secured, according to an analysis by the MetalsFinance newsletter.
It suggests that the scale of demand for capital means not all mines will
obtain immediate financing.
'Developments are likely to be tiered according to their level of project,
political and economic risk, among other factors. It is unlikely that
projects in southern Africa will be developed ahead of mines in Latin
America, while deposits in the Commonwealth of Independent States also face
near-term uncertainty,' it adds.
According to the newsletter, Latin American projects are seeking a total of
Dollars 6.555bn, Africa requires 'a conservative' Dollars 2.5bn, while
smaller amounts will go to Australia and North America.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US likely to boost world demand
for coarse grains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World consumption of coarse grains could rise by about 19m tonnes in 1994/95
on growing demand from the US, the International Wheat Council said in its
latest grain market report.
'Although the declining trend is likely to continue in the former Soviet
Union, a significant upturn is expected in the US,' it said.
Growing livestock industries would also increase demand for coarse grains in
developing countries, particularly in Asia, where their use for all purposes
'could set a new record'.
However, early calculations of consumption of 840m tonnes depended on a good
US harvest. 'Should the latter fall significantly below expectations,
consumption would drop because of the limited volume of existing supplies in
exporting countries,' it said. Stocks at the end of 1993/94 were estimated
to be only 111m tonnes.
The IWC forecasts 1994 world production of coarse grains at 837m tonnes, up
48m tonnes on last year. 'Although crops are expected to decline or show
little change in most countries, output should be boosted by a recovery in
the US and another large harvest in China.'
No recovery in demand is expected this year from Russia, where animal
numbers and meat consumption have dropped in recent years.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kennecott makes large Canadian
diamond find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The emerging diamond field in Canada's Northwest Territories has been
further extended with a substantial discovery by a joint venture led by
Kennecott, a subsidiary of the UK's RTZ group.
Kennecott's Canadian partner, Aber Resources, said that it has recovered 154
stones from a 155kg sample taken from its Diavik property, about 350km
north-east of Yellowknife.
The property is on the southern boundary of the Lac de Gras area in which
Australia's BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner, Dia Met Minerals, have
already made substantial discoveries.
BHP and Dia Met are presently analysing bulk ore samples from their property
before deciding whether to build North America's first diamond mine on the
site.
Their confidence that the CDollars 400m project will go ahead is reflected
in talks which have already begun with the Northwest Territories government
on environmental permits and financial arrangements for a mine. BHP believes
the property could be in production by 1997.
Aber stressed that its discovery was concentrated in a single kimberlite
pipe. Of the 154 stones, 38 had a diameter of more than 0.5mm. However, it
said that preliminary results from another pipe also pointed to the presence
of diamonds.
The Kennecott/Aber discovery has given another push to the surge in share
prices of companies involved in the NWT diamond rush.
Aber gained 88 cents to CDollars 8.25 in early trading on the Toronto stock
exchange yesterday, after jumping by CDollars 2 on Monday afternoon,
following the announcement of its find. Dia Met was also higher.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Germany leads decline in European prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haunted by continued fears of resurgent inflation, European government bonds
took another dive yesterday.
Germany again led the decline but outperformed the rest of Europe on the
basis of its perceived 'safe-haven' status. Neighbouring markets' yield
spreads over bunds widened further and several long-dated bond futures
contracts hit new lows for the year.
Although traders cited a number of reasons for the slide, 'what is behind
the declines is that there are just no end-investors willing to buy here',
said Mr Mike Gallagher, director of economic research at IDEA.
Although bonds could stage brief corrections near-term, 'the market won't
find a sustainable bottom until investors come in at bargain-basement
levels,' he said.
German bonds slumped early in the day when the June bund futures contract
breached key technical support at 93.30. Shortly thereafter, the Bundesbank
announced that a widely-expected issue of long-dated bunds would not take
place because of the government's good cash position. This gave the bund
future a brief fillip, but it soon resumed its slide, falling as low as
92.62.
While the removal of fresh supply offered some relief, many dealers were
disappointed by the cancellation of the bund.
UK gilts were one of the day's worst casualties, sliding on data showing M0
money supply rising by a provisionally adjusted 7.1 per cent in the year to
end-May.
'People fear the worst - they have no confidence inflation can stay low
because this country has one of the worst track records,' said Mr Ifty
Islam, international strategist at Merrill Lynch. 'It may take months of
subdued RPI numbers to show that inflation is not going out of control.'
Talk that today's UK purchasing managers' survey for May would show a rise
in producer prices put further pressure on prices. The long gilt futures
contract fell 1 to 100 23/32 .
'If it goes through 100, there's very little support until 98,' said Mr Mark
Reckless, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. The UK 10-year yield spread
over Germany widened to 185 basis points, from 173 points on Friday.
French bonds followed bunds lower, but were also weighed down by the
prospect of some FFr20bn of new bonds on Thursday. 'There's no one around to
absorb that supply,' said one dealer. The notional June future on Matif fell
by 1.00 point to 117.72.
The Italian market was also dogged by supply, having to absorb L3,500bn in
new 10 and 30-year bonds, where the yield rose sharply from the previous
auctions. The June BTP future ended around 108.17, down 1.25 points.
Danish and Swedish bonds were hammered by heavy foreign selling, dealers
said. Denmark is weighed down by inflation worries amid a strong economic
recovery, and both are clouded by election fears. The Danish yield spread
over Germany widened to 113 from 89 basis points last Friday; the Swedish
yield gap widened to 243 from 208 basis points.
US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday as a bearish tone set in ahead of this
week's crucial economic data.
Late in the session, the 30-year government bond was  11/32 lower at 86 1/32
, yielding 7.42 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16
at 99 3/4 , to yield 5.993 per cent.
The morning brought a barrage of economic news, most of which pointed to
slower growth, a favourable development for inflation-sensitive bonds.
However, Treasuries were moderately lower across the board in light
activity, as commodity and gold prices showed fresh strength and declines in
European bonds showed no signs of abating.
Among the day's economic reports, the Conference Board, an industry trade
group, said that consumer confidence had ebbed in May, after growing in the
previous two months.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported personal income in April had
risen 0.4 per cent, in line with expectations, while personal spending had
dipped 0.1 per cent, against forecasts of no change. April new homes sales
showed a 6.8 per cent decline from March.
No single piece of data had much impact, although traders were surely
unsettled by the monthly survey of Chicago's purchasing managers.
This month, the regional index of business activity showed a slight drop
from April but the index of prices paid by purchasing managers jumped from
59.8 to 63.6. The gain could presage higher inflation in coming months.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Focus remains on the short end with
issues worth Dollars 800m

The short end of the eurodollar sector remained in focus yesterday with the
launch of four issues worth a total of Dollars 800m. They followed the
successful short-dated offering last week by AT&amp;T.
Dealers said yesterday's deals provided the issuers with good opportunities
to swap into other currencies and appealed in particular to Swiss retail
investors who were overweight in the US currency.
'It's an arbitrage play and as long as swap spreads remain at these levels
this part of the yield curve will remain attractive,' said one dealer.
The best reception was given to the Dollars 250m offering of three-year
paper by Australia's Export Finance and Insurance Corp (Efic). Traders said
the yield spread of 20 basis points above the equivalent Treasuries was a
reasonable reflection of the group's double-A rating, although some
suggested that the name was not sufficiently well-known to attract
substantial demand.
ABB Finance raised Dollars 200m of debt with a similar maturity and coupon
as Efic and book-runner Goldman Sachs priced it to yield 16 basis points
above Treasuries. It was also targeted at Swiss investors but rivals claimed
it was priced too aggressively and the electrical engineering group did not
have the appeal of big US and Japanese corporate names such as Toyota, GECC
and AT&amp;T.
The Dollars 200m three-year issue from Landesbank Schleswig Holstein, priced
to yield 20 basis points over Treasuries, was also treated with some
scepticism. But BZW, which lead-managed the issue, said the pricing was
sufficiently generous, considering that the yield on AT&amp;T's deal was now
five basis points below Treasuries. It added that although the spread had
widened to 23 basis points, LB Schleswig Holstein was the most highly-rated
of the day's three biggest dollar issuers.
Finally, the Council of Europe offered Dollars 150m of two-year bonds and
Rabobank Nederland offered CDollars 100m of three-year debt.
There was also a flurry of yen-denominated issues yesterday with Mitsubishi
Estate, the property arm of the Japanese trading group, topping the list
with an offering of Y35m of six-year debt and Y20bn of eight-year paper.
Both issues were targeted at Japanese institutions.
In Japan, Mitsubishi Corporation, the country's biggest trading house,
raised Y200bn in five-year bonds, the largest domestic bond issue of its
kind, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The issue topped the previous record, a Y150bn issue by Tokyo Electric
Power, and will give a boost to Japan's fledgling corporate bond market
which has been struggling to free itself from regulation.
Over the past year, the market has been opened to a wider range of issuers
and restrictions on floating-rate notes have been lifted.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: OM to concentrate on core
activities
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OM Group, a Swedish company which runs derivatives exchanges in Stockholm
and London, is selling its financing businesses and dropping plans to
participate in founding a new Swedish bank in order to concentrate on core
exchange and clearing operations.
OM, operator of the OM Stockholm exchange and the OMLX exchange in London,
said the surprise decision to restructure was prompted by the dramatic
recent growth in volume of derivatives traded.
'We can see steady growth in the exchange and clearing business for
derivatives, not least in London. With all the discussion going on about the
risks, we think the demand for centralised clearing will grow,' Mr Olof
Stenhammar, OM's founder and chief executive, told the Financial Times.
He said that the combined daily volumes at OM Stockholm and the OMLX had
jumped from 97,000 contracts in December to 135,000 contracts in May, with
the daily value of clearing operations rising from SKr50bn to SKr70bn in the
same period.
OM Group, founded in the mid-1980s, is listed on the Stockholm Stock
Exchange. Its biggest shareholder is the powerful Wallenberg family, which
holds a 21 per cent stake.
Mr Stenhammar, who remains under investigation by the country's state
prosecutor for insider trading allegations, which he strongly denies, owns 7
per cent.
OM had intended to extend its interests in finance activities to founding a
bank called Tre Kronor Bank in a joint project with a state pension fund and
AFS, a financial services arm of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering giant. But Mr Stenhammar said this no longer fitted with group
strategy.
OM said the sale of its OM Finans division, which it hopes to complete by
the end of this year, would increase its equity to assets ratio to around 70
per cent from 54 per cent at present.
AFS and the pension fund issued a joint statement saying the Tre Kronor Bank
project would no longer go ahead, despite initial approval from the banking
authorities.

<TEXT>
Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third-biggest bank, had second-quarter net
profits of CDollars 187m (USDollars 135m) or 76 cents a share, excluding
special charges, up from CDollars 172m or 71 cents a year earlier.
Return on average assets was 0.66 per cent against 0.72 per cent, and on
equity 13.5 per cent against 14.2 per cent.
The bank took special after-tax charges of CDollars 305m relating to the
purchase of Montreal Trust and the write-down of goodwill for another
acquisition.
First-half earnings were CDollars 384m, up 14 per cent, but after the
charges were CDollars 79m, or 15 cents, against CDollars 337m, or CDollars
1.41, a year earlier. Total assets at April 30 were CDollars 127bn, up 27.5
per cent, largely due to the Montreal Trust acquisition and the impact of
the lower Canadian dollar.
Net interest income was little changed, but non-interest income rose 29 per
cent, due to strong brokerage and investment banking revenues. Non-interest
expenses rose 41.5 per cent with the addition of Montreal Trust's costs.
The total loan-loss provision for fiscal 1994 is CDollars 567m.
Non-performing loans were down to CDollars 2.08bn on April 30.

<TEXT>
Bangkok Land, Thailand's biggest property company which is controlled by the
Sino-Thai Kanjanapas family, reported a disappointing 3 per cent rise in
consolidated net profits to Bt5.028bn (Dollars 199m) for the year to
end-March.
Profits fell to Bt763m in the last quarter from Bt1.354bn in the third
quarter.
Sales for the year are likely to be down by some 30 per cent to around
Bt11.5bn, compared with Bt16.8bn in 1993, according to Bangkok property
analysts. Earnings per share rose to Bt8.38 from Bt8.11.
'Either Land was struggling in the last quarter or it was saving profits to
buttress next year's profits, when new accounting rules could squeeze the
profits of many property companies,' said Mr Neil Semple, research manager
at HG Asia in Bangkok.
The new rules will force property companies to set aside 20 per cent before
they start to book profits, compared with the current 10 per cent.
Tanayong, Bangkok Land's sister company, which is also controlled by the
Kanjanapas family, reported a 31 per cent fall in unconsolidated net profit
to Bt434.4m for the year, compared with Bt647.4m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enel, Italy's state-owned electricity utility, yesterday announced record
profits for 1993, in preparation for privatisation, possibly before the end
of this year.
The group, which is directly owned by the Italian treasury, reported a net
profit of L344bn (Dollars 216m), compared with L234bn in 1992, after
depreciation of L6,152bn against L6,129bn a year earlier.
The gross operating margin in the group's industrial operations increased by
3.7 per cent against the background of a 0.4 per cent increase in sales and
unchanged tariffs during 1993. The group said that its costs had been
reduced by 4.3 per cent in the year, or 8.6 per cent in real terms.
Investment in power stations during the year was 14 per cent lower than the
previous year at L8,749bn, but the group said this was due to the difficulty
of getting permission for new construction and the poor economic situation.
The group said that the results showed Enel was economically healthy,
efficient and with good growth prospects, elements which would lead to a
successful sell-off.

Rising deliveries of its 50-passenger regional jet and strong demand for
snow-mobiles and watercraft brought a 33.7 per cent gain in first-quarter
net profit for Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport equipment
group. Sales rose 27 per cent.
Bombardier earned CDollars 52.4m (USDollars 37.9m), or 31 cents a share,
against CDollars 39.2m or 25 cents a year earlier, on sales of CDollars
1.17bn against CDollars 993m.
The strong start to fiscal 1995 followed a 30 per cent profits gain in
fiscal 1994 to CDollars 175.6m, or CDollars 1.12, from CDollars 132.8m, or
85 cents.
The aerospace business, including Canadair, de Havilland, Short Brothers in
Northern Ireland and Lear Jet in the US, now represents about half the total
business. Bombardier is preparing a 70-seat version of the regional jet and
a larger 70-seat commuter turboprop.
Air Littoral of France has ordered two more regional jets, bringing firm
orders to 71, with 29 delivered and 71 options. A major US order is expected
shortly. Bombardier is increasing regional jet production rate to three a
month and deliveries in 1996 will reach 46 aircraft.
Including transport equipment, Bombardier's order book stands at around
CDollars 9bn. A slow recovery is expected in the low-margin rail equipment
sector this year, partly due to a settlement being reached last December of
a dispute over specialised Channel Tunnel rail cars.

Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, the consortium installing 1m new

its shares were traded on the local stock exchange for the first time
yesterday.
After opening at Bt190, against an initial public offering price of Bt145,
the shares fell along with the rest of the market and closed at Bt171.
TT&amp;T is the fourth-largest company by capitalisation on the Stock Exchange
of Thailand, after TelecomAsia (which is installing 2m new lines in the
capital) Bangkok Bank and Siam Cement.
After years of inadequate investment by state telephone companies, work by
TT&amp;T will more than double the number of provincial telephone lines, and it
is expected to benefit from rapid economic growth.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dismal year for Japan's
carmakers - Automotive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last spring, as Japan's carmakers looked ahead to prospects for the year,
the consensus was that at best they might hope for some relief from the
downturn in the Japanese economy.
A year later, even that cautious assessment appears sanguine, as one
carmaker after another has announced dismal results for the year to last
March.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker, yesterday became the latest in the
industry to report a substantial deterioration in its annual performance.
The results come amid persistent weakness in the domestic market and a 14
per cent rise in the yen's value against the dollar.
Nissan, which reported a consolidated net loss of Y86.9bn (Dollars 832m),
compared with Y55.9bn a year ago, was joined in its plight by Mazda and
Mitsubishi Motor.
Both Mazda and Mitsubishi last week reported sharp falls in sales. Mazda saw
its first loss in 19 years and has been forced to pass its dividend for the
first time since it was listed.
Mitsubishi had previously enjoyed buoyant sales on the strength of the
popularity in Japan of its range of sports utility and multipurpose
vehicles.
However, the company experienced a setback last year as competition in those
sectors increased.
Fuji Heavy, which produces Subaru cars, likewise fell into loss and passed
its dividend.
However, Daihatsu, which specialises in small cars and commercial vehicles,
returned to the black largely as a result of cost-cutting.
The carmakers' difficulties last year are largely attributed to two factors
which have plagued the industry recently: weak markets in Japan and Europe,
and the appreciation of the yen.
The poor state of the Japanese market is reflected in figures published by
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
The Japanese car market suffered a fall in demand in the fiscal year to
March 1994 - its third consecutive annual decline.
According to JAMA, domestic demand fell by 7 per cent to 6.4m units, while
vehicle production in Japan also dropped for the third consecutive year by
12 per cent to 10.8m units - the largest annual fall since 1949.
The situation was hardly much better outside Japan. Exports for the year are
estimated to have fallen by 18 per cent, although part of this reflects a
greater shift of production overseas.
These adverse market trends have been particularly damaging for Nissan and
Mazda, which have accumulated significant losses and face an uphill battle
to recovery.
Both companies made ambitious investments at home as the domestic market
went into reverse.
Nissan built a state-of-the-art factory in southern Japan and aggressively
expanded its model range.
Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, industry analyst at BZW, says that while Nissan has a
wide model range, it has not had the productivity levels of Toyota.
Although it is difficult to estimate capacity utilisation from available
figures, Mr Blair-Smith believes Nissan's rate is 64 per cent, compared with
82 per cent for Toyota.
Meanwhile, Mazda also opened a new factory in 1992 and built up a network of
five distribution channels.
Mazda is operating at an average capacity utilisation ratio of 80 per cent,
compared with 120 per cent at the peak of the boom years, the company said.
Nissan and Mazda have also been particularly hard hit by the slump in
European markets.
Nissan experienced a 30 per cent drop in unit export sales, which it
attributed to sluggish demand in Europe.
The fall in demand in Spain, together with the sharp depreciation of the
peseta against the yen, has meant that losses at its Spanish subsidiary,
Nissan Motor Iberica, and the restructuring programme there, have been
significant factors behind Nissan's consolidated losses.
Mazda, meanwhile, has seen shipments to overseas markets slump by 23 per
cent.
The carmakers are stepping up their cost-cutting measures through greater
use of common car parts, a reduction of car models and labour cuts.
For example, Mazda will not take on any new workers next spring, a sharp
reversal from its peak years when it took on 3,000 employees. Capital
spending is being reduced to Y50bn compared with Y54bn last year.
It is possible that these efforts, supported by a mild recovery in the
Japanese car market this year, will enable the beleaguered carmakers to
achieve a modest improvement in performance without taking restructuring
much further than planned.
But if the Japanese market fails to take off strongly, significant
improvements in profits may call for another round of aggressive
cost-cutting that might include further reductions in capacity.

Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, the consortium installing 1m new
telephone lines in Thailand's provinces, was valued at Dollars 3.4bn when
its shares were traded on the local stock exchange for the first time
yesterday.
After opening at Bt190, compared with an initial public offering price of
Bt145, the shares fell along with the rest of the market and closed lower at
Bt171.
TT&amp;T is the fourth-largest company by capitalisation on the Stock Exchange
of Thailand, after TelecomAsia (which is installing 2m new lines in the
capital) Bangkok Bank and Siam Cement.
After years of inadequate investment by state telephone companies, the work
being carried out by TT&amp;T will more than double the number of provincial
telephone lines, and the company is expected to benefit from rapid economic
growth outside Bangkok during its 25-year concession.
A survey by Sofrecom of France showed there were on average only 1.33 lines
per 100 people in the provinces, compared with 16.13 in Bangkok.
TT&amp;T has to pay 43.1 per cent of its gross revenue from the new lines to the
state Telephone Organisation of Thailand, whereas TelecomAsia pays only 16
per cent. But higher total revenues per line in the provinces should give
TT&amp;T a bigger net income per line than TelecomAsia by 1998, according to a
recent report by Peregrine Nithi Finance and Securities.
Net profit is forecast to rise from a negligible Bt31m (Dollars 1.2m) this
year to Bt1.28bn next year and Bt2.49bn in 1996.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Weak demand and higher yen take
toll on paper groups - Paper &amp; pulp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The annual results of Japan's paper and pulp companies provide a vivid
illustration of the competitive pressures on the country's materials
manufacturing industries.
Last year's rise in the yen has pushed paper makers' international costs
above those of producers in neighbouring south-east Asia, resulting in loss
of market share at home and abroad.
Persistently weak demand, meanwhile, has driven down prices in yen terms
faster than costs. As a result, the two largest paper producers, New Oji
Paper and Nippon Paper, reported declining profits, while the number three,
Daishowa, made a record loss, more than double the previous year.
That was far bigger than expected, because of Daishowa's inability to sell
assets as fast as planned, to reduce its Y434.7bn (Dollars 4.16bn) debt, a
consequence of over-investment in new capacity in the late 1980s.
Two creditor banks and a corporate shareholder are to install three
executives at Daishowa to help reduce its debts.
This ends one of the toughest years in Daishowa's history, following last
November's arrest of its former president, Mr Ryoei Saito, on bribery
charges.
The only leading paper group to produce a slight profits gain last year,
Mitsubishi Paper Mills, managed to do so by selling securities, a common
technique used by industrial companies to tide their published results
through hard times. Excluding a Y5.3bn capital gain on securities sales,
Mitsubishi Paper would have made a Y2.9bn loss, said Mr Toshihide Kokuzawa,
managing director. The group forecasts a 16.8 per cent earnings decline on
stagnant sales in the current year.
So far, the paper industry has managed to avoid heavy job losses and has
sought instead to reduce costs through mergers.
New Oji resulted from a merger last October between Oji Paper and Kanzaki
Paper. Nippon Paper was created six months earlier by Jujio Paper and
Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp. Two others, Honshu Paper and Takasaki Paper, have
stopped short of a full merger, but announced in January that they are to
pool distribution and purchasing.

better this year. Sail's plants produced 8.3m tonnes of steel last year.

San Miguel, the Philippines' largest industrial enterprise, announced that

for HKDollars 3.5bn (USDollars 453m), writes Jose Galang in Manila.
The sale translates into an extraordinary profit for the parent company of
about USDollars 253m, equivalent to one and a half times its profits for the
whole of 1993.
The sale is part of the Hong Kong subsidiary's move to a bigger location for
its plan to expand production to penetrate the beer market in mainland
China. The new plant is expected to be completed at a cost of Dollars 109m,
the Manila-based parent company said.

Trust Bank, New Zealand's fifth-largest and only locally-owned national
bank, yesterday reported a 17 per cent increase in after-tax profit to
NZDollars 72.8m (USDollars 42.8m) for the year ended March 31, writes Terry
Hall in Wellington.
The company was listed on the New Zealand stock exchange in March, and the
result was NZDollars 5m better than prospectus forecasts. It came after
writing off share issue expenses of NZDollars 7.5m and a gain of NZDollars
2.9m from property revaluations.
The charge for bad and doubtful debts fell to NZDollars 1.4m from NZDollars
22.8m. Shareholders' funds rose to NZDollars 467m from NZDollars 311m.
Trust Bank is New Zealand's largest lender to the home mortgage market, but
is seeking to expand into commercial and rural lending. Lending on home
mortgages was up 6 per cent to NZDollars 4.4bn, to the commercial sector by
17 per cent to NZDollars 1.1bn, and to the rural sector by 30 per cent to
NZDollars 577m.

<TEXT>
Nova, the Western Canada energy and petroleum group, and Petronas, the
state-owned Malaysian oil company, are paying around ADollars 250m
(USDollars 183m) for a 49 per cent stake in the Moomba-to-Sydney gas
pipeline. The pipeline is being sold by Australia's federal government.
Mr Kim Beazley, Australia's finance minister, said yesterday the sale was
expected to raise between ADollars 520m and ADollars 540m for the
government, and be completed by the end of June. Net proceeds are expected
to be just under ADollars 500m.
The government announced late last year that it planned to sell a 51 per
cent majority interest in the pipeline to Australian Gas Light Company
(AGL), the Sydney-based utility which is also the nation's largest gas
pipeline company. The government invited tenders for the remaining equity.
Under the deal, which has Foreign Investment Review Board approval, Nova
will take a 25 per cent interest in the pipeline and Petronas, 24 per cent.
In return for giving up vetoes over the sale, the Cooper Basin gas producers
will share a ADollars 20m payment - of which about ADollars 10.8m will go to
the Adelaide-based Santos group - while AGL gets ADollars 30m for waiving
similar rights.

for stake sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's biggest institutional investor is joining a rebellion against
plans by Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, to sell stakes of up
to 30 per cent in its four specialty retailing subsidiaries.
The influential College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), which holds 1.1bn
of Kmart's 455.9bn issued shares, said it wanted Kmart to sell the
subsidiaries completely, so that management could concentrate on improving
the core discount store business.
It also said it would withhold support for all five of Kmart's 13 directors
seeking re-election this year, citing the company's 'significant long-term
decline in market share, profitability, operating earnings and share price'.
With two days to go before the company's annual meeting on Friday, the CREF
is the biggest of five investors to have spoken out against Kmart's
strategy.
The others are the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the 10
largest US pension funds; the Florida State Board of Administration; the
Ohio State Teachers Retirement System; and the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Union.
Between them, these investors control only a small percentage of Kmart's
shares. But they are hoping their public opposition to Kmart's plans will
swing other shareholders against the company.
Kmart, which has been struggling to compete with its more successful rival
Wal-Mart, ended five years of stagnant earnings by plummeting into net
losses of Dollars 947m last year. The creation of new shares in its
specialty retailing subsidiaries, and the sale of up to 30 per cent of the
shares in the marketplace, forms part of its plan for recovery.

Warner holding

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edgar Bronfman Snr, chairman of Seagram, the world's fourth-biggest
drinks group, will today face shareholders' questions about his company's
longer-term relationship with Time Warner, the entertainment group.
Seagram has acquired 14.9 per cent of Time Warner for Dollars 2.1bn.
Uncertainty over its future plans has been over-shadowing Seagram's market
performance this year.
Analysts expect Mr Bronfman to say at today's annual meeting that Seagram's
holding represents a strategic investment in a global growth industry and
will benefit all shareholders as Time Warner reduces its debt and
strengthens cash flow and profits. Its cable TV interests are already a
source of rising cash flow.
He may also play down reports of disagreements with Mr Gerald Levin,
chairman of Time Warner, who has ruled out any standstill agreement that
might allow Seagram to increase its stake to 25 per cent. Analysts also
believe Seagram will ultimately seek one or two board seats to influence
Time Warner's strategy, although at the moment Seagram has denied this.
Seagram has strongly denied it plans to sell its 24.3 per cent interest in
Du Pont, the chemicals and energy giant, which is now worth nearly Dollars
10bn, and bid for all Time Warner stock.
Analysts say this would be prohibitively expensive, and selling the Du Pont
interest could involve heavy capital gains taxes.
After the meeting Mr Bronfman, soon to be 65, will hand over the chief
executive's chair to his son, Mr Edgar Jnr, 39, who became president and
chief operating officer in 1989.
Mr Bronfman Snr will remain chairman with his brother, Charles, co-chairman.
The Bronfmans own 37 per cent of Seagram.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: New funding source for Leeds
Permanent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, has raised Pounds
100m (Dollars 151m) for new mortgage lending through a mortgage-backed loan
facility, the first of its kind for a UK building society.
The transaction, which gives Leeds increased access to wholesale funding and
opens up a new source of funding for other building societies, is a form of
securitisation. This financing technique is widely used in the US but is
still at an early stage in its development in the UK.
Securitisation allows lenders to take loans off their balance sheet, thereby
removing the risk of default and freeing capital.
The assets are placed in a special-purpose vehicle which then raises money
by selling debt securities to investors. Interest on the so-called
'mortgage-backed' securities is funded by the loan repayments.
However, instead of selling securities in the public market, Leeds has used
a pool of mortgages to provide security for a loan from a group of banks.
The deal, signed on Friday, is a test run for a system which Leeds has set
up to securitise its mortgages.
Citibank, Commerzbank, Daiwa, NatWest, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Union Bank of Switzerland each took Pounds 13.57m of senior notes. Daiwa and
UBS took Pounds 2.5m each of the Pounds 5m subordinated portion.

Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace arm of the German Daimler-Benz
group, and Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace operation, intend
to form two joint ventures - one to build guided missiles and the other to
build satellites.
Munich-based Dasa said yesterday that talks with the French company over the
terms of the joint ventures had reached an advanced stage and it was likely
the new companies would be formed from January 1 next year.
Dasa and Aerospatiale have worked together in the guided missile area for
decades. The companies believe that a formal joint venture is the best way
of co-operating further.
The joint ventures are likely to be structured around two holding companies,
one for guided missiles which will be established in Paris and a satellite
company in Germany.
Each of the holding companies will be parent to a German and a French
subsidiary, which will divide the work equally between themselves.
Both Aerospatiale and Dasa plan to concentrate all their activities in these
business areas within the new holding companies.
Dasa and Aerospatiale already operate Eurocopter, a helicopter joint
venture.
Earlier this month Mr Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman,
said that joint ventures were planned as part of a strategy of returning to
profitability.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: US buy-out firms adopt more
modest guise - Clayton Dubilier's Richard Braddock tells Richard Waters
about the sector's recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Things have changed in the US buy-out industry. Just two years ago,
Citicorp, under pressure from regulators, backed away from highly-leveraged
lending.
Today Mr Richard Braddock, the banking group's president and chief operating
officer until 1992, begins work at Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice, one of the
handful of US buy-out firms to have come through the 1980s unscathed.
The move is symptomatic of the re-emergence of buy-outs in the US.
Starved of finance as the banks withdrew and the junk bond market dried up,
the industry virtually died.
But the market for sub-investment grade bonds roared back to life last year,
and lending to companies considered high risk is one of the few
opportunities banks now have to put their plentiful capital to work.
Also, a number of buy-out funds have spent the last year raising equity.
'Pile bank and subordinated debt on top of that, and there's an enormous
amount of money (available to do transactions),' says Mr Joseph Rice, one of
Clayton Dubilier's principals.
The industry that has re-emerged differs in several respects from the 1980s
version. Much of the new equity behind the buy-out funds has been provided
by pension funds, rather than the banks and insurance companies who invested
in funds in the 1980s, says Mr Leonard Green, a Los Angeles-based deal maker
who himself recently raised more than Dollars 300m for a new buy-out fund.
Pension funds, seeking higher yields, have been attracted by the investment
returns of the more successful funds.
Clayton Dubilier, for instance, claims an annualised rate of return on its
investments of around 100 per cent (investors get 80 per cent, while the
buy-out firm's partners keep 20 per cent).
Another difference in the 1990s buy-out industry is the lower level of
leverage (or gearing) at which deals are being struck.
One part equity to nine parts debt used to be the rule of thumb of the
1980s; now, says Mr Don Gogel, a Clayton Dubilier partner who was once
co-head of Kidder Peabody's mergers and acquisitions department, 'we look at
anything from 25-35 per cent equity'.
Lower gearing means lower investment returns in the years ahead. The 80 per
cent return paid to Clayton Dubilier investors will not be matched in
future, the firm warns - though it is still confident of beating its target
return of 40 per cent a year.
In this new era, it is the funds that can show a steady flow of successful
transactions - rather than those which scored big profits from single,
blockbuster leveraged deals - which are likely to be most successful.
Clayton Dubilier, one of the small group of funds to re-emerge strongly in
the 1990s, typifies the more modest ambitions of the new breed.
In nearly 20 deals over the past 15 years, only one - the Dollars 960m
purchase of healthcare products maker Kendall from Colgate-Palmolive in 1988
 -has proved a disaster.
Clayton Dubilier was forced into a refinancing, the ultimate success of
which remains unclear. But the firm's partners are adamant that they did not
walk away from the company. 'We fixed the problem and no one lost money,'
says Mr Gogel.
Meanwhile, the firm has developed a style which enables it to benefit from
more than just the financial structuring of its buy-outs.
Its partners have included some powerful business managers - among them Mr
Braddock, Mr Chuck Ames, a former boss of Reliant Electric, and, until he
left to run Westinghouse Electric last year, Mr Michael Jordan. These
operating managers take a more direct involvement in bought-out firms than
is typical in the industry.
'We're not buying short-term to flip businesses, or to take advantage of a
business's trajectory - we're looking to influence the trajectory,' says Mr
Braddock. The result has been the purchase recently of a number of
underperforming subsidiaries of large companies, each of which Clayton
managers are actively engaged in turning around: Allison from General
Motors, Wesco from Westinghouse and Remington from DuPont.
With these three transactions, between them valued at more than Dollars 1bn,
the firm established itself as one of the most active buy-out firms in the
second half of last year.
Clayton Dubilier is now preparing to raise cash for its next investment fund
 -likely to be launched later this year - and, once again, is eyeing Europe.
Four years ago, the firm established a London office; no deals have
resulted.
Over time, says Braddock now, Europe could still be a rich source of deals
for the US buy-out funds. Reminded of previous talk of an active European
buy-out industry, he insists: 'It's more than an idle comment.'

He said that joint ventures were planned as part of the Aerospatiale's

Aerospatiale, like other companies in the sector, has suffered from the
downturn in both defence and commercial activities.
'We need to achieve a much deeper integration of our European defence
industries to compete with the US, where consolidation is taking place at a
very rapid pace,' Mr Gallois said.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Prodi quits as Iri losses widen
to L10,230bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iri, the Italian state holding company, yesterday said 1993 losses had
reached a record L10,230bn (Dollars 6.4bn), more than double the L4,809bn
for the previous year.
At the same time, it was announced that Mr Romano Prodi, chairman, had
handed in his resignation to Mr Lamberto Dini, minister for the Treasury,
the sole shareholder of Iri, which transformed in 1992 into a
Treasury-controlled public company with capital of L15,000bn.
Of the losses, L8,317bn was attributed to the reorganisation and
restructuring of Ilva and Iritecna, Iri's subsidiaries in the steel and
construction/engineering sectors.
The heavy financial charges resulting from its L75,000bn debts, which
include those of telecommunications and motorway subsidiaries, played a
part. Debt directly attributable to the holding company was L18,085bn,
against L20,000bn the previous year.
Iri said some L5,000bn of losses was due to the reorganisation of its Ilva
steel group and at Iri-Tecna, its construction/engineering arm.
Ilva is in the process of being privatised and an announcement is expected
soon on the sale of its special steels operations.
Coinciding with yesterday's meeting, the Official Gazette published details
of the decree approved by the previous Ciampi government allowing Iri to
restructure some of its debt. This involves the issue of up to L10,000bn in
bonds by the Treasury-controlled Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.
The departure of Mr Prodi was expected. He agreed a year ago to return to
Iri, having been chairman from 1982-89. However, he has been out of sympathy
with the new government headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Mr Berlusconi has made no real effort to retain Mr Prodi's services at Iri
and is even reported to have offered him a European Commissioner's job in
Brussels.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Skanska predicts profits
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skanska, the Swedish construction and real estate group, yesterday predicted
higher profits for 1994 and said it planned to increase its international
operations.
Mr Melker Schorling, chief executive, said the company's pre-tax profit in
1994 should be higher than the SKr1.18bn (Dollars 149.4m) level achieved
last year.
This was in spite of strong pressure on margins caused by the depressed
Swedish construction market.
The group plans to continue international expansion to reduce dependence on
Sweden.
'Our aim is to continue sharply increasing our international business until
it accounts for 35 per cent to 40 per cent of group revenues,' said Mr
Schorling. 'By continuing our internationalisation, we will reduce Skanska's
exposure to fluctuations in the Swedish construction market, while taking
advantage of the growth potential that exists in many foreign markets.'
Last year, non-Swedish business accounted for 23 per cent of group sales of
SKr28.9bn, while in 1992 it amounted to 14 per cent of sales of SKr31.9bn.
The company, Scandinavia's biggest construction group, operates in more than
30 countries and has 25 per cent of its employees working outside Sweden.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japan's leading airlines held
back by high costs

<TEXT>
Japan's two leading airlines yesterday announced heavy losses for the year
to March, as they battled with high costs in markets increasingly open to
lower-cost competition.
However, the results from Japan Air Lines (JAL) did offer some hope as the
airline cut its net loss to Y25.3bn (Dollars 243m) from last year's Y43.7bn,
on sales which slipped to Y982.3bn from Y1,033.9bn.
Pre-tax losses fell to Y26.1bn from Y53.8bn. JAL forecast a modest pre-tax
profit of Y1bn for this year.
All Nippon Airways (ANA) fell into a net loss of Y2.9bn from a profit of
Y2.4bn last year, on sales down to Y774.8bn from Y808.4bn. At the pre-tax
level, the profit slipped to Y2.8bn from Y15.8bn. The airline expects to
break even this year.
Both carriers continued to experience weak demand, particularly in the first
half. 'International business travel demand was low, and there was a marked
swing to lower fares,' JAL said.
The fall in demand, as cost-conscious passengers turn to lower fare airlines
and discounted tickets, demonstrates the big effort JAL and ANA need to put
into reducing their high-cost structures.
Japan's airlines face restrictions by the transport ministry which must
approve fare changes and it imposes stringent regulations which add to their
cost base.
For JAL, cost-cutting in the parent company is almost impossible because of
union resistance. The airline plans to reduce its workforce by more than
4,000 people in four years, has expanded its voluntary retirement scheme,
and has launched a frequent-flyer programme and lower-fare routes. It is
shifting a greater proportion of costs outside Japan. Some maintenance is
being moved to China, and the company is hiring more than 800 Thai flight
attendants over the next four years and more than 200 non-Japanese pilots.
JAL is introducing a tourist flight to Hawaii. This is one of the most
popular destinations of Japanese travellers but it must compete with
low-cost US carriers. ANA, meanwhile, plans to cut its workforce by 10 per
cent in the next two years, and it has suspended some unprofitable routes.

FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Bastion of discretion speaks out
 -Mediobanca has reacted angrily to allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not much moves Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, to make a
public statement. In a financial community which leaks like a pasta-chef's
colander, Mediobanca is a bastion of discretion, opening up only twice a
year to emit an elegantly printed annual and half-year report.
However, on Monday evening Mediobanca came as near as it has ever done to
losing its temper in public. The trigger was the formal decision by Ravenna
magistrates to warn four top Mediobanca executives - including its
86-year-old honorary chairman, Mr Enrico Cuccia - that they are under
investigation for allegedly conspiring last year to falsify the accounts of
the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group.
In an uncharacteristically angry statement, the bank expressed its
'bitterness' that it was being 'criminalised' for its efforts to save
Italy's second-largest industrial group from disaster. In particular, it
said the magistrates' decision was based on 'elements which seem to have
been deliberately supplied by some of those who bear the greatest
responsibility for that disaster'.
The magistrates' decision has electrified the Italian media. This is not
because it was particularly momentous. It is a formal move which is far from
implying any guilt on Mediobanca's part, and the allegations are mainly
based on a supposed technical lapse by the bank.
But Mediobanca has an influence over the Italian financial and corporate
community far greater than that of any other merchant bank in any other
developed market. Mr Cuccia has cultivated clients which include all of
Italy's most powerful industrial and financial groups. The network is so
close that many of these groups, together with former state-owned banks, are
part of the shareholder syndicate that controls Mediobanca.
Under the circumstances, the restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison was a deal
which could only have been worked out by Mr Cuccia and his team.
This is the first time the bank has been caught up in the corruption
scandals, in which the old Ferruzzi-Montedison group seems to have been a
central player. But questions were already being raised about Mediobanca's
role in the new Italy. The bank has come under attack for trying to extend
its influence over the banks and industrial companies being privatised.
The magistrates' investigation centres on how much Mediobanca knew about
Ferruzzi-Montedison's L435bn (Dollars 257m) of undeclared bad debts in
offshore companies. If it was aware of this hole in the 1992 accounts, then
under Italian law it had an obligation to declare its knowledge, or face
criminal charges of 'false communication'.
The old board of Ferruzzi-Montedison approved the 1992 accounts at a meeting
on May 28. Mediobanca was given the mandate for a restructuring of the group
on June 4 and the accounts were deposited with the regulatory authorities on
June 12. Shareholders only learnt about the hole at their assembly on June
28. Mediobanca says it has submitted 'incontrovertible' evidence to the
Ravenna prosecutor that it had neither the power nor the duty to vet the
accounts.
The most prominent dissenter from this view is Mr Carlo Sama, the former
chief executive of Ferruzzi-Montedison who is facing corruption allegations.
He claims that Mediobanca knew more than it is letting on. In a television
interview on Monday night, he went further, claiming Mediobanca had 'taken
away our property and our honour' in an attempt to gain control of a large
chunk of Italy's industrial economy. Mr Sama believes the merchant bank
deliberately scuppered an alternative plan for the restructuring of
Ferruzzi, prepared by the directors.
The new board of Montedison issued a statement yesterday deploring the fact
that ex-directors - 'responsible for having led the group to disaster, with
a legacy of L31,000bn of debts' - were trying to undermine the credibility
of their replacements, struggling to put in place Mediobanca's rescue plan.
Mr Gianni Agnelli, the Fiat chairman who is probably Mr Cuccia's closest
ally, described the magistrates' decision as 'a serious matter and an
annoying obstacle' at a moment when Italy needed all the instruments at its
disposal 'to revitalise its industrial groups and expand'.
Mediobanca's rivals believe the move could have positive repercussions for a
financial system notable for its lack of transparency. This would be welcome
at a time when there is intense scrutiny of the possible conflict of
interest between Mr Silvio Berlusconi's role as prime minister and as owner
of one of Italy's largest private companies.
Market reaction suggests the reputation of the bank has only been dented by
the Ferruzzi-Montedison affair. Shares in Mediobanca, which had fallen
nearly 20 per cent ahead of Monday's decision, yesterday recovered slightly.
Mr Cuccia is likely to be happier about this than yesterday's show of
support from many of his allies: Mediobanca is preparing for a L1,500bn
rights issue which could have been put in jeopardy by a continued fall in
its share price.

<TEXT>
AssiDoman, the newly-formed Swedish forestry group, yesterday announced a 65
per cent increase in first-quarter profits and increased its forecast for
the full year.
Profits after financial items rose to SKr344m (Dollars 43.5m) from SKr208m
after a 4 per cent increase in sales to SKr3.86bn.
The company, which was partially privatised in March, predicts full-year
profits of more than SKr1.5bn due to increased efficiency and the improving
outlook for the pulp and paper industry. Last year profits were SKr876m.
The Swedish government sold off a 49 per cent stake in AssiDoman in March,
raising SKr7.6bn in Sweden's biggest privatisation to date.
The privatisation followed the merger of two state-owned forestry groups,
Assi and Doman, at the start of the year. A third company, NCB, which was
majority state-owned, is being merged with the group and has been
consolidated from the start of the year.
The first-quarter performance showed the benefits of stronger operating
results from Skog &amp; Tra, which lifted profits to SKr311m from SKr223m, while
Kraft Products achieved a SKr11m profit after a SKr36m loss. The group
raised overall operating profits to SKr390m from SKr285m, despite falling
profits in the carton and packaging divisions.
Financial outlays fell to SKr46m from SKr77m due to lower interest rates and
a reduced net debt. NCB made a SKr24m profit from a SKr41m loss.
AssiDoman's shares closed yesterday at SKr162. Individuals paid SKr138 a
share at privatisation.

Volvo, the Swedish motor vehicle manufacturer, plans to take over a Danish

Group.
Under an agreement signed with Kassbohrer, Volvo Bus will take over all the
activities of Aabenraa Karosserifabrik, the German company's Danish
subsidiary, related to the production and marketing of bodies for Volvo bus
chassis.
Neither company disclosed the value of the deal, which is due to be
completed by the end of this month.
Aabenraa builds about 125 Volvo buses a year for sale mainly in the Danish
market.
It produces about 50 buses for Kassbohrer, but Volvo will not acquire those
activities. Volvo says it will, however, take on a majority of Aabenraa's
220 employees and has plans to incorporate the operation as a Danish Volvo
subsidiary.
Volvo embarked on a strategy to concentrate on car, truck and bus
manufacturing following the collapse of its previous plans to merge with
France's Renault.
Volvo has wholly-owned bus body-building operations in Sweden and Austria,
as well as a joint venture in China.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rodime hit by heavy interim costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodime, the former disk drive manufacturer whose activity now concerns the
licensing of its patents through negotiation or litigation, suffered a
significant reduction in revenue and a 'substantial increase in litigation
costs' for the half year to end-March.
Administrative expenses jumped from Dollars 1.9m to Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m)
and after interest costs of Dollars 448,000 (Dollars 696,000) pre-tax losses
emerged at Dollars 5.29m compared with profits of Dollars 815,000.
Losses per share were 3.6 cents against earnings of 0.4 cents.
The directors said it was unlikely that any significant licence agreements
would be reached in the second half of the year.
Directors expected losses to continue in the second six months, although at
a reduced rate.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J shareholders reject rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerald and Vera Weisfeld, the millionaire couple who founded the What
Everyone Wants chain, did not get what they wanted yesterday as shareholders
in discount retailer Brown &amp; Jackson rejected their rescue plan at an
extraordinary meeting in London.
The company could now face legal action arising from its decision to
recommend a second rescue package in preference to that of the Weisfelds.
It was clear from his statement that Mr Weisfeld, who had previously
refrained from commenting on the competing rescue offer from South African
group Pepkor, was angry.
The Weisfelds had offered to inject up to Pounds 28.4m, in return for a 43
per cent stake and two seats on the board. The board of B&amp;J had recommended
the Weisfeld's offer, until earlier this month when Pepkor offered an
injection of up to Pounds 56.3m for a 63 per cent stake.
The company said the Pepkor offer had been preferable as it meant B&amp;J would
get a Pounds 20m cash injection immediately. Mr Weisfeld said his efforts to
provide a similar immediate injection had been hampered by a lack of
financial information from the company.
Shareholders representing 58.6 per cent of the votes cast rejected the
Weisfeld's offer. An egm will be held on June 3 to vote on the Pepkor
proposals.

Mr Alan Jackson, chairman of BTR Nylex, the Asia-Pacific arm of BTR, the
industrial conglomerate, said yesterday that orders and sales performance in
the first four months of 1994 had been robust.
'Apart from isolated exceptions, the vast majority of our companies in these
markets are well ahead of prior-year orders and sales, although not all
these companies are yet achieving commensurate profit drop-through
performance', he told shareholders at the annual meeting in Melbourne.
Mr Jackson added that the company's Taiwan Polymer businesses were
benefiting from more favourable pricing, and operating profits for that
sector were substantially up on those of the equivalent period of 1993. He
expected 'substantial' gains for the company overall in 1994.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stratagem, which has evolved from an investment company into a group with
interests in the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors, yesterday
reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 280,000 for the six months to
end-February.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 272,000 and came from turnover
up from Pounds 690,000 to Pounds 33.8m. The results were bolstered by the
inclusion of a first-time contribution from Harrison Industries, acquired
last August.
The directors said that all three divisions acquired with Harrison were
reporting profits by the end of the period.
At the same time Veritas, the car dealership operation, had benefited from
the reorganisation which was implemented after it became wholly owned in
late-November 1993.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.6p (2.2p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.5p.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Colombian find shores up Lasmo's bid
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent explorer under siege from hostile bidder Enterprise
Oil, yesterday shored up its defence by announcing the discovery of a new
find in Colombia.
The Revancha 1 well, which was tested at a rate of 6,200 barrels of oil a
day, is just 3km from an earlier discovery. Lasmo estimated the combined
recoverable reserves at between 50m and 150m barrels.
Analysts said the new discovery could be worth some 2p to 5p on Lasmo's
share price. But some speculated that finds announced during the bid process
might eventually be scaled back.
Colombia accounts for about 5 to 7 per cent of Lasmo's output. It has been
cited by Enterprise as one of the areas which suffers because of Lasmo's
heavy financial commitments elsewhere.
Mr John Hogan, Lasmo's chief operating officer, acknowledged that
development of the latest discovery was not in the budget. But 'there is
always money available for good projects'.
He noted that three more exploration wells for the area were in next year's
budget. Full scale development is not envisaged before late 1995 or early
1996, by which time Lasmo will have completed its extensive capital
programme to develop the Liverpool Bay gas field.
The two discovery wells in Colombia are 5km from the Purifacacion field,
from which Lasmo is trucking out 5,000 barrels a day.
Mr Hogan said the expensive trucking operation, which analysts say can add
up to Dollars 5 a barrel in costs, will end later this year when a pipeline
with a capacity of 35,000 b/d is completed.
Lasmo wants to achieve early production from the new discoveries to generate
cash which will be used for the further development of the field.
A temporary pipeline might be built to link the new discoveries to
Purifacacion as early as next year, Mr Hogan said.
Lasmo's 66 per cent interest in the block will fall to 30 per cent when it
proves to be commercially viable and Ecopetrol, the Colombian state oil
company, exercises its option to back into the deal.
Lasmo yesterday retracted an earlier statement which claimed that: 'In the
1990s Enterprise has lost over Pounds 150m in international operations.' It
acknowledged that the lossmaking operations mentioned did not include
Norway, which '. . . was not lossmaking over the period'.
Enterprise pointed out that Lasmo had 'chosen to ignore' 93 per cent of its
international production. Norway last year accounted for turnover of Pounds
144m, against total international revenues of Pounds 154.6m.
Enterprise has until the opening of the London Stock Exchange today to
extend its Pounds 1.3bn bid.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pentos sells Athena to management team for
Pounds 1.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the specialist retailing group, has sold the publishing,
manufacturing and wholesaling businesses of Athena International to a
management team backed by Henderson Venture Managers for a maximum of Pounds
1.9m.
The three-person management buy-in team is led by Mr David Clipsham who has
had a career in marketing and creative-led businesses, including periods
with both the Athena retail and publishing businesses as well as being a
divisional director of WH Smith.
Athena's operations involve the design, manufacture, sales and distribution
of graphic arts printed products including greeting cards, postcards,
posters and prints under the Athena brand name, together with frames and
framed products under the KwikFrame and Montana brands.
The company, which has turnover of about Pounds 12m and exports some 15 per
cent of sales, will continue to supply the Athena retail chain which
accounts for about one third of its business. It employs between 100 and 150
people.
Mr Clipsham said the new management team intends to boost the group's
overseas sales and take advantage of its new independence to develop
domestic sales by broadening both the product range and the customer base.
The other two members of the management buy-in team are Mr Paul Bendit,
finance director, and Ms Linda Worsfold, publishing director.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Making an appeal to all sides - Why Mining
(Scotland) wants part of British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If political acceptability is to count for anything in the government's
selection of the winning bids for the assets of British Coal then a company
named Mining (Scotland) is ideal.
The consortium has the support of the National Union of Mineworkers in
Scotland, and Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades
Union Congress, sits on its board. But its co-chairman is Professor Ross
Harper, a former president of the Scottish Conservative party, and his
co-chairman is Mr George McAlpine, a former British Coal area director for
Scotland.
The formation of Mining (Scotland) last summer was both an example of the
Scottish preference for consensus rather than confrontation, and of Scottish
pragmatism in pursuit of an objective. The moderate Scottish branch of the
NUM has swallowed any ideological objections to privatisation in the
interests of getting a share of the assets.
Those assets are among the most attractive the government is offering. They
consist of one deep mine, Longannet, and nine opencast sites, with a number
of prospective opencast sites for future development. Last autumn Scottish
Power and Hydro-Electric agreed to buy 2.5m tonnes of coal in 1994-95,
rising to 2.8m tonnes each year until 1997-98.
The low sulphur content of much of Scotland's coal makes it relatively
friendly in environmental terms, and demand is set to rise from 5.3m tonnes
this year to 7.5m in 1998. This is because of the increase in the capacity
of the interconnecting power lines to England and the tailing off of
supplies of gas from the Miller field in the North Sea to Hydro-Electric's
power station at Peterhead, Grampian.
The government is also offering as a separate lot the Frances colliery near
Kirkcaldy in Fife, which has been mothballed for several years but which
possesses reserves of low sulphur coal. Mining (Scotland) is interested in
that too, though realises that it could require a substantial investment.
The attractions of the Scottish coalfield have been appreciated by other
bidders. Last month Ryan Group, the coal producer, announced a joint venture
with Miller Group, the Edinburgh-based construction company. Between them
they already mine 40 per cent of Scottish coal under contract to British
Coal.
Scotcoal, as it is called, also has a top Scottish Tory on its board: the
chairman is Lord Sanderson who until last May was chairman of the party.
Other companies are thought to have pre-qualified, if only to see the
details of what British Coal is putting on sale.
Mr Brian MacDonald, the Glasgow businessman whom Mining (Scotland) appointed
chief executive last autumn, says that part of the eventual deal should be
structured as a management-employee buy-out through an employee share
ownership plan. The mining unions would invest separately.
Other shareholders are likely to be involved. Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former
British Coal commercial director who has formed a company called Coal
Investments, is on the board and would take a stake. Intriguingly, Mr
MacDonald says Mining (Scotland) is negotiating a partnership with another
British coal mining company, but refuses to name it.
He envisages the founding shareholders' equity being supplemented by loans
and venture capital funding, though he says 'high gearing is not desirable.'
Royal Bank of Scotland has told the company it would consider lending to it
and Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow investment house, should offer venture
capital. If all goes well, Mining (Scotland) would expect to float on the
Stock Exchange in five to seven years time.
However, these are early days. First Mining (Scotland) wants to know exactly
what British Coal is offering and what liabilities such as subsidence,
flooding, pollution and miners' health the government expects the purchaser
to take on. The government has indicated that it is prepared to address some
of the potential bidders' concerns on these costs but has yet to decide
where to draw the line.
'The liabilities are a big problem,' Mr MacDonald says. 'If they are not
capped by the government in some way I don't believe anyone will want to buy
the assets.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals hit United Breweries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional charges and a substantial property write-down combined to push
United Breweries, the USM-traded regional brewer and pub operator, deeper
into the red.
Despite what Mr Vijay Mallya, chairman, described as 'extremely difficult
trading conditions' turnover during the year to November 30 jumped 68 per
cent to Pounds 4.14m, while operating profits before the exceptionals
improved from just Pounds 38,000 to Pounds 463,000.
The pre-tax line, however, showed a deficit of Pounds 8.57m (Pounds 978,954)
following non-recurring exceptional charges of Pounds 758,570 against the
Chainmaker division, bad debt write-offs and 'other known losses'. Interest
charges increased from Pounds 720,177 to Pounds 815,279.
As announced in April, a revaluation of the group's 76 public houses
resulted in a Pounds 7.49m write-down, effectively eliminating the company's
reserves and leading it to breach its banking covenants.
Nevertheless, Mr Mallya remained cautiously optimistic: 'The underlying
business continues to improve through operational efficiency. Negotiations
for both the restructuring and acquisitions continue.'
Losses per share widened from 8.58p to 10.65p.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Conquest Inns buys Bass pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conquest Inns, a company set up by three former executives of the UK's
leading brewing groups and funded by The Ann Street Brewery Company, Jersey,
and Barclays, yesterday announced it had completed its first acquisition,
writes Peter Franklin.
The deal comprises the purchase from Bass, for an undisclosed amount, of 59
pubs in the Midlands, London and south-east England.
Mr Adam Hogg, previously an executive with Courage, and Conquest's managing
director, said he welcomed the involvement of The Ann Street Brewery as the
company's majority shareholder.
Mr Ian Steven, Ann Street's chairman and chief executive who is also
chairman of Conquest Inns, said: 'We have been looking for opportunities to
invest outside the Channel Islands for some time, and Conquest Inns fits our
strategy of investing in management teams in industries in which we have
experience.
'We have no immediate plans for introducing Ann Street brands into England,'
he added.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Warburg highlights exposure -
Implementation of derivative accounting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg yesterday became the latest in a series of British banks to
highlight exposure to derivatives under pressure from European law and
industry guidelines enacted at the end of last year.
Derivatives are the financial instruments such as swaps, futures and options
whose value is 'derived' from more conventional financial assets. Their
presence and treatment in accounts has come under growing scrutiny in the
last few months, particularly in the light of the hundreds of millions of
dollars lost by such blue chip companies as Proctor &amp; Gamble and
Metallgesellschaft.
But accountants and other readers of accounts warn that the new disclosure
requirements now in place for banks still only provide very little
information, and that this data needs to be interpreted with great care.
Warburg's accounts for the year to March 31 1994 contain a number of changes
to the format of the profit and loss account and balance sheet and
accompanying notes, as well as an 'operating and financial review' designed
to describe the company's performance and strategy in text.
'This is a more transparent document,' says Mr Simon Leathes, Warburg's
group finance director. 'As time moved on we felt it was appropriate to give
people who read our accounts more information.'
No new disclosure is more significant than note 30, which shows for the
first time Warburg's 'forward and futures contracts' divided between three
categories: exchange rate contracts, interest rate contracts and equity
contracts.
Three numbers are provided under each heading:
contract or underlying principal: a notional value for the gross volume of
outstanding derivatives business at the balance sheet date.
replacement cost: the cost to the bank if counterparties to the derivative
contracts fail to meet their obligations. The cost is calculated by
aggregating those contracts with a positive value when 'marked to market' at
current prices.
credit risk weighted amount: a Bank of England formula to give an indication
of the credit risk of the contracts.
The categories used and the level of disclosure provided are similar to
those adopted in the latest accounts produced by banks such as Barclays,
Kleinwort Benson and Schroders.
The reason for the additional disclosures dates back to the introduction of
the EU fourth company law directive, which lays down reporting requirements
but specifically excluded banks and insurance companies as special cases
needing separate rules.
In the UK, these EU rules for banks were incorporated in Schedule 9 of the
UK Companies Act - generally known as the 'bank accounts directive' - and
came into force for companies with year-ends after December 22 last year. It
included references to derivatives.
Far more detailed advice has been provided in an accompanying 'Sorp' -
statement of recommended practice - produced by the British Bankers'
Association. While not mandatory, it represents best practice which banks
would be loathe to ignore.
However, the level of disclosure still provides an imperfect picture. 'It is
very hard to give information that really reflects the risks involved,' says
Mr Leathes. 'It is very hard to know how to do so without misleading people
unless you have a detailed knowledge of how firms with big numbers are
managing their risk. The whole thing could boil down to very little.'
Mr John Tattersall, a banking partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, says warily that readers could try to compare the replacement
cost of contracts against the balance sheet total, or the credit risk value
against the banks' more conventional exposures such as customer loans.
His waryness is shared by Mr Chris Taylor, a partner in the capital markets
group of accountants Price Waterhouse. 'I'm not sure it's terribly sensible
to compare anything. This is very crude measure with very raw data.
He warns that the exchange, interest and equity contract categories are
still enormously broad. He adds that while the figures provide an assessment
of the credit risk of the counterparty in a transaction, they do not assess
the market risk.
Mr Taylor says that draft proposals from the US Financial Accounting
Standards Board, issued in April, would disclose the average, maximum and
minimum market value of contracts during the financial reporting period.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Beazer Homes jumps by 20% to Pounds 15.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Beazer Homes, the former Hanson subsidiary which was
floated only two months ago, jumped by a fifth from Pounds 13m to Pounds
15.6m during the six months to March 31.
The improvement had been widely expected and the shares yesterday fell 2p to
154p, against an issue price of 165p. Shares prices of housebuilders have
fallen sharply since March amid fears that the next interest rate movement
will be upwards, undermining housing market confidence.
Mr Dennis Webb, chief executive, said yesterday that turnover during the six
months had risen by 26 per cent, from Pounds 105.8m to Pounds 133.1m.
Earnings per share, after a 26 per cent tax charge, were 4.6p (5.2p).
The group, which is changing its year end to June 30, intends to pay a
dividend of 1.8p for the nine months to the end of June. Mr Webb hoped
future distributions to shareholders would be covered by earnings at least 2
to 3 times.
The group completed 2,210 homes during the period - 17 per cent more than
the 1,884 completed a year earlier. The average price of a home rose from
Pounds 57,400 to Pounds 61,600.
Operating margins, however, fell from 12.6 per cent to 11.9 per cent - as
forecast in the flotation prospectus. Mr Webb said that he would expect
margins to start to recover slightly.
At the end of March the group had net cash of Pounds 74.7m available for
land purchases and acquisitions. It plans to increase annual output to about
7,000 homes by the end of the decade, compared with about 5,000 to 5,500
currently.
Mr Webb said the market for housing land was very difficult in south-east
England with some buyers paying 'silly prices'. Nonetheless, it was still
possible to buy some sites by private treaty at sensible prices.
At the period end the group owned 16,552 plots with planning permission in
its books at Pounds 9,000 a plot, compared with Pounds 8,500 a plot when the
flotation prospectus was published.
COMMENT
Beazer Homes' shares have fallen by more than 5 per cent from the issue
price reflecting general stock market concern about the potential impact of
rising interest rates and land prices on housebuilders' profits. The
potential for Beazer to improve its margins is less than for some of its
rivals given that it has opted for 'jam today' policy by writing down land
values to include a margin for profit. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m for the
nine months to June and Pounds 51m for the following 12 months would put the
company on 12 times earnings on 1994-95 profits. The rating is unlikely to
improve in the short term with sentiment running against housebuilders and
the market waiting to see how wisely the group intends to spend its cash.
The jury is still out.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Heron Intl sifts throughthe bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heron International's board of directors yesterday started the process of
selecting a short-list of six bidders for Mr Gerald Ronson's troubled
property and petrol stations group, after the deadline for offers closed
last Friday.
The company had expressions of interest from 40 groups but Lord Boardman,
chairman, would not comment on the number of formal proposals that had been
received. However, a number of leading US investment banks are understood to
have submitted offers.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which control substantial property funds,
have been discussing a similarly complex untangling of the property
developer's Broadgate and Ludgate properties, and both are understood to be
interested in Heron.
Heron has given assurances that it will be able to put forward concrete
proposals to its bondholders by the end of the month, and Lord Boardman said
the directors would meet again next week to discuss the proposals.
Heron had been on target in its asset disposal programme, agreed at the time
of the Pounds 1.4bn restructuring last year. Many of these assets, however,
were held by a subsidiary, Heron Corporation, whose bankers have first call
on the proceeds.
Heron International was unable to meet its dividend payments, while the
bankers to Heron Corporation have received payments in advance of the agreed
timeframe.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins halves Plysu to Pounds
5.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An erosion in margins sharply reduced profits at Plysu, the plastic
container manufacturer, in the year to March 31.
It yesterday reported pre-tax profits down almost 50 per cent from Pounds
10.8m to Pounds 5.43m. Sales were up by 2.7 per cent to Pounds 88.8m (Pounds
86.4m).
Mr David O'Shaughnessy, chairman, said the results were disappointing
although he considered the year successful because of the development of new
products and investment in plant and equipment. Plysu had issued a profits
warning in October, just after Mr O'Shaughnessy was brought in as chairman
in September.
The dairy and juice division, which in the period increased its share of the
UK milk and fruit juice containers market to 66 per cent, secured several
long-term supply contracts.
Two new factories were commissioned during the year, new products were
introduced and additional capacity was brought on stream.
Operating profit from continuing operations fell from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds
7.39m. Exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.4m covered closing some
UK plants.
Mr O'Shaughnessy said Plysu remained committed to its continental European
businesses despite over-capacity in the industrial containers sector and the
poor economic climate. There were signs of sustained improvement in the UK
market, he said.
Earnings shrank to 7.3p (15.3p). An unchanged final dividend of 5p is
proposed, maintaining the total at 7p.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Profits warning slices 71p off Hall share
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Hall Engineering (Holdings) fell almost 30 per cent yesterday
following a profits warning from the Shrewsbury-based steel products and
automotive engineering group.
The directors said that because of problems in the Stadco automation
engineering operations and margin pressure in the general steel stockholding
and steel reinforcement businesses the results for the current year were
expected to be 'materially short of those for 1993'.
The shares closed 71p lower at 169p
Last year the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.56m and raised its
dividend for the year by 10 per cent to 9.5p.
In their statement yesterday the directors said that, providing there was no
further deterioration in the forecast for this year, they expected to
maintain the dividend at 9.5p.
They said that Stadco's automation engineering division, which designs and
builds assembly line welding systems for car manufacturers, had been
affected by the decision of an unidentified continental European car
manufacturer to cancel one of three sections of a Pounds 21m contract.
Although the customer was expected to reinstate part of this section of the
contract following further negotiations, the company said the disruption to
Stadco's production plan had resulted in 'an under recovery of overheads'.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sugar signs new chief executive - Amstrad
fills top post after seven-month search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, yesterday
appointed Mr David Rogers, a senior Philips executive, to the post of chief
executive.
Mr Rogers, aged 47, is currently chief executive of Philips Advanced
Communication Enterprise, an investment vehicle for the Dutch electronics
group, and will take up his new appointment in August.
He was previously head of Philips Consumer Communications business which has
annual sales of about Pounds 300m and is responsible for Philips' worldwide
interests in telephones, facsimile machines, telephones and other products.
His appointment comes seven months after Mr Sugar first announced that he
planned to split the roles of chairman and chief executive and began the
search for someone to fill the new job.
The appointment comes at a critical time for Amstrad which is attempting to
develop new markets to offset declining margins in its older consumer
electronic operations.
Mr Sugar and Mr Rogers are understood to have spent considerable time
together over the past couple of months in an effort to ensure that 'the
chemistry was right' and that they could work together effectively.
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's colourful chairman and founder, has also strengthened
the board through the appointment of two non-executive directors in the past
18 months.
Mr Rogers' appointment appears to underline Mr Sugar's determination to
expand Amstrad's advanced telecommunications equipment operations and to
strengthen the group's strategic plan-ning.
In his last job Mr Rogers was responsible for Philips' investment in General
Magic, a Californian-based software company founded by the two lead
designers of the Apple Macintosh.
Before joining Philips in 1986 Mr Rogers spent most of his career in the
British electronics industry working for both GEC and Plessey. He also had a
five year spell with Black &amp; Decker.
He has considerable international experience - particularly of the European
Union, the US and east Asian markets.
Mr Rogers speaks French and German and has a BA in business management.

FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: The parting of the ways - The demerging of
ECC's construction materials arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took only six minutes at yesterday's EGM to secure shareholder approval
to launch English China Clays as a speciality minerals and chemicals
company. Trading in Camas, its demerged construction materials arm, starts
today.
Yet it has taken almost four years of planning and rationalising for Mr
Andrew Teare, chief executive, to get the group into its present shape.
When he arrived from Rugby, the construction materials group, Mr Teare was
faced with revitalising what was, in effect, a mining company which had
mistakenly strayed into housebuilding. After withdrawing from the housing
market and cutting more than 20 per cent of the workforce, yesterday's
demerger marks the final chapter of ECC's transition.
Mr Teare is left with a minerals operation dependent on the paper industry,
and a chemicals business based on the recent purchase of Calgon, a US water
treatment group.
The logic of demerging a business on the verge of recovery while the
remaining core operations are a year behind in the economic cycle has come
under widespread attack.
Mr Teare is confident, however, that the timing of the demerger is an
irrelevant issue, since shareholders will have stakes in both companies.
He intends to focus on building ECC around two concepts - added value and
service. The key to his strategy is research and development, which is at
the heart of both divisions.
Mr Teare's game plan goes something like this: ECC intends in the short to
medium term to remain heavily dependent on the paper industry. While margins
have come under severe pressure in recent years due to overcapacity, paper
volumes have actually increased at a rate of 3 to 4 per cent a year in
recent years.
This steady growth allows ECC to avoid the excessive cyclical swings of
volatile sectors such as building materials, and provides a certain degree
of security, he says.
With volumes steady, but margins weak, Mr Teare argues that profit growth
must come from technical innovation and the provision of integrated
services.
For example, his utopia has ECC providing the minerals used to whiten paper
and the chemical processes to reclaim the products for recycling.
The opportunities presented by environmental legislation are vast, Mr Teare
says, when one considers that the paper and packaging industries generate
some 40 per cent of the world's landfill demand.
The paper industry is also one of the largest producers of waste water.
Enter Calgon, the US acquisition upon which ECC intends to build a global
speciality chemicals business.
ECC's logic is that because it is a substantial user of chemicals in its
mineral refining process, there is much to be gained by combining the
research and development expertise of the two divisions.
If all goes to plan, this would lead to more innovative products, allowing
ECC to raise prices and offer integrated services in a world where
manufacturers want to deal with fewer suppliers.
The theory sounds attractive. There are some sceptics, however, who suspect
it may not be so easy to implement.
ECC remains largely dependent on its kaolin product, a mineral used to
whiten paper, and has stocks which are expected to last for substantially
more than 25 years. Yet kaolin is facing heavy competition from cheaper
alternatives such as calcium carbonate, which ECC also provides but in much
smaller quantities.
Although demand for kaolin is growing, it is doing so at a much slower rate
than the cheaper alternatives. Furthermore, ECC has had to take some sharp
price cuts to keep the market going.
'If kaolin loses market share, then ECC's profits will suffer,' one analyst
says. 'We are not convinced that this is a very clear cut recovery story.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Two Warburg directors paid Pounds 1m-plus: Late starter
shows rapid growth in off-balance sheet derivatives contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two directors of SG Warburg, the UK-based investment bank, received more
than Pounds 1m in salary and bonuses last year, as emoluments to the bank's
directors nearly doubled to Pounds 10.7m, it was disclosed yesterday.
Warburg revealed in its annual report for the year to March that one
director received Pounds 1.2m and another Pounds 1.5m. In each case, more
than Pounds 600,000 came under a long-term performance-related bonus scheme.
Sir David Scholey, chairman, received Pounds 758,000 compared with Pounds
411,000 in 1992-93. Some 11 Warburg directors were paid more than the top
amount of Pounds 510,000-Pounds 515,000 received by a director in the
previous year.
The bank also disclosed a rapid growth in its off-balance sheet financial
derivatives contracts. It held exchange rate, interest rate and equity
contracts with a notional value of Pounds 61.6bn at the year-end, compared
with Pounds 23.9bn.
However, the total replacement value of the contracts - the amount which it
would have to provide if the other parties to all its derivatives contracts
defaulted - grew only slightly to Pounds 597.4m, against Pounds 586m.
The figures, disclosed for the first time under the EC Bank Accounts
directive, showed rapid growth in equity derivatives contracts, an area
which it strengthened last year with the acquisition of the Chicago firm
KC-CO Investments.
Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, said last week when the results were
released, that it had entered derivatives 'rather late in the day' and its
activities in the area were still 'relatively small'.
Mr Philip Gibbs, an investment banking analyst for BZW, said that the
figures did not indicate much about the shape of Warburg's derivatives
activities, but growth in derivatives was encouraging because it was a
profitable business.
Warburg also disclosed a fall in the proportion of pre-tax profits coming
from the UK: Pounds 196.1m, or 66 per cent, of the Pounds 297m total
compared with 83 per cent of Pounds 148.2m the previous year. But Warburg
added that more than 60 per cent of revenues came from outside the UK last
year.
The proportion of profits coming from the Asia Pacific rose to 13.9 per
cent, compared with 3.7 per cent.

FT  01 JUN 94 / BT-MCI deal to get go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is set to gain the consent of US regulatory
authorities for its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) alliance with MCI, the
second largest US operator.
The US Department of Justice, and the Federal Communications Commission, the
US telecommunications regulator, may clear the BT deal as soon as this week,
following a year-long inquiry. 'All the lights are green,' said an industry
source.
Regulatory approval for the BT/MCI deal, signed last June, has taken far
longer than expected, leading to repeated postponements of the launch of a
joint venture between the two operators. The European Commission cleared the
alliance last September.
A Dollars 1bn joint venture company, geared to the international telecoms
needs of multinationals, will be launched soon, based in Washington. BT will
also be free to complete its Dollars 4.3bn purchase of 20 per cent of MCI.
The FCC's ruling will be tied to conditions, but they are not believed to be
onerous on BT.
Disputes between rival US/UK operators as to the openness of their
respective telecoms markets have dogged the approval process. AT&amp;T, which
competes fiercely with MCI in the US long-distance market and with BT
internationally, claimed the UK to be less favourable to new operators than
the US.
Consent for the BT/MCI deal does not finally resolve the issue. A separate
BT application to resell leased telecoms lines in the US is still pending,
as is an application by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK's second largest telecoms
group, for a waiver allowing it to have stakes exceeding 25 per cent in US
cellular mobile operations.
AT&amp;T also has an application pending in the UK for full access to the UK
public network.
Regulatory authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have privately
expressed optimism that each will soon be able to pronounce the other
broadly equivalent in terms of openness.
That would permit the granting of consent to the outstanding applications,
and open the way to 'international simple resale' between the US and UK -
competition by leased-line operators offering services across the public
networks in both countries, which could significantly reduce transatlantic
telecoms prices.
Several large US telecoms operators are active in the UK's cable and
cellular mobile markets. Two of them - Nynex and US West - have supported
Cable &amp; Wireless's waiver application before the FCC.

FT  01 JUN 94 / The strange myth of the panicking small investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take away the liquidity of mutual funds and what do you have left? Not
surprisingly the mutual fund industry has reacted negatively to the recent
suggestion of Henry Kaufman that curbs should be placed on mutual fund
dealing, notably a 60-day or 90-day waiting period before investors could
sell their shares in stock or bond funds.
The practicalities of such a proposal are certainly suspect. The aim would
be to protect the securities markets from the destabilising waves of selling
by panicking small investors. Holdings of equities through mutual funds have
grown from Dollars 180bn to Dollars 700bn since the Wall Street crash of
October 1987. In theory the US stock market is that much more exposed to a
wave of fund liquidation. But a mutual fund curb might backfire.
Piles of selling orders would accumulate at investment company offices. The
exact total volume might not be generally known, but the fund managers would
immediately begin to build up liquidity in anticipation of the eventual
redemptions. Elsewhere, traders would front-run the anticipated wave of
transactions. The markets would prove to be just as volatile, but in the
event of a crash mutual fund investors would be the last to get out.
So why pick on mutual fund investors? There is evidence that they are
relatively stable in their behaviour, and that some kinds of institutional
investor are more prone to fickle attitudes. Hedge funds are obvious
examples.
It is true that anxieties are being expressed at present about the low cash
positions of some US mutual funds. The more volatile and aggressive small
cap funds, for example, have seen some cash outflows recently. On the other
hand, managers can point to the relative steadiness of investors' nerves in
past crises. In modern mutual fund history, monthly outflows have never come
close to exceeding the industry's aggregate cash position (though individual
funds may have encountered problems).
In the UK, too, general panic withdrawals from unit trusts are unknown. It
is true that inflows can be very sensitive to financial conditions, notably
the level of interest rates available on savings deposits, but once invested
the money stays put for a relatively long time. Even after the 1987 crash,
the unit trust industry only suffered net redemptions in two individual
months, and then on a trivial scale.
So why single out mutual fund investors for restriction? The Kaufman theory
appears to be that the big expansion in holdings has reflected the
participation of inexperienced investors shifting out of deposits and
unaccustomed to the idea of price volatility. However, much of the growth
may reflect a tendency for households to own mutual funds rather than stocks
directly - though direct personal holdings still account for 50 per cent of
corporate equities in the US.
Another important trend is for investors to own mutual funds through
long-term savings plans such as IRAs (individual retirement accounts). At
the end of last year nearly Dollars 450bn of mutual fund holdings were tied
up in various types of personal and corporate retirement plans.
Mutual funds hold just 11 per cent of US equities, less than a quarter of
the direct holdings of households, so to single out mutual funds for trading
curbs would put them at a disadvantage. In practice, money would move into
directly invested portfolios and into other institutionalised accounts which
managed to escape trading limitations.
If there is a volatility problem with open-ended funds it may be different
to the one that Henry Kaufman perceives: it is not that investors rush in a
dangerous way for the exit but that they plunge into the market at the wrong
time. We have just seen this in the UK, where a record for net sales was set
in March.
Mutual fund sales have, of course, long been a key indicator for contrarian
investors. Amateur money pushes the markets to unsustainable peaks, and the
commercial reputation of the industry suffers because so many customers
lured in at the top lose money quickly. Perhaps it would be better, for
their own protection, though not for any systemic reasons, if investors were
required to wait 90 days before putting their money in. They could safely be
allowed to take it out again any time they liked.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Banknote sales help De La Rue rise 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De La Rue, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, yesterday
reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, buoyed by particularly
strong banknote sales.
The group, which abandoned merger talks with Portals, the security paper
maker, last week, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 129.8m in the year to
March 31, up from Pounds 104.7m. Turnover from continuing operations grew by
7 per cent to Pounds 586.6m.
The latest profits include a Pounds 6.1m net gain on disposals. Leaving this
aside, pre-tax profits rose by 20.2 per cent to Pounds 123.7m. The shares
closed up 16p at 859p.
De La Rue held net cash of Pounds 267.7m at the year-end, well ahead of the
previous March's Pounds 170.9m. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said
the group was continuing to look at acquisitions, but any purchase would
have to be in a related area.
He said all three divisions had pushed up sales, operating profits and
margins.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 25 per cent to
Pounds 96.1m, underpinned by strong banknote demand from emerging nations.
Excluding the Brazilian operations, which were sold during the year, the
security printing division lifted sales by 16.4 per cent to Pounds 208.2m,
while operating profits increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 50.6m.
The division's margins widened from 20.8 to 24.3 per cent as a result of
enhanced production efficiency, an improved mix of banknote work - including
more sophisticated notes to beat counterfeiters - and favourable exchange
rate movements.
The payment systems division increased its sales, particularly in the US and
continental Europe, except for Germany, and improved margins through the
rationalisation of some of its manufacturing operations in Sweden and the
US. Profits increased by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 40.5m on sales marginally
ahead at Pounds 317.1m.
The new transaction systems division, seen as a longer term source of
growth, lifted sales by 12.4 per cent to Pounds 64.4m and profits by 72.4
per cent to Pounds 5m.
Net interest receipts were slightly higher at Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.6m).
Associates' profits increased 31.1 per cent to Pounds 15.6m.
Earnings per share rose to 49.9p, against 38.8p. A final dividend of 14p is
proposed, making a total of 20p, up from 17p.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Nissan Motor at record deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest carmaker, plunged to a record
consolidated pre-tax loss of Y202.4bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the year to March,
its worst financial performance since it became a public company.
However, Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK stayed in the black, albeit at a
greatly reduced Pounds 2.1m, against Pounds 29.6m. Nissan Motor (GB), the UK
sales and marketing subsidiary, managed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 731,000
following a loss of Pounds 16.8m in 1992, its first full year of operation.
The Nissan group, which has been hit by the appreciation of the yen and
recession in the Japanese and the European new car markets, warned yesterday
that it would suffer a third consecutive year of losses in 1994-95.
The group pre-tax loss almost doubled last year from Y108.1bn. Operating
losses jumped to Y144bn from Y7.2bn a year earlier, while its net loss rose
to Y86.9bn from Y56bn.
In Europe the company suffered heavy losses at Nissan Motor Iberica, in
Spain.
Nissan's worldwide vehicle production fell 7.4 per cent last year to 2.74m.
Domestic production declined by 14.1 per cent to 1.75m while production
overseas increased 7.2 per cent to 993,000.
Group turnover fell 6.4 per cent to Y5,801bn. Nissan performed strongly in
the US with a 15 per cent increase in sales volume, but this failed to
offset the decline in Europe and in the domestic market.
Overall new car sales have fallen for three years in succession in Japan,
while in western Europe new car sales dropped by more than 15 per cent last
year.
Nissan said that group losses reflected chiefly the drop in sales volumes in
Japan and in Europe, its costly restructuring in Spain, heavy depreciation
charges in Mexico, and the sharp appreciation of the yen.
The Nissan parent company announced a small net profit of Y7.6bn (Pounds
48.4m) as a result of gains from the heavy sale of securities, and will pay
a dividend of Y7 per share.
Mr Heiichi Hamaoka, managing director, warned that Nissan was being forced
to accelerate its restructuring and cost-cutting. 'We will do what we can to
return to the black.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Independents fail to secure review of British Gas assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent gas marketers have failed to persuade Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, to order a root-and-branch revaluation of the assets of British
Gas's transportation and storage system.
The independents believe the current valuation of the assets is too high,
and have lobbied strongly for Ofgas to reappraise it in its forthcoming
consultation paper on transportation and storage charges.
British Gas will charge the independents for use of the transportation and
storage system, but its earnings from this will be limited by applying a
permitted maximum rate of return to the value of the assets.
If, as the marketers believe, the assets are valued too high, British Gas
will be able to justify higher charges.
That would limit the ability of the independents to offer cheaper prices to
customers once the phased opening of the domestic market begins in 1996.
Ofgas officials say there is no time to launch such an extensive exercise in
the run-up to competition. They will instead rely on the assumptions used in
1992, when they devised the present tariff formula, which is presently set
at retail price index minus 4 percentage points.
At that time, Ofgas commissioned an independent assessment, which valued
British Gas's transportation and storage assets at about Pounds 17bn, a
figure with which British Gas broadly agrees but which some independent
marketers say is 'hopelessly inflated' because the system has been built to
too high specifications.
The marketers have also questioned whether British Gas needs all the assets
it has placed in transportation and storage.
Ofgas plans a full review of the transportation and storage and tariff
formulas before 1997, when the present tariff formula ends. The
transportation and storage consultation paper will include details of the
formula that will govern the price British Gas can charge over the next
three years for its transportation and storage facilities, now known as
TransCo. The new system is expected to be working by October.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission last year recommended a rate of return
for existing TransCo assets of 4 per cent-4.5 per cent, and 6.5 per cent-7.5
per cent for new assets. Ofgas officials say they would need a good reason
to do anything other than what the MMC recommended.
Some independent shippers have asked that a tariff of RPI -10 be set to
ensure that British Gas slashes what they consider to be an extravagant cost
base.
But Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, recently warned that it
needs a 'return which will enable us to maintain a viable and safe pipeline
system and encourage new investment'.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Labour plans curbs on hostile takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour party plans due out tomorrow provide for a shake-up of corporate
governance and a clampdown on hostile takeovers. Pressures on companies to
pay high dividends to City institutions would be reduced.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman - and a potential
Labour leadership candidate - said yesterday he wanted to 'remove the
terror' that frightened company chairmen into paying big dividends.
'Companies often have to place dividends before investment because they fear
a fall in their share price will make them vulnerable to a takeover,' he
said.
In a paper called Winning for Britain, Mr Cook blames much of the decline in
investment performance on the fact that over the past 15 years the
proportion of net profits taken out of the business in dividends has
increased from half to three quarters. The government is also reviewing
whether companies are paying too much in dividends.
Mr Cook wants to reverse the burden of proof in takeovers on to the company
launching a hostile bid to show that it is in the public interest. At
present, a hostile takeover would be stopped only if it clearly transgressed
competition rules.
Mr Cook accepts that curbing the number of hostile takeovers - expected to
increase again after a lull during the recession - will not be sufficient to
ensure that companies invest more and improve performance.
He is proposing a package of measures designed 'to encourage committed
owners, promote collective contribution to the strength of the business
enterprise and raise the priority of long-term organic development of
businesses'.
They include tax changes to encourage long-term holding of shares; better
information for pension fund trustees; statutory reporting of long-term
indicators of corporate strength in annual reports; and a review of whether
to establish a minimum legal standard for the composition of company boards.
Although the plans are likely to upset business organisations, they are less
ambitious than Labour's previous policies and there is a strong stress on
changing corporate 'culture' and encouraging collaborative networking
between companies.
Big companies will only be encouraged rather than forced to introduce
Labour's favoured two-tier board option, with a supervisory board monitoring
an executive board.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Top US Congressman charged with corruption: Rostenkowski may
face 'several years in jail'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US federal grand jury yesterday charged Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, the
powerful Democrat chairman of the House ways and means committee, with 17
counts of corrupt practices, including embezzlement, mail and wire fraud and
tampering with a witness.
Mr Eric Holder, the federal prosecutor in Washington, said Mr Rostenkowski,
now in his 36th year in Congress, had been guilty of 'a pattern of corrupt
activity going back for 20 years' and had 'embezzled hundreds of thousands
of dollars from his congressional expense allowances in order to enrich
himself, his family and his friends'.
'This indictment alleges that Congressman Rostenkowski used his elective
office for an extensive fraud on the American people,' he said.
Mr Rostenkowski is forced under House of Representatives rules to resign his
committee chairmanship, and his absence from this key panel is likely to
make passage of healthcare reform legislation this year no easier.
The indictments were brought after the failure of negotiations under which
Mr Rostenkowski would have pleaded guilty to lesser offences and stepped
down from the chairmanship of Ways and Means. But on Monday he declared he
was innocent of all charges and was determined to clear his name in court.
Mr Holder said that if Mr Rostenkowski was found guilty he would spend
'several years in jail'. He said an arraignment in a Washington court could
take place within 10 days but he warned that defence motions could delay an
actual trial for months or longer.
The indictments include charges that Mr Rostenkowski embezzled more than
Dollars 50,000 from the House post office by converting postage stamp
purchases into cash; that he misappropriated Dollars 40,000 from the House
stationery office in the form of gifts for friends; and that he cost the
House treasury Dollars 70,000 by leasing cars for his personal use.
Mr Rostenkowski was also charged with putting on his pay roll - paid for by
public funds - personnel who mostly performed private duties for him and his
family. The total cost was as much as Dollars 500,000, Mr Holder said.
A statement issued by Mr Rostenkowski late on Monday was unequivocal. 'I did
not commit any crimes. My conscience is clear and my 42-year record as an
elected official is one I am proud to once again run on.'
Fighting to 'regain my reputation in court is a far more attractive option
than pleading guilty to crimes I did not commit'.
Yesterday, the White House said it would continue to work with him.

FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Mediobanca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mediobanca will be relieved by yesterday's bounce in its share price. Not
only does it apparently show that the market is unconcerned by news that
four top executives at the Milan merchant bank are under investigation over
their role as advisers to the Ferruzzi-Montedison group. The higher share
price will also ensure a smoother passage for Mediobanca's forthcoming
L1,500bn equity issue. At yesterday's opening price of L15,300, the group's
shares were uncomfortably close to minimum level of L15,000 that it had set
for the issue.
Not that there was ever much doubt that the offering would go ahead. The
Italian portion of the issue is apparently already underwritten, while many
non-Italian banks would probably not wish to slight such a powerful force in
Italian finance by declining to take part in its fundraising. Even if
Mediobanca's share price dips beneath L15,000 in the coming weeks, it could
still press ahead with the issue.
Mediobanca needs the new equity to maintain its grip on Italian industry.
Several companies within Mediobanca's sphere have themselves recently issued
shares or are planning to do so. The merchant bank therefore needs funds to
avoid dilution. The money may also be used to accumulate stakes in the
upcoming privatisations of Stet and Enel. Mediobanca's allies have already
taken effective control of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano.
Though the government has recently tightened the rules to prevent a
recurrence in future privatisations, it remains to be seen whether they will
be effective.

FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise/Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest exchanges in the Lasmo bid battle have a rather desultory air
about them. Lasmo's Colombian find provides a modest boost to its claim that
a focused exploration strategy is paying off. Similarly, Enterprise has
scored a small victory by forcing Lasmo to modify claims that it had had
little international success.
But all this is pretty minor stuff. What the market is waiting for is an
improvement in Enterprise's all-paper bid. Today's announcement of the level
of acceptances at the first closing is expected to confirm that there is
little enthusiasm among Lasmo shareholders for the current offer. Given that
Enterprise's chairman Mr Graham Hearne is not about to retreat in the same
way De La Rue did last week, an enhanced bid is on the cards.
But Lasmo shareholders should not count on a dramatic improvement in the
offer. There is no sign of any white knight, so Enterprise is not under any
competitive pressure to increase its bid. Nor does it have the financial
resources to put up large amounts of cash. In fact, Enterprise would
probably need underwriting if even a modest portion of the bid were to
offered in cash. In the circumstances, it is hardly surprising that some
Lasmo shareholders have been taking the cash in the market with the result
that the company's share price has taken a slight knock. But it is still
comfortably above the value of the Enterprise offer.

FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The once pedestrian business of printing banknotes is booming. De La Rue
increased banknote sales by 17 per cent last year, four times the trend rate
of growth, due to demand from newly-independent countries. Profits grew by
rather more as rising capacity utilisation led to wider margins. While the
company's order book suggests the banknote bonanza will continue for a year
or two yet, such heady growth is unsustainable. In the longer term, rapid
progress in banknotes depends on unlocking public sector printing contracts
 -which is why Portal's connections with central banks were almost worth
bidding for.
Unless it can win plum privatisations, De La Rue's interests in automated
cash handling and payments systems will eventually have to take up the
running. Even allowing for the favourable impact of currency movements,
these businesses are performing well enough. Selling cash handling equipment
should become easier as banks emerge from recession and start to refurbish
branches. Such favourable impact from the banking cycle is already being
felt in the US.
If organic growth starts to slow, De La Rue's Pounds 260m cash pile will
become a more pressing issue. In relation to net assets the company is
already holding more cash than Glaxo. It is a measure of De La Rue's small
balance sheet that fresh equity would almost certainly be required to offset
the goodwill from a sizeable acquisition. That is all the more reason to
deal with the cash pile before it starts to exert real drag on the shares'
rating.

FT  01 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Bonds under the hammer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp falls in German government bonds yesterday are an object lesson on
the dangers of issuing authorities trying to play the markets. The
Bundesbank may have thought that it would calm nerves by withdrawing its
second debt auction in a week. But far from being reassured by the temporary
prospect of lower supply, the market simply worried that the move actually
revealed a serious lack of demand. The Bank of England has got itself in a
similarly awkward position by its reluctance to issue long gilts even when
rates were at their lows. How much better off both would be if they simply
borrowed routinely and regularly across the maturity spectrum. Then there
would be no particular signal for markets to misread.
At least the Bundesbank may be right when it says the public sector has no
pressing need for cash. The central bank transferred its DM18bn profits to
the government in April and borrowing was heavy at the end of last year.
Even so, withdrawing auctions cannot become a habit. Given the size of the
budget deficit the Bundesbank will have to return before too long. The
still-unanswered question is who will buy the paper on offer.
With international hedge funds and investment bank proprietary trading desks
scaling down activities, bond markets are becoming more reliant on
traditional domestic investors. The Bundesbank has pointed to the hope that
its rate cuts would attract such buyers out along the yield curve, but the
swollen M3 money supply suggests they remain reluctant to move out of cash.
There is some evidence that retail investors are starting to nibble. It may
take a further rise in real rates to bring them out in force.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Out of sync with their partners: Pressure to devalue the
Greek currency will not abate while the economy is unbalanced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek investors, some carrying attache cases filled with cash, crowded into
banks and brokers' offices yesterday to take advantage of the highest
interest rates of the postwar period. The drachma crisis has sent short-term
rates soaring, with commercial banks offering returns on deposits that match
the Socialist government's issue of a new series of high-yielding bonds.
The Greek currency has survived more than two weeks of speculative pressure,
but at a heavy cost. The sharp increase in interest rates on tax-free
government securities is the latest move in the battle to avert a
devaluation.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist prime minister, insists devaluation
must be avoided because it would fuel inflation and undermine confidence. He
sounded optimistic at the weekend, asserting: 'The battle for the drachma is
still continuing and it is critical, but it has effectively been won.'
The drachma slipped yesterday, closing at 148.1 against the D-Mark compared
to Dr147.9 on Monday. But it is still supported on a cushion of foreign
currency from overseas investors attracted by the government's series of
'superbonds'. A one-month zero-coupon bond was issued at 27 per cent, while
the three-month Treasury bill, offered last month at 16.5 per cent, now
carries a rate of 25.5 per cent.
Greece's currency crisis was triggered by the government's decision on May
16 to lift all remaining controls on capital movement, six weeks ahead of
the deadline set by the European Union. There has been no flight of capital,
because of high domestic interest rates and the introduction by the central
bank of complex regulations for transferring funds abroad. But
liberalisation provoked immediate attacks on the drachma. Financial markets
expected that the government would devalue rather than exhaust Greece's
modest Dollars 9bn foreign exchange reserves in trying to support the
currency.
The reasons for the drachma's problems, however, go deeper. Because of its
chronically high inflation rate, Greece was not able to join the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The central bank's 'hard
drachma' policy, allowing the drachma to depreciate against other EU
currencies at a slower pace than inflation, has made the currency appreciate
in real terms: most estimates suggest the drachma is overvalued by at least
20 per cent.
Another reason for the drachma's current weakness is the failure of recent
governments to reduce the public sector deficit, which this year could reach
17 per cent of gross domestic product. With spending exceeding economic
growth for the past decade, Greece's accumulated debt is now equal to about
150 per cent of annual GDP. This month, the government must raise some
Dr450bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from domestic and foreign investors to pay interest
charges on this debt.
'The debt is deterring investment. Servicing costs are so large that
interest rates cannot come down. And the new bond issues will lock the
government into maintaining even higher interest rates,' says Mr Peter
Doukas of Citibank, the US bank.
Mr Papandreou's decision to defend the drachma by raising short-term
interest rates comes at a particularly awkward moment. Unless measures to
boost income are taken quickly, a shortfall in tax revenues through evasion
will increase the government's borrowing requirement this year to 18 per
cent of GDP, against a budget target of 12.8 per cent.
The need to improve revenues has forced the Socialists to abandon their
ideological opposition to privatisation. Unbundling the state is now a
priority, with public offerings being planned for several utilities,
starting with OTE, the state telecoms monopoly. The flotation of 25 per cent
of OTE later this year should raise Dr250bn, enough to cover half the
projected revenue shortfall.
More drastic measures, however, will be needed to restore the drachma's
stability. Economists are calling for both short-term measures to boost
revenues and structural reforms to reduce the annual public sector deficit.
'Now that capital controls are gone, the drachma can come under pressure at
any time. The only serious defence is to address the underlying problems -
the yearly deficits and the total debt,' says Ms Miranda Xafa of Salomon
Brothers, the US investment bank.
Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, the finance minister, claims that renewed
efforts to collect tax arrears will yield an extra Dr200bn later in the year
to cover the rest of the expected shortfall. With European Parliament
elections less than two weeks away, the Socialists are reluctant to incur
the political cost of launching an emergency fiscal package.
Mr Papadopoulos argues that the benefits of short-term measures such as
price increases for petrol and utilities would be outweighed by their impact
on the inflation rate. Since their return to power last October, the
Socialists' main economic task has been to bring inflation down to single
digits during 1994. But in April the year-on-year inflation rate crept up
from 10.2 to 10.4 per cent, ending a steady 10-month decline.
Nevertheless, the government is under increasing pressure from its EU
partners to introduce structural reforms. The rising deficits and debt are
pulling Greece further from the Maastricht economic convergence targets. The
gap with the rest of the EU will widen again this year, with GDP growth in
Greece forecast at less than 1 per cent.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the European Commissioner for economic affairs,
has proposed that Greece should use its position as EU president to win
approval at this month's Corfu summit for an economic package. To reduce the
public sector deficit, it should include deep spending cuts. With payroll
and pension costs accounting for 40 per cent of budget outlays, there seems
no alternative to shutting loss-making state enterprises and eliminating a
large proportion of the 50,000 civil service jobs. Like their conservative
predecessors, the Socialists are unwilling to adopt such unpopular measures.
Yet they could pay a high price for ignoring the Commission's advice. Greece
is already unpopular with its partners for failing to implement two previous
stabilisation plans since 1990 and over its blockade of the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia. The Commission is preparing legal action against
Greece for violating Treaty of Rome requirements on EU trade with the
embargo.
Recovery in Greece is based on the assumption of increased inflows of EU
assistance, amounting to Ecu16.8bn over the next five years. As well as
promoting growth through grants that will cover up to 80 per cent of
financing for large infrastructure projects, the funds will help to keep
Greece's current account deficit at manageable levels - about 2 per cent of
GDP. But if Greece fails to make progress towards the Maastricht targets,
some EU financing may be withheld.
Such progress may be difficult because the chances for economic recovery are
now threatened by the turmoil on Greek financial markets. Triple-digit
interest rates on the interbank market are creating a liquidity squeeze for
Greek banks, now being reflected in soaring interest rates for corporate
borrowers.
The banks' most reliable customers saw interest charges on 'working capital'
jump from 25 to more than 40 per cent last week, while new borrowers were
turned away. Moreover, the liquidity problem is likely to continue as
deposits are siphoned off into high-yielding government securities. 'It's
impossible to hold money market rates at such high levels for more than a
couple of weeks without disrupting the whole economy,' Ms Xafa says.
Few economists believe the drachma can withstand prolonged pressure. Given
Greece's underlying economic imbalances, the question of devaluation is
likely to resurface. In the medium-term, the 'hard drachma' policy will have
to be relaxed to accommodate a faster slide than the 6 to 7 per cent
projected for this year. But the longer the government delays the needed
fiscal stabilisation, the greater the risk that the decline of the currency
will become totally out of control. As Mr Doukas says: 'The question is not
whether, but when and by how much the drachma will come down.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The battle for dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a widespread assumption to the contrary, Tory governments are not
invariably on the side of big dividends. In the early 1970s, the Heath
administration shocked the City by capping payments to shareholders while
imposing a pay freeze. In a recent speech, the financial secretary to the
Treasury, Mr Stephen Dorrell, made it clear that the present government
would not repeat the mistake of intervening directly in fixing dividend
levels. But he suggested that companies appeared to be over-distributing - a
view shared by Labour - and that this could have an adverse impact on
investment.
The government's case has been vigorously attacked by fund managers,
including Mr Paddy Linaker, managing director of the M &amp; G Group, in these
pages. His views are widely shared by other institutions including the
pension funds, which have been caught on a particularly raw nerve. The
average British pension fund is now mature, with pensions being paid out of
investment income rather than new cash flow from contributions. Pension fund
managers are thus more sensitive to changes in investment income. And they
have been stung by the reduction in tax relief on dividends introduced by
former chancellor Mr Norman Lamont, who failed to see that taxing pension
funds simply forces companies to raise pension contributions.
In economic theory, investors should be indifferent to whether profits are
distributed or reinvested. But statistical research by investment bankers
BZW has shown that since 1918 two-thirds of the total UK equity return has
come from income rather than capital. There is thus a natural tendency for
British fund managers to pay particular attention to dividends. And since
the growth of tax-exempt institutions has introduced a bias towards
distribution into the corporation tax system, it is not surprising if
dividend cover is on the low side by international standards.
Reluctant buyers
For pension funds approaching maturity the obvious step should be to
increase holdings of gilt-edged. Yet British fund managers' memory of the
destruction of fixed-interest values is too recent to make them other than
reluctant buyers. Small wonder that they now want the equivalent of the
commercial property landlord's upward-only rent review in equities. The
question is whether this attempt to turn equity into a more stable, low-risk
investment makes sense for companies and the wider financial system.
Artificial boost
There is anecdotal evidence that the recent reduction in dividend cover to
historically low levels is partly a hangover from the 1980s contested
takeover boom. Industrialists have no wish to alienate investors who may be
the arbiters of their fate in a future bid battle. Yet some argue that a
fall in dividend cover is appropriate in today's low-inflation environment,
since historic cost accounting no longer provides such a big artificial
boost to reported profits. And while research by academics at the Institute
for Fiscal Studies suggests that the level of retentions does affect
investment spending for a significant proportion of companies, the
historical correlation between high payouts and high investment by
industrial and commercial companies remains striking.
CBI surveys suggest that industrialists are far more worried about
inadequate returns on investment than shortage of finance. That, in turn,
reinforces the suspicion that companies have been slow to reduce hurdle
rates of return and payback periods in response to disinflation. This leads
to two mutually contradictory possibilities. Either companies are reluctant
to invest because they believe that inflation is set to rise again, in which
case their hurdle rates of return are right and dividend cover is too thin
on a historic cost basis. Or the constraint on investment that Mr Dorrell
fears has nothing to do with low dividend cover and everything to do with
management's failure to adjust hurdle rates to disinflation.
The way to resolve this dilemma is not for the government to tinker with the
tax system on the basis of inconclusive data. Time and market forces will
anyway help bring about an adjustment. For their part, industrialists should
recognise the legitimate income needs of the institutions, but be robust in
defending their cash flow when prudence requires.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Tangled yarn in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Ireland has the highest unemployment rate in Britain, an economy
unhealthily dependent on public support and an image which can deter foreign
investors. Any private sector manufacturing project which promises to create
hundreds of jobs there should normally be welcomed. However, such a welcome
can only be extended with confidence when there is clear evidence that the
project stands a reasonable chance of success.
It is difficult, on the basis of the public information available to date,
to form such a judgement about the plan by Hualon, a Taiwanese industrial
conglomerate, to build a Pounds 157m synthetic fabrics plant in Belfast. Too
many unresolved questions surround the background of some of the individuals
involved, the economics of the project and the manner in which it has been
dealt with by both British authorities and the European Commission.
These questions take on particular importance because the plant is being
assisted with Pounds 61m of public money. It is surprising that the
government proposes to give these funds to a company, two of whose top
managers have been charged - and one of them convicted - in connection with
an alleged financial fraud. Ministers have declined to say whether they knew
of the charges and, if so, why they considered it proper to back the
project. Inquiries have been referred to Northern Ireland's Industrial
Development Board, which conducted the negotiations with Hualon. The IDB's
response has also been unsatisfactory.
Shrinking market
Lack of clarity also surrounds the plant's proposed operations. The market
it is being set up to supply is already shrinking, and will face further
pressures as the EU lifts controls on imports from developing countries with
far lower labour costs. The IDB says Hualon plans to compete by using highly
automated capital-intensive production methods. Yet it claims the plant will
employ 1,800 people. Not only is that figure regarded as high by others in
the textiles industry; but the European Commission says it was able to
approve state aid for the plant only because its technology is so basic that
it will not threaten other EU producers.
Just where the truth lies is impossible to say, since the IDB refuses to
disclose any details of Hualon's business plan or of the procedures used to
vet the project. Nor is there any evidence that the business plan was
scrutinised by independent experts before the go-ahead was given. It is
difficult to imagine any prospective private investor not taking such an
elementary precaution. The IDB's apparent failure to do so hardly encourages
confidence in the plant's viability.
UK lobbying
A different set of issues arises from the conditions in which the project
was approved by Brussels. The UK government's energetic lobbying for
approval - against competition objections from commission experts - is
inconsistent with its repeated criticisms of other countries' industrial
subsidies. Nor has the Commission's apparent readiness to yield to political
entreaties enhanced its reputation for impartiality.
Beyond that, the case highlights a deeper dilemma in EU policy. In
principle, its efforts to encourage the transfer of resources to Europe's
poorer regions are to be commended. In practice, the result has too often
been rivalry between governments to woo mobile investments with large
financial inducements. These penalise other producers and distort markets,
particularly in sectors such as synthetic fibres where there is chronic
excess capacity. Such policies also risk attracting marginal investment
projects which cannot raise funds elsewhere.
Above all, governments' overriding desire to create jobs can too easily
impair their judgment. A memorable consequence was the De Lorean car venture
in Northern Ireland, which collapsed in the early 1980s. There is no
evidence to suggest the Hualon plant will suffer a similar fate. But
taxpayers and the people of Belfast need more information about the project.
The political accountability of the IDB also needs to be clarified. If
ministers will not provide answers voluntarily, the newly-formed Commons
Northern Ireland committee should require them to do so.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Personal View: German M3 boiler builds up steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS MAYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As German broad money supply (M3) now seems set to exceed its target for the
third year in a row, pressure on the Bundesbank is growing to ignore what
Bundesbank president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, calls an 'important intermediate
indicator'. The Bundesbank itself has been strengthening the hand of critics
of monetary targeting by lowering interest rates sharply despite very strong
money supply growth in the past six months.
Abandoning M3 now as a signpost for monetary policy would be a grave mistake
for at least two reasons. First, there is no convincing evidence so far that
the long-run relationship between money supply growth and inflation has
ceased to exist. Publicly available independent studies, such as those from
the Kiel Institute of World Economics and the OECD, have found some evidence
for a short-term disturbance in the demand for money in the wake of German
unification. But they have failed to reject the hypothesis that the long-run
demand for money has remained stable.
Second, excessive money supply growth has reflected the partial monetary
financing of government debt, which, if continued, could threaten the
purchasing power of the D-Mark.
In recent months Bundesbank representatives and other observers have
attempted to explain the rampant growth of money supply on the basis of
portfolio shifts between money and 'monetary capital' (the longer-term
liabilities of the credit institutions, excluded from M3).
In reality, however, expansion of credit has been driving money supply
growth. At the end of 1993, total bank credit amounted to about DM3,800bn,
money (M3) to DM1,900bn, and monetary capital to roughly DM2,100bn.
With bank credit rising at an annual rate of 10.3 per cent between the end
of 1991 and the end of 1993, monetary capital would have had to grow
substantially above this rate to neutralise the effects of credit growth on
M3.
In fact, monetary capital grew at an annual average rate of only 7.7 per
cent, so the annual rise of M3 during this period was 8.7 per cent.
If the expansion of bank lending had been used to finance investment in
future productive capacity, there would have been little reason to worry.
However, between the second half of 1990 and the second half of 1993, real
investment in machinery and equipment in united Germany declined by about 4
per cent. This suggests that most of the credit was used for housing
construction and consumption.
An important source of the demand for bank credit was the public sector.
Between the end of 1989 and mid-1993, public debt rose by 52 per cent. By
the end of 1994, the rise will be more than 115 per cent. The lion's share
of this increase was incurred to finance transfers to east Germany. Since
the appetite of German domestic savers for government bonds was not
sufficient to absorb the new debt, the government exported part of it by
selling bonds abroad, and allowed the monetisation of another part.
Reflecting foreign purchases of government bonds, the German public sector's
external liabilities rose by 115 per cent between the end of 1989 and
mid-1993. Reflecting the monetary financing of government debt, bank credit
to the public sector rose by 56 per cent between the end of 1989 and
February 1994.
As a result of the increase in public bank credit, banks' holdings of
government bonds rose by 132 per cent during this period.
As a result of these factors, M3 increased by 46 per cent between 1989 and
1993, considerably outstripping the rise in real GDP in united Germany of
only 19 per cent.
Twice this century, after the first and second world wars, the monetisation
of government debt has led to hyperinflation in Germany and subsequent
monetary upheavals.
It is worth remembering that, in both periods, the government authorities
undermined and eventually broke the initial resistance of the Reichsbank
against monetary financing of government debt.
It would be clearly exaggerated to compare the past financial burdens caused
by lost wars with those arising in the wake of German unification.
Nonetheless, if the central bank helps to finance the rapid accumulation of
public debt, the government-financed operation to shore up east Germany
since unification has clear potential to create creeping inflation.
In such circumstances, ignoring soaring money supply would be like
suppressing the information from a pressure gauge of a boiler in which the
steam is building up.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Spanish stanza
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The literary brilliance of London's brokers marches on, with Williams de
Broe choosing to head a recent research note on Spanish bonds with the
following lines from W H Auden's poem In Memory of WB Yeats:
In the deserts of the heart
Let the healing fountains start,
In the prison of his days
Teach the free man how to praise.
It used the text to suggest that former central bank governor Mario Rubio's
stint in jail was 'of minor importance to Spanish politics and to the Bonos
market', and Felipe Gonzalez 'is a good doctor'.
Staggering percipience. The boys at de Broe should have concluded with
another Auden verse of equal relevance:
The glacier knocks in the cupboard,
The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
A lane to the land of the dead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conclusive evidence that the Cuban revolution is over: the government is
trying to interest foreign investors in rehabilitating and operating
Havana's Sloppy Joe's bar, formerly one of the country's leading tourist
attractions.
Closed almost 30 years ago, the bar featured popular, albeit down-market
fare. Whoever takes on the job has been promised the same building.
But will the famed innocent-tasting but potent daiquiris and planter's
punches, as well as the splendid jamon y queso sandwiches return?
Missing for sure will be the stunning senoritas once available for
encounters at Sloppy Joe's. Some aspects of the revolution continue to defy
change.
The building containing the bar still has photos of some of its better known
clients, including boxer Joe Louis and film stars such as Errol Flynn, Ava
Gardner, Frank Sinatra and Alec Guinness.
One thing will have changed: the new bar is certain to have a no-smoking
section. Maybe the country's leading non-smoker - Fidel himself - will take
a seat.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark did not much like the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development when it was headed by Jacques Attali.
Nothing much has changed now it's run by another Frenchman, Jacques de
Larosiere.
Svend Auken, the Danish environment minister, has peeved the EBRD over his
invitation to east European environmental ministers to attend a conference
in Copenhagen tomorrow. The subject: discussion of 'soft' loans to clean up
messes left by the former communist regimes.
The EBRD is still very sensitive over its role and likes to keep all matters
east European under its belt.
Thus, suggests Auken, the bank is trying to flush away his meeting. 'Given a
choice between building a Coca Cola plant . . . and a purification plant for
sewage waste, they (the EBRD) will always choose the former,' says an Auken
aide.
The Danes claim the EBRD is pointedly sending only junior staff to
Copenhagen, and that the bank has put word out that those east Europeans
sending ministerial-level deputations can whistle for cash in future.
Such is the strength of EBRD influence today, that all the ministers invited
have told Auken they will attend with pleasure.
Wouldn't have happened in Attali's day . . .

FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Lea makes way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it that otherwise sensible economists are seduced by the bright
lights of the media? It can't be the cash, since the best ones are already
paid a handsome whack. It must be the chance of fame and glory.
Ruth Lea, currently chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers, is joining the
UK's Independent Television News as economics editor, taking on the
difficult task of explaining to a mass audience the intricacies of M0 in
50-second sound bites.
Lea is thus going to be ITN's answer to Peter Jay, the BBC's economics guru.
Jay declines to tone down his highbrow style and complex sentences - refined
since his days as presenter of Weekend World in the 1970s - and thus has an
avid following of at least three - the governor of the Bank of England, the
programme producer, and Jay himself.
Lea has a more crisp, down-to-earth style, no doubt honed by 16 years in the
civil service. She will need it in the increasingly tabloid-style ITN.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Joint plea for a downer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We now all know that president Clinton never inhaled. No such shyness from
Aussie politicos.
Hours into her new job, the irrepressible Bronwyn Bishop, the Liberal
Party's health spokeswoman, announced she supported tobacco advertising.
When Carmen Lawrence, federal health minister, berated Bishop for this
attitude, Bishop countered by recalling Lawrence's admission that she had
used marijuana and 'lived to tell the tale'.
With Swiftian wit, the health minister riposted by saying that Bishop's boss
Alexander Downer, had said much the same about his encounters with the weed,
which perhaps explains why he has been picked as the new head of the
Australian opposition.
Prime minister Paul Keating - former manager of rock band The Ramrods - is
in the clear: 'The heaviest I got was a few cases of beer behind the stage
after a concert,' he recently acknowledged.
But despite all this badinage, Canberra wits suggest the real problem with
local politicians is that they all remember to exhale.

FT  01 JUN 94 / No to D-day flags: The anniversary should not be a selective
event inspired by nostalgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Monday, certain western governments will be celebrating the anniversary
of the D-day landings 50 years ago. The invasion of Normandy by American,
British and other allied forces was, of course, an extraordinary military
exploit; a great achievement of strategic organisation, a scene of heroism,
and a turning point in the war against Hitler's Nazi regime. But with the
perspective of all that has happened since, it is hard to understand why
this particular military event is being given this kind of public emphasis
by today's political leaders.
First, it is obviously inappropriate to embark on any kind of simplistic
military triumphalism. This was an achievement only bought with immense
human suffering, on both sides. There are veterans who lost comrades, and
families that lost fathers, husbands or brothers; it is they who can claim
an inalienable part of the truth about this campaign. If D-day is to be
remembered, it should surely be in a solemn commemoration in church or by a
graveside, not with the nationalistic waving of flags. The significance of
the Normandy invasion surely should not be reduced to the public rhetoric of
patriotic glory.
In any case, the D-day celebrations seem designed to convey a misleading
interpretation of history. The flag-waving tacitly suggests that it was the
western allies who defeated Hitler, single-handed. We know that the former
Soviet Union played at least as big a part, and suffered much bigger loss of
life; but do we celebrate the seige of Leningrad, or the battle of
Stalingrad, or the reconquest of Ukraine? We do not.
The reluctance of western propagandists at the time to publicise the heroism
of the Russians was subsequently reinforced by the cold war. But, in
addition, the western celebrations of the Normandy landings have been kept
alive as part of a hidden agenda; or rather, two hidden agendas, one French,
one British.
The French have promoted the D-day commemorations for reasons of national
mythology, the British for national nostalgia.
For the French, it is a way of sustaining the legend that, in the liberation
of France, they played an equal part with the Americans, the British and the
other allies. This is a partial view of history. General de Gaulle was a
great man, and the Resistance made an important contribution; but the French
role in winning the war in the west was marginal compared with the
overwhelming part played by the Americans.
The Gaullist legend became a vital part of the mythology, to exorcise the
painful memory of France's humiliating collapse in 1940 and the long and
willing collaboration of the Petain regime with Hitler's Germany.
The exorcism and the mythology were necessary, in turn, to justify France's
role, from 1944 on, as one of the big four postwar powers, with a share in
the occupation of Germany and a permanent seat on the United Nations
Security Council. Since France's great-power eminence is now challenged by
the rise of united Germany, it is all the more important to keep alive the
memory of D-day.
For Britain, the commemoration of D-day has been made a central feature of
the national nostalgia for the days of military glory, when Britain was
great and victorious. Above all, those were the days when Britain was
allied, on what seemed like almost equal terms, with the Americans. The
British have never quite got over the excitement of the association.
The habits and principles of military co-operation developed for D-day
became the indelible and sacred template for the later military integration
of Nato; and the British are still playing the role of high priests of Nato,
as if history and American policy had not moved on.
In political terms, the memory of the Anglo-American line-up against the
continental Axis established a distorting prism which is still reflected
today in the knee-jerk anti-Europeanism of Britain's ruling Conservative
party.
For the purposes of its campaign for the European parliament election on
June 9 and 12, the Conservative party appears to be trying to idealise D-day
as the epitome of a lost 'golden age'. The reality is that it was one
important turning point in a world war which only a minority can now
remember; it was not the end of history.
In the meantime, the kaleidoscope has shifted several times in spectacular
fashion. The Russians, who were then our allies, became our enemies for 45
years, but are now friends with us again, or at least precarious partners.
The Germans who were then the anathema of the civilised world, soon became
our allies, and central protagonists in the long process of building a
peaceful, democratic and integrated Europe.
If we were celebrating D-day as a symbol of the defeat of Nazism, it would
be more broad-minded if we included the Russians; and it should be easier to
do so now that we have defeated the aggressive pretensions of Soviet
communism, especially since we did so, not through war, but through the
peaceful strategy of deterrence exerted by the North Atlantic alliance. But
we could also celebrate the Normandy invasion as a symbol of the banishment
for the subsequent four decades of war from the continent of Europe; in
which case we should include the Germans.
Instead, we are to have a selective celebration, inspired by an atavistic
nostalgia, which seems designed to deny everything that has been learned in
Europe over the past 50 years. It seems a great pity.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Accountability of societies probed: Governance may need
change, says Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering ways of making building societies more
accountable to their members as part of the Treasury review of the 1986
legislation which governs societies.
But societies are set to retain some protection from predatory takeover
offers by banks or other organisations.
In a delay to the original schedule, the first stage of the review is now
expected to be announced to the Commons in the second half of this month.
Officials have submitted their initial views, but ministers have yet to
decide what changes they wish to make.
The review, set up in January, will also have to take account of the outcome
of the legal challenge to the agreed Pounds 1.8bn Lloyds Bank offer for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. The two days of hearings ended
last week, but judgment has been reserved.
Despite the lobbying from banks such as Abbey National and TSB Group,
ministers see political disadvantages in exposing societies to hostile
takeover offers by other institutions.
There is a recognition at the Treasury, however, that corporate governance
arrangements which were adequate when societies were smaller organisations
now need changes. The largest societies each have more than 1m members.
Although many societies insist they are already accountable, measures to
improve accountability appear to be the price they will have to pay for the
greater freedoms they will enjoy as a result of the review.
Among suggestions to the Treasury is a requirement that, if a society's
board advises accepting an offer from a bank, then it should obtain two
independent valuations in order to ensure that members do not lose from the
society being undervalued.
The second stage of the review is likely to consider what specific changes
can be carried out through existing powers, through the new powers which
will be available from the de-regulation bill currently before parliament,
and what would require new legislation.
Some of the existing restrictions on societies - most notably the ceiling of
40 per cent on the amount of funds they can raise on the wholesale market -
look certain to be relaxed.
Among other changes sought by leading societies is a rise in the limit on
bonuses that can be paid to members when two societies merge, and an
increase in the very limited stake that a society can hold in a general
insurance company.
Some constraints will be retained, however, as the Treasury seems likely to
prefer an evolutionary approach: the government will argue that the option
of conversion to plc status remains open to societies which believe they
should be able to operate outside the regulatory restrictions.

majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERALD FRANKEL and Mr BEN COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Chalfont and others are quite wrong to put forward their view of
the European Union as that of the 'silent industrial majority' (Letters, May
31). The millions of owners and employees of small businesses would be
unlikely to agree with its main contentions.
The European single market may suit multinationals but it remains a threat
rather than an opportunity for most small UK firms (only the largest
companies, for example, can afford to commit resources to ensuring that new
European standards are not to their disadvantage).
The European social chapter is irrelevant to small companies, which are
specifically exempted by Article 2 ('Directives shall avoid imposing
administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold
back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings').
They are more worried by issues such as late payment by larger firms.
The potential entry into the European Union of low-cost central and eastern
European countries, while welcome to importers and to multinationals seeking
ever cheaper labour, fills most small firms with dread.
By all means give space to Lord Chalfont and his friends. But please
acknowledge which part of British industry they are coming from.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Re-enter the dragon of controversy: The latest allegations
to swirl around the Welsh Development Agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the Welsh Development Agency. The office is now closed,' began the
recorded telephone message yesterday morning at the agency's Pearl House
headquarters, a landmark 18-storey building in central Cardiff.
An extended bank holiday might have come as a relief to the beleaguered
staff at the government-funded agency, as it faces yet another brouhaha over
the way it is run. On the other hand, its answerphone message might be
symbolic of its clouded future - even if closure itself is not on the
agenda. Morale at the agency, responsible to the Welsh Office for promoting
economic development in Wales and improving the physical environment, is
low.
'Everyone is confused,' said one insider. 'Every time there is something
positive, there is then another knocking story.'
The latest allegations centre on a BBC Wales television investigation. The
broadcast last night claimed that the Welsh Office had unlawfully used the
agency to channel Pounds 7m in grants to mid-Wales, with the presumed
purpose of bolstering Conservative prospects in marginal constituencies
after the region had lost assisted area status in 1982. This, the programme
claimed, was outside the agency's legal powers.
As the Labour party called for the resignation of Mr John Redwood, Welsh
secretary, he retorted by denouncing the BBC for what he called 'scandalous
allegations' and a 'put-up job'. He said the grants had been legally
disbursed and parliament had been told of the scheme in 1982.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the latest claims - and Mr Redwood put the
calls for his resignation in the context of campaigning for next week's
European Parliament elections - the government's embarrassment over Welsh
quangos in general, and the WDA in particular, remains considerable.
Since Mr Redwood succeeded Mr David Hunt as Welsh secretary in May last
year, he has confronted a seemingly unending series of disclosures
concerning the quangos - the unofficial name for non-departmental unelected
public bodies.
At present, the Conservatives only hold four of the 38 parliamentary seats
in Wales, and the growth in the principality of quangos since the Tories
came to office in 1979 is seen by many government critics as a way of
bypassing the electorate. Professor Kevin Morgan, of the department of city
and regional planning at the University of Wales, last autumn published a
study of quangos pointedly called The Democratic Deficit, which called for
more account-ability.
The WDA, as the biggest Welsh quango with a total budget of Pounds 167m for
this year, is at the centre of the argument about the role of such bodies.
Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, appointed chairman by Mr Redwood last summer to rid
the agency of its aura of unacceptable behaviour, was found to have been a
former Conservative party fund-raiser overseas.
While Mr Redwood denied having known this when he appointed Mr Rowe-Beddoe,
the incident served to reinforce claims that Welsh Office appointees to
quangos have not always been politically neutral.
The WDA itself was set up by act of parliament in 1975 (under a Labour
government) and has played the leading role in dealing with Wales's legacy
of old heavy industries - coal, iron and steel. Its efforts at land
reclamation, urban regeneration and winning overseas investment have been
widely praised.
What has not been admired is the way in which it failed to reconcile its
responsibilities as an agency of government, accountable to parliament, with
its attempts to play an entrepreneurial role more appropriate to the private
sector.
Its entrepreneurial culture stems from the days of Mr Peter Walker, now Lord
Walker. As Welsh secretary in 1988 he chose Dr Gwyn Jones to be chairman of
the WDA. Although the post is sometimes called 'the second most important in
Wales', Mr Walker did not have it advertised, nor did he seek personal
references from Dr Jones, then a little-known Swansea businessman in his
late thirties. Dr Jones, described as 'dynamic' by advocates and
'flamboyant' by critics, successfully promoted Wales and the agency on an
international stage.
Mr Walker gave Dr Jones the brief of recasting the WDA's strategy to make it
more commercially aggressive and, in particular, to devote time to winning
inward investment. The agency's achievements in that latter aim have been
significant. But Mr Walker's bullishness that the Welsh economy could be
rapidly transformed, with the WDA acting as a catalyst, has proved to be
misplaced, even though unemployment was brought down to the UK national
average.
While Mr Walker and Dr Jones were selling Wales around the world, however,
the agency's managers failed to stop the kind of internal practices which
last year were criticised by the Commons public accounts committee.
While there was no evidence of corruption, these included a loss of Pounds
1.4m on an unapproved agency redundancy scheme, the provision of free
private motoring for senior agency executives, expenditure of more than
Pounds 300,000 on consultancy fees to consider partial privatisation, which
was not identified separately in accounts, and the appointment of a
convicted fraudster as marketing director. Another board member until
recently was Sir Donald Walters, a prominent Conservative supporter in
Wales.
Dr Jones ended his chairmanship early last year. Mr Philip Head resigned as
chief executive last October after the public accounts committee's
criticisms, and other heads rolled, including that of Mr Mike Henry,
director of corporate services, who is bringing a case of unfair dismissal,
and who contributed to last night's BBC programme.
A wholesale restructuring of the agency, which entails the loss of about 70
of its 420 jobs, is under way under Mr Rowe-Beddoe, and a new chief
executive, Mr Barry Hartop. The board has been strengthened by the
appointment of Professor Garyl Rhys, an automotive industry expert, and
Rhiannon Chapman, former director of the Industrial Society.
One ex-officio vacancy on the WDA board is that of the chairmanship of
another quango, the Development Board for Rural Wales. The awkward reason
for the vacancy is that Mr Glyn Davies, the rural board's chairman, resigned
last month in the wake of another blistering report by the Commons public
accounts committee over an illegal housing allocation scheme. No successor
has yet been appointed because Mr Redwood is reviewing the rural board's
entire future.
The Welsh Office itself has not managed to divorce itself from criticisms of
the quangos. Earlier this year, Mr Michael Scholar, permanent secretary,
found himself taken to task by the public accounts committee for the Welsh
Office's failure to demand disciplinary action at the quangos, and only last
month the committee described the department's monitoring of public accounts
as 'unacceptable'.
While Mr Redwood may feel he is unfairly bearing the brunt of allegations
relating to events that took place before his time, after his first year in
office the quangos continue to provide ammunition for his opponents. Board
members are on the defensive and regard much of the criticism as politically
motivated. Yesterday, one commented: 'There are axes being ground. If the
power base were reversed, would it be very different?'
Prof Morgan counters by saying that the common thread in the scandals is the
culpability of the Welsh Office in its monitoring of the quangos. 'The key
issue is to try to restore some credibility to the appointment process - it
is far from being transparent and certainly not fair,' he says. 'It needs to
be far more impartial. The second issue is the way they are regulated.'
This leaves the task of raising the credibility of 'quangoland', as Mr
Redwood himself has described it, firmly at the Welsh secretary's door.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conditions must be right for China to
be in Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From C M PURVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Bringing China into the Gatt' (May 30), stresses the need
to deal with some difficult issues before finalising China's accession to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or to its suc-cessor, the World
Trade Organisation.
You are right to include in the list of such issues the state-owned
enterprises and the export of prison-produced goods. What is equally
important, however, is to obtain the removal of non-tariff barriers
inhibiting exports to China, together with a substantial reduction and
binding of Chinese tariffs. Such a step - if properly implemented by China
and policed by Gatt and WTO - would at once cut the ground from under
backward looking policies of central control and self-sufficiency; it would
also, importantly, make it much more difficult for Chinese enterprises to
disrupt world markets by dumping practices.
It is vital for the world trading system to get these conditions for Chinese
accession right. The Gatt should not be pressured into agreeing
unsatisfactory compromises for the sake of speed.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: London SE needs 'circuit breakers' to
avoid volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GRENIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A large part of the market turmoil seen in London last week can be
directly attributed to the operation of futures and options trading. On the
two days when the FTSE-100 Share Index fell more than 50 points, futures
trading was heavy while trading in the actual market was light.
The trading rules of the London market encourage aggressive use of traded
options and futures, whether on the bear or the bull tacks. It is surely now
time for the stock exchange to follow the lead of the New York Stock
Exchange (and other markets) by introducing 'circuit breakers'. These would
come into operation automatically on a 50-point fall (or rise) in the
FTSE-100 Share Index.
Only in this way can the London market avoid the creation of false markets
through excessive volatility.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: More to be done in order to contain
derivatives risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CHAMBERLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report 'GAO rings alarm bells over danger of derivatives' (May 19)
concludes with references to the recommendation of the General Accounting
office in the US that regulatory attention should be paid to the accounting
and disclosure regime for derivatives.
While many different accounting recognition and measurement issues related
to derivatives remain to be resolved both in the US and elsewhere, more
could quite quickly be done in the disclosure field internationally to
ensure that investors are made aware of companies' strategies for risk
management and their exposures to both credit and market risk, as a minimum.
Progress has already been made in some countries in this field. The examples
already set could usefully be followed by others and the UK is one of those
where there is ground to be made up.
But accounting standard sectors from various countries and the International
Accounting Standards Committee are meeting this month in Edinburgh to
examine this subject.
It is to be hoped that advances can usefully be made there on the priority
issue of disclosure, even if agreement on accounting proves to be more
elusive.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Negative view of what is an essential
policy of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID RINGROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Those reforms in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union that have
had the most positive effect on sustainable, long-term job creation have
been brought about by those who recognise that private enterprise is a way
of facing up to the pressure of the invisible hand of the market.
By ignoring the positive motives for governments' decision to withdraw state
control over sectors of the economy, the article 'Privatisation in Europe
could cost 800,000 jobs' (May 25) presents privatisation as a zero-sum game,
rather than as a tool for managing change in a global economy. It is a
one-sided view of a policy the many virtues of which the FT has long
extolled, not least, implicitly, in the editorial, 'A manifesto for
business', of the same day ('It is encouraging that the government now
accepts that (big new spending on industrial support) more often (creates)
problems by retarding essential adjustment'). To what does BA owe its
increase in profits, except to such 'essential adjustment'? Why do BT,
British Gas and British Steel have healthier futures than most of their
competitors?
Privatisation is not a cure-all, but it is surprising to see the FT
highlighting only the negative side of an essential policy.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Arts: How the money men invaded our screens - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any visiting Martian who last week read the newspapers, listened to the
radio, watched television and then took at face value the reactions to the
first annual Performance Reviews on commercial television companies by the
Independent Television Commission might well be under the impression that a
government body had launched a frontal attack on ITV.
He would be led to believe that ITV programmes, once the wonder of the
world, were now hopeless, which simply confirmed what all right-thinking
people had been saying ever since Jewel In The Crown and Brideshead
Revisited.
Let us recap briefly. Between 1955 and 1992 British commercial television
companies were made to behave like public service broadcasters. Then, in the
market-obsessed spirit of the 1980s, the government decided to sell the ITV
franchises to the highest bidders and swap the old public service body, the
IBA, for a 'light touch' authority (the ITC) and let the businessmen get on
with it.
The Performance Review is the ITC's way of saying whether the businessmen
are doing what they said they would. It is an exercise in that modern
phenomenon 'compliance', largely devoted to estimating whether, for
instance, Granada is doing its duty by Equal Opportunities. Affirmative: 1.6
per cent of the staff are from ethnic minorities and 0.4 per cent are
disabled.
When it comes to the general performance of the 17 programme licensees,
phrases such as 'a successful year' (Central), 'a strong performance'
(Channel) and 'a very satisfactory first year' (Ulster) predominate. Just
two outfits take a wigging: the breakfast company, GMTV, and the London
weekday licensee Carlton.
Of Carlton the ITC says: 'The application contained ambitious proposals for
network programmes, but only a small number of these were commissioned by
the Network Centre for transmission during the year . . . those network
programmes which were shown . . . were, with some exceptions, not
distinctive or of noticeable high quality.'
The fact is that, whereas under the old ITV horse-trading system, a big
company such as Thames or Granada could muscle its way on to the national
network, in the new setup the national schedule is decided by the Network
Centre. So none of the companies can guarantee how much of their material
will be networked.
Thanks to the government's daft legislation we now have something of a
paradox at the centre of commercial television. Having bid vast sums for
their franchises, the chief concern of the licencees is to make enough money
to pay off those bids plus the government levy and, of course, provide a
profit for shareholders.
What they are after is consistency: consistent programmes pulling in a
consistent audience. Experimentation and idiosyncrasy do not fit in.
Meanwhile the ITC is trying to enforce quality thresholds and making value
judgments about programme content.
As a critic I find myself looking less and less to ITV as a source for
interesting new programmes; what we see are safe and increasingly repetitive
ratings builders. But this is hardly surprising, as it is an inevitable
outcome of the government's legislation.
Most nights now there is a big slab of middlebrow, middle-aged, middleweight
drama in the middle of ITV's evening: 2 1/2 hours of Taggart (Saturday), 90
minutes of Cadfael (Sunday), two hours of Sharpe (tonight), an hour of
Moving Story (tomorrow), an hour of London's Burning (Friday). They are not
cheap or badly made, though they are often too long.
The opening episode of Cadfael, for instance, with Derek Jacobi playing a
medieval detective monk, would have been better with 30 minutes cut out. The
tone got perilously close to 'Ho, varlet' (we had 'vile traitors' and 'vile
thievery') but it looked good, having been filmed in Hungary.
The first episode in Jack Rosenthal's expansion of his one-off drama about
removal men, The Chain, into the series Moving Story was also slow but it is
obviously going to be character that counts here.
Much the most entertaining of the new drama series is Sharpe, a blood and
thunder saga of the Peninsular War with Sean Bean playing a rough diamond
officer promoted, unusually, from the ranks by Wellington, thus bringing in
the favourite sub-text of British television drama: class.
With blowzy camp followers, Peter Postlethwaite playing a marvellous
scoundrel of a sergeant who keeps whipping off his cap to use it like a
telephone to talk to his mother, and yet more ex-Warsaw Pact locations, it
makes a refreshing change from policemen in screeching motors.
No doubt such entertainment contributes little to the artistic sensibilities
of the nation, but what can you expect when politicians decide that ITV
should be an electronic whelk stall? They left Channel 4 to carry commercial
television's banner for the arts, alternative programme making, minorities
and so on, and Channel 4 does that pretty well. As the ITC report rightly
proclaims: 'In many programme areas high standards of quality, innovation
and distinctiveness were achieved.'
On Saturday Channel 4 gave us a splendid evening, providing a live relay of
the first performance from Glyndebourne's new opera house, The Marriage Of
Figaro, with an excellent documentary during the dinner interval about the
creation of the new building: The House That Jack Built.
You do still come across the occasional outcrop of high quality on ITV. The
Windsors is an example: a four-part series about the British royal family
which began last week with Victoria and had fascinating things to say about
George V and his children.
The royals are the best possible subjects for archivists since their
activities have been so assiduously filmed, but the material can still be
used well or badly and this looks like an outstanding series. Yet, despite
the popularity of the subject matter, the Network Centre has decided not to
show it until 10.45pm. That arrangement is the natural outcome of the last
lot of political fiddling with television.
There is nothing much wrong with Britain's programme makers. The trouble is
that those working for ITV find themselves in a system that is concerned
more with accountancy and less with programmes.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Arts: Air of harmony masks a city out of tune - The battle
for survival of Berlin's three opera houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measuring his words carefully, the intendant of Berlin's Deutsche Oper, Gotz
Friedrich, says he has always enjoyed good relations with Daniel Barenboim,
who heads the city's other opera company, the Staatsoper unter den Linden.
'Each strives for his house as best he can.'
Over in the eastern half of the city, Barenboim's lieutenants acknowledge
conflicts of interest with the Deutsche Oper, 'but the goodwill exists to
live with each other'.
Behind the polite avowals of harmony, the Deutsche Oper and Staatsoper are
locked in a bare-knuckled fight for prestige and subsidy. Along with the
smaller Komische Oper, they swallow DM235m (Pounds 94m) of state subsidy a
year. In a city still coming to terms with the cost of unification, many
regard three opera companies as a luxury. Chilled by the axing of one of
west Berlin's leading drama ensembles, each company has been forced on to
the offensive to justify its existence.
The immediate cause of friction is a DM9m deficit at the Staatsoper. While
Friedrich kept within the Deutsche Oper's budget ceiling, Barenboim went on
a spending spree, engaging star conductors and singers in a whirlwind
attempt to re-establish the Staatsoper's international reputation, tarnished
by years of communist under-investment.
Trade union representatives at the Deutsche Oper say that by virtually
writing off the deficit, the Berlin Senate has shown favouritism, and that
Barenboim's 'arrogance' could provoke calls for more closures - and job
losses.
One union official said: 'The Staatsoper acted as if the recession never
existed. Barenboim seems to think he can get away with it just because of
who he is.'
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the only cultural institutions to escape
rationalisation were the three opera houses. The Staatsoper was the most
run-down, but it had a distinguished prewar history and the most traditional
ambience. Barenboim was hailed as the ideal figure to transform the company,
and his appointment in 1992 - with a 10-year contract worth DM10m - had the
blessing of Richard von Weizsaecker, the president.
But change has been slower than anticipated. Although Barenboim has inspired
several artistic successes - notably Patrice Chereau's staging of Wozzeck
and the improved sound-quality of the Staatskapelle - he is absent for seven
months of the year, leaving less gifted deputies in charge of
run-of-the-mill repertory inherited from the previous regime.
Because of the delay in aligning wages between east and west, staff are paid
80 per cent of what colleagues at the Deutsche Oper receive. And whereas the
latter operates within one modern building, the Staatsoper's rehearsal and
storage facilities are spread over six ill-equipped sites, some of which it
shares with other ensembles.
At the Deutsche Oper, Friedrich has a different set of problems. Before
unification, he was undisputed king of Berlin's opera life. Suddenly he
found himself having to share his throne with two others - Barenboim and
Harry Kupfer, who has built an unassailable position at the Komische Oper.
Morale at the Deutsche Oper slumped, especially when Friedrich failed to
attract a strong music director.
But this season has seen a revival of company fortunes, thanks to
Friedrich's fiscal rectitude and a programme balancing new or unfamiliar
works with unconventional stagings of popular classics. With 1,900 seats to
fill each night (500 more than the Staatsoper), Friedrich cannot afford many
experiments. But he has shown that the Deutsche Oper has a useful role and
will not cede first place without a battle.
Most critics agree that each company could do more to stress its individual
identity. Poor co-ordination means you can still see three different
stagings of Die Zauberflote in one week, and there is too much recycling of
fashionable names like Hans Schavernoch, who designed productions at all
three houses this season.
In a city where culture and politics are inseparable, however, coherent
artistic programming alone cannot ensure survival. Berlin's operatic future
also depends on the speed of economic recovery, on the whim of politicians
like Ulrich Roloff-Momin, the culture senator, and on the fickle tide of
public opinion.
Hans-Dieter Roser, head of artistic planning at the Staatsoper, says no one
seriously doubts the long-term viability of three opera houses, 'but people
expect miracles, as if the traditions of the prewar era can be revived
overnight'. Roser added: 'Theatre doesn't work like that. We inherited a
divided city, in which each half went its separate way for 40 years. We have
to build a new system and develop it organically. That takes years.'

Do you have a pc at home? Does it have windows? Or a mouse? Have you bought
an electronic notebook to replace that antiquated laptop? There is, we are
told, an increasingly significant split between those who are computer
literate and those who are not. It is said to be as important as the gap
dividing those who can read and those who cannot. But there is another
group, which is also expanding: those of us who find ourselves using
computers, willy nilly, though we still do not properly understand them, or
like them very much. We must constitute an ideal audience for The Net,
BBC2's series which deals with computers in much the same way that 'Top
Gear' deals with cars. Today (8.00) they consider the symbiotic relationship
between those who create computer viruses and those who write anti-viral
software. If you would prefer to be taken out of yourself with very
straightforward enter tainment, Sharpe is a blood and thunder series
starring Sean Bean as an officer in Wellington's army during the Napoleonic
wars (ITV 8.00). BBC2 repeats Safe, a drama about homeless teenagers in
London (9.00).

FT  01 JUN 94 / Arts: Stately venues give Belgian festival style - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a city gives a festival, part of the festival's fun lies in the variety
of venues in which the events occur. The new Brussels Kunsten Festival des
Arts - a bilingual name for this Franco-Flemish city - is splendidly endowed
in this respect: old proscenium-arch theatres, vast modern halls, derelict
churches and studios.
Of the 12 performances I caught there, I was even grateful for the worst -
Une Chose Intime, a coy little before-and-after conversation about
male-female sexual intimacy, performed by ASBL Transquinquennal (Belgian) -
because it occurred on the second floor of an empty old house in the city
centre.
The Kunsten Festival has won an important place on the theatrical map
because it includes so broad a range of world theatre. The emphasis is on
modernist and post-modernist drama and theatrical style: this is not a
festival for the conventional well-made narrative play with a clear
beginning, middle and end. I saw plays from Poland, Romania, France, Italy,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and felt my horizons widened by several
of them.
One interesting theme that emerged was the plays of Pier Paolo Pasolini. I
have already reported on the Compagnie Nordey's performance of his Pylade;
later in May, I caught Turin's Teatro Stabile performing his Calderon and
Affabulazione. The Pasolini that emerges from these is an arresting creator
of theatrical political dialectic, neither without pretentiousness nor
wrecked by it. Both make the political maximum out of basic family
relationships.
In Calderon Pasolini turns the daughter-lover-father nexus of certain
Calderon plays - where the father is the traditional tyrant prohibiting
rebellious young love - into a portrayal of the deadening force of fascism
intruding unfeelingly to wreck young lives. Affabulazione is a full-throttle
study of the mid-life crisis of a father who cannot allow his son to enter
adult responsibility. Oedipal tensions abound. A certain homoeroticism
enters into both plays; male beauty and phallic power were themes that
Pasolini could probably never bypass. But the domestic dimensions of fascism
 -so important to the Italian mind, so strange to the British - become both
ironic and serious.
The Teatro Stabile performs the plays, as directed by Luca Ronconi, with
extreme elegance, stylised but modern. There is an awareness that one is
watching and hearing highly trained actors, whose command of stance,
gesture, phrasing, vocal tone is grandly and subtly judged. Not
old-fashioned ham, but rigorous, imaginative austerity. And this style, so
far from Stanislavskian realism, is the right one for Pasolini's dialectic.
Handsome stagings, holding the attention at all points.
The nearest to realism was the Theatregroep Hollandia, who presented in
different off-beat venues Marguerite Duras' La Musica Deuxieme and
Wedekind's (five-hour) Lulu. This company of marvellous Dutch actors brought
a far more compelling emotional tension to Duras' portrait of a heartbroken
divorcing couple than Harriet Walter and Larry Lamb were able to achieve in
Joseph Blatchley's 1983 Hampstead staging. (The French text, with its
untranslatable and long-delayed shift from vous to tu, helps.)
And in Lulu, though the actors spoke in Dutch without surtitles or other
translation device, and even though Lulu herself was no Louise Brooks, they
communicated vividly and kept the action pithy.
These were highlights, as the German Volksbuhne and the French Compagnie
Nordey had been at the festival's start. I also admired the Romanian Teatrul
National of Craiova in Phaedra (part Euripides, part Seneca), a bold staging
which has been seen in Glasgow. Its use of chorus and soloists is
imaginative, modern and classic; and the actors make Romanian sound one of
the most beautiful of languages.
I admired the Polish actors from the Stary Teatr Krakow in the first two
acts of Kalkwerk, but could not face another act of sub-Woyzeck gloom. As
for the Belgian groups Dito Dito and ASBL Transquinquennal, they were solely
of local interest.
The Kunsten Festival des Arts continues until June 5.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Animal art at auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Augustinus was in trouble. The nearest tree was an unstable sapling.
His glasses had fallen as he ran, impairing his sight. The lioness was
gaining ground.
Luckily, nature was kind. Augustinus reached the tree, it held his weight,
the lioness was distracted. And Augustinus, a wildlife painter, had yet more
material for his work.
Wildlife art can be dangerous work; the art market is waiting to see if it
is lucrative work. This Friday, in the UK's first specialist wildlife art
auction, more than 600 pieces from around the world go on auction at
Christie's in London,
The event will span three centuries of art work, capturing bird, mammal and
marine life in watercolours, oils, prints and sculptures. It follows
Christie's successful bird art auctions, first launched five years ago.
Christie's is keen to see whether the art market follows the growing
environmentalism of the 1990s. 'Where corporations want to become involved
in the environment, it may well be through having a collection of wildlife
art,' says Gregory Page-Turner, Christie's watercolour and drawings
specialist.
Conservation groups also have a vested interest. Several are entering pieces
donated to them for the auction. The groups hope to raise more money by
auction than they could through usual charitable events.
Five conservation groups will also receive a proportion of the sale price of
specific art lots. They are: the Rhino Rescue Trust, Nature in Art, the Dian
Fossey Gorilla Fund, Tusk Force Environmental Protection and BirdLife
International.
For Augustinus, with three pictures up for sale, the auction is an
opportunity to test the real market price for wildlife art - priced from
several hundred pounds to Pounds 60,000. 'Until now, galleries and artists
have determined the price - this will set the market value for future 'green
art',' he says.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Call for 'carbon bond'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man who promoted Costa Rica's 'debt-for-nature swaps' has come up with
another instrument he thinks could provide part of the solution to the
long-term preservation of its diminishing rainforests and combat global
warming.
Alvaro Umana, former minister of natural resources, is touting a 'carbon
bond' through which companies in developed countries can offset greenhouse
gas emissions by financing forest preservation.
He argues that Costa Rica provides a global service by guaranteeing the
storage of carbon through preserving its forests, for which it should be
financially compensated.
'At a very low price of Dollars 10 (Pounds 6.60) a tonne (of stored carbon)
that means Costa Rica has about a Dollars 1bn chip,' he says. 'But there is
no market to cash it in, yet.'
The 1992 Convention on Climate Change, agreed at the Rio summit, called on
industrialised nations to stabilise emissions by the year 2000 at their 1990
level. Emission ceilings will be imposed on individual companies, but under
the convention they are permitted to emit carbon in one place and sequester
it in another.
Some utility companies in the US and Canada, with an environmentally
friendly bent, have shown interest in the proposal, including Ontario Hydro,
run by Maurice Strong, who chaired the Rio summit.
But interest is also being generated because the bonds make good business
sense, claims Umana. 'They know it's coming, and they think they might be
able to get cheaper carbon futures now.' Companies would exchange cash - to
preserve the forest - for permits allowing them higher emissions.
Umana admits the project's success will depend on whether Costa Rica can
develop a mechanism of verification that will be acceptable to the
industrial countries.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Shopping for a revival -
Traditional town centres are under increasing pressure from out-of-town
sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boarded-up shops, dilapidated buildings and empty streets are evidence of
the mounting pressures facing Britain's town centres. Recession, a greater
reliance on cars, and competition from business parks and out-of-town
shopping centres have undermined the prosperity of many traditional centres
over the past five years.
The problem is widespread and urgent, according to a recent government
report, Vital and Viable Town Centres*. 'Whereas in the 1980s, most British
towns expected their shopping centres to grow, many now feel threatened and
there are widespread signs of decline. Many towns and cities are at a
turning point,' it says.
The need to stop the rot has assumed a new prominence in the government's
environmental policies. John Gummer, environment secretary, has recently
introduced guidelines to help to curb out-of-town development, reduce the
need for lengthy car journeys and improve the vitality of city centres.
The need for 'sustainable development' is at the centre of his concerns. 'We
cannot afford urban sprawl and to place development in locations which can
only be served by long trips by car,' he said last week.
Gummer's guidelines represent a marked change from the laisser faire
policies of the last decade, under which the UK became home to some of the
largest out-of-town shopping centres in Europe. The most striking aspect of
the policy shift is the proposed tightening of the planning rules on future
developments of this kind. According to a guidance note, PPG6, issued last
summer, planning authorities should not promote large out-of-town stores if
they would seriously jeopardise town centres.
This guidance was followed by a draft consultation paper on transport
policies, published earlier this year, which discouraged local authorities
from allowing development unless it was easily serviced by public transport.
Gummer's proposals have been welcomed by the environmental lobby, as well as
by many planners, property owners and retailers. But critics say they have
been insufficiently thought through. They claim that obstructing out-of-town
development is not enough to ensure a vibrant town centre.
Neglect, as well as the threat from out-of-town shopping, pose the most
serious threats to town centres, according to the report. 'Strengthening
planning policies is not enough,' it says.
The point was echoed by the Consumers' Association at a recent select
committee hearing. 'Town centres will survive only if they provide shoppers
with what they want and need,' it said.
Town centres are being told to fight back. The government report says local
authorities should work with local businesses and other key interests to
upgrade town centres by making the town look well-cared for and by improving
short-stay car parking, bus services and security.
But who should pay for such improvements? The report acknowledges that local
businesses are resistant to foot the bill. 'As businesses often believe they
are already paying for local services through the business rate, there is a
need to review the mechanisms for resourcing the improvement and maintenance
of town centres,' it says.
As matters stand, there is little reason to expect more money to be spent on
town centres. A recent report by Hillier Parker into Quality in the Public
Realm found that only 20 per cent of local authorities plan to spend more
than Pounds 1m and 46 per cent planned to spend less than Pounds 500,000 on
town centre improvements over the next three years. 'All recent research
shows that there is risk that the share of total retail spending taken by
town centres will continue to decline,' says Brian Raggett, the report's
author.
Another concern is that a clamp-down on out-of-town development will lead to
increased town centre congestion. This has long been an obstacle to town
centre development. 'What drives developers out of town is the unwillingness
of local authorities to allow development in town,' says William McKee of
the British Property Federation, a landlords' association.
Peter Hall, who was until recently a planning adviser to Gummer, says: 'What
we have to ensure is that (the restoration of city centres) is not achieved
by congestion, which could be less sustainable than allowing development to
go out into the green fields.'
He suggests curbing the growth of towns and cities by establishing new
settlements. 'New communities form part of the package of sustainable
development.'
The pronouncements of the planners and policy formers are viewed with
bemusement by many property developers, who feel that the government's
planning policy lacks consistency. They claim that this wastes time and
money, when they are dealing with projects that take many years to plan and
assemble.
But there is a more fundamental reservation on the part of the development
industry to the government's revised policy. The British Property
Federation, which represents landlords, is concerned that the importance of
economic development may be lost in the clamour for environmental
protection.
'We want to support sustainable development but we think there is a grave
danger that the sustainable development argument will be used to turn down
anything the environmental lobby does not like,' says McKee.
The defenders of a more liberal planning policy argue that the swing to
out-of-town shopping is underpinned by a strong demand from consumers. Many
traditional high street shops are shifting to out-of-town centres, retail
warehouses are now embracing products such as toys, electrical goods and
computers, and discount warehouses, such as Costco at Thurrock in Essex, are
making increasing inroads into the market.
The pressures for more out-of-town and edge-of-town development lead some
commentators to argue that the government should crack down decisively to
prevent further erosion of the countryside and the vitality of cities.
Duncan McLaren of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group,
believes that the time has come for the UK to choose between US-style
development, where almost all shopping is on the ringroads surrounding a
town, or the model of most Continental cities, which generally have central
shopping facilities. 'At the moment we are at a crossroads,' he says.
Others argue that the UK should opt for a combination of out-of-town
development and town centre development in an effort to reduce congestion
and preserve the character of town centres. 'Out-of-town sites and thriving
town centres are not mutually exclusive,' says Stuart Robinson of chartered
surveyors Hillier Parker.
The question of how well an out-of-town development can co-exist with a
healthy town centre depends on the town's circumstances. In big towns, the
demand may be large enough to accommodate both out-of-town superstores and a
healthy retail sector within the town centre; in small towns, the arrival of
a superstore may squeeze out smaller retailers in the town centres.
Many planning experts believe that the government's policies may turn out to
be less radical than they first appear. For all Gummer's rhetoric, the
wording of his department's new guidelines is relatively mild.
'The shift in policy is not one of moving from free development to
restricted development,' says Ross Davies of the Oxford Institute of Retail
Management. 'It is a swing back to a balanced view.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Management: A deal that aims to deliver / A look at the
attraction of logistics alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As more multinational companies cut their number of factories in Europe, and
concentrate production in fewer countries, many of them are also
subcontracting their transport and warehousing services to a single outside
provider of 'logistics' services. But most of this 'outsourcing' is focused
too much on cost reduction, and too little on improvements in service
deliveries to customers.
This is one of the main conclusions to emerge from a study of 'logistics
alliances' between 50 customer companies and 20 logistics specialists across
five north European countries*. The study was carried out by McKinsey, the
management consultancy, with the Centre for European Logistics.
The study reports that logistics alliances are being set up rapidly, in both
industrial products and consumer goods. But so far most of them involve only
the stocking, handling and transport of finished goods. Less than half those
surveyed also covered the inflow of goods, parts and materials.
Specialisation of production across borders is one of two motives for the
creation of logistics alliances, according to the study, the findings of
which are reported in the latest issue of the McKinsey Quarterly by two
consultants, Peter van Laarhoven and Graham Sharman.
The other factor is the decision by some companies to focus on 'core
competences' such as product development, manufacturing, marketing and
selling, and to outsource logistics to a specialist provider.
Among the pioneers of such deals, the study cites Rank Xerox, the copier
maker, and the Dutch transport company Frans Maas, whose relationship has
evolved over a decade, with periodic increases in the scope and value added
by the arrangement.
Almost half the deals involving international flows are being taken by
forwarders such as Sweden's ASG and Germany's Kuehne &amp; Nagel, according to
Laarhoven and Sharman. But the overall market leaders - if purely national
deals are also included - are warehousing specialists such as Nedlloyd's
Districentres and NFC's Exel. Non-European 'integrators' of both warehousing
and transport are now becoming 'more active', says the study.
For the majority of deals, the study's use of the term 'alliance' may be
premature: Laarhoven and Sharman themselves say that most are still at an
early stage of development - which they christen 'contract logistics'.
Companies are tending to choose their service providers on the basis of
hard, competitive cost bidding. Only one in seven of the customer companies
in the study chose to negotiate with an existing service provider on a 'sole
source' basis. But the study argues that many relationships will grow deeper
with time.
The excessive focus of most deals on cost reduction, and the inadequate
priority they give to service improvement, probably result from the fact
that the main stimulus behind most of them is corporate restructuring, say
the consultants.
Too much emphasis on cost reduction in negotiating an alliance actually
inhibits a successful outcome, argue Laarhoven and Sharman. Instead, they
advise companies to emphasise delivery service as the first priority.
Opportunities for cost reduction will arise through improved methods and
co-operation once the alliance has settled down.
The consultants also advise customer companies, most of which are several
times larger than their service providers, to avoid the temptation to
respond to recession by reverting to traditional 'arm's length' purchasing
methods. Logistics alliances will only flourish if companies are willing to
nurture their relationships, share information and explore ways of extending
the scope of the arrangement. A few companies have gone as far as
subcontracting management control of all or part of their inward and outward
'supply chain'.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Management: Solo sailor seeks broader horizons - Nigel Rowe
reports from the high seas on the pursuit of a Big Hairy Ambitious Goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ROWE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A couple of days before I left England, home, my job
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the salary that went with it - to fulfil a dream that had become
something of an obsession, I attended a conference in London on global
excellence.
The conference, organised by the Confederation of British Industry, the
employers' organisation, had been inspired and sponsored by BOC, the
industrial gases and healthcare group. It was my last duty for the company.
John Stopford, of the London Business School, was one of the principal
speakers and, like all business school professors, he could not resist the
opportunity to coin a new phrase. What British industry needed, he said,
were Big Hairy Ambitious Goals.
I sat at the back of the hall and smiled. Yes, I thought, I knew what it was
like to have a BHAG, even if the professor and the 250 company directors
present might not too readily relate to it. For I was about to compete in
the BOC Challenge 1994-95 single-handed, round-the-world race.
As I left the conference I took off my tie and dropped it into a waste bin
in Tottenham Court Road. Perhaps it was a childish act of worthless
symbolism, but I remember doing the same when I left school.
I flew to the US two days later to ready my 48ft sailing boat Sky Catcher
for the last phase of our preparations together - two transatlantic
crossings, including a single-handed race in July, also sponsored by BOC.
We left Charleston, South Carolina, just before midnight on Thursday 12 May
 -it being a tradition born out of superstition that one should not begin a
passage on a Friday, least of all on one that carried with it the additional
stigma of being the 13th. Now, a little over a week and two gales later, we
are about a third of the way across to Falmouth, and I have had time to
reflect on what brought me here.
My guess is a combination of balance, opportunity and curiosity (it may be
some time before I can shake off the initials BOC).
Very few of us achieve a healthy balance of interests and contrast in our
lives. A successful business makes many demands on its managers. Life's
priorities are driven overwhelmingly by those at the office. Further, the
more senior one's position, the more dependant corporate man becomes on the
trappings and comforts of higher office. Less and less of this experience is
enriching in any but a material way and it is often poor preparation for the
rest of life. I know too many people who were burned out when they retired
to face a long list of things they wished they had done and now cannot. I
want to avoid that.
Opportunities must be grasped when they appear. But another lesson from
corporate life is that they can also be created, even if at some cost. I was
fortunate to be able to negotiate this opportunity and was prepared to meet
the cost in terms of loss of salary and future security.
But curiosity has been the principal motivation in this endeavour. I am
curious about what it will teach me about myself as well as other people,
places and things. I am also curious about what will be demanded of me to
meet the challenge of this undertaking.
I initiated BOC's sponsorship of the BOC Challenge more than 12 years ago
when I had been sailing for only a couple of years. Such feats as a solo
circum-
navigation were beyond my imagination then. The 1994-95 race, which starts
from Charleston on September 17th, will be its fourth edition. Now, I have
many thousands of miles of sailing experience; but I know nothing of the
windless doldrums or of the Southern Ocean with its screaming winds,
icebergs and the infamous Cape Horn. I am curious about how I shall deal
with all of that.
Knowledge gained from a long and happy life in the corporate womb may not
help me much.
The author is the former chief executive of corporate relations for the BOC
Group. This report was filed from Sky Catcher in the North Atlantic.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Management: Director's nightmare - The biggest worries for
senior UK executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman is drunk in charge of the business. The company's owner is
insisting on terms of employment that will surely end up before an
industrial tribunal. The board is deadlocked on whether the company should
cease trading.
Real cases, real dilemmas: the next step for the three company directors
faced with them was to contact Britain's Institute of Directors, which has
logged the 10 most common worries.
At 24 hours' notice, any one of the IoD's 47,000 members - many of whom run
companies too small to have a full range of in-house specialists - can speak
to an expert for free and in confidence. Every year, around 1,000 of them
do.
Employing six part-time advisers, each senior in their own field, the IoD's
advisory service covers finance, law, human resources, property, marketing
and the birth and death of businesses. As such it offers an insight into the
issues that cause headaches.
Dismissal, it would seem, is the threat that causes most anxiety. The single
most common call to the service is prompted by IoD members' own lack of job
security.
For one managing director, who was instructed by the owner of his company to
take more than 20 sales representatives off their salaried contracts and pay
them on a commission-only basis, the threat of a rash of industrial tribunal
cases for constructive dismissal was only avoided by refusing to co-operate,
and losing his own job. In the end, he got almost 12 months' salary, kept
his company car and received help with a CV and job contacts.
Another managing director, this time of a UK subsidiary of a company jointly
owned by Russia and Ukraine, called the service when the majority holder had
decided his nationality was a problem. The Russians wanted a Russian in the
post. A third, running the subsidiary of a British company based in Zambia,
was similarly sacked from afar. Alone and unaided he needed rapid advice on
his legal position and rights.
All three cases demonstrate the degree to which many directors are
unprotected. A surprisingly large number take up jobs without a service
agreement.
One such caller owned 5 per cent of the equity of a company. He was its
managing director and the owners were related to his wife. Surely, a
position of security. If the company were acquired, he could be in trouble,
the IoD told him.
Nor is it just directors' job security that arises. The dismissal of other
company employees is a recurring topic.
One managing director, who inherited a 52-year-old secretary on an 18-hour
week, had given her two verbal warnings for poor work, before offering early
retirement with severance pay equivalent to the statutory redundancy figure.
The secretary was now holding out for straight redundancy, but the managing
director did not want to make the position redundant. The IoD was emphatic
on the error of mixing disciplinary procedures with redundancy.
Other cases have been more shocking. The chairman of a small publishing
company wanted to dismiss a 59-year-old senior editor, who had not been
doing his job properly since developing a brain tumour. The editor's doctor
had advised that it would be best for the man to continue working. The IoD
warned of an industrial tribunal case, and advised a generous severance
payment.
The service did have one scrape with a dissatisfied customer when a director
facing insider-dealing charges claimed the service had told him his
transactions were legal. IoD records showed he had not spoken to the service
until after the transactions, and that the IoD had anyway not said they were
legal, and the claim was dropped.

FT  01 JUN 94 / People: Schroder's Mackenzie moves to run GE Capital in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GE Capital, the financial services arm of General Electric Company of the
US, has recruited a London merchant banker to spearhead its European
expansion. Christopher Mackenzie, 40, has resigned from J. Henry Schroder
Wagg &amp; Co, to be the first president of GE Capital Europe.
GE Capital provides around 40 per cent of its US parent's profits and
Mackenzie has been given the task of putting its widely dispersed European
operations on the map. GE Capital has 13 niche businesses in Europe, ranging
from private label credit cards to car leasing, assets of Dollars 5bn, and
employs 4,600 staff in 14 countries.
Mackenzie, who has worked as a McKinsey management consultant as well as a
merchant banker, hopes to double the size of the European business in the
next three years. The choice of a merchant banker as president suggests that
GE Capital will be making more acquisitions in the financial services
industry.
However, Mackenzie is keen to play down the role of acquisitions in his bid
to develop a 'truly European financial institution'. In particular, he
stresses that GE has no plans to buy a UK building society but is keen to
explore ways GE Capital could supply financial services through 'alliances'
with societies. 'We are well placed to be a friend,' says Mackenzie.
In his previous position at Schroders, Mackenzie was responsible for the
firm's pharmaceutical and chemical investment banking business for the
bank's European clients. David Legg, one of GE Capital Europe's two joint
managing directors, has retired and George Tappert continues as Mackenzie's
deputy.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Reconciling commitment and flexibility - How
can companies maintain employee loyalty when they can no longer promise a
job for life?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry is taking a long-term view of
recruitment prospects over the next 10 years in what promises to become a
much more deregulated and flexible labour market.
This - it believes - will involve a reappraisal of how to motivate employees
to be committed at work but also adaptable enough to embrace change even if
it means accepting redundancy.
Stable employment policies are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain
in companies of all kinds because of competitive pressures. Employers may
want to treat their employees sensitively as human assets to be nurtured but
they are under pressure to regard them also as a factor of production. But
the tensions that this creates between a desire for commitment in the
workplace and the need for flexibility can pose a problem.
Is it possible for employers to recruit workers in the labour market who are
both loyal to the company but take an understanding view if they lose their
job as the result of working in a competitive environment?
It is this fundamental issue that is concerning the CBI. Clearly a delicate
balance has to be struck between the dual demands of the company: to promote
loyalty among its employees but also have the power to respond to
increasingly uncertain business pressures.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, the CBI's employee affairs director, explained to a
recent conference on employment prospects at Warwick University School of
Industrial and Business Studies: 'More than ever employers will be looking
for a workforce that can deliver higher productivity, work more efficiently,
give reliable and customer-oriented service, be innovative and accept the
need for continuous personal development and improvement.'
However, he also admitted that the CBI's employment affairs committee
believed it was going to become 'increasingly difficult' for companies to
maintain the long-term commitment of employees. The CBI is uncertain whether
loyalty in the company is an outdated concept and if the future employment
relationship is moving 'towards specific contracts for a specified job
within a specified period'.
'The dilemma for employers is that whilst they want loyalty, certainly from
their core employees, they are often seen to be less than loyal to those who
work for them,' Gilbert said. 'Employers want to be able to face those who
work for them with new challenges but sometimes to close the door with them
on the outside.'
Undoubtedly a less loyal workforce could prove much harder for a company to
motivate. Structural reorganisation inside companies is also likely to
weaken employee commitment.
Removing layers of management bureaucracy in companies has introduced less
hierarchical, flatter organisations. As a result employers will find it more
difficult to ensure job satisfaction and motivation as most promotions now
tend to go in a lateral direction.
'There will also be less demarcation between manager and managed at all
levels and a lessening both of status and the power that comes with being
privy to information. The entire concept of management may grow more fluid,'
said Gilbert.
As a result companies are going to adopt a much more focused approach in
their employment policies. The CBI is keen for employers to promote
recruitment packages that cater for the specific needs of each employee.
Employers will have to tailor their needs to what Mr Gilbert calls 'a
growing diversity in the labour supply'. This will mean, in particular,
encouraging women with children to return to work. This group is expected to
fill most of the jobs to be created by 2000.
'Working patterns will need to be more flexible and realistic, tying in to
company as well as individual needs,' argued Gilbert. This will require a
more consistent removal of workplace barriers that discriminate against
gender and age. Management needs to concern itself with family issues and
individual expectations.
The CBI believes that employers will have to spend more time assessing
employee attitudes to work and leisure and managing those attitudes to fit
in with the objectives of the business. Employers may have to sell the
concept that employment with them is not for life but for a limited, often
contractual period. This raises, the CBI believes, a new concept of
employability. No employer can promise a job for life but it is possible for
companies to work with individuals in helping them to develop their talents
so they can have the best opportunity to develop a portfolio of skills and
expertise for use elsewhere in the labour market. A number of City of London
companies are already pursuing that policy, such as Legal and General, the
insurance group.
Some participants at the Warwick conference suggested that employers might
find this the best method of reconciling flexibility with commitment. Trust
and loyalty ought to be possible even when a worker has limited job
prospects with one particular employer.
As Gilbert explained: 'In future a measure of the good employer is not
necessarily one who pays the highest rate but who keeps workers' skills, and
hence their employability, up to date.'
He also believes that companies will have to become more candid about
explaining to new employees the demands of flexibility facing them. Gilbert
talks of 'building productive relationships on knowledge, realism and
frankness'.
Not nearly enough British companies have the foresight to pursue such a
policy. They tend to take a short-sighted view of their own recruitment
needs. But this is mainly because many employers are forced to respond to
immediate pressures rather than to manage innovation.
The government's Investors in People scheme may help to mitigate that
tendency as it provides a nationally recognised quality standard to help
train and develop employees throughout their working life as well as
ensuring organisations invest effectively in skills training.
The CBI also believes that companies must develop new ways of attracting,
retaining and motivating their employees over the next 10 years. This will
mean giving them more responsibility and authority. It also recognises that
employees will be better educated, more self-confident and independent than
before.
Last week the Department of Employment published a glossy guide to employee
involvement entitled The Competitive Edge. It stresses that 'successful
employee involvement depends on mutual trust'. It talks of changing the
culture of companies through recognising what David Hunt, employment
secretary, called the 'new realisation of the common interest of management
and employees in securing business growth'.
The genuine tensions between flexibility and commitment may yet be
reconciled in the workplace, at least in the more innovative companies who
can look beyond their immediate needs to recognise employee development is
as much in their corporate interests as those who work for them.

had lodged a planning application with Birmingham City Council.
The 22-storey building will have 200,000 sq ft of offices and will cost
Pounds 75m. It is next to a similar unit by the same company which is

British Rail had to pay about Pounds 4.5m in refunds in 1993-94 under the
Passenger's Charter compared with Pounds 7m in 1992-93, in spite of having
to meet tougher financial targets.
Under the Passenger's Charter, season ticketholders can claim refunds from
BR if trains are consistently late or cancelled.
BR said: 'There really are no particularly bad lines any more.'
The improvement was given only a guarded welcome by the passenger watchdog
body, the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee.
'BR has been doing slightly better in terms of punctuality and reliability
but some trains are now timetabled to get in later and so they do not
trigger the repayments,' it said.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Change to Tec funding 'threatens training'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of young people may be offered unsuitable training as a result of a
new funding regime being imposed by the government on training and
enterprise councils, which administer publicly funded training in England
and Wales.
The government has told Tecs that after 1997 it will contract only with
those meeting stringent targets for delivering the government's guarantee of
a training place for all young people who want one.
Mr Chris Humphries, director of policy and strategy at the Tec National
Council, which represents the 82 Tecs in England and Wales, said: 'Tecs
agree with the principle of the guarantee. But if one pushes too hard there
is a danger that young people could end up in unsuitable training.'
Both Tecs and the Careers Service, which refers young people to Tecs for
training places, also fear the new rules will tempt Tecs to collude with the
service to massage the figures so that the guarantee appears to be
delivered.
The move comes amid a political row about homeless young people. In spite of
the guarantee, it is estimated that there are thousands of young people not
on the Youth Training scheme, but without jobs or benefits. Many already
reject offers of a place on YT because the places offered are not what they
want.
Meeting the guarantee, which involves a Tec making an offer of a YT place
within eight weeks, will be an 'absolute requirement' said the Department of
Employment. Last week the department published details of the contract it
will be offering the Tecs.
The new rules are designed to prevent a repetition of the government's
embarrassment two years ago when the Labour party made political capital out
of the fact that the guarantee had not been met for many young people.
The department then put considerable pressure on Tecs to find places. They
in turn have put pressure on the Careers Service, which is responsible for
monitoring whether an offer has been made and reporting this back to the
department.
The strategy has been successful in that a year ago more than 5,000 young
people had to wait more than eight weeks for an offer of a place. The
official figure is currently 157.
Many Tecs fear they might not meet the new criteria. Tecs will be considered
for licensing only if fewer than two people per thousand in their client
group are waiting for a place after eight weeks during a six-month
monitoring period.
One careers officer said: 'Clearly it is important for Tecs to bring the
figures down. It is not as easy as it sounds, and the returns we make are
open to interpretation.
'A person may have a training place lined up, but may have to wait nine
weeks. Technically, the guarantee is not being met. Also, the guarantee is
about an offer of a place.
'The Careers Service may not think some offers made by the Tec are suitable.
But it may not wish to argue with the Tec when it is trying to work in
partnership with it.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Big-screen display shames drivers speeding on motorway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shame is the latest weapon to be used by the Department of Transport in its
effort to curb motorway speeding.
Drivers on the M1 in the Midlands were confronted yesterday by a giant
screen which flashed the word 'speeding' with their own registration number
and their speed. The effect was immediate.
Speeding motorists do not merely face embarrassment. Details go to the
police computer which disgorges a summons.
The system is being demonstrated for six months at roadworks near Junction
21A of the M1 in Leicestershire. Mr Robert Key, roads and traffic minister,
who switched on the system known as Speed Violation Detection Deterrent
(SVDD), said: 'I believe that speeding should become as socially
unacceptable as drink-driving. It can be just as dangerous to other road
users.'
The county police have substantial experience of dealing with speeding
motorists at these roadworks. Leicestershire's chief constable is himself
nursing a conviction - Mr Keith Povey was banned for seven days and fined
Pounds 350 after driving at 80mph in the 50mph zone. During one fortnight
last February 717 motorists were prosecuted for breaching the 50mph limit.
Acting Supt Graham Compton, head of Leicestershire Police traffic
department, said: 'It is indisputable that speed kills and anything which
can bring that message home to motorists and make the county's roads safer
has to be welcomed. We will be looking at the outcome of this project with a
great deal of interest.'
The system was designed by Travers Morgan, transport consultants, and made
by the NEI subsidiary of Rolls-Royce.
It may affect the weekend motorist straining for freedom rather than the
caricatured salesman in a Cavalier or chief executive in a Jaguar. Travers
Morgan research has shown that there is more speeding at weekends than
during the week.

A shiver has gone through the training industry after fresh allegations that

The affair raises questions about whether it is possible for the new
national vocational qualifications system, on which the government is
pinning its hopes for on-the-job training, to be monitored properly. NVQs
are based on measuring an individual's competence on day-to-day tasks at
work. Full external assessment would be very expensive, so the system relies
on internal assessors giving accurate returns.
While the qualifications are verified by outside awarding bodies the
verifiers generally only see the paper records of achievements. There is no
formal requirement upon them to see whether the individual can actually
perform a task such as driving a tractor for a horticulture NVQ.
It can be tempting for unscrupulous assessors to exaggerate success by
asserting that a 'competency' has been achieved, as providers are
effectively paid by results. 'The system relies on the integrity and
professionalism of the assessor,' said Mrs Alison Wolf, reader in education
at the Institute of Education.
The events which have shaken the training industry centre on JHP Training, a
business and administration training provider, which is already under
investigation by the Department of Employment's internal audit service after
the disclosure last month that former employees obtained cash from Cumbria
Training and Enterprise Council for the attainment of NVQs based on bogus
claims.
The company admitted the original fraud, but said it responded openly and
promptly when it discovered that two or three former members of staff had
falsified documents.
A Commons motion tabled last week by Labour MPs Mr John Hutton and Mr Dale
Campbell-Savours named 'yet another victim' of the company in
Barrow-in-Furness which, it said, had claimed money for training he had not
attended. JHP has 'categorically' denied irregularity over this incident.
Mr Hugh Pitman, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The young man concerned
was being assessed for a qualification in the workplace while in a job. The
NVQ system was not properly explained to him. He thought that participating
in the scheme involved off-the-job training.'
JHP trains 10,000 people a year in 65 locations. 'To make sure everybody
obeys company policy is very difficult,' said Mr Pitman. 'We monitor our
work, as do Tecs and the Department of Employment. But there is still a
possibility of things going wrong.'
Several training providers say they are now ensuring that their internal
systems are secure. 'If you lose your good name in a system that relies on
integrity you are in trouble,' said Mrs Anne Weinstock, chief executive of
the Rathbone Society, a charity which trains 4,000 young people a year.
'There is no doubt that there is scope for sharp practice,' said Mr Ian
Christie of the Policy Studies Institute. 'But, it is very difficult to
quantify whether it is happening or not.'
Where the NVQs involve government-funded training it is the employer-led
Tecs in England and Wales which are responsible for arranging and paying for
the training.
Increasingly the government is paying Tecs for 'outputs': getting work or
qualifications for an unemployed individual rather than just paying him or
her to be on a course. Training providers which contract with Tecs risk
financial loss if outputs are not achieved.
Tecs are still refining quality-control systems. But they argue that their
new systems are a significant refinement on those of the employment
department when it ran publicly funded training programmes. Indeed, the
department's accounts were qualified three times by the National Audit
Office.
Tecs say that in the past a training provider would be paid when it informed
the department's local office that it had trained a certain number of
people. Now those Tecs which have invested fully in the new systems can
track a named individual through his or her complete training and monitor
progress.
The department says there is no evidence of widespread abuse of the system -
current abuses being investigated grossed up to about Pounds 15,000. It
rates most Tecs as of 'medium or low' risk in their quality control systems
for training. But the department, still scrutinising the JHP case, is
reviewing whether the NVQ system and safeguards are adequate.
A number of organisations, including the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications, which developed NVQs, say new checks may have to be
introduced, including substantial sampling of students by the external
verifiers. 'It takes time to build up consistent standards,' said the NCVQ.
Cumbria Tec, which made the payments to JHP, had for example three times
more people involved in financial appraisals than it inherited from the
employment department four years ago.

The Channel tunnel takes a further step towards paying its way today with
the start of long-distance freight services carrying new cars from the West
Midlands to Milan, Charles Batchelor writes.
Rover Group will make its first shipment of about 250 cars to its Italian
distribution centre as part of a regular service of five trains a week. The
journey time will be cut from eight days to two.
Railfreight Distribution, the British Rail subsidiary, expects to run six
trains a day each way through the tunnel by midsummer, rising to 27 a day by
the end of next year.
Through freight trains are the second service in the tunnel after freight
shuttles - which carry lorries between Folkestone and Calais.

FT  01 JUN 94 / OFT urges regulation cost review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rising costs of self-regulation for the financial services industry
should be kept under review by the industry's regulators, Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday.
In a report to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Sir Bryan said that none
of the rules of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to
protect the private investor, would damage competition to any significant
extent.
The report is a sign that the PIA has overcome another hurdle on its way to
full and formal recognition as a regulator.
But it also raises concerns about the potentially anti-competitive nature of
some of the PIA's rules for those it will regulate.
Sir Bryan said he would keep three rules under review:
The 'capital adequacy' requirement for all members to have Pounds 10,000 in
net assets.
The controls preventing the employment of sales agents with debts of more
than Pounds 1,000 to industry participants.
The regulations requiring different levels of professional indemnity
insurance cover to be held by certain members.
The cost of regulation was among the issues addressed by the cross-party
Commons Treasury committee in its report on financial regulation.
MPs welcomed the PIA's decision to see whether arrangements might be made
this year to prevent smaller firms of independent financial advisers from
having to find several regulatory payments over a short period.
The interest of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, in the cost of regulation has been directed primarily at its own
costs and the costs of regulatory changes rather than the costs of the
frontline regulators.
The costs of the PIA's first year operation from mid-July was estimated in
its prospectus at Pounds 29.5m. The Pounds 6m start-up costs incurred since
spring 1992 are intended to be written off over five years.
The Treasury has a veto over the decision on whether to allow the PIA to
become operational but the decision itself is taken by SIB. It is expected
to make an announcement later this month.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Labour set to support lifting of BT ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party is set to support a lifting of the controversial ban on
British Telecommunications carrying entertainment over its network.
The commitment, in a policy statement on competitiveness published this
week, provides encouragement to BT and a signals a significant shift in
Labour's approach to the privatised telecoms company.
The BT ban, which the government is determined should last until at least
1998, was imposed to encourage cable companies - mostly US-owned  - to
invest in telecommunications networks in competition with BT.
The cable companies argue that the ban, which includes broadcast television,
is essential to the viability of their planned Pounds 6bn investment over
the next five years.
They also claim to be installing a 'superhighway' in much of urban Britain,
taking fibre-optic cable to local level.
BT counters that it alone can provide a nationwide fibre-optic grid, but
cannot justify the investment until it is allowed to tap the entertainment
market.
It also points to the danger of giving local monopolies to a patchwork of
cable operators building to different standards.
Labour has, in effect, come out for BT. It proposes to scrap the
entertainment ban, in return for BT undertaking to pioneer a 'nationwide
communications link-up' offering nationwide access to 'broadband' services.
Until now Labour has been consistently hostile to BT's grander ambitions,
and has called for tough regulation to curb its prices and profits. It now
sees a deal in the making: BT will be allowed greater commercial freedom in
return for a commitment to use a large part of its profits to construct a
superhighway, without the Exchequer having to meet any of the projected
Pounds 15bn bill.
'We witness the paradox of the recabling of Britain being carried out by
American and French telephone companies while their major British rivals are
excluded from the market,' says the paper.
A continuation of the policy would 'risk widening the gap' between urban
areas with cable networks and less developed regions.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Factories short of paper and steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British factories reported a significant shortage of paper, pulp and steel
in May as manufacturing output continued to surge across the country, the
latest Purchasing Managers Index shows.
The index, released today, shows that monthly growth in recruitment
accelerated to its highest level in the index's three-year history,
providing further evidence of economic recovery.
Purchasing prices were reported to be up significantly, however, possibly
indicating inflationary pressures. The purchasing managers' price index was
57.8 per cent.
The index, which surveys 250 purchasing managers, measures changes in
economic performance between consecutive months, with any figure above 50
per cent implying a monthly rise.
The reported rise in prices is slightly at odds with the Confederation of
British Industry's most recent survey, which implied a more modest growth in
prices.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, the organiser of the
index, said the main reason was that rising factory demand was creating
shortages of vital manufacturing components.
Pulp and steel were said to be in particularly short supply, affecting the
prices of production and packaging materials.
The shortages are feeding through to delivery periods. The suppliers'
delivery times index fell to 42.7 per cent - its lowest recorded level. The
institute said the fall reflected shortages in many sectors.
These trends appear to tally with the broader output figures, which showed
that the engineering and vehicle manufacturing sectors - significant users
of steel - had recorded the highest level of monthly growth of any sector,
with the output index at 68.
Strong growth was recorded in timber, paper, textiles, and food and drink,
as well as in the office machinery and electrical sectors.
The chemical industry, rubber and plastics processing, and mining performed
worse, with monthly output growth reported to have slowed.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Annual growth rate of M0 jumps to 7.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual growth rate of M0, the government's narrow measure of money
supply, jumped to 7.1 per cent in May from 6.2 per cent in April, according
to figures released by the Bank of England yesterday.
The rapid growth in this money supply measure, which is one of the
inflationary indicators monitored by the government, was seen by analysts
yesterday as making a further base rate cut even less likely.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International
(Europe), said: 'There is no justification for a base rate cut on the basis
of these figures.'
Ms Ruth Lea, chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers, said: 'These are
exceptionally strong figures which show that the economy is not slowing
down.'
The government's monitoring range for M0 annual growth is zero to 4 per
cent. In the Bank of England's last inflation report, the acceleration in M0
growth was attributed to low interest rates, which have reduced the
effective cost to consumers of holding cash.
But the Bank warned that 'the longer M0 grows at well above its monitoring
range, the greater the concerns about the implications for future
inflation'.
The Bank said yesterday that it would be concerned if M0 growth failed to
slow by the end of the year.
M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent between April and May, but
because a negative number in May 1993 dropped out of the comparison, the
annual rate accelerated sharply.
Recent growth in M0 has been particularly strong, with the indicator rising
by 1.9 per cent between March and April. On an annualised basis, growth over
the past three months has been 10 per cent.
The amount of notes and coins, the core component of M0, rose by 0.5 per
cent over the month, and by 7.0 per cent over the year.
M0 is seen as having a close relationship with retail sales and yesterday's
figures were thought to show that consumers were weathering the recent tax
rises. 'Growth in M0 is signalling a relatively strong consumer sector,'
said Mr Richardson.
Figures for growth in M4, the broad measure of the money supply, yesterday
confirmed earlier estimates of a 5.7 per cent rise in the 12 months to
April.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Banks grant fewer mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New mortgage lending by UK banks fell in April to a level below that for the
corresponding month last year, the British Bankers Association reported
yesterday.
The number of mortgages approved in April also dropped compared with the
same month a year ago, and with March.
These figures suggest that banks are losing the sharply increased share of
the mortgage market they acquired last year at the expense of building
societies.
Gross loans made by the banks totalled Pounds 1.43bn in April - a drop of 11
per cent from the Pounds 1.61bn lent in March.
In April 1993, the banks' gross mortgage loans amounted to Pounds 1.79bn.
The fall in the number of loans approved, which is regarded as an important
indicator for future mortgage lending, is even more striking.
Some 26,989 new loans were approved in April, while in the previous month
31,518 were approved. Last month's figure is 24 per cent lower than the
35,348 approvals in April 1993.
Lord Inchyra, BBA director-general, said the reductions were similar to
those experienced by building societies.
However, in contrast to the banks, the societies' monthly lending figures
for April were higher than in April last year, even though they were lower
than in March this year.
Mr John Ecklin, BBA director of statistics, said that in 1993, monthly
mortgage lending by banks was higher than the previous year while societies
had been lending less.
'For the last four or five months the reverse has happened,' he said.
Lord Inchyra said it was 'too soon' to attribute the fall in mortgage
lending to the tax increases and the reduction in mortgage tax relief which
took effect at the beginning of April.

<TEXT>
Greater London remains the wealthiest region of the UK, but Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland are catching up, figures issued by the Central
Statistical Office showed yesterday.
In 1992, personal income per head in Greater London was Pounds 11,577, which
was 122 per cent of the average for the whole of the UK, while the
comparable figure in Wales and Northern Ireland was just Pounds 7,980 or
84.1 per cent of the average.
However, over the period from 1990 to 1992, incomes in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland grew most strongly while growth in the south-east of
England and Greater London was below average.
Scotland climbed for the first time above the UK average in terms of
personal disposable income per head, which is calculated after deducting
factors such as taxes and the community charge. The county with the highest
level of income per head was Surrey, with an average of Pounds 11,225 in
1991. The wealthiest county outside England was Lothian, with an average of
Pounds 9,510.
The poorest county in terms of income per head was Mid Glamorgan, with an
average of Pounds 6,858. The poorest English county was Durham, with an
average of Pounds 7,312.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Scott urged to broaden arms probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday called on Lord Justice Scott to broaden the scope of his
arms-for-Iraq inquiry to include leading businesspeople and bankers.
In a letter to the judge, Mr Michael Meacher, the party's public-service
spokesman, says the inquiry has been too narrow in focusing principally on
arms sales to Iraq between 1989 and 1990, and on the use of public interest
immunity certificates during the Matrix Churchill trial.
The letter refers to 'huge quantities' of arms being exported by the UK both
to Iraq and to Iran between 1980 and 1988, in 'defiance of UN international
embargoes' and with 'the full connivance of the British government'.
Mr Meacher says that the revelations that sparked the inquiry are only a
minor instance of a wider practice involving larger companies.
He writes: 'I submit that unless you question the leaders of the firms
controlling Britain's arms-export business . . . you will not . . . be able
to discover the full extent of the government's knowledge and active
involvement in the supply of arms to Iraq.'
Lord Justice Scott concluded the bulk of his hearings in March. He took
evidence mainly from civil servants, intelligence officials, and former and
serving ministers.
Mr Paul Regan, a spokesman for the inquiry, said that the judge had no
immediate comment on Mr Meacher's letter. However, he said that the judge
was 'still following leads he feels he has to follow up'.
In the past the judge has made clear he considers his terms of reference do
not cover a full inquiry into the main participants in the British arms
trade with Iraq and Iran. His inquiry covers the extent to which the
government may have broken its own rules.
Mr Meacher said last night he realised that extending the inquiry would mean
further delays to the publication of the judge's report.
However, he felt that such a delay would be justified in the public interest
as otherwise the judge's conclusions would be based on incomplete evidence.
He added: 'If the judge doesn't do what we are asking for, he is going to
let the government off the hook in a very big way.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / MPs likely to review funding for Hualon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons public accounts committee is likely to review the funding for a
Belfast textiles plant to be built by a Taiwanese group, two of whose top
managers have been charged in connection with an alleged share fraud.
According to a member of the committee there is concern that a non-elected
body - the province's Industrial Development Board - lobbied for a project
which may not have been justified economically.
Political leaders in Northern Ireland yesterday called on the development
board to ensure adequate safeguards were put in place before final approval
was given to a Pounds 61m grant to the Taiwanese textile company Hualon for
a Pounds 157m weaving, dyeing and finishing plant.
Mr Mark Durkan, chairman of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said the
project should only go ahead 'once it has been fully tested and examined',
following a report in yesterday's Financial Times that the European
Commission had approved grant-aiding the project only after intense lobbying
by the UK and against the advice of its own officials.
All three MEPs from Northern Ireland had been drafted in by the board to
lobby on behalf of the project once it transpired that serious objections
were being raised in Brussels.
Mr Jim Nicholson, the Ulster Unionist MEP, said he was asked to lobby for
the project 'so that the EU bureaucracy would not block it'. He said they
had been told by the board that several EU countries had objected to the
project on competition grounds, but he had been given no briefing on alleged
financial improprieties.
Both he and Mr John Hume, the SDLP MEP, met Mr Karel van Miert, competition
commissioner, in Strasbourg shortly before May 4, when the project was
approved.
Mr Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the Democratic Unionist party, whose MEP the
Rev Ian Paisley also lobbied on behalf of the project, said: 'The IDB should
make sure there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure we don't get
bitten again.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / 'Only 24% of dole leavers' go to jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer than a quarter of those leaving the unemployment register are going
into employment, says an analysis of government figures published today by
the Low Pay Network.
The network, the federation of low pay units which lobby on behalf of the
low-paid, said revised government figures showed that from last June to
December employment rose only 33,000 while unemployment fell 140,800.
The report's author said that not only was employment growth failing to
match the falls in employment, but such growth as there was in employment
was in part-time jobs.
The Department of Employment said the finding was not new. Thousands of
people came off and on the unemployment register in any month and it was
difficult to match jobless figures to employment data.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Welsh grant charges rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday rejected allegations that Pounds
7m of government grants had been illegally channelled to marginal
constituencies in mid Wales, Roland Adburgham writes.
In a BBC Wales television programme last night it was claimed the money was
disbursed through the Welsh Development Agency after the region lost its
assisted-area status in 1982. It was said that, under the 1975 act which set
up the development agency, it had no legal powers to do this.
Mr Jon Owen Jones, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, called on Mr Redwood to
resign. He said: 'It's a clear case of the political masters deciding that
the money should follow their own perceived political advantage.'
Mr Redwood accused the BBC of 'not doing its homework' and described the
allegations as 'scandalous'. He said: 'The legal advice I have is that the
powers are available under the WDA act.'
Parliament had been told in 1982 about the aid and it had not been
challenged. 'This is just a sign that we have an election coming up,' Mr
Redwood said. He would, however, call for a report from officials.
The Welsh Office said: 'The money has been used to finance business in mid
Wales, has created hundreds of jobs legitimately and has been audited. There
is no evidence at all that the scheme has been used for wrong purposes.'
Mr Ron Davies, Labour shadow Welsh secretary, said yesterday the government
had made a mistake in scrapping assisted area status for mid Wales.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Kent vineyard strives for buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wine production at Lamberhurst, one of England's biggest and best-known
vineyards, is being wound down after the business failed to attract a buyer
as a going concern.
The guide price for the vineyard, including a 17th-century farmhouse, a
restaurant and farm shop, has been halved to Pounds 750,000 and the property
is being re-offered for sale on a freehold basis.
Mr Kenneth McAlpine, 73, the vineyard's founder and owner, put the business
on the market for Pounds 1.5m last September because he wanted to retire.
Mr James Crawford of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the estate agents selling the
property near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said there was a 'lack of confidence in
the wine trade in the face of competition from other countries, cheap
imports and duty on wine going up every year'.
Mr McAlpine, a director of the Sir Robert McAlpine construction company,
said several potential buyers from the UK and abroad had thought it would be
'fun' to own a vineyard as a hobby. 'But when they discovered it was a
business with a turnover of Pounds 750,000 a year, they didn't want the
hassle of running it.'
Production, which used to account for a tenth of UK wine output, has been
reduced drastically, he said. 'We're not cultivating much of our vineyard at
all.' The restaurant and vineyard tours will close in September.
But Mr McAlpine, who has been in the wine business for 21 years, is
determined to maintain the Lamberhurst name if the new price fails to find a
buyer keen to revive the vineyard. He plans to keep three or four acres of
the 42-acre vineyard to produce red wine from a new German grape. He will
also continue to buy grapes from other English vineyards to make Lamberhurst
white wines on a smaller scale.
He will cut output from last year's 350,000 bottles - already well below
peak years of 500,000 - to 100,000, focusing on high-quality, high-priced
wine.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Cheap imports crush the English grape: Stewart Dalby finds
the wine industry facing a fresh set of difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English wine industry has suffered from the boom in cross-channel
imports of beer, wine and spirits, compounded by a higher rate of duty than
faced by continental competitors.
There are just over 450 vineyards in Britain, with approximately 60
wineries, covering 2,000 acres and producing, in a good year, 2.5m litres of
wine - about 0.3 per cent of British wine consumption.
The industry has always had its problems, not least fighting the perception
that the climate is not quite right for quality wine growing. It receives no
government assistance, unlike industries in other European countries, and
the UK is the only European Union country which charges tax on wine bought
at the vineyard.
The fragmented nature of the industry and lack of mass production means
overheads are high, marketing difficult and costs per bottle more than those
for most imported wines.
Since January last year taxes on imports from European producers were
abolished. English wine attracts a levy of Pounds 12.30 a case, or another
Pounds 1 a bottle.
Mr David Carr Taylor runs a 37-acre vine near Hastings in East Sussex. He
buys in a lot of grapes and produces about 100,000 bottles a year.
He says farm-gate sales are down more than 40 per cent in the past year and
sales to hotels and restaurants, which make up about 40 per cent of his
custom, are down 50 per cent.
'Since January 1993, a hotelier or restaurateur can drive a Transit van
across to Calais, buy a truck-load of wine at less than Pounds 2 a bottle
and still see a profit even after the ferry fare. Under the law anyone can
bring in enough for his or her own personal consumption, so if you are
running a restaurant you can get away with it,' he says.
He believes that the single market's easing of drink importation has much to
do with those declines in sales.
The situation is a little easier for quality wine makers. Mr Christopher Ann
runs the English Wine Centre in East Sussex - a small vineyard and
off-licence business.
He says: 'A lot of our business is special events and we have some secure
outlets. The quality end has held better than for table wines. Even so I
would guess business is down by 20 per cent. This is not solely due to the
cross-channel traffic. There are other factors, but certainly the imports
and the duty we have to pay have not helped.'
Ms Gay Biddlecombe, who runs the St George vineyard, also in East Sussex,
says: 'We have not been particularly affected by the cross-channel trade so
far, but this is because I specialise in niche marketing of quality wine.'
Commander Geoffrey Bond, chief executive of the English Vineyards
Association, says: 'We were already being hit by all kinds of regulation
which don't affect other producers in the EU. This duty is one more heavy
burden.'
The association is preparing to lobby the government to lift the duty. He
says: 'I am contacting all our members to find how business has been hit.
But I can well imagine that some vineyards are 50 per cent down in
business.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Associated to spend up to Pounds 50m on cable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated Newspapers plans to spend up to Pounds 50m over a number of years
to create Channel One, its new cable television channel aimed at cable
subscribers in London.
The owner of the Daily Mail and London's Evening Standard intends to launch
the channel in November on the London Interconnect Network, which links the
cable franchises of London.
There are 205,000 cable subscribers in the capital region - although the
total will almost certainly be higher when the channel is launched.
The investment cost has been pushed up from about Pounds 30m as the plans
have moved towards a considerable emphasis on news. Previous plans were more
entertainment-based.
The increased cost and the move towards news persuaded Mr Allan McKeown,
chief executive of SelecTv, to drop out of the project. Mr McKeown, whose
company has produced programmes such as Birds of a Feather, intended to take
a 20 per cent stake.
SelecTv plans to set up its own cable venture, The People's Channel, which
will use a lot of library material and will have a maximum cable requirement
of Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m.
Associated, which will get a monthly fee for each subscriber, is clearly
hoping to take a version of the channel to other large urban areas which are
being cabled. Channel One is seen as a long-term strategic investment by the
company.
According to official Independent Television Commission figures 642,377
homes are connected to modern cable networks. But although more cable is
being laid, the penetration rate - the proportion of those subscribing to
those who could - of 21.5 per cent has not risen over the past year.
Channel One can only be seen as a long-term strategic investment by
Associated, whose chairman Lord Rothermere has been determined for some time
to increase the group's presence in the electronic media.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Minister blocks Pounds 7.5m aid for Brixton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Young, inner-cities minister, has refused to approve a Pounds
7.5m grant to Brixton, one of London's most run-down inner-city districts,
because of delays by Lambeth Borough Council in approving projects.
The south London district faces the loss of more than Pounds 30m of
government funds for urban regeneration because of the delays.
Brixton, the scene of much-publicised rioting in 1981, is one of 31
inner-city areas to have won funds in the government's City Challenge
programme. The Brixton Challenge plan was awarded Pounds 7.5m a year over
five years for an urban regeneration plan which included a Pounds 40m
shopping mall in the centre of the area. But the scheme has failed to hit
most of its performance targets and underspent its first-year budget by
Pounds 1.8m.
Sir George has refused to approve the second year's grant until he has
assurances from council leaders that they will speed up their approvals for
the scheme's projects.
He is also concerned that the political impasse on the council, which has
had no overall political control since last month's council elections, could
make it impossible for Brixton Challenge to function effectively. The
council met last night to discuss committee chairmanships after arguing over
the procedure for electing the mayor at two previous meetings.
Sir George told leaders of the political groups on Lambeth council that the
Brixton Challenge had given him more trouble than any of the other 30 City
Challenge schemes. They have until June 10 to convince him that they will
clear the obstacles to the scheme.
Leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democrat groups on the council, which each
have 24 seats, said last night that Sir George would receive the necessary
assurances. Ms Anna Tapsell, leader of the Labour group, said the problems
had arisen out of the council's 'over-bureaucratic ways of working with
Brixton Challenge'.
She added that she expected new standing orders to be introduced to ensure
that urgent business passed through the council more quickly.
Mr Mike Tuffrey, Liberal Democrat leader, said he was confident that his
party and Labour would be able to give the assurances.
However, Mr Hugh Jones, leader of the 16 Conservative councillors, warned
that future funding would depend on the parties demonstrating that they
could operate council business. He said: 'The signs are not that good at the
moment. It took the council over 13 hours to elect a mayor.'
Two other schemes, in Leicester and the London Borough of Brent, are also
being monitored closely by the environment department. Their continuing
funding will be reviewed by ministers in the autumn, halfway through the
1994-95 year.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Chaos feared from tighter air cargo checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Security regulations on the shipment of air cargo which take effect today
could delay exports and cause chaos at airports, a large freight-forwarding
company claims. Only one in eight of cargo agents is thought to be able to
meet the new rules.
New security rules have been brought in partly in response to the bombing of
a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie. They require the registration of air
cargo agents with the threat of delays for shipments sent by unapproved
companies.
MSAS Cargo International, the second-largest UK freight forwarder, said that
confusion about the new regulations had meant that many agents and airlines
had not yet invested in the x-ray equipment which would be needed, nor had
they trained their staff to hand-search cargo.
MSAS also said shippers faced the prospect of additional charges to carry
out cargo screening.
The Aviation and Security (Air Cargo Agents) Regulations, which were brought
in after three years of consultation with the industry, establish the
concept of 'listed agents', who are approved and registered by the
Department of Transport.
Listed agents can in turn declare shippers to be 'known customers' if they
are reputable, regular exporters which operate from secure sites.
Cargo sent by known customers and listed agents can be shipped without
stringent security checks, but other cargoes must be x-rayed or
hand-searched. If this is not possible then the cargo must be held for the
duration of the planned flight, plus two hours, but with a minimum wait of
12 hours.
Mail and courier parcels which are less than  1/4 inch thick are exempt.
The Department of Transport said the June deadline had been known since last
September.
It also said that about 110 of an estimated 800 agents have achieved listed
status, and more were applying.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Redwood denies grant claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday rejected allegations that Pounds
7m of government grants had been illegally channelled to marginal
constituencies in mid Wales.
In a BBC Wales television programme screened last night, it was claimed that
the money was disbursed via the Welsh Development Agency after the region
lost its assisted area status in 1982.
It was alleged that, under the 1975 act which set up the WDA, the agency had
no legal powers to do this.
Mr Jon Owen Jones, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, called on Mr Redwood to
resign. 'It's a clear case of the political masters deciding that the money
should follow their own perceived political advantage,' he said.
Mr Redwood accused the BBC of 'not doing its homework' and described the
allegations as 'scandalous'. He said: 'The legal advice I have is that the
powers are available under the WDA act.'
Parliament had been told in 1982 about the aid and it had not been
challenged. 'This is just a sign that we have an election coming up,' said
Mr Redwood. But he said he would call for a report from officials.
The Welsh Office said: 'The money has been used to finance business in mid
Wales, has created hundreds of jobs legitimately and has been audited. There
is no evidence at all that the scheme has been used for wrong purposes.'
In last night's programme, Mr Michael Henry, a former WDA director of
corporate services, said he had received legal advice that the grant aid was
outside the agency's powers, but had been told not to take it further.
Mr Henry was dismissed last autumn in the wake of criticisms of the agency
by the Commons public accounts committee, and is claiming unfair dismissal.
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, said yesterday the government had
made a mistake in scrapping assisted area status for mid Wales.
'The whole incident highlights the incompetence and stupidity of government
policy and the way they have handed over an increasing range of public
services and taxpayers' money to unaccountable bodies,' he said.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Beckett attacks government's 'sweatshop' policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of
seeking to turn Britain into the 'sweatshop of the world' as the focus of
the European election campaign shifted to economic policy. Leading Labour
politicians gave an enthusiastic, if qualified, reception to a report from
the party's Social Justice Commission urging a 'Citizens' Service' programme
to tackle youth unemployment.
Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the race for the Labour leadership, said the
proposal to take unemployed people aged between 16 and 24 off the dole
through paid but voluntary service schemes marked an 'excellent'
contribution to his party's policymaking.
His enthusiasm was echoed by several members of Labour's shadow cabinet,
with Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, suggesting that up to
750,000 young people could benefit.
The Liberal Democrats welcomed the proposal as 'a shift to our ground'. But
Mr Malcolm Bruce, their trade and industry spokesman, warned that without a
strong commitment to education or training, the scheme would merely 'plaster
over the cracks'.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, rejected the idea and accused Labour of
promot-ing a dependency culture.
Mr Hunt, stressing the government's commitment to high-quality education and
training, said: 'I don't want 16 and 17-year-olds going straight from school
on to social security or weeding grass verges.'
Mr Hunt was forced to acknowledge that nearly 80,000 school-leavers aged
between 16 and 17 fall through the government's training and social security
safety nets. This group - at the centre of the recent political row about
begging on the streets - are denied benefit because they do not take up
training places.
His comments came as Mr John Major launched a Conservative defence of the
government's decision to opt out of the European Union's social chapter.
He said that Britain's lower social costs were a vital ingredient in its
strong record of job creation over the past year and cited widespread
support from business for the opt-out.
Mrs Beckett used a keynote speech to attack the government's approach. She
said the Tory future for Britain was a 'low-wage, low-skill economy where
pay and living standards are driven down'. She said the first act of a
Labour government would be to sign the social chapter in a commitment to
high wages, high skills and job creation.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Societies under probe by Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering ways of making building societies more
accountable to their members as part of the Treasury review of the 1986
legislation which governs societies.
But societies are set to retain some protection from predatory takeover
offers by banks or other organisations.
In a delay to the original schedule, the first stage of the review is now
expected to be announced to the Commons in the second half of this month.
Officials have submitted initial views, but ministers have yet to decide
what changes they wish to make.
The review, set up in January, will also have to take account of the outcome
of the legal challenge to the agreed Pounds 1.8bn Lloyds Bank offer for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. The two days of hearings ended
last week, but judgment has been reserved.
Despite the lobbying from banks such as Abbey National and TSB Group,
ministers see political disadvantages in exposing societies to hostile
takeover offers by other institutions.
There is a recognition at the Treasury, however, that corporate governance
arrangements which were adequate when societies were smaller organisations
now need changes. The largest societies each have more than 1m members.
Although many societies insist they are already accountable, measures to
improve accountability appear to be the price they will have to pay for the
greater freedoms they will enjoy as a result of the review.
Among suggestions to the Treasury is a requirement that, if a society's
board advises accepting an offer from a bank, then it should obtain two
independent valuations to ensure that members do not lose from the society
being undervalued.
The second stage of the review is likely to consider what specific changes
can be carried out through existing powers, through the new powers which
will be available from the de-regulation bill currently before parliament,
and what would require new legislation.
Some existing restrictions on societies - most notably the ceiling of 40 per
cent on the amount of funds they can raise on the wholesale market - look
certain to be relaxed.

FT  01 JUN 94 / More tunnel freight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel takes a further step towards paying its way today with
the start of long-distance freight services carrying new cars from the West
Midlands to Milan.
Rover Group will make its first shipment of about 250 cars to its Italian
distribution centre as part of a regular service involving five trainloads a
week.
The journey will take two days compared with eight days previously.
Railfreight Distribution, the British Rail subsidiary, expects to run six
freight trains a day each way through the tunnel by midsummer, rising to 27
a day by the end of 1995.
Through freight trains are the second type of service to begin running
through the tunnel after the start of freight shuttles, which carry lorries
between Folkestone and Calais, on May 19. Passenger services are expected to
start in July.

FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: Edgy Tory walks along a thin tightrope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Prout has a slightly edgy look as he sits each morning on
the platform at Conservative Central Office to be quizzed by the media about
next month's European elections. Friends of the MEP, who leads the Tory
group in the Strasbourg assembly, say his demeanour betrays nothing more
than his usual, pleasantly self-effacing disposition.
Political opponents judge that Sir Christopher, a committed European in a
party torn by internal divisions, is deeply embarrassed by the government's
negative campaigning.
Whatever the truth, he is walking the thinnest of tightropes. His strongly
pro-European instincts sit distinctly uneasily beside Mr John Major's
judgment that the Tories' best chance of avoiding annihilation on June 9 is
to pitch for the chauvinist vote.
Sir Christopher plays the game skilfully. A flick through his speeches
during 15 years in the European parliament leaves no doubt where he stands.
He does not advocate the monolithic superstate the government professes to
be battling against. But he is happy with words such as 'federal', with the
ambition of a single currency and the concept of more majority voting in the
Council of Ministers.
He insists relations between the 32-strong group of Tory MEPs and the
government have improved since the disastrous 1989 election when the MEPs
were driven to revolt by Baroness Thatcher's campaign against a 'diet of
Brussels'.
Not all colleagues are so sure. One Tory MEP was recently overheard
contrasting the government's attitude to its MEPs with its approach to the
IRA: ministers were at least prepared to talk to the terrorists.
Sir Christopher stresses that he regards the national veto so vigorously
defended by Mr Major as vital in the areas of foreign policy and taxation.
Transfer of authority on those issues to Brussels would 'erode the
sovereignty of the state and the sovereignty of Westminster'.
But, parting company with the likes of Mr Michael Portillo and others on the
Tory Euro-sceptic right, he added: 'It has always been my personal view that
it is possible to have a single currency without undermining national
sovereignty.'
Sir Christopher reinforces the point with a reference to the Victorian past,
when the currency was fixed to the gold standard: 'No-one imagined then that
the supply of money was not a fit matter to be left to the Bank (of
England).'
He is keen also to see the powers of the European parliament increased. Its
present authority to sack the European Commission in its entirety should be
extended to allow it to dismiss individual members of the executive, he
believes.
The assembly's powers of co-decision with the Council of Ministers should
apply in all areas where there is majority voting: 'It is important to have
a fuller democratic blocking mechanism.'
He takes issue with those in his party who believe that Britain's main task
over the next few years will be resisting the centralist juggernaut.
Although he does not fear economic and monetary union, he believes the
momentum has been lost. 'My view is that the time for a single currency has
probably come and gone.' Instead: 'The big problem that Europe is going to
face in the medium term is not centralisation. It is nationalism.'
He distinguishes between benign patriotism and malign nationalism: 'I am
quite fearful about the nationalism that feeds on enemies.'
Stressing that the EU must quickly enlarge eastwards, he warns that Germany
and Russia might otherwise divide up the former communist bloc countries of
central and eastern Europe into national spheres of interest. That last
happened in the late 1930s.
The way to stop history repeating itself is to build on the model provided
by the EU's precursor - the European Coal and Steel Community  - and to
begin now the process of drawing in the former communist bloc countries.
It all sounds sensible stuff. But sadly it is not the message Mr Major
thinks will persuade disgruntled Tory voters to turn out and support the
party on June 9. Better to tell them that the government will fight off the
bureaucrats of Brussels while the opposition parties run up the white flag.
For his part Sir Christopher has a reasonable chance of holding on to the
Herefordshire and Shropshire constituency against a threat from both the
Liberal Democrats and Labour. Many of his colleagues will not be so lucky.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Wine business struggles for a buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wine production at Lamberhurst, one of England's biggest and best-known
vineyards, is being wound down after the business failed to attract a buyer
as a going concern.
The guide price for the vineyards, including a 17th-century farmhouse, a
restaurant and farm shop, has been halved to Pounds 750,000 and the property
is being re-offered for sale on a freehold basis.
Mr Kenneth McAlpine, 73, the vineyards' founder and owner, put the business
on the market for Pounds 1.5m last September because he wanted to retire.
Mr James Crawford of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the estate agents selling the
property near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said there was a 'lack of confidence in
the wine trade in the face of competition from other countries, cheap
imports and duty on wine going up every year'.
Mr McAlpine, a director of the Sir Robert McAlpine construction company,
said several potential buyers from the UK and abroad had thought it would be
'fun' to own a vineyard as a hobby. 'But when they discovered it was a
business with a turnover of Pounds 750,000 a year, they didn't want the
hassle of running it.'
Production, which used to account for a tenth of UK wine output, has been
reduced dramatically, he said. 'We're not cultivating much of our vineyard
at all.' The restaurant and vineyard tours will close in September.
But Mr McAlpine, who has been in the wine business for 21 years, is
determined to maintain the Lamberhurst name if the new price fails to find a
buyer keen to revive the vineyard.
He plans to keep three or four acres of the 42 acre-vineyard to produce red
wine from a new German grape. He will also continue to buy grapes from other
English vineyards to make Lamberhurst white wines on a smaller scale.
He will cut output from last year's 350,000 bottles - already well below
peak years of 500,000 - to 100,000, focusing on high-quality, high-priced
wine. He intends to retain a long-term lease on the winery so he can
continue production.
If the rest of the vineyard falls into disuse, Mr McAlpine will
paradoxically have contributed to what he regards as the solution to the
industry's problems. A glut of wine has pushed prices down and made
production uneconomic, so England's 2,500 acres of vineyards must be
reduced, he said.
'In three or four years, England, and the rest of the world, will have
reduced production and prices should start going up again.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Hualon faces MPs' inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons public accounts committee is likely to review the funding for a
Belfast textiles plant to be built by a Taiwanese group, two of whose top
managers have been charged in connection with an alleged share fraud.
According to a member of the committee there is concern that a non-elected
body - the province's Industrial Development Board - lobbied for a project
which may not have been justified economically.
Political leaders in Northern Ireland yesterday called on the IDB to ensure
adequate safeguards were put in place before final approval was given to a
Pounds 61m grant to the Taiwanese textile company Hualon for a Pounds 157m
weaving, dyeing and finishing plant.
Mr Mark Durkan, chairman of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said the
project should only go ahead 'once it has been fully tested and examined',
following a report in yesterday's Financial Times that the European
Commission had approved grant-aiding the project only after intense lobbying
by the UK and against the advice of its own officials.
All three MEPs from Northern Ireland had been drafted in by the IDB to lobby
on behalf of the project once it transpired serious objections were being
raised to it in Brussels.
Mr Jim Nicholson, the Ulster Unionist MEP, said he was asked to lobby on
behalf of the project 'so that the EU bureaucracy would not block it'. He
said they had been told by the IDB that Spain and several other EU countries
had objected to the project, 'and even a few companies in the UK' on
competitions grounds, but he had been given no briefing on alleged financial
improprieties.
Both he and Mr John Hume, the SDLP MEP, met Mr Karel van Miert, competition
commissioner, in Strasbourg shortly before May 4, when the project was
approved.
Mr Sammy Wilson, spokesman for the Democratic Unionist party, whose MEP the
Rev Ian Paisley also lobbied on behalf of the project, said 'The IDB should
make sure there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure we don't get
bitten again.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Imports cause vine to wither
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English wine industry has suffered from the boom in cross-channel
imports of beer, wine and spirits, compounded by a higher rate of duty than
faced by continental competitors.
There are just more than 450 vineyards in Britain, with approximately 60
wineries, covering 2,000 acres and producing, in a good year, 2.5m litres of
wine - about 0.3 per cent of British wine consumption.
The industry has always had its problems, not least fighting the perception
that the climate is not quite right for quality wine growing. It receives no
government assistance, unlike industries in other European countries, and
the UK is the only European Union country which charges tax on wine bought
at the vineyard.
The fragmented nature of the industry and lack of mass production means
overheads are high, marketing is difficult and costs per bottle are more
than most imported wines.
Since January last year taxes on imports from European producers were
abolished. English wine attracts a levy of Pounds 12.30 a case or another
Pounds 1 a bottle.
Mr David Carr Taylor runs a 37-acre vine near Hastings in East Sussex. He
buys in a lot of grapes and produces about 100,000 bottles a year. He says
farm-gate sales are down more than 40 per cent in the past year and sales to
hotels and restaurants, which make up about 40 per cent of his custom, are
down 50 per cent.
He believes that the single market's easing of drink importation has much to
do with those declines in sales.
The situation is a little easier for quality wine makers. Mr Christopher Ann
runs the English Wine Centre in East Sussex - a small vineyard and
off-licence business.
He says: 'A lot of our business is special events and we have some secure
outlets. The quality end has held better than for table wines. Even so I
would guess business is down by 20 per cent. This is not solely due to the
cross-channel traffic. There are other factors, but certainly the imports
and the duty we have to pay have not helped.'
Ms Gay Biddlecombe, who runs the St George vineyard, also in East Sussex,
says: 'We have not been particularly affected by the cross-channel trade so
far, but this is because I specialise in niche marketing of quality wine.'
Commander Geoffrey Bond, chief executive of the English Vineyards
Association, says: 'We were already being hit by all kinds of regulation
which don't affect other producers in the EU. This duty is one more heavy
burden.'
The association is preparing to lobby the government to lift the duty. He
says: 'I am contacting all our members to find how business has been hit.
But I can well imagine that some vineyards are 50 per cent down in
business.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / States tell cigarette makers to cough up on health costs:
Fresh legal attacks by Florida and Mississippi that, if successful and
replicated, could force the cigarette manufacturers out of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US tobacco industry is under fresh attack. In the last few days, two
states - Mississippi and Florida - have announced plans to take US cigarette
manufacturers to court in an attempt to recoup costs incurred in treating
smoking-related diseases under medical assistance programmes such as
Medicaid.
The sums the states are seeking are vast: Florida says smoking-related
illnesses have cost the state at least Dollars 1.2bn in medical costs since
1989. If its legal action succeeds, and other states do the same, the
cigarette manufacturers could be forced out of business.
In its intensifying war against the tobacco industry, the US anti-smoking
lobby has backed many attempts to sue cigarette manufacturers for the health
costs associated with smoking. All efforts have failed: the industry has yet
to pay a cent in damages.
But these latest cases are different. Earlier suits were brought against
manufacturers on behalf of individuals or groups of individuals seeking
compensation for their suffering. Mississippi and Florida are not
representing individuals: they are asking the industry as a whole to
reimburse them for the direct economic costs of treating smoking-related
diseases.
The distinction is important because it could deny cigarette makers the
opportunity to deploy some of their most powerful defences. In previous
cases, manufacturers have successfully argued that individuals who smoke
knowingly assume all the risks associated with the habit; that those who
become ill cannot conclusively prove that smoking was the cause; or that no
one can be sure which manufacturer's cigarettes caused the illness.
Mississippi believes it will overcome these defences by filing a claim
against all 13 US cigarette manufacturers seeking reimbursement of the
health costs it incurs in treating smokers. If it wins, the damages will be
split between the companies according to their market share.
'This lawsuit is premised on a simple notion. You caused the health crisis:
now you pay for it,' Mr Mike Moore, Mississippi attorney general, said.
Florida has gone further by signing into law an act that will specifically
deny cigarette manufacturers the right to deploy their traditional defences,
arguing that they are irrelevant to the issue of how much the state pays out
to treat smoking-related diseases. This will greatly enhance the prospects
of a successful suit.
'We're going to take the Marlboro Man to court,' said Florida's Governor
Lawton Chiles, who is running for a second term in office.
The moves by the two states come against a background of growing hostility
to smoking in the US from anti-smoking groups, government officials and
legislators at local and national level. Ms Jennifer Lew, managing attorney
at the Tobacco Products Liability Project, a Boston-based anti-smoking
group, says: 'I think the tide has turned so that this sort of legislation
has become politically palatable.'
Even so, some are concerned about the implications. Associated Industries of
Florida, a business organisation for the state, says the principles
enshrined in Florida's new legislation could easily be extended to the
manufacture of dairy products, sugar, pharmaceuticals or cars. It says it
will fight for a repeal.
The cigarette manufacturers will also fight the legislative moves. They will
almost certainly challenge the constitutionality of Florida's new law; and
in the event that any suit succeeds, they will almost certainly appeal. Ms
Lew acknowledged that it could be years before the first case is settled.
Financially, that may be no bad thing. Like other states, Florida does well
out of cigarette sales. Officials concede that the Dollars 1.2bn it has paid
out in medical costs in the last five years is not as much as the Dollars
2bn it has collected in taxes on cigarettes.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US begins talks on linking workers' rights
to trade
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US trade officials said yesterday they had begun consulting with trading
partners on the vexed question of workers' rights and trade, and hoped to
raise the issue formally within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
before the summer break.
Developing countries have vigorously rejected tying worker rights to trade
privileges, which they regard as a cover for protectionism.
The US, backed by the European Union and other industrialised nations, says
its object is not to remove the comparative advantage of low labour-cost
countries, but to curb human rights abuses such as bans on trade union
membership, forced labour and child exploitation.
Though not on the formal agenda, the idea of a 'social clause' in Gatt is
expected to feature strongly in discussions at the annual conference of the
International Labour Organisation, which begins next week in Geneva.
Mr Michel Hansenne, director-general of the UN agency, has said he
personally favours a 'social clause' related to the ILO's core conventions:
the right to form trade unions and bargain collectively, and the ban on
forced labour. These, he argues, are basic human rights and can be applied
by countries at any level of development.
He proposes making a ban on child labour effective within five to 10 years.
A report by an ILO committee published yesterday urges the ILO to tighten
enforcement of international labour standards, singling out breaches of the
forced labour convention including forced child labour and child
prostitution. The ILO now relies mainly on moral persuasion and, in rare
cases, public condemnation.
The report calls for closer scrutiny of compliance with the core human
rights conventions, possible compensation for those adversely affected by
violations of ILO standards and voluntary mediation and arbitration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European aerospace companies yesterday called on Japan to include them in
its latest attempt to fulfil a long-frustrated ambition of creating a world
class Japanese civil aircraft industry.
A committee of the European Business Community, Europe's main business lobby
in Japan, voiced dismay at the inclusion of Boeing as the sole western
aerospace group in an important government-backed development project for a
short range passenger aircraft, code-named YSX. China is also taking part.
The 70-80 seat carrier, due to come into service at the turn of this decade,
is 'the essence' of Japanese civil aerospace policy, according to Mr
Toshifumi Hirai, director of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry's aircraft and ordnance division. As such, it is of vital interest
to foreign suppliers.
Miti officials stressed that the inclusion of Boeing in the initial research
for the YSX did not mean European suppliers would be excluded.
However, the EBC's aeronautics and space committee was unconvinced and
warned that the exclusion of European suppliers would 'further contribute to
the imbalance between the US and Europe in Japanese aerospace
collaboration'. Japan was depriving itself of the 'longstanding experience
of European manufacturers in the regional market', it said.
ATR, the Franco-Italian regional airliner-making joint venture, and
Saab-Scania of Sweden are among the groups angling for a stake in the
project.
Until last year, Miti was hoping to develop a medium range 150-seater
aircraft, the YXX, with Boeing. But the ministry had to freeze the YXX after
Boeing went for the cheaper option of updating an existing aircraft series.
Japan was unable to continue alone, a frustrating reminder of its dependence
on US aerospace technology.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Zapatistas to vote on 'final' peace accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of Mexico's rebel Zapatista Army of National Liberation say that
they have finished consultations on the government's proposed peace
agreement and that their supporters will now begin voting on the accord.
The rebels began internal consultations after the government proposed a
32-point peace plan at the beginning of March, but these were suspended
after the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's
presidential candidate, on March 23. They resumed at the end of April.
The government promised in its peace offer to redistribute land in the
southern state of Chiapas, where the rebels launched their rebellion on New
Year's Day, and implement potentially far-reaching judicial and social
reforms in the state. It also said it would give increased protection and
rights for the Indian population.
Although the agreement did not directly meet the rebel demand for national
democratic reforms, such concerns were simultaneously negotiated with
opposition parties.
While the Zapatistas are not expected to break a ceasefire in place since
early January, most observers doubt they will accept the peace offer without
conditions.
Rebel leaders have been suspicious of the government's willingness to
implement the accord, and have previously indicated they will not approve an
agreement at least until this August's presidential election, as a way of
maintaining pressure on the government to hold fair elections.
The vote on the agreement by rebel supporters will take place in the region
of southern Chiapas under Zapatista control.
It is expected that the voting process will take some time, and no date has
been fixed for a final result.
The Zapatistas claimed that the vote would be 'free and democratic' but have
now closed the territory under their control to the press and outside
observers.
Democratic Congressman Robert Torricelli says he sees no quick end to the
uprising in Chiapas and warned it could spread, Reuter reports from Mexico
City.
The New Jersey representative said on Monday the problems of poverty and
corruption that produced the uprising in Chiapas existed elsewhere in Mexico
and this could lead to more violence.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Brittan says No to job as WTO chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, moved swiftly yesterday to damp
speculation he could be in the running to head the new World Trade
Organisation in Geneva, due to come into force at the beginning of next
year.
Mr Peter Guilford, his spokesman, said Sir Leon 'has no interest in the job
and can foresee no circumstances whatsoever under which he would be
interested'.
There was speculation at the EU's Brussels headquarters that the linking of
Sir Leon's name with the WTO vacancy was 'French mischief', part of a
campaign by Paris to ditch Sir Leon's candidacy for the European Commission
presidency. France is backing Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister, to succeed Mr Jacques Delors.
Sir Leon's name is not among those circulating in Geneva as serious
contenders for the WTO post, who include Mr Renato Ruggiero, former Italian
trade minister and now deputy chairman of Fiat, Mr Rubens Ricupero,
Brazilian finance minister, and Mr Philip Burdon, trade minister of New
Zealand.
Trade officials take a cool view of suggestions that the WTO might be some
sort of consolation prize for failed candidates elsewhere. Lord Lawson, who
is bidding for the OECD top job, has also been mentioned as a possible WTO
chief.
Mr Peter Sutherland, whose decision to step aside as director-general of the
Gatt has created the WTO vacancy, is being mooted as a possible compromise
choice as European Commission president. Mr Sutherland, who is Irish, has
denied seeking the job.
The workability of the new WTO will be established quickly through the use
of its trade disputes procedure, according to Mr Sutherland.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Brazil fails in bid to update constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's attempt to update its constitution ended largely in failure
yesterday, highlighting the weaknesses in the country's political system.
The constitutional revision process, under way in Congress since October,
has failed to make any of the important changes most analysts believe are
crucial for the government to regain control of the economy.
Reforms to the tax, social security and government spending regimes failed
to win congressional support. As a result, the country's next president -
due to take office in January - will continue to face serious problems
balancing the budget and tackling inflation.
Congress also failed to pass reforms opening the economy to foreign
investment and easing constraints on foreign companies in the mining sector.
The revision failed partly because of political corruption hearings last
year, which sometimes bought congressional business to a standstill. More
importantly, congressmen were not prepared to vote on controversial issues
in an election year.
Brazil also lacks an efficient party political system to force congressmen
to attend sessions. This led to delays in the revision process.
Mr Nelson Jobim, in charge of the revision process, said he was leaving
Congress after the elections, mainly because of disappointment at the
revision's failure.
Congress did make some changes to the constitution, which was adopted in
1988 in a backlash against two decades of military dictatorship, but has
since been criticised as highly idealistic. The most important change was
approval of a two-year emergency social fund, designed to bring short-term
relief to the government's finances. But without longer term reforms to the
tax and social security systems, the fund is very limited in scope.
A second change, reducing future presidential terms from five to four years,
again showed the depth of Brazil's political problems. Congress approved the
measure to make presidential terms the same as Congress. But a proposal to
allow presidents to seek re-election was rejected, mainly because Congress
and state governors fear any one party controlling government for eight
years.
As a result, future presidents will have only four years to carry out their
programmes, scarcely enough in Brazil's ponderous politics.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's software exports soared 51 per cent in the year to March to Rs10.2bn
(Pounds 215.5m), as the industry successfully maintained the fast pace of
growth of recent years.
Total turnover also expanded rapidly by 47 per cent to Rs17.1bn, according
to figures released yesterday by the National Association of Software and
Service Companies.
Indian producers believe they are now reaping the benefits of establishing
themselves in international markets. Export sales are dominated by a handful
of larger companies, notably Tata Consultancy Services, a member of the Tata
industrial grouping, which had overseas sales of Rs2bn. Altogether 100
companies exported software worth Rs10m or more, compared with only five
five years ago.
Indian companies often used to send engineers to the US and other countries
to work on projects on-site. Recently, however, Indian companies have been
carrying out more of their work in India, transmitting the results to
clients by data communications lines.

The US and Japan will have their first opportunity to put their newfound
co-operative spirit to the test when they resume talks in Washington today
on access to Japan's insurance market.
The insurance sector will be the first specific issue the two countries will
tackle since they agreed earlier this month to try to negotiate a framework
for opening Japanese markets to foreign goods and services and to reduce
Japan's current account surplus.
The US has argued that Japan has structural barriers and regulations which
hinder foreign penetration of the insurance market.
Japan maintains that its insurance market is already quite open.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Slower US growth eases economy fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New signals of slowing economic activity yesterday took the edge off
remaining fears that the US economy might be growing at an unsustainable
pace.
The Commerce Department reported that disposable personal incomes fell by
0.2 per cent in April, while spending on personal consumption fell by 0.1
per cent.
Higher wages and salaries raised total personal income by 0.4 per cent, a
more modest gain than in recent months, but increased tax payments as last
year's budget took effect on higher income taxpayers depressed disposable
income.
At the same time, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell by 7
per cent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 683,000 homes,
while consumer confidence dipped sharply, according to the Conference
Board's May index.
'What we are seeing is that the economy was growing faster than could be
internally sustained, particularly in the consumer sector, and now it is
slowing to a pace which is more sustainable,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg,
manager of macro-economic analysis at Merrill Lynch, the US stockbroker.
Yesterday's data followed an unexpected upwards revision on Friday in the
Commerce Department's estimate of growth in the first quarter, to an
annualised rate of 3 per cent.
Although the US economy is expected to show stronger growth in the second
quarter than in the first, as the country shakes off the frosts of January
and February, it is also starting to feel the effects of a series of
interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board.
April's drop in home sales showed the impact of rising interest rates on the
construction sector, even before the Fed's most recent half percentage point
rise two weeks ago.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which dropped to 87.6 in
May from 92.1 in April, also appears to reflect a reaction to higher
interest rates.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, came under fire last week from senior
Democratic senators who complained that he was stamping out the recovery by
raising interest rates long before there were any real signs of inflation.
But most private sector economists still see a strong pace of growth, and
will be looking more closely at today's purchasing managers' index and
Friday's report on employment in May than at yesterday's signals of
slowdown.
'We are slowing from a 5 per cent pace of growth at the end of last year,
and I think there is still some ambiguity over whether we are slowing to a
little under 3 per cent or a little under 4 per cent. Our view is that the
slowdown is only gradual,' said Mr Robert Mellman of JP Morgan, the New York
bank, which is forecasting a 6 per cent growth rate in the second quarter,
slowing to a rate of 3.5 per cent by the end of the year.

FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Modernising Mexico open for water business
 -Foreign prospects in a fast-developing sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and French companies are competing fiercely to gain a hold in
Mexico's water sector, drawn by an industry that is being partly opened to
private investment and is in desperate need of modernisation.
Over the past year Thames, Severn Trent, North West Water, Biwater, Anglian
Water of the UK, and Lyonnaise des Eaux and Generale des Eaux of France,
with local partners have won contracts worth more than Dollars 1bn to build
water treatment plants or to modernise municipal water systems in Mexico.
Other British and French companies have bid unsuccessfully for contracts.
Further investment is likely to run into billions of dollars. Just a fifth
of Mexico's sewage is treated, a proportion that will have to grow when new
laws regarding water quality are enforced. A quarter of the population does
not have access to running water, and still more receive irregular service.
However, foreign companies in Mexico warn that the market is highly
competitive and grumble that margins are so low that they often do not
justify the still considerable risks. 'Mexico is a big market,' says Bob
Tippings of Biwater in Mexico, 'but there are a lot of players. We have more
profitable business in Venezuela where there is less rivalry.' Apart from
the foreign companies, there are half a dozen Mexican construction companies
keen to win water contracts.
Operators further complain that doing business with Mexico's municipal
governments can be time consuming and frustrating. Despite regulations that
permit private investment, many say there is considerable resistance to
their presence at the lower levels of the government, and this has led to
costly delays in construction and financing of plants.
'The municipalities are a disaster,' says one government water official.
'They are too small, badly managed, and have no tradition of managing water
efficiently.' The World Bank, in a recent report on Mexico, says water
contracts at the local level are decided more on political than economic
grounds.
Waste water treatment plants are generally seen as the best opportunity in
the short term. Some private operators reckon that there needs to be about
Dollars 5bn of investment in treatment plants if municipal governments are
to meet new federal regulations that subject them to fines if they do not
clean their waste water.
Under the most common scheme, the private operator pays for the treatment
plants, and in return is given management and ownership with a guaranteed
amount of business for a set number of years, under the so-called
Built-Operating-Transfer blueprint. Such BOTs have been negotiated in Puerto
Vallarta, Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Hermosillo, Obregon, Puebla, Leon, La
Paz and Tampico.
Private operators have so far found it difficult to raise debt collaterised
by future revenues because of concern about the creditworthiness of the
municipalities. The worry is that the municipal government will not be able
to pay the operator the agreed price for treating water and renege on the
contract.
Banobras, a state development bank, has now agreed to guarantee the
contracts between the municipal governments and the operator, thereby giving
the collaterised debt a higher credit rating.
Mexico City plans eventually to give private companies full operational
control over its water system. Last year the city government split the
capital into four regions, and awarded contracts to four consortiums of
water companies.
In the first phase, the companies will install 700,000 meters on a contract
basis; in the second they will operate the system in the name of the
government; and in the third they will take full control, buying water in
bulk and selling it directly, at regulated prices, to customers.

This is a sharp turnaround from the Treasury prediction last October before
the general election that returned the National party government. The
Treasury then predicted a deficit of NZDollars 1.4bn. Mr Birch said that
thanks to the rapidly improving economy, tax receipts would be NZDollars 2bn
higher than expected, while government spending and other costs had been

Hong Kong's property market, under scrutiny by the government, has received
a boost with the sale of the New Territories' San Miguel Brewery site for
HKDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 300m), sharply above market expectations, writes
Louise Lucas. The 494,700 sq ft site went to Diamond Hill Development, a
vehicle in which Wheelock, Wharf Holdings and Hong Kong Realty and Trust
have equal shares.
Uncertainty has dogged the market since March, when Mr Chris Patten, the
governor, announced his intention to look at ways to control prices amid
concern that home ownership is beyond the reach of many families.

South Africa is today to become the 51st member of the Commonwealth,

Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary general, said the admission of a

co-sponsor a conference with the United Nations in mid-September for
potential donors 'to help South Africa make up for the huge gaps made by
years of apartheid'.
Yesterday the country also joined the Non-Aligned Movement of developing

Alfred Nzo, South African foreign minister, committed his country to share
its economic, technological and scientific skills with developing nations,
particularly in Africa.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Tokyo takes step forward on optical fibre highway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry yesterday took its ambitions
to build an information superhighway a step forward, with the announcement
of a three-stage plan to lay optical fibre throughout the country, with 100
per cent population coverage by the year 2010.
The ministry's vision, based on a government advisory panel recommendation,
calls for laying optical fibre to connect 20 per cent of the population
within six years, extending that to 60 per cent by 2005, with nationwide
hook-up over the following five years.
The laying of the infrastructure will be entrusted to telecommunications
companies and cable television network operators. The government should
provide support in the form of interest-free loans and tax incentives to
encourage investment in the infrastructure, the report says.
'During the network's preliminary stage, it is important for the government
to play a leading role in triggering future development, particularly with
regard to the development and introduction of public applications,' the
panel's report states.
The ministry plans to put public network applications into practical use by
the year 2000, and intends to ensure budgetary allocation will have high
priority.
A pilot project to test applications of multimedia services such as video on
demand, via fibre to the home, will begin in the Kansai area around Osaka in
July. The ministry estimates the cost of laying optical fibre cable to homes
could total Y33 trillion (Pounds 210bn) at the least, but believes the
information superhighway will generate markets worth Y123 trillion and
create about 2.43m jobs.
It is studying the benefits which multimedia services offer a society such
as Japan's: heavily populated, concentrated in urban areas, experiencing
structural industrial changes, and rapidly ageing.

South Korea is making progress in its economic reforms, but more may need to
be done and at a faster pace, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development said in a survey released yesterday.
Meanwhile, the South Korean finance ministry said it would study the
possibility of Seoul applying for OECD membership this December, which could
accelerate the introduction of reform measures. The country had been hoping
to join the organisation in 1996.
The OECD survey generally gave good marks to a comprehensive package of
economic deregulation and financial liberalisation measures proposed last
year that would reduce strong government intervention. But it added several
caveats to its approval, particularly in the area of financial
liberalisation.
'In contrast to false starts in the past, it is important that this
(financial deregulation) programme be implemented in full, and at a pace
which leaves markets in no doubt that the process is irreversible.
'The reform plan is open to considerable interpretation, but it appears that
even if the plan is fully implemented by 1997, the Korean financial system
will still have a higher degree of official control than is found in most
OECD countries. Further steps would therefore be needed to complete the
process of deregulation.'
It suggested, for example, that controls on capital inflows should be
further loosened despite Korean fears that it could lead to inflationary
pressure due to an increase in the money supply. Other recommendations
included accelerating interest rate deregulation and allowing financial
institutions more freedom to introduce new products.
The Korean government has traditionally used its tight control over the
financial system to guide industrial policy.
The OECD was critical that 'some elements of the old credit allocation will
remain at the end of the liberalisation period'. These include a requirement
that banks must extend 45 per cent of their loans to small companies to
promote their growth, while restricting loans to the 30 largest
conglomerates, or chaebol. The OECD suggested the government's efforts to
curb the economic power of the chaebol through credit restrictions were
misguided.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Nigeria tightens direct controls on foreign exchange: Rift
widens with international creditors ahead of scheduled visit by team from
IMF

Nigeria's military regime has increased direct control over scarce foreign
exchange and export finance despite opposition from Mr Kalu I. Kalu, finance
minister, and Mr Paul Ogwuma, central bank governor.
Increased state regulation of the economy has also widened the rift between
Nigeria and its international creditors ahead of a scheduled visit this
month by an International Monetary Fund team.
This week, ministers are allocating Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) out of a
fortnightly average supply of Dollars 100m, to companies for priority
imports, mainly food. They say this is to prevent shortages in the shops
later this year and correct distorted demand.
A committee chaired by Mr Samuel Ogbemudia, labour minister, including Mr
Iyorchia Ayu, education minister, and Mr Aremu Yahaya, junior transport
minister, is expected to allocate most of the foreign currency for food
importers to undisclosed companies.
'Something has to give soon,' said Mr Kalu in an interview in the capital
Abuja. 'At the end of June I plan to hold a mid-year review of the economy.
I want to review foreign exchange restrictions, the cap on interest rates
and other controls, and look at ways to reduce bureaucracy and create
incentives for producers.
'We need to create the minimum framework for resuming talks with the
international creditors.'
Other critics regard the direct allocation as creeping towards the import
licence system, notorious for its corruption in the 1980s. 'In our
experience, this does not solve the problem,' Mr Rasheed Gbadomosi, Nigerian
Industrial Development Bank chairman, said yesterday. 'It can lead to
accusations of abuse of power and is straying from the fundamental problem:
the low supply of foreign exchange. While non-oil exports are depressed,
they will just be rationing the misery.'
Mr Kalu and Mr Ogwuma have failed to block transfer of control over the
Nigerian Export-Import Bank (Neximbank) from the central bank to the
ministry of commerce and tourism and the appointment of Mr Tony Adaba as its
new managing director. Both decisions were authorised by the presidency.
'This is a financial institution, not a trade promotion council. It should
be under the central bank,' Mr Kalu said.
The cocoa industry is concerned about the security of Dollars 10m which
industry operators say is owed to farmers. The sum is left over from a levy
by the International Cocoa Organisation which had not been remitted by the
government when the levy ceased in 1990.

The United Nations sent investigators yesterday to a camp in government-held
territory in Rwanda where aid workers said 500 people were massacred, Reuter
reports from Kigali.
Rebels and government troops resumed fighting despite talk of a truce and UN
officials and witnesses reported that an officer serving with the UN force
was killed by a mortar blast just inside the government-held part of the
capital, Kigali.
The reported massacre was the latest indication that mass killings were
continuing in the central African nation, where half a million people are
estimated to have died in seven weeks.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Japanese recession bottoming out: Decline has stopped but
months of conflicting economic signals are predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Further evidence that the Japanese recession has hit bottom emerged
yesterday, with a slight easing in unemployment and an official forecast of
an improvement in business conditions.
Yet economic analysts warned that there were no signs yet of a clear
recovery and that several months of conflicting economic signals could be
expected as the economy bumps along the bottom.
The state Economic Planning Agency's leading index of business conditions
hit 90.09 in March, rising from 54.2 in February, the third month at which
it has stayed above the 50 dividing line between growth and contraction.
The index, designed as a barometer of business conditions up to six months
ahead, has proved erratic in the past. Yet it was unusually consistent in
March in that all but one of the index's 13 components improved, except for
commercial property, where the market continues to weaken.
'It confirms that the decline has stopped, but it does not mean that the
economy is going up. Capacity is still increasing faster than demand,'
warned Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute.
Mr Brian Rose, senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research, said: 'We
hit the bottom in the fourth quarter of last year. Nothing since then has
changed that view. The recovery is weak, so we won't yet see a series of
figures clearly pointing upwards.'
The EPA itself was even more cautious and warned that it was too early to
say whether the worst was over.
Japan's jobless rate fell to 2.8 per cent in April, from 2.9 per cent in the
previous month, the Management and Co-ordination Agency announced yesterday.
But again the improvement is fragile, in the light of the labour market's
continued weakness. There were only 66 jobs available for every 100
applicants last month, the same as in March and only a small improvement
from the low of 65 last December.
Manufacturing industry is the hardest hit, where the workforce declined by
1.1 per cent from April 1993, for the sixth month running. Within this,
there was one bright sector, construction, where the numbers employed rose
by 3.2 per cent in April, propelled by a recovery in housing starts, up 11.6
per cent in the same month, according to the Construction Ministry
yesterday. Housing starts dipped by 0.7 per cent in March.
Overall, 65 per cent of Japanese companies reduced overtime last year
because of the recession, according to a survey by the Leisure Development
Centre, a state research body.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Supreme Court clears way for human rights conference
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Filipinos link arms to escort foreign delegates to attend a human rights
conference on East Timor in Manila yesterday. The Philippine Supreme Court
yesterday cleared the way for the conference to open on schedule. It
overturned a decision by a lower court that in effect banned the conference.
Indonesia, accused by human rights groups of widespread killings, torture
and detentions since it annexed East Timor in 1976, has bitterly opposed the
privately organised conference. Bending to this pressure, President Fidel
Ramos's government banned foreigners from attending and expelled 11 of them,
but about 25 delegates managed to slip through.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Pragmatism and opportunism, but no programme yet: Australian
opposition leader Alexander Downer, one week on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only hours after Mr Alexander Downer took over as leader of Australia's
opposition Liberal party, a public opinion poll had him nine points ahead of
Labor's incumbent, Mr Paul Keating, as the electorate's preferred prime
minister.
Nearly 60 per cent of voters polled also thought an opposition led by Mr
Downer had a better chance of beating Mr Keating's Labor government than one
led by Mr John Hewson, Mr Downer's ousted predecessor. 'Not so much a
honeymoon - more of a love-in,' remarked one commentator.
Sustaining this boost to the opposition's fortunes and capturing it in an
appealing manifesto will prove more difficult.
For, while media attention has been concentrated on the Liberals' leadership
crisis and the recent personality jockeying, the party has faced a policy
void ever since it lost the last election, in March 1993.
Going into that vote, the opposition's position was clear enough. Mr Hewson,
a career economist before his switch into federal politics, had spelt out a
free-market economic reform package which was far more extensive than
anything Labor proposed.
According to a party policy document called Fightback] a Hewson government
would have moved swiftly to deregulate Australia's labour markets, largely
eradicating compulsory arbitration and occupational awards; switched the
taxation emphasis from direct to indirect via the introduction of a goods
and services tax (GST); and, in all likelihood, passed control of monetary
policy to an independent central bank.
But the prescription apparently proved too strong for an Australian
electorate, squeezed by recession and fearful of the GST. Largely as a
result of this, the opposition lost a supposedly 'unlosable' election.
Today, the question is what sort of policies Mr Downer can articulate
without running into the more moderately paced reforms pursued by Labor.
In his first week, the new opposition leader has given few direct hints  -
except to suggest that rigid ideology will be low on the agenda. Immediately
after the leadership ballot, he refused to be drawn on specific policy
issues, saying only that a 'directional document' would be issued in the
next few months. Even that would centre on broad guidelines, rather than
detailed strategies.
'(This) is not an ideological party, or a frightening party. . . it is a
practical, commonsense party and we will address issues in a practical,
commonsense way,' he said.
Commentators also struggled to read much into the revamped shadow cabinet,
announced on Thursday. There was an inevitable preference for either Mr
Downer's supporters or those of Mr Peter Costello, who joined Mr Downer on
the 'youth ticket' and becomes shadow treasurer. But Mr Hewson stays on, as
industry spokesman.
Overall, the team is thought to be 'drier' than that of Mr Hewson, but Mr
Downer himself has indicated that it was picked primarily with a view to
giving Labor a rough political ride, rather than because of its ideological
affiliations. Shadow ministers, he said, would have to be 'strong in terms
of their attack on the Labor party, in exposing the weaknesses of the Labor
government'.
As for Mr Downer himself, he comes into the Liberal leadership position with
little ideological baggage. His most recent job was shadow treasurer,
articulating the opposition's economic policy, and he is widely thought to
have handled the task well.
But for much of the time, the Downer programme was to acknowledge
Australia's increasingly cheerful economic numbers, and then poke holes in
Labor's response to them. This approach had the merit of making Mr Downer
appear fair-minded, while throwing the spotlight on the weaker points - such
as lagging business investment - in the Keating strategy. However, for the
most part, it was an effective piecemeal attack, rather than a comprehensive
statement of alternative policy.
That said, some economic cornerstones were established, and will probably
form the basis for policy development in the months ahead. Mr Downer has,
for example, consistently suggested that the financial leeway afforded to
the government from Australia's faster-than-expected economic recovery
should be used to reduce the budget deficit. Failure to do so, he has
warned, will intensify the upward pressure on interest rates, and discourage
the corporate sector.
He has also highlighted Australia's low household saving ratio as a critical
area of concern. Lack of domestic savings, he has warned, is likely to
exacerbate balance of payments problems, and fuel a 'boom-and-bust' economy.
Other key policy elements are likely to include measures to encourage
investment by small businesses, and a few of the former Fightback] features
 -such as faster micro-economic reform in areas like the labour market,
where the government's new industrial relations law is coming under heavy
attack from employer groups, and greater independence for the Reserve Bank.
But there are also indications that the opposition's future policy emphasis
will be wider ranging, putting additional weight on social issues, not just
economic ones. On one level, a change of tack is almost certainly wise: the
economy has been recovering strongly.
But on the broader plane, there are some large lacunae in Liberal party
policy. For example, its handling of the high-profile and emotionally
charged 'Mabo' issues - the land rights and compensation entitlements of
Australia's indigenous peoples - has been disastrous, with the party
appearing both callous and inconsistent.
The Labor government can also fairly claim to have taken a formidable
initiative on Australia's chronic unemployment problem, with a recently
announced ADollars 6.5bn (Pounds 3.1bn) jobs programme.
Last week, Mr Downer quickly took a tough line on immigration while
unemployment remains high. This appears to be of growing concern to voters,
although the proposed modest increase in this year's migrant intake will
largely be filled by Chinese in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen
Square massacre.
The new opposition leader also trod a shrewd line on the republic debate,
suggesting that constitutional change was more likely under a Liberal
government, while also saying he felt that such a change was too complex.
One week on, then, pragmatism and opportunism seem to be the order of the
day for the new opposition leader. But whether they eventually add up to a
coherent package which the electorate will buy, remains to be proved.

FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: Bavaria's bogeymen in retreat - The
far-right's main hope lies in a low turnout on polling day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the side of a shabby truck parked under the medieval clock on the town
hall in Munich's Marienplatz a poster was tacked up with a picture of a
miserable looking cow in the German national colours.
Sucking away at its udders were 11 other member states of the European
Union, and the slogan simply said: Stop It]
As the tape-recorded strains of a brass band faded away from the speakers,
Mr Wolfgang Huttl, Bavarian chairman of the far-right Republicans and
candidate for the European parliament, warmed to his theme.
'We have had a belly-full of paying for Europe and the rest of the world,'
he shouts.
He has to shout, because his speech is being drowned out by a barrage of
whistles and cat-calls from an audience dominated by political opponents
from the left and the far-left, and a handful of bemused-looking tourists.
The only supporters seem to be a few caricatures of heavy bodyguards
surrounding the truck, and a handful of elderly sympathisers at the front.
Munich is home base for the Republicans and their leader, Mr Franz
Schonhuber, and Bavaria is the state where the far-right bogeymen of German
politics shocked the political establishment by winning almost 15 per cent
of the vote in the last European elections.
Five years later, and they seem to be having a lot more trouble getting
their message across.
The rhetoric is anti-European integration and solidly nationalist. Yet the
party really has no proper European election programme, apart from
opposition to the Maastricht treaty and Germany's hefty net contributions to
the EU budget. Between the lines, the real theme is anti-foreigner and
anti-immigration.
Mr Schonhuber's hopes of exploiting the issue as successfully again have
been hit by two factors: all the main political parties have successfully
negotiated a constitutional compromise, which has radically reduced the
number of asylum-seekers flooding into the country; and at the same time his
party has been tarred with the brush of violent attacks on foreigners.
'The overall number of foreigners is too great, that is the impression of
the people,' says Mr Hermann Regensburger, state secretary in the Bavarian
interior ministry. 'There are pressures on the housing market and in the
labour market. There are sometimes more than 50 per cent foreign children in
individual schools.'
Since the asylum compromise came into effect last July, however, the monthly
numbers of asylum seekers have dropped by more than 60 per cent. Now there
is no automatic right to asylum in Germany if the applicant has come from a
country classified as having no political persecution, or if he or she has
passed through a third country on the way.
'The Republicans are fighting their campaign primarily on the theme of
foreigners, mixed with the theme of law and order,' says Mr Regensburger.
'When the call comes: 'Foreigners out]' they always get big applause. But
the people have realised now that the big parties are capable of acting. The
situation has got considerably better, both in reality, and in the mood.'
Ms Renate Schmidt, the leader of the Social Democratic party (SPD) in
Bavaria, is not inclined to underestimate the threat yet. 'There is a lot of
support for the Reps amongst people who are discontented,' she says. 'Many
are on social assistance, unemployed or homeless. The discontented used to
drift left, and now they are drifting right. It is the same as in Britain
and France.' She agrees, however, that the 'sting has been taken out of the
asylum issue' thanks to the drop in numbers. The real danger in the European
poll is simply persuading voters to turn out.
'I think we will have difficulty getting people to the polls at all,' she
says. 'I think we will be pleased if we get 60 per cent turnout in Munich.'
The turnout will also be a key issue for the ruling Christian Social Union
(CSU) in Bavaria - because the party needs a high vote in its home base to
cross the 5 per cent hurdle needed nationally for winning seats in the
European parliament.
The party has been forced to adopt a harsh line on immigration and a
Euro-sceptical line on Maastricht to head off the challenge from Mr
Schonhuber and other assorted protest movements. But at the end of the day,
the turnover will count.
Mr Ingo Friedrich, the party's lead Euro-candidate, says they will have to
win 40 per cent to get in, and higher still if the Bavarian turnout is down.
In spite of his party's Euro-scepticism, he argues that immigration and
organised crime can only be tackled on a European level - through
cross-border co-operation.
'The argument against Schonhuber is that we need a European police,' he
says. 'That is very popular.'
'We argue that the Republicans don't belong to the ranks of respectable
parties. We can also point to their voting record in the European
parliament.
'They are lazy and have done nothing. The German voters don't like to see
that.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: EU vision with more realism than romance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abel Matutes, 52, the outgoing European commissioner for energy and
transport, now heads the list of European parliament candidates for Spain's
Popular party, the conservative opposition, which is tipped in the polls for
first place.
Q: Who would swap a post in the European Commission for a seat in the
European parliament?
A: Someone who is convinced that at this moment my job is to lead the
European list because of the great political significance of these
elections.
Q: What will the big themes of this campaign be?
A: We have to make European integration compatible with a more realistic and
firm defence of legitimate national interests. We have to get away from a
simple romantic vision of Europe, because Europe will only be built solidly
on the basis of realities. And if in the end the sums do not work out for
the Spanish in this integrated Europe, the very process of European
integration will be at risk because Spaniards will lose sympathy and reject
it. This firmer defence of national interests has two dimensions. One is a
more effective presence in European institutions in Brussels, but there is
also an internal dimension - better European policy implies a good economic
policy in Spain. Competition in the single market is not only between
companies - a Spanish company against a German or a French company - but
also between the economic policies of all the member states.
Q: Do you think European issues will really be aired in this election? The
campaign seems to be wholly focused on internal politics.
A: I try to air them. But I have to admit internal politics are the only
theme that ultimately interests people.
Q: Do you believe the European parliament should have more powers than it
does now?
A: The parliament had its powers considerably reinforced in the Maastricht
treaty. It is now not just a budget chamber, but also a legislative chamber.
Obviously, its sovereignty is shared with the council of member states,
which also represents democratic governments. That is just where the
difficulty lies. First of all, the parliament should concern itself with
those questions in which it has competence, to demonstrate not only that it
deserves these powers but also that it needs more. I would like to have
parliament to have more powers, but let's try first with what we have, which
is a new instrument.
Q: Most of the candidates on the lists are unknown figures, and are likely
to remain so even after they are elected. Do you agree with the list system?
A: I have always preferred a system of individual constituencies because it
makes members of parliament work harder for their seats. But in Spain we
have a proportional system. Here the question is whether there should be a
single national constituency or smaller ones. I think the electoral district
should be the whole country rather than regions, because this provides a
national dimension. Q: How do you see the impact of EU enlargement on Spain?
A: I am worried about it, because I am afraid the government, during the
recent boom, failed to take adjustment measures and to make our economy more
competitive.

FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: Voters divided on EU's important issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europeans generally favour enlarging the EU northwards and eastwards, but
are deeply split over the desirability of deepening integration as laid down
by the Maastricht treaty, according to an opinion poll commissioned by the
Financial Times.
The poll, carried out for the FT and seven European newspapers, reveals
great diversity among the 12 EU member states on attitudes towards the
European parliament and the future of European co-operation.
The detailed findings are as follows:
Only 31 per cent of British people surveyed said they wanted a more
integrated Europe, compared with 61 per cent favouring a looser form of
European co-operation. Similar votes were seen in east Germany, Denmark and
west Germany, where scores were 33 per cent to 62 cent, 26 per cent to 61
per cent and 37 per cent to 58 per cent against Maastricht-style integration
respectively. By contrast, between 64 and 72 per cent of respondents in
Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Belgium favoured more integration.
Residents of Ireland and the UK appear to believe most strongly that a
single currency in at least three EU states will be established by the end
of the century, with 63 per cent and 64 per cent respectively saying they
believed this was either 'very likely' or 'fairly likely'. Greatest
scepticism in this field came from the 'hard currency' countries, with 61
per cent of east and west Germans and 52 per cent of Dutch respondents
holding the view that this was unlikely.
Asked about responses to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, 38 per cent of
respondents throughout the EU, spread fairly evenly among the 12, argued in
favour of continued diplomatic efforts to end the fighting. Only 16 per cent
and 17 per cent respectively called for combat troops or air strikes to
bring peace.
Regarding the European elections, 72 per cent of all respondents said they
were 'absolutely certain' to vote, while 7 per cent described their turnout
as 'very likely', 8 per cent as 'fairly likely' and 6 per cent as 'not very
likely'.
Only 49 per cent of British said they were 'absolutely certain' to vote,
compared with 93 per cent in Greece, 89 per cent in Belgium and 83 per cent
in Luxembourg (in all three countries, voting is compulsory). By contrast,
76 per cent of respondents in west Germany and 67 per cent of those in east
Germany said they were certain to vote.
Of those 'absolutely certain' to vote, 56 per cent of the Irish, 55 per cent
of Portuguese and 53 per cent of east Germans said they would do so to
support their countries' governments. Only 35 per cent of Britons and Danes
and 15 per cent of Belgians gave this as a reason.
A protest vote seems particularly likely in the UK and Spain, where 25 per
cent and 23 per cent of respondents respectively said they would vote to
voice opposition to their governments.
Denmark recorded the highest score - 35 per cent - of respondents saying
they were not certain to vote because they 'do not understand the (European)
issues'. Others who admitted failure to understand European affairs were the
British (32 per cent) and Italians (29 per cent).
On enlargement, the proposed extension of the EU on January 1 1995 to
Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria is given particular support by west
Germans (87 per cent), east Germans (88 per cent), and Italians (86 per
cent). Even those most lukewarm on enlargement to the Efta countries - the
Spanish and Portuguese - are 70 per cent and 72 per cent in favour.
There is more divergence over enlarging the EU to former Communist
countries. The largest scores in favour of bringing in the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia came from Italy (69 per cent), east Germany (60
per cent), Belgium, The Netherlands and Spain (56 per cent each). The lowest
scores were seen in west Germany and Portugal (47 per cent), Luxembourg and
Britain (45 per cent) and Denmark (33 per cent).
British and Danish respondents stood out as thinking the European parliament
has too much power, with 38 per cent and 37 per cent of respondents
respectively holding this view. By contrast, 60 per cent of east Germans, 55
per cent of west Germans and Italians, and 54 per cent of Greek and French
respondents said parliament has too little power - a view held by 46 per
cent of respondents throughout the EU.
Britons and Danes also believe the European Commission is too powerful, with
58 per cent and 51 per cent of respondents taking this line.
The main defenders of the European Commission seem to be the east Germans,
Spanish, Italians and Belgians - between 40 per cent and 43 per cent of
these respondents say the Commission has too little power.

FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: A case of mind over doesn't matter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
To stand, or not to stand? The question is taxing and dividing a group of
French intellectuals who had pledged to run in the European parliamentary
elections on a ticket which supports Bosnian Moslems.
Professor Leon Schwartzenberg, a cancer specialist and the head of the
'Europe begins in Sarajevo' list told RTL radio yesterday that he would
press ahead with plans to contest the June 12 vote. His statement followed
an announcement on Monday by members of the movement that they would not
contest the elections, having already publicised their call to lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia.
'We do not have the right to play with institutions,' said Prof
Schwartzenberg, referring to the fact that election lists cannot be
withdrawn once they have been registered with the Interior Ministry. But he
admitted that it was unlikely that there would be ballots for the movement
at all polling stations. His comments will cause concern for the Socialist
party, which appears most at risk from the Sarajevo candidates' 12 per cent
in recent polls.
The U-turns of the past few days, however, reveal the divisions among
France's intellectuals. Prof Schwartzenberg is at odds with several other
members of the movement, including Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, a left-bank Paris
philosopher turned film-maker, who has been the driving force behind 'Europe
begins in Sarajevo'.
His film, Bosna], which was released at the Cannes film festival earlier
this month and which dramatises suffering of residents of Sarajevo, prepared
the way for the launch of the movement. But Mr Levy and his supporters voted
in favour of a withdrawal of the Sarajevo slate at the European elections,
arguing that the plight of Bosnia had been raised and that it would continue
to campaign for an end to the arms embargo by other means.
Mr Schwartzenberg, however, sees it differently. True intellectuals, he
said, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus would not have withdrawn at
the last minute. He criticised his opponents within the movement for seeking
'personal publicity' and said that they had never intended to go as far as
the elections.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Danes question subsidies for E German shipyard

<TEXT>
Denmark is to take up with the European Commission complaints by the
Association of Danish Shipbuilders over the level of subsidies to the MTW
shipyard at Wismar in eastern Germany. The Danes fear that subsidies to MTW
(now owned by Bremer Vulkan of west Germany) and other yards in former East
Germany will put their own yards out of business.
Under the terms of a 1992 European Council agreement MTW was allowed to
receive DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) from the EU - DM1bn in investment subsidies
and DM600m as an operating subsidy covering the three years 1994-1996. The
final tranche of the latter was paid last month. A condition of the
operating subsidy was that it should comprise a maximum of 36 per cent of
'normal turnover' for the period. Danish shipbuilders claim that the
turnover will in fact be much lower than envisaged at the time of the
agreement, elevating the subsidy as a share of turnover to a much higher
level.
The Danes point out that other European shipyards are not allowed receive a
subsidy of more than 9 per cent, and that a serious effort is under way by
member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
to agree on abolishing shipbuilding subsidies altogether. They believe the
Wismar yard is too big to be able to operate profitably.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Marcel Bich: a purveyor of the disposable leaves indelible
mark - The death of the creator of the Bic line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are a handful of businessmen and women in France whose personalities
are so powerful that they are deemed by the media to have earned the epithet
of le grand patron. Baron Marcel Bich was one.
Baron Bich, who died on Monday at the age of 79, was one of the dynamic
industrialists who breathed new life into the French economy during the
post-war years. He not only created a world-class company in Bic, but his
disposable pens, lighters and razors changed the everyday lives of ordinary
people by introducing them to a new generation of inexpensive, practical
products.
Despite his aristocratic title, the story of Baron Bich is an archetypal
entrepreneurial tale. He was born in Turin, the son of an Italian engineer
who emigrated to France with his family. The young Marcel took French
citizenship as a teenager. He then earned his living as a door-to-door
salesman before studying law at Paris university.
Baron Bich worked in Britain in the 1930s, as production director of
Stephens &amp; Swan, the stationery manufacturer. But he returned to Paris,
where he began his own business after the war. He started off with a small
ink factory but in 1953 he scored the coup of his career by buying the
patent rights to a ballpoint pen designed by Ladislao Biro, a Hungarian.
The biro's launch brought out the best of Baron Bich as a marketer. His
handy 50-centime version of the old-fashioned fountain pen was the perfect
product for the never-had-it-so-good consumers of the 1950s, 1960s and
1970s. Roland Barthes, the French intellectual, wrote an essay hailing it as
an icon of contemporary consumption. The Bic biro also made the baron one of
the few industrialists whose name has slipped into the vernacular.
The Bic group diversified into disposable lighters in 1973 and razors in
1976. The baron then dabbled in acquisitions by buying DIM, the hosiery
manufacturer, and Rosy, the lingerie company. But he was far from
infallible. His foray into the fragrance market in 1988, with the
introduction of Bic perfume, was a flop.
Despite the demands of his business, Baron Bich always conformed to the
cliche of the grand patron by being a larger-than-life character who lived
his life to the full. He had 11 children one of whom, Bruno, succeeded him
as chairman of Bic when he reluctantly gave up the reins three years ago.
The baron also loved sailing and raced his yacht, the France, four times in
the America's Cup. His press pictures invariably portray him beaming from
the helm clad in a spruce linen suit and snowy white cap. It was the closest
the media got to him. Baron Bich gave his last press interview in 1969. He
did not like what the journalist wrote and saw no need to bother being
interviewed again.

Mr Horst Seehofer, German health minister, gives evidence to a parliamentary
committee today about mounting charges that heart surgeons have been
falsifying the cost of operations, part of an alleged network of abuse which
may total up to DM45m (Pounds 18m). The federation of health insurance funds
said some doctors had been pocketing up to DM3,000 per cardiac valve they
fit. Another insurance association said it had evidence that prices for
artificial joints and other products had also been inflated. Mr Seehofer
said a senior official had been discussing the claims since February. Public
prosecutors and local health insurance funds had meanwhile taken over the
investigations.

<TEXT>
Latvia's government coalition partners appear to have been trounced in
Sunday's local elections in preliminary results which suggest a mixture of
discontent with economic reforms and wariness about attempts to mend
relations with Russia. The pro-monetarist Latvian Way and the Latvian
Peasants Union coalition government, which wants better protection for
farmers from western competition, have together maintained a course of
effective but unpopular financial stabilisation policies. The government,
which has also been hit by accusations that five cabinet ministers used to
work for the Soviet KGB before the republic gained independence, last month
concluded an agreement with Russia to withdraw troops from Latvia by August
31. The poll results, which partially benefit more extreme nationalists, may
also affect the government's progress in pushing through long-postponed
legislation clarifying which non-Latvians (who comprise 48 per cent of the
population) qualify for citizenship.

<TEXT>
Poland's finance ministry has dropped plans to break up PZU, the country's
largest insurer. It will privatise the state-owned company as a whole, in
line with management suggestions. Mr Roman Fulneczek, PZU president, argues
that the company should be kept together to better face the challenge of the
liberalisation of the country's insurance market in 1999. PZU which reported
a 325bn zloty (Pounds 9.6m) net profit last year controls about half
Poland's fledgling insurance market. The decision includes devoting around
800bn zlotys worth of profits earned by PZU Zycie, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, to plug a 1,600bn zloty gap in PZU's reserves. This would avoid
the need to draw on a Dollars 200m loan offered by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to underpin a government bond issue designed
to bolster PZU's finances. The ministry also appears to have accepted PZU
management's three-year privatisation strategy.

<TEXT>
Greece's central bank governor, Mr Yannis Boutos, warned yesterday that
commercial banks could not expect any assistance in covering losses incurred
in the current upheaval on local financial markets. His warning came as
competition for funds between banks and the finance ministry intensified.
With liquidity still being squeezed, banks were offering much higher
interest rates for short-term deposits yesterday. Private Greek banks were
offering rates of 35-50 per cent on one-month deposits of more than Dr1m
(Pounds 2,700). This compared with 27 per cent on the government's new
zero-coupon one-month bond available to investors with more than Dr15m. Mr
Boutos claimed the battle to save the drachma from devaluation had been won
and that short-term interest rates, still at more than 100 per cent on the
interbank market, 'would de-escalate over the next one or two weeks'. The
drachma slipped against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at Dr148.1, down from
Dr147.9 on Monday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union agriculture ministers yesterday agreed tighter controls
against 'mad cow' disease (BSE) in an effort to divert German threats to ban
imports of British beef. The ministers, meeting in Brussels, backed a
package of measures from Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner,
including extending to all member states a ban on the use of meat and bone
meal in cattle feed. A ban has been in place in Britain since 1988. 'It
should be sufficient to dispel any fears the German farm minister (Mr Jochen
Borchert) might have had,' said Mr Steichen. The measures proposed by Mr
Steichen include raising temperatures in the meat rendering process,
restricting the use of meat by-products in cosmetics and ensuring checks in
all member states to detect BSE.
However, pressure for a unilateral ban on British beef imports has come from
Mr Horst Seehofer, German health minister. Bonn argues that it is not
certain that humans are not at risk from BSE. Mr Seehofer will discuss the
issue further with his EU counterparts at a health ministers' meeting
tomorrow.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: More unemployed in France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French unemployment rose to a new record in April, increasing by 4,900 to
3,325,800 or 12.3 per cent of the labour force, according to labour ministry
statistics announced yesterday. However, the rising trend in unemployment
has slowed markedly from last year, raising hopes for a stabilisation in
joblessness. In the first four months of this year, unemployment increased
by 23,500, compared with a rise of about four times that amount in the same
period in 1993. Yesterday's announcement coincided with more optimistic
official economic growth forecasts. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister,
told Le Figaro newspaper that gross domestic product this year was likely to
exceed the government's 1.4 per cent forecast. Growth could reach the 1.6
per cent level forecast by the European Commission. John Ridding, Paris
Industrial sales in the Netherlands rose 3.5 per cent in March from a year
earlier and were up 1.3 per cent in the first quarter on a year-to-year
basis, the government reported yesterday.
Italy's foreign debt has fallen to L150,000bn (Pounds 63bn( from L175,000bn
at the end of 1992, and a further reduction can be expected in 1994,
according to Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio. Denmark's current account
surplus slipped in February to DKr2.3bn (Pounds 237m) from DKr3.3bn the
month before, but was unchanged from a year earlier, according to figures
from the national statistics agency.

   MULHOUSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and France yesterday promised tight co-ordination of their
successive European Union presidencies over the next year, at a summit
replete with gestures of friendship that appeared to clear the air of recent
tensions.
For the first time since 1944, German soldiers will march down the Champs
Elysees on July 14 as a result of President Francois Mitterrand's
announcement yesterday that he was inviting the multinational Eurocorps to
take part in France's Bastille Day military parade.
Inevitably absent from next week's D-Day commemoration in Normandy,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday expressed his 'warm' welcome for this 'very
generous' gesture, and is expected to attend the July 14 parade, along with
leaders of Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain which also contribute to the
Eurocorps. Mr Kohl for his part presented the French president with one of
28 valuable paintings taken at the end of the war to Germany, which is now
returning them.
Mr Mitterrand said he hoped the next year, in which Germany which will take
the chair of the EU Council of Ministers on July 1 and then hand it on
January 1 next year to France, would give the impression of 'a continuous,
if not a common, Franco-German presidency'. Its main themes are expected to
be fostering more jobs at home and more stability to the east.
France now seems satisfied that Germany will not try to rush east European
countries into an unadapted Union, in the way that earlier this spring Paris
criticised Bonn for ramming through entry by Nordic countries and Austria.
Mr Kohl endorsed Mr Mitterrand's call for the EU to reinforce its
institutions as it took in new members, and the German leader rejected any
attempt to turn the Union into 'just a big free trade zone, as once proposed
by one of our number', a reference to Lady Thatcher, the former UK premier.
Germany and France will place 'development of the (Union's) common foreign
and security policy. . . . at the centre of their co-operation' in running
their presidencies, according to a communique yesterday. A key part of this
common policy will be closer security links with east European countries,
and partnership with Russia. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister,
confirmed that France was no longer blocking a new EU accord with Russia,
because Paris had now received assurances of adequate safeguards against
Russian enriched uranium flooding the EU market.
By redoubling their gestures of reconciliation, and by keeping all advisers
out of most of their private talks, President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl
gave the impression of wanting to make the most of one of their last
official meetings; the former is not up for re-election next year, and the
latter's re-election in October is by no means sure.
But some of the unusual privacy was also to discuss the succession to Mr
Jacques Delors as European Commisison president. Quizzed about their choice,
the French president would only say that 'I think we (France and Germany)
will be in agreement to support the same person after we have consulted our
10 partners'. However, officials say privately their leaders prefer Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
This morning, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Groupe
Schneider will be led from Brussels' notoriously unpleasant Foret prison for
a hearing in a fraud case before Belgium's prosecuting authorities. At
roughly the same time, on the other side of town, minority shareholders of
Schneider subsidiary Cofimines will have another chance to voice their
grievances against the beleaguered French chairman at their annual general
meeting.
It is thanks to the aggressive tactics of the two Belgian subsidiaries -
Cofimines and Cofibel - that the investigation into the French electrical
engineering group was triggered.
Their initial complaints centred on claims that Schneider's 1992 bid to buy
them out had undervalued their shares. At the end of last year some of the
shareholders reached an agreement with Schneider, after which they agreed to
withdraw legal proceedings.
At least one refused. Yesterday Mr Andre de Barsy, a prominent Belgian
property owner and shareholder in both Cofimines and Cofibel, said he had
independently collected thick files of information that incriminated Mr
Pineau-Valencienne. He denied suggestions in the French press that it was he
who had prompted the Belgian authorities to continue their investigations.
Yesterday Groupe Schneider denied it had harmed the interests of minority
shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel. The French group said it had invested
BFr2.2bn (Pounds 43m) in Cofibel and Cofimines since 1989 and that the two
companies had seen their net assets per share rise markedly.
Schneider said the offer, launched in 1992, to buy out minority shareholders
in the two companies was equivalent to 4.25 times the share price of Cofibel
in 1981 and 4.6 times the share price of Cofimines at the same date. During
the same period the Brussels bourse rose in value by 4.59 times. 'These
facts show that the relations between Schneider and its Belgian financial
subsidiaries were not developed for sole benefit of the majority
shareholder,' the company said.
The affair continued to provoke indignation, and a certain amount of
smugness in the Belgian press. Long used to being dismissed by the French as
les petits Belges they enjoy jabbing their arrogant neighbour. L'Echo, a
Francophone financial daily, said Belgium's 'audacity' in daring to imprison
a member of the French establishment had prompted indignant, acid and
occasionally insulting comments about the Belgians in the French press. All
the Belgian newspapers have meanwhile vigorously defended the reputation of
Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen , the Belgian prosecuting judge.

FT  01 JUN 94 / EU verdict on chemical venture expected

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is expected to decide today whether to allow
Montedison and Royal Dutch/Shell to create a joint chemicals venture,
Montell, in polyethylene and polypropylene.
An advisory committee to the Commission had recommended a veto of the
Dollars 6.6bn venture last week and Montedison's share price fell almost 9
per cent last Friday on fears that the deal would be abandoned. The shares
have since recovered as the companies pointed out they could change details
of the proposed deal.
A public announcement is expected from the Commission next week, ahead of a
June 15 deadline. Yesterday, senior managers from both prospective joint
venture partners were in Brussels to present final arguments to the
Commission. The Commission will discuss these arguments with its special
committtee today.
The deal is important to both Montedison, industrial arm of the collapsed
Ferruzzi empire, and Anglo-Dutch petrochemicals group Royal Dutch/Shell. In
an industry suffering from over capacity in eastern Europe, they are facing
cut-price competition from eastern Europe in polypropylene and the Mid-east
in polyethylene.
The two companies have been careful to stress that their collaboration is
over polypropylene technology, not their combined European Union market
share which they say would be 24 per cent. Advances in technology are one of
the main planks of defence against cut-price commodity imports from eastern
Europe.
In addition, Montedison's plastics subsidiary Himont has developed a
technique for making a type of polyethylene (linear low density polyethylene
or LLDPE) which is an improvement over older methods in some respects. Shell
has the cash resources and the raw material, ethylene, to accelerate
development of Montedison's LLDPE. According to chemicals consultancy Chem
Systems, European demand for LLDPE should almost double by 2000, while that
for older forms could rise by less than 10 per cent.
The application for the venture has been contested by other European
manufacturers, led by US-owned Union Carbide, and Belgium's Petrofina. The
commission opened an inquiry earlier this year, suspecting that even if
limited to a technology joint venture, the combination would prove too
powerful.
Brussels argued that technology developed by the companies - Spheripol by
Montedison and Unipol by Shell and Union Carbide of the US - was used by 70
per cent of the world's polypropylene manufacturers.

'strategic mobility', writes David Buchan. Ministers 'approved the
orientations' for the new bilateral arms agency designed to co-ordinate the
two countries' numerous programmes. But in deference to European partners,
the communique said the Franco-German agency would be open to other members
of the Western European Union and that the ultimate aim was a wider
procurement agency under the WEU. The project for a four-engine transport
with a 25 tonnes capacity has industrial backing from Deutsche Aerospace,
Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and Casa of Spain, but so
far no government backing.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Warning to Berlusconi on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor of the Bank of Italy, yesterday warned the
new Berlusconi government against introducing inflationary policies to
stimulate economic recovery after two years of harsh recession.
Mr Fazio made it clear the bank would raise interest rates if the recovery
encouraged excessive consumer demand and began to ignore the continuing need
to reduce Italy's large public sector deficit.
'A recovery which is too rapid and too heavily weighted towards consumption
would require immediate corrective action,' he said.
'While the central bank will continue to provide support for the present
state of the economy and for employment, it is also alert to any pressure on
costs and prices. The moment the recovery ceases to be non-inflationary,
monetary policy must be aimed at halting price increases by resorting to a
rise in interest rates.'
The warning was the central point the governor's annual economic statement -
regarded as the bank's single most important economic analysis during the
year.
The Berlusconi government is less than three weeks old and has spelled out
few details of its committment to stimulate the current timid recovery. But
Mr Fazio's comments are likely to become the benchmark against which
government policy will be judged.
The bank is clearly concerned that Mr Berlusconi's rhetorical electoral
promise of creating 1m jobs and encouraging business confidence through
fiscal incentives risks being inflationary. Italy's inflation, annualised at
4.1 percent, still remains well above the average despite a sharp drop in
domestic demand and a drop in real earnings over the past two years.
He gave cautious endorsement to the cabinet's decision last Friday to
unfreeze public works blocked by the two-year-old corruption scandals and
moves by the previous Ciampi government to introduce new laws on bidding and
awarding contracts. Public works investments fell last year by 16 per cent,
he said.
Renewed investment could help job creation and the recovery, as well as
raise the standard of Italy's poor infrastructure. But Mr Fazio insisted old
habits of wastage and corruption had to be avoioded.
In the context of public works projects, Mr Fazio backed the Delors White
Paper on job creation through infrastructure projects. By emphasising this
and almost ignoring the issue of moves towards monetary union, this suggests
the bank will continue to adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards developments
over implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.
Mr Fazio was careful to stick to technical advice and thus avoid an early
confrontation with the new government, several of whose members are anxious
to curb the 100-year-old institution's autonomy. On public spending he threw
his weight behind the new government's desire to reduce the excessive
benefits of the state pensions scheme.
He made no mention of a successor to Mr Lamberto Dini, who left from being
the governor's deputy to become treasury minister on May 18. Instead he paid
fullsome tribute to Mr Dini's role especially on the international scene and
looked forward to 'intense collaboration' between the treasury and the Bank
of Italy.
But he also concluded with a reminder of the bank's ultimate role. 'Acting
in the exclusive interests of the country with the aim of contributing to
stable development, the Bank of Italy will be careful to prevent any brusque
movement in the value of the currency,' he said.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Inflation fears depress bonds: Bundesbank cancels auction -
Dealers expect bear phase in markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers across Europe drove government bond prices lower yesterday as the
view took hold that inflationary pressures were on the rise and markets had
entered a bear phase.
Fears that resurgent inflation pressures will bring an end to interest rate
cuts in Europe, and may indeed cause short-term rates to rise, have pushed
bond yields sharply higher.
Those worries were fanned yesterday by the continuing surge in commodity
prices - which unsettled US Treasury bonds - amid reports of heavy buying on
international markets, where hedge funds were said to be particularly
active.
Most of the activity in bonds took place in futures pits rather than in cash
bonds. Technical support levels on several futures contracts were breached,
which further shook confidence and gave traders the impression that prices
would continue to fall.
'It's a very scared market,' one London bond trader said. 'Most bonds offer
great value on a fundamental basis, but after the losses of the recent
months, no one dares to get in, even at these levels.'
Stock markets across Europe ended the day relatively unscathed after a
roller-coaster session. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 4.1 higher at
2,970.5, having been more than 40 points down at one stage. Shares in
Frankfurt, Paris and Milan all finished above their worst.
In the bonds market, Germany led the decline when the June contract of the
German government bond future fell to a new low for the year.
The Bundesbank announced that a widely expected auction of long-dated bonds
would not take place. While the Bundesbank said the move was due to the
government's good cash position, it was taken as a sign that it was not
prepared to risk an issue in a shaky market. It was the second time in a
week that an issue has been delayed.
The June bund futures contract on Liffe, the London futures and options
exchange, reached a low of 92.62, before ending 0.62 points lower at 92.83.
The yield on the German 10-year benchmark bond rose to 6.98 per cent.
UK government bonds fell sharply on data showing M0 money supply rising a
provisional adjusted 7.1 per cent in the year to end May. In addition, talk
that today's UK purchasing managers' survey for May would show a rise in
producer prices put further pressure on prices. The long gilt futures
contract fell by 1 to 100 23/32 . French and Italian government bonds also
fell sharply, tracking Germany lower but further weighed down by supply
pressures. The June futures contract on the French exchange Matif fell by
1.00 point to 117.72.
European traders said they were awaiting the Bundesbank's allocation of
two-week securities repurchase agreements today, where they were hoping for
a confirmation of recent Bundesbank comments that the repo rate has room to
fall further.
In the US, fears of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve
eased slightly after the Commerce Department reported that disposable
personal incomes had fallen by 0.2 per cent in April, while spending on
personal consumption fell by 0.1 per cent.

FT  01 JUN 94 / Rise in UK factory prices 'fuelled by recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff, PHILIP COGGAN, MICHAEL CASSELL and
ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs that the British economic recovery may be fuelling inflationary
pressures emerged yesterday after a business survey warned that
manufacturing bottlenecks had significantly raised factory prices in May.
The UK purchasing managers' survey, released today, said prices were pushed
up for the sixth successive month because factories were unable to meet the
recent surge in demand. Shortages of pulp, paper and steel had created
particular difficulties in the packaging and production industries, it
added.
In another sign of inflationary pressure, the annual growth rate of M0, the
narrow measure of the money supply, rose to a seasonally adjusted 7.1 per
cent in May, the highest figure since April 1990.
M0 has been growing outside the government's monitoring range of 0-4 per
cent for some time. The Bank of England does consider M0 to be a forward
indicator of inflation but it has argued that the annual growth rate has
been distorted by the move to low interest rates, which have reduced the
cost to consumers of holding cash.
But analysts said the figures indicated that the economy was still growing
strongly and therefore the likelihood of a further base rate cut had been
even further reduced.
The strength of this growth was underlined by the purchasing managers'
survey, which showed that factory output, new orders and employment all rose
to the highest levels recorded during the survey's three-year history.
Mr Peter Thomson, director-general of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply, which organised the survey, said: 'May seems to have been the
busiest month for UK manufacturers for a long time.'
This was creating problems for some UK factories, the survey suggested.
Although levels of stocks had remained broadly flat in May, delivery times
had lengthened to record periods because many manufacturers were unable to
meet demand requirement in time.
These findings are slightly at odds with a recent survey from the
Confederation of British Industry, which suggested that most manufacturing
sectors still had spare capacity and inflationary pressures remained low.
Manufacturers last night endorsed the report's picture of rising sales and
lengthening order books and delivery times but insisted severe supply
constraints remain rare.
The Confederation of European Paper Industries said the UK appeared to be at
the forefront of a very strong surge in demand for paper products which
began in the first quarter. Mr Alan Collins, president of the British
Constructional Steelwork Association, said: 'Supply and demand is more in
line which has enabled prices to rise by 8-10 per cent since the beginning
of this year.'
Mr Dennis Webb, chief executive of Beazer Homes, Britain's fourth largest
housebuilder, said: 'We have seen no evidence of material or labour
shortages hitting housebuilders.'

FT  01 JUN 94 / Europeans back enlargement despite doubts on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europeans are doubtful that there will be a single currency by the end of
the century, but favour EU enlargement by a wide margin, according to an FT
opinion poll across all 12 EU members.
The survey underlines how German voters seem to be joining traditionally
Euro-sceptic electorates in Denmark and the UK in their antipathy towards
closer integration along the lines of the Maastricht treaty.
The poll was commissioned by the Financial Times and seven other European
newspapers in advance of the European elections, to be held later this
month. It was carried out last month through telephone interviews among a
sample of 6,439 people by Harris Research.
Only 8 per cent of respondents in western Germany, and 7 per cent of those
in eastern Germany, believed that a single currency was 'very likely' in at
least three EU member countries by the end of the century.
Overall, 47 per cent of Europeans thought a single currency was likely by
2000, with 46 per cent saying it was unlikely.
Revealingly, voters in Britain, who appear least in favour of the Maastricht
treaty, hold the strongest belief that a single currency will be established
by 2000. A total of 64 per cent of British respondents said a single
currency was either 'very likely' or 'fairly likely' by then, compared with
figures below 40 per cent in Germany, Denmark, Spain and Italy.
The survey reveals a deep split on the desirability of fulfilling the
Maastricht plan for European union.
Respondents in the UK, Denmark and east and west Germany said by a roughly 2
to 1 margin that they were against the Maastricht arrangements, supporting a
'looser' Europe.
Firmest support for Maastricht came from Italy, Spain, Belgium and the
Netherlands, all in favour of closer integration by margins of 2 to 1 or
more.
On enlargement, 79 per cent of the EU electorate favoured the planned
extension of the EU to Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria on January 1,
with 9 per cent voicing opposition. Fifty per cent, with 30 per cent
against, backed membership by former communist countries, with support
greatest in Italy and east Germany.
The poll indicates how years of powerfully voiced British doubts about
European integration may have cost the UK influence. A large proportion of
Europeans - 27 per cent of the French, 21 per cent of west Germans, 20 per
cent of the Spanish and 19 per cent of Belgians - label Britain as the EU
country they least trust.
Britons also show considerable suspicion of other important EU partners,
with 44 per cent and 24 per cent of Britons describing respectively France
and Germany as the nations they least trust.

FT  01 JUN 94 / PM signals readiness to opt out of EU integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night signalled that his government would be ready to opt
out of the next stage of European integration as he sketched out a
'multi-track, multi-speed' future for the European Union.
In a speech designed to unite the Conservative party by stressing his
determination not to cede further national sovereignty, the prime minister
flatly rejected the 'old centralised prescription'.
Instead he insisted that 'a new vision of Europe' was emerging in which 'the
functions of the Community should be carried out in different ways, often
involving different groups of states'.
Speaking at a European election rally in Ellesmere Port, he added: 'I have
never believed that Europe must invariably act as one on every issue. Trying
to make every country conform to every plan is a socialist way of thinking:
it not for us.'
The prime minister's comments marked out the growing difference of approach
between Britain and some of its EU partners over the evolution of EU
decision-making.
Earlier this week, Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for Europe, hit
out at governments seeking to slow the pace of European integration and
called for more centralised decision making.
But Mr Major said yesterday: 'I don't happen to think that it threatens
Europe if member states are free to do some things in their own way and at
their own speed.'
Senior Conservative party officials insisted he was not suggesting Britain
would join the 'slow lane' of a two-speed Europe.
Mr Major also made it clear that he was not raising the possibility that
Britain - or any other EU state - could 'duck out' of commitments made in
the past.
But the speech was immediately seized on by opposition parties as an
admission by the government of its failure in Europe. Mr Jack Cunningham,
Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said that in order to hold together the
Conservative party, the prime minister 'is apparently willing to offer
voluntary relegation to the second division in Europe'.
The idea of a multi-speed Europe has been floated several times in recent
weeks by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as a possible outcome of
the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of European
integration.
But last night marked the first time that Mr Major had taken up the theme of
so-called 'variable geometry'. He also used his second rally of the campaign
to warn that the opposition parties would allow Brussels to dictate
Britain's taxation and foreign policies.
Surrender of the national veto would threaten Britain's Pounds 3bn rebate
from Brussels and could also lead to higher taxes set by the EU and to a
loss of control over Britain's own foreign policy interests, Mr Major said.

The National Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank, intends to maintain its
tough licensing policy for new domestic and foreign banks, Mr Witold
Kozinski, the bank's deputy chairman, said.
His comments mean that foreign banks such as Chase Manhattan and Deutsche
Bank, which have applications pending for the establishment of wholly-owned
subsidiaries in Poland, are unlikely to be accepted in the near future.
An exception is the joint application by Dresdner Bank and the Banque
Nationale de Paris, which is in its final stages.
'Everything points to a successful conclusion (to this application),' Mr
Kozinski said. 'We are waiting for them to clarify some points in their
business plan,' he added.
The green light for Dresdner signifies recognition of the bank's role as
chair of the London Club creditors' steering committee, which negotiated a
45 per cent reduction in Poland's Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt last
march.
However, the NBP will continue to invite the remaining applicants to take
stakes in the dozen or so newly formed local private banks. These are
struggling under the weight of poor loan portfolios or are unable to raise
new funds to avoid failure.
'We would also consider investments by foreign banks in some of our healthy
banks,' Mr Kozinski said, adding that the NBP was ready to grant tax breaks
and make capital injections in cases where foreign banks decided to take
over an ailing local bank.
The NBP is aiming to consolidate the private banking sector. This comprises
62 banks of which about one-fifth face the prospect of bankruptcy. These
banks were established in 1990 and 1991 and have suffered from inexperienced
management which allowed bad loans to accumulate without building adequate
reserves.
The NBP then issued licences to 10 foreign banks, including Citibank and the
International Bank in Poland (whose shareholders include Credit Lyonnais and
the Banca Commerciale Italiana). These have earned large profits by
concentrating on cash management services and foreign exchange dealing, and
have pursued conservative lending policies.
The locally owned private banks account for about 20 per cent of the banking
system's capital base. The majority is still in the hands of state sector
banks which were recapitalised last year and present less cause for concern.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: German banks in talks over
Castle Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The group of banks financing the DM3.4bn (Dollars 2bn) rescue package for
Metallgesellschaft yesterday discussed the future of Castle Energy
Corporation, the US oil refining group at the centre of the German company's
financial difficulties.
The future of Castle Energy in which the German company has a 40 per cent
stake became the subject of speculation following the announcement last week
by Metallgesellschaft that it will have to make provisions for new losses on
top of debt totalling DM9.2bn last March.
However, Deutsche Bank, which hosted the so-called steering committee, said
the meeting with representatives of the German group's board had been
relatively short.
It was held to inform the banks about a strategy unveiled by Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, the new chief executive drafted in after the group nearly went
bankrupt earlier this year, he said.
A source close to the talks said links between Castle and MG Corp, a
Metallgesellschaft subsidiary in New York, 'were so intensive' that a
decision to sell the stake was unthinkable.
MG Corp agreed to buy virtually all Castle's refinery output at prices above
the existing market, an unusual agreement which triggered the need for
further risk provisions.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(12): Multimedia spurs ATM advance / ATM technology opens the door to
exciting new applications for computer networks. It is ideally suited for
handling multimedia projects - A breakthrough in communications technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATM (which stands for Asynchronous Transfer Mode) has the potential to
support transmission of combined data, voice and video at up to 45 megabits
per second.
Developed in the French laboratory CNET in the mid-l980s, the switching
system employs fixed length instead of variable length 'packets' to achieve
greater efficiency.
How soon it becomes widespread depends on the ability of equipment vendors
and service providers to supply a range of functions which are needed to
convert the extra network bandwidth into a useful tool.
Vendors have to make it easy and attractive for users to migrate from
current transmission systems. Most experts think that 1996 will be the year
in which the ATM market comes of age.
Many large organisations which are suffering from congestion of their data
networks are eager to have the extra bandwidth. Many hope to start using ATM
within the next couple of years, but it needs to be properly managed to be
of any benefit to them.
The shift to client-server computing, coupled with a big increase in
workgroup applications, file transfers and online transaction processing,
are the main factors in creating the demand for ATM. The imminent arrival of
multimedia systems has added to the urgency.
Mr Massimo Pacini, a product manager for IBM UK's bandwidth management
systems division, says that ATM is ideally suited to handling multimedia
applications in which data transfer is time-critical.
'Unlike previous generations of technology, there is no other technology
coming up on the horizon to replace it,' he says. 'Users will therefore
build ATM networks as a way of 'future-proofing' themselves.'
Many organisations are finding that today's networking systems, particularly
the Ethernet and Token Ring local area network structures, can barely cope.
Nor do Fast Ethernet and Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) appear to
be fully capable of taking over from them. When the price of ATM falls to
the point where it becomes competitive with these systems, it will have
several important advantages. It can run over existing cables; it can be
applied to both local area and wide area networks; and, above all, there is
a consensus that there is no alternative.
This lack of an alternative has concentrated the industry on bringing about
rapid standardisation, steered by the ATM Forum. Mr Pacini says there is
still a need for more standards before ATM can become universal,
particularly for an application programming interface.
The Superjanet academic and research network is undertaking a pioneering ATM
project which is the most advanced in the UK and among the most innovative
of its kind in the world.
Supported by the Higher Education Funding Councils for England, Scotland and
Wales, the network is managed by the Rutherford-Appleton laboratory in
Oxfordshire.
Based on BT's broadband technology, it was begun five years ago as an
extension of the research community's Janet network and now claims to lead
the world in high-speed wide area networks running complex imaging
applications across fibre optic cables.
Since the middle of last year, four universities - Cambridge, Manchester,
Edinburgh and University College, London - have been connected by an ATM
system running at 34 megabits per second.
Superjanet has four ATM switches supplied by Netcomm, a UK ATM specialist
which was acquired last year by General Datacom of the US.
The first ATM application for Superjanet has been teaching surgery. An
operation is captured on a overhead camera; the surgeon is equipped with a
microphone so that the operation can be discussed with medical students who
watch it on screens in the other hospitals.
Dr Robert Cooper, director of networking for the Superjanet project, says
this gives medical students a chance to obtain the right experience which
might not otherwise be available to them.
In the next few months the number of sites linked to the Superjanet ATM
system will rise to 14. Next year the maximum speed of the network will be
increased to 155 megabits, allowing many more users to be connected and
greatly improving the quality of the images. The project also involves a
pilot scheme to connect CISCO routers to the network.
Other applications will soon be added. It is expected that one of them will
be a video-conferencing facility for molecular chemistry students. They will
be able to work together using images of three-dimensional models.
Superjanet has been described by BT as the world's first big information
super-highway. BT's broadband product manager Mr Steve Taylor expects that
in the long-term the whole network will be run over ATM.
In the US there are at least three similar pioneering ATM ventures,
involving industry, government, research laboratories and academia. These
have had enthusiastic support from president Clinton and vice-president
Gore.
The US is by far the biggest initial market for ATM products, according to
Mr Richard Barnett, director of research and development for Netcomm.
The main interest in it comes from US telecom companies which are now
installing ATM networks to meet the growing demand from their customers,
particularly for video-conferencing applications, he says.
In Europe, users do not seem to be pushing the carriers to the same extent
and European telecom companies have been much slower to develop ATM
services, he says. One explanation for this is that the US has a much more
competitive telecoms market, which has brought down the cost of calls and
made ATM services more affordable.
The first ATM-related products have been launched by equipment vendors in
the past year. In May, IBM introduced its first ATM adapter, which fits into
the back of a workstation. IBM has stated that in the struggle to reverse
its decline it intends to be the leader in the ATM market and plans to spend
Dollars 100m in developing ATM products, including microchips, intelligent
hubs and carrier switches.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(13): Storage problem intensifies / New, inventive software eats away at PC
hard disk space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an assumption that when you buy a PC you will get enough storage to
last you five years.
'That's not true and not possible,' according to Peter Sondergaard, an
analyst at the Gartner Group. 'We are on the verge of a significant increase
in storage requirements.'
Key drivers include the onset of multimedia (combining voice and video with
the PC) and the development of storage-hungry software - 'from 1995, when we
buy a PC we'll get 'free' audio and video (multimedia) support,' says Mr
Sondergaard. 'And when users have it, they'll exploit it. But video and
voice make heavy demands on storage.'
Compression software, which helps users reduce the space taken up by voice,
video and data, is improving all the time. But the Gartner Group does not
believe that it will enable people to stick with what facilities they have.
Storage-hungry software is also eating away at hard disk space. Anyone who
bought a 386-based PC with a 20 megabyte hard disk a few years ago will find
that it is almost impossible to get anything but a slimmed down version of
one of the latest word processing packages on to it.
Microsoft's Word for Windows 6.0 and WordPerfect for Windows both take up
over 20 megabytes of storage. And you cannot run either of them without
MS-Dos and Microsoft's Windows graphical user interface (itself much larger
than earlier PC operating systems). Using compression software and deleting
superfluous files can help but both require spare time and technical
knowledge.
In the future, as object-oriented operating systems and software catch on,
the problem is likely to become worse. Object-oriented software, which
combines data with the instructions used to process it - for example,
statistical data and the graph needed to plot it - will allow software
developers to come up with ever more inventive and more storage-hungry
software.
However, the good news from the Gartner Group is that the price per megabyte
of storage will continue to fall over the next five years. At the same time
the range of different storage options will increase. Today, the main
choices for PC storage are:
Magnetic hard disks. These are built in to most PCs. Removable hard disks
are available, too. Alessandra Bianchini, notebook manager at Olivetti in
Italy, asks: 'Why carry a portable into the office, when all you want is
access to the data it contains?'
With this in mind, Olivetti's latest Philos portable includes a removable
hard disk (under the keyboard) measuring about 3 ins. by 5 ins. This can be
carried into the office and plugged into a slot in a desktop PC.
PCMCIA hard disks (PCMCIA stands for Personal Computer Memory Card
Association) are another form of portable storage. These are the size of
thick credit cards and can be slotted into small expansion slots conforming
to PCMCIA standards. These slots are becoming the norm on most portable
computers (for hard disks, fax modems and so on) but are only available on a
small proportion of new desktop PCs - 'there is almost universal support for
PCMCIA in the mobile computing market,' says Gavin Lennox, brand manager for
communications products at Lotus.
CD-Rom disks (compact disk, read-only memory). These are optical disks which
look like music CDs but store data, voice, video - or all three. They are
usually non-rewritable; which means you can retrieve information from them
but not add to it. To use CD-Rom disks you need a CD-Rom drive plugged into
your PC or built into it.
Magneto-optical CDs. These are also based on CD technology but are similar
to magnetic floppy and hard disks in that they are rewritable. They are
often used for storing digitised images of paper documents in industries
like insurance. The entry costs for using this technology are relatively
high in terms of the equipment needed and access is slow, but the cost per
megabyte is low.
'Raid' technology (raid: redundant arrays of inexpensive disks) are mainly
used in conjunction with PC servers, computers which store files and manage
PCs in a network, and with mid-range systems.
Raid technology cleverly combines low-cost PC hard disks with techniques and
peripherals common to mid-range and mainframe computing environments. Hard
disks are essentially stacked together so that several can be accessed
simultaneously for extra speed.
Tape drives: where fast access is not needed - for example, in data
archiving - data can be stored on tape (such as digital audio tape) and this
provides a cheaper alternative than Raid.
Floppy disks: once the main form of PC storage, these are now used mainly to
transfer information to another computer - for example, through the post -
or from an office PC to a portable/home computer.
The Gartner Group believes that hard disks will remain the dominant form of
PC storage until at least 1997 for a number of reasons: first, they are
inexpensive which is very important in the competitive PC market.
Second, there is a large installed base of users and a wide choice of
suppliers. In the computer industry this situation tends to slow the take up
of newer technologies.
Third, they do not suffer from some of the drawbacks of potential rivals.
They are rewritable and offer fast access to data. They are also available
in high-capacity versions, such as 200 megabytes.
CD-Rom disks can store far more data than hard disks. But most are not
rewritable. This makes them most suitable for delivering information which
cannot be changed. They are ideal for dictionaries and software programs.
Rewritable CDs are starting to appear - 'but over the next few years, growth
of CD-ROMS will be slightly inhibited because they offer slower access to
data than hard disks,' says Sondergaard,
PCMCIA hard disks take up less space and consume less energy than hard
disks. For this reason, IBM has one in its small footprint 'green' PC.
Peter Sondergaard says the dominance of hard disks could change after 1997;
after that,'we'll see the emergence of CDR (CD rewritable) and we may see
CDs with faster data access,' he says. 'But even then, hard disks will still
be faster and cheaper.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(11): Surprises abound / The computer printer industry is one of the most
dynamic segments of the office equipment sector and has been growing at
double digit rates - Printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The printer may not share the glamour of the personal computer or demand the
respect traditionally accorded to the mainframe or the departmental server,
but the changes under way in printers and print technology are scarely less
dramatic.
Today, the printer market includes humble dot-matrix machines at the low
end, low cost ink-jets for low volume and colour work, high quality personal
desktop laser printers, network lasers connected to local area networks, and
high speed digital copier-printers in the print room.
In terms of manufacturers, Mr Graham Salmons, a senior industry analyst in
Dataquest's European document management group, says, 'Hewlett Packard
'owns' the European printer market.' HP has around a 33 per cent market
share by volume and a similar percentage share by value - worth an estimated
Dollars 2.65bn.( Pounds 1.81bn)
The US manufacture's dominance of the market in part reflects a marked shift
in the sales product-mix. Sales of printers based on older impact technology
 -such as dot-matrix and daisy wheel printers - are falling while sales of
printers based on non-impact technologies like ink-jet, laser and Led (Light
Emitting Diodes) are growing strongly.
This shift has been driven by the clear advantages which laser printers have
over their rivals including convenience, print quality, high speed
operation, advanced text and graphics capabilities and the rapid erosion of
the price premum they once commanded. As a result, the 30:70 balance in
favour of impact printers across Europe in 1991 is expected to be reversed
over the next couple of years - 1993 was the first year when non-impact
printer volumes exceeded those for impact devices.
Despite this, most analysts believe the dot-matrix printer will retain a
role as the office workhorse for a limited number of high volume
applications including those requiring continuous paper such as orders and
invoices.
For low-volume work, particularly in the home market, European users in
particular have eagerly embraced ink and bubble jet printers which offer
fast, virtually silent printing at very low cost.
Ink-jet printing technology has also provided a cost effective means of
introducing colour to both business and technical graphics.
According to Dataquest, HP has over 90 per cent of the European colour
ink-jet market and over 50 per cent of all injet sales worth Dollars 1.13bn
last year. Cannon ranks number two with around a 20 per cent share worth
about Pounds 420m (Dollars 613.20m).
Mr Salmons believes that injet printers will continue to replace dot-matrix
at the low volume end, and that they will move away from mono to colour as
lower priced laser printers are developed.
Nevertheless in the personal printer market, ink-jets also face a challenge
from lower cost laser printers, particularly the Windows GDI printers which
have recently appeared - some costing less than Pounds 400.
These printers take advantage of Microsoft Windows software and PC
processing power eliminating the need for costly 'intelligence' to be built
into the printer itself. Although print speeds are relatively slow, they
offer high quality laser printing at low prices.
More generally two distinct markets for laser printers are emerging -
low-end personal printers capable of around 6ppm (pages per minute), and
high-end heavy duty desktop printers capable of 16-20ppm for shared use.
The trend towards networking of PCs has clearly fuelled laser printer sales
over the past few years although recent research conducted by Dataquest
shows that even where PC users are connected to Lans, many of them still
prefer to have a personal printer. Dataquest estimates that HP has about 48
per cent of the European market for page and non-impact printers up to 6 ppm
(pages per minute) and more than 60 per cent of the 16-20ppm network printer
market.
The main trends among the network printers are towards easier installation,
simpler operation and greater paper capacity.
Although HP also dominates this market segment, the projected growth of
network and workgroup printing is attracting new entrants such as Rank Xerox
which introduced a range network printers recently.
'Users in network environments are demanding robust, fully featured
workgroup printers optimised specifically for multi-user applications,' says
Mr Richard Gibbs, Rank Xerox' business team manager at a recent product
launch. The company's new 4220 network printer offeres enhanced 300dpi (dots
per inch) print quality at speeds up to 20ppm and seamless automatic
emulation switching between print languages.
Multifunctional devices combining the roles of digital facsimile, scanner,
printer and copier units are also beginning to appear - although much less
quickly than some had predicted.
At the low-volume or 'personal' end of the office equipment market this is
epitomised by the DOC-IT systems from Oki, the Japanese office machine
manufacturer, which were launched last year. These systems combine an 8ppm
printer with a plain-paper fax machine, digital copier and a 10ppm flatbed
and hand-held scanners - all accessible through Microsoft Windows-based
software running on a PC. Similarly, a growing number of xerographic copiers
use digital technology which in turn enables some of them to double up as
colour printers and scanners. At the top end of the office equipment
spectrum Rank Xerox was the first manufacturer to introduce a high speed
multi-function copier and printer. The Docutech Production Publisher prints
at a rate of 135cpm (copies per minute) and can be linked up to work with
any computer system thereby providing true 'printing on demand.'
High speed electronic printers take output directly from a PC and come
equipped with powerful raster image processors which allows them to process
extremely complex documentation at very high speed.
Meanwhile, although most companies have traditionally sent their high
quality colour work out to offset printers, the launch of the Indigo E-Print
1000, the world's first digital offset colour printer, last summer holds out
the prospect of bringing at least short-run colour work back to the office
print room.

(10): Quicker decisions, higher efficiency / Imaging has moved out of the
backroom and into the mainstream of business re-engineering - Improved
document handling

An imaging system has brought about a startling change at Birmingham
Midshires Building Society. Two years ago it took an average of five weeks
to process a mortgage application. Now a department only one fifth of its
previous size processes applications in three weeks.
According to Mike Jackson, chief executive of the Wolverhampton-based
society, 80 per cent of mortgage deals are now offered within this new
time-scale. More remarkable is the reduction in staffing levels, from 150
people processing mortgages, to a staff of 30 or so.
'Overall, we've reduced staffing by 1,000, from 2,450 to 1,450 since August
1992,' says Mr Jackson. 'But this is very much part of a wider process of
re-engineering the business. We've already gone through one 'pass' and now
we are doing it again.'
Birmingham Midshires' system is based on Wang's Open/image software,
implemented by City-based Relational Developments RDL - 'the imaging system
has improved the speed of decision-making,' says Mr Jackson.
'One of the key benefits is having all the information on hand, and being
able to answer customers' and brokers' questions immediately from the screen
without having to refer to paper.
'The second part is that using the database coupled with the imaging system,
we have a lot more information and history available on the customer than we
ever had available through a paper file; that has brought our arrears levels
significantly lower than they were before.'
It is into this mainstream arena of business process re-engineering (BPR)
that image processing is emerging from its niche, in partnership with other
information sharing technologies such as groupware and workflow. This
drawing together of parallel technologies has been made possible by the
general adoption of powerful, highly adaptable (and lower cost) desktop
workstations, and robust networking software.
More specific to the imaging market is the mundane but vital business of
getting the images into the system, and storing them, once captured. Images
are space-hungry, but optical disks have helped: an optical disk of 12ins
diameter can store more than 100,000 A4 documents. Scanning technology has
also become much cheaper, and like the fax and the PC, come within the reach
of departmental budgets.
According to Geoff Bedser, a senior consultant at CMG, (Computer Management
Group), image processing is far more relevant to business than it is to
information technology (IT) - 'IT people don't like it because it reduces
their power-base,' he comments.
A banker by training, he has long argued the business case for imaging, and
his work in CMG's finance division has given him a bird's eye view of the
various imaging developments, as well as the offerings and alliances of
various suppliers whose products have come and gone.
'Over the last five years hardware and software have advanced at an
astonishing rate. The emphasis of the system suppliers is now on improved
process automation and document handling, rather than straightforward
storage and retrieval. Companies who are aiming for optimum efficiency in
their document handling are starting to consider the benefits of totally
restructuring the way they work.'
Andrea Wharton, research director of Twickenham-based Wharton Information
Systems, writes an annual review of the UK imaging market in association
with the UK Association for Information and Image Management (UK AIIM). She
estimates that electronic document management (EDM) systems doubled sales in
1993, generating a total revenue of more than Pounds 130m.
Ms Wharton's report, Document Management: the Next Steps, estimates the
current number of image processing sites in the UK at more than 7,000.
Although the larger share of new installations still goes to specialists
such as Canofile and Cimage, the report identifies increasing interest among
mainstream software publishers including Lotus, Oracle, and Sybase.
Ms Wharton believes that recent improvements in technology including data
compression and the availability of high-quality ISDN telephone links, have
helped make imaging more appealing as an alternative to acres of filing
cabinets.
'One of the most difficult things was putting the data around the network.
It's now faster, and PCs are more able to handle images without expensive
extras.
'Large organisations which had a real need, went ahead and did it anyway.
Despite the deficiencies of the technology three or more years ago, they
created their own environment behind closed doors. But increasingly we're
seeing a desire to give much wider inter-departmental access to image
information, so that image becomes simply another data-type.'
Both Mr Bedser and Ms Wharton underline the fragmented nature of the imaging
market, and remark on how difficult it is to break into it. Even companies
with as much muscle as Digital Equipment have changed direction several
times, and eventually given up the struggle to establish a market share.
As in any emerging market, there are clever innovators in specific niches.
Ealing-based Trimco, one-time Cimage distributor, has developed its own
large-format technology. Imagesolve of Finchley (acquired in November 1993
by US-based Banctec) has both PC-based and client-server solutions. US
company Excalibur has software for intelligent correction of optical
character recognition (OCR), eliminating the inevitable problems of OCR such
as coffee-stains on documents.
Concentrating on image rather than text is Bournemouth-based 4Sight, which
has practically cornered the market in newspaper publishing with its
software for transmitting images via ISDN lines between incompatible
hardware.
At the low end of the market are turnkey storage and retrieval systems such
as Keyfile and Watermark, sold through third parties. High-end offerings
such as Filenet ImagePlus and Plexus have already been widely adopted by
banking and financial users.
Wang's partnership with RDL in the Birmingham Midshires site is typical of
its strategy to use third parties and systems integrators to sell
Open/image. After a disastrous loss of direction, and some years in the
financial wilderness, Wang has focused sharply on imaging. David Allcock,
marketing manager at Wang UK, is working to develop third-party channels for
Wang's technology.
Always clever at building in extras, Wang has built performance measurement
into Open/image, but kept its own role anonymous - 'we allow VARs to absorb
completely our technology into their application: no two-second commercial
when the user enters the system,' says Mr Allcock.
'Previously we had too many irons in the fire. In the last three years we
have spent Dollars 50m developing our imaging and workflow technology, and
the only way we have of re-couping that is to sell in volume, through
resellers, not direct.'
Partners now include more than 20 Value Added Resellers (VARS) including
House of Speed, Fraser Williams, and Lynxserve.
Open/image's intelligent workload assessment measures the time taken to
process workloads, so that financial directors can see the gains - 'it
allows you to justify the spend and see where the benefits are,' says Mr
Allcock.
'Increasingly the quality of systems is such that any dealer can supply
shrink-wrapped imaging solutions. I can see the imaging market turning into
a commodity market, like PCs.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (8): Herd treads
carefully / Profile of Merrill Lynch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The thundering herd is gathering speed in Germany - but is taking care to
tread carefully, writes David Waller. While Merrill Lynch is renowned for
its aggressive approach to investment banking, its hooves are muffled as it
sets about expanding its presence in the German financial markets.
Conservatism is the watchword for the bank's German activities, says Mr Tim
von Halle, Anglo-German head of the bank's capital markets activities in
Frankfurt - an under-appreciated dimension to the Merrill Lynch culture
which the bank claims fits in well with the German business environment.
Couple the bank's conservatism with its undoubted financial muscle - Merrill
raised more capital for its clients in international financial markets than
any other institution last year - and the bank is convinced that it has an
attractive proposition for Germany's capital-hungry corporations.
Having set up a subsidiary in Frankfurt in 1988, Merrill Lynch has 35 'front
office' professionals on the ground in Frankfurt plus about 25 back-office
staff.
Separate from the investment banking activities is a network of five offices
throughout Germany which provide private banking services to high net worth
individuals. This operation was set up more than 20 years ago and now
employs 80 people.
Merrill's plans to expand from this base are understated - Mr von Halle says
simply that the bank intends to grow profitably. There is no declared aim to
achieve a spectacular increase in the headcount within a given period.
The growth plans are in part driven by broader changes within the Merrill
group. Traditionally highly centralised, Merrill has more recently taken a
strategic decision to devolve power away from the New York headquarters to
its regional operations around the world. In addition, Merrill sees a wealth
of opportunity for its services in Germany in the years ahead.
'Foreign banks have traditionally brought all the innovation to the German
capital market,' comments Mr Andreas von Buddenbrock, who recently joined
Merrill Lynch's German operations as head of investment banking after more
than 14 years with rival J. P. Morgan.
'Over the past 20 years, foreign banks have introduced German corporations
to the international foreign exchange markets, to the Euromarkets and
Eurobonds,' he says. 'We will be at the forefront of the next wave of
developments - the globalisation of the German equity markets and an upsurge
in demand for mergers and acquisitions advice.'
The past two years has seen a noted increase in the willingness of the
German Lander - federal states - and the public sector Landesbanken to make
use of foreign investment banks when raising D-Marks on international
capital markets. Foreign countries also use US houses to raise D-Mark funds,
rather than relying on the big three German banks as in the past. Merrill
has led or co-led 29 fixed-interest D-Mark issues which raised DM28bn since
July last year.
The bank has also played a leading role in two pioneering international
equity issues involving German companies. It was co-book-runner with
Deutsche Bank in the Dollars 810m placing of a 3 per cent stake in the
Daimler-Benz group with US investors; more recently it was joint global
co-ordinator with Dresdner Bank in the bank's innovative DM1.14bn placing of
new shares with international investors, completed in early May this year.
Merrill won these mandates less because of its strength within Germany than
because of its powerful position as the world's largest distributor of new
equity. Merrill's team of advisers to the Dresdner issue, for example, was
flown in from the investment bank's European HQ in London.
Merrill aims to bolster the local presence with a strategy of partnership
with Germany's leading domestic institutions.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (6): Old family houses
return / Examining the efforts to rebuild the banking system in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly four years since German unification, the banking system and a range
of financial services are taking root in eastern Germany. But it is not only
the savings banks and Landesbanken, or state banks, which are being
re-established. The country's old family banking houses are returning, too.
But rebuilding a banking system has proved far from easy, says Mr Rudolf von
Sandersleben who represents the eastern states for Sal. Oppenheim, one of
Germany's oldest private banking houses which was founded in 1789.
Unlike western Germany after the second world war, which was still in a
position to lean on the mittelstand, the small and medium-sized enterprises
which formed the backbone to Germany's economic success over the past 40
years, no such sector existed in former communist eastern Germany. Moreover,
as Mr von Sandersleben points out, when Sal. Oppenheim opened its office in
Leipzig in 1990, the bank could not even lean on an entrepreneurial class.
'The entire memory of private enterprise had not been entirely wiped out,
largely because the last of the privately-run, very small businesses were
not banned until the early 1970s,' explained Mr von Sandersleben. 'But many
of these managers are now very old. Some of them have, however, tried again
to set up their businesses and revive that entrepreneurial spirit. But they
are few in number. We have to start from scratch.'
The absence of the mittelstand sector, therefore, poses a set of different
challenges for the private banking houses. Moreover, the absence of an
industrial base, which spawned west Germany's mittelstand, means that
private bankers have to look elsewhere for business or, more importantly,
take considerable risk to finance young entrepreneurs anxious to set up a
business in the eastern states.
Even in this context there are problems. 'These small businesses have no
capital,' said Mr von Sandersleben. 'They have no reserves, unlike the west
German mittelstand which have had 20 or 30 years to build up reserves which
can be used to invest, market, and make use of their capital.'
What, then, is the strategy the private banking houses have adopted in
eastern Germany? Sal. Oppenheim, for the moment, is 'going for the big fish'
 -those enterprises with a turnover of at least DM100m. These include the
utilities, for example, which are already largely dominated by west German
companies. Sal. Oppenheim is also more intent on finding ways to finance
their surplus liquidity than homing in on very small companies.
At the same time, the bank is playing a considerable role in consulting and
financial engineering. Yet the private bankers admit that many of the
companies in eastern Germany are not yet ready for such sophisticated
instruments of financing. 'What they still lack are the tools which are
vital for surviving: marketing expertise, risk capital, reserves and
management know-how,' said Mr von Sandersleben. 'Many are struggling to
survive'.
Yet, according to the Federal Association for Germany's banks, (BDB) under
which the country's private bankers are grouped, these are precisely the
kind of tools the banking sector in eastern Germany is now providing. Last
year's figures for these activities seem to confirm this. For example, the
credit flows from the private banking sector increased from DM23bn in 1990,
to more than DM96.9bn in 1993. Almost half that credit has been earmarked
for the housing sector. The Hypotheken banks, which specialise in this
sector, have already lent DM46bn, while the smaller banks have extended more
than DM11bn of credit.
Investment in businesses, ranging from the small crafts sector to property
and the infrastructure, has also increased sharply, rising from DM2.7bn in
1991 to DM4.3bn in 1993, and is set to increase to DM6.2bn by the end of
next year.
Yet curiously, the private banks have increasingly shied away from lending
to enterprises under the Treuhand privatisation agency. By the end of 1990,
the private banks had extended loans totalling DM18.3bn to the agency, and
only DM4.7bn to non-Treuhand companies. This ratio was understandable, given
that there were few private enterprises at that time, everything was in flux
and, in any case, credit facilities to the Treuhand carried few risks. They
were guaranteed by the government and margins were high.
Yet, by the end of 1993, more than DM48.9bn of credits had been extended to
non-Treuhand enterprises, and less than DM8bn to those enterprises still
under the agency. 'We wanted to have the freedom to do our own advising and
financing and locate potential customers ourselves,' said one banker.
As the private banks identified their niches throughout eastern Germany,
they also employed more people, crucial in a region which is facing
unemployment rates of more than 17 per cent. The number of jobs created by
the private banking sector rose from 18,000 in 1991 to over 21,000 in 1993.
But in creating jobs, the BDB believes is it also contributing to 'the
transfer of management know-how to the eastern states, which is a crucial
plank for restructuring the entire banking sector,' according to its
officials.
Bankhaus Lobbecke, which was founded in 1761 and which has opened branches
in Dresden and Magdeburg since unification, shares this philosophy. But
Konsul Gunter Follmer, the spokesman for the bank's partners, would go one
step further. 'Banking in eastern Germany is often pioneering work and it
still is. . .' Mr Follmer said. He added that Lobbecke wanted to support the
fledgling mittelstand sector. Indeed, by the end of last year, more than
DM1bn, or a third of its total credit volume, had been targeted on eastern
German clients.
There is hardly a banker who does not believe that eastern Germany needs a
mittelstand as much as the banks need these clients. 'The landscape will
change over the next 10 years,' said Mr von Sandersleben. 'But we will have
learned from our mistakes as well. And the existence of an overriding
bureaucracy is one of those mistakes. But that's another issue.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (7): Avoiding the
pitfalls / Profile of Salomon Brothers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buried in the annual report of the Association of Foreign Banks in Germany
is a sentence which expresses foreign bankers' frustrations at doing
business in Germany.
'The universal banking system prevailing in Germany. . . knows how to
successfully prevent competitors from penetrating traditional business
relationships,' the report says, lamenting the fact that foreign banks'
share of the German banking market has stuck at a modest 5 per cent.
'Many foreign banks stub their toes in this market,' agrees Mr Nicholas
Coulson who joined the board of Salomon Brothers' German operations last
year.
Salomon is one which has managed to avoid the pitfalls and 'make intelligent
use of the opportunities' which present themselves in Germany, the former S.
G. Warburg executive says.
Salomon made DM40.3m net profits in 1992 and had a DM10.2bn balance sheet at
the end of that year. The figures for 1993 have not been released yet but Mr
Dan Lee, Arkansas-born managing director of Salomon's German operations,
says that they improved substantially.
In itself this is not surprising, given the excellent conditions prevailing
in the world capital markets last year, but there is no doubt that Salomon
has developed a strong franchise within Germany - the most recent figures
from the Association of Foreign Banks show that in 1992 Salomon was the most
profitable foreign investment bank in Germany, with the biggest balance
sheet.
If a year ago one had asked around the Frankfurt banking community why this
should be, rivals would have put it down to Mr Peter Coym and Mr Frank
Beelitz, the two men who opened up Salomon's German operation in 1986. But
they left last year to join Lehman Brothers where they are hoping to repeat
the success they enjoyed at Salomon.
Mr Lee argues that the personnel changes have had no disruptive impact on
Salomon's development - below board level, the senior management team has
remained extremely stable in the seven years that Salomon has been in
Germany, he says. The firm has done wll precisely because of the continuity
of client coverage in Germany, Mr Lee claims, combined with the ability to
deploy the resources of Salomon's worldwide network for the benefit of
German clients.
Another attraction has been a relatively cheap source of funds.
'Over the past seven years Germany has evolved to be one of Salomon's
cheaper sources of financing worldwide,' Mr Lee explains. 'This allows us to
run large trading positions here and to fund the rest of the group.'
The bank's profits, he says, come chiefly from trading in government
securities, equities and derivatives, and from capital market transactions
where the bank makes use of its international placing power.
In the Eurobond markets, it was joint lead-manager last year - with Deutsche
Bank - on the World Bank's D-Mark Global Bond issue, the first of its kind,
as well as on two smaller issues raising DM300m. In the domestic D-Mark bond
market it was lead manager on a DM750m issue for the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg.
This year, Salomon lead-managed the second-ever D-Mark Global Bond, a DM2bn
issue for the public sector L-Bank.
It was also co-lead manager, co-manager or underwriter in 11 Eurobond issues
and six domestic bond issues, following on from 100 such mandates last year.
The bank has about 125 people working in Germany: 40 on the trading floor,
55 in the back office and the rest providing corporate finance, mergers and
acquisitions, research and other services.
Salomon plans to expand at a pace consistent with the growth of new business
opportunities. Mr Lee stresses that there is no hurry to achieve any
targeted growth in personnel, recognising that finding the right people can
be difficult in Frankfurt, given the intense competition to employ native
Germans who have had experience of working in the Anglo-American financial
services sector.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(7): Stronger in niche markets / The competitive performance of
European-owned electronics companies is relatively poor. There are, however,
oases of excellence in an arid landscape - European suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European information technology industry is big, worth over Ecu120bn -
equal to Dollars 135.6bn or Pounds 94.4bn - in the EU countries alone, but
it is mostly foreign-owned. There are, however, some market niches where
European-owned companies seem able to hold their own with the rest of the
information technology world.
Supercomputing, remarkably enough, is one. Meiko, UK-owned with headquarters
in Bristol, England, and Waltham, Massachusetts, last year sold a Dollars
17.5m (Pounds 11.90m) machine to Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a top US
research establishment more used to spending its money on American
supercomputers from Cray Research, the world leader.
Stern Computing Systems, based in Lyons, France, is meanwhile developing a
line of smaller, less powerful machines aimed at the technical computing
market rather than 'Grand Challenge' problems like modelling atmospheric
behaviour.
These, however, are oases of excellence in an arid landscape. European
computer hardware is dominated by US and Asian companies. The competitive
performance of European-owned electronics companies is poor, and shows
little sign of improvement. All the three indigenously-owned large
manufacturers - Siemens Nixdorf, Olivetti and Groupe Bull - are losing money
heavily.
The state-owned Bull is seeking private equity investment to strengthen its
balance sheet and persuade Brussels that further injections of capital from
the French government is essential for restructuring and not simply a
concealed subsidy.
The performance of indigenously owned PC companies including Vobis in
Germany, Tulip in Holland and Elonex in the UK is more hopeful, helped by
the fact that the professional microcomputer market grew at a healthy 8.8
per cent in units in 1993.
The fact remains that overall European electronics companies hold less than
30 per cent of their domestic markets for computers. By comparison, US and
Japanese companies control at least three-quarters of their computer
business in their home markets. According to Hubert Joly, Jurgen Kluge and
Lothar Stein, writing in the current issue of the McKinsey Quarterly, there
are three principles reasons for Europe's weakness in information
technology:
First, a concentration on high-end products supported by protected markets
and high prices.
Second, a lack of market-driven technological innovation and growth through
new products.
Third, a failure to adapt operations to changing competitive conditions.
They say 'the bad news here is that Europe cannot blame its poor showing on
the sluggish economy, industry cycles or higher factor costs. The problem
stems from missed opportunities to cope early on with the superior
approaches and faster pace of world-class competitors.'
Mr Franz Hetzenhauer, president and co-founder of Tulip Computers, believes
that the European Commission could and should do more to stimulate the
development of indigenously owned companies: 'It's very difficult to say we
have an industry,' he says. 'We are a small number of companies in a very
big market.'
He believes the EU should endorse a strategy for the industry recognising
that information technology will be one of the three largest global
industries by 2000 and should form one of the bases of Europe's prosperity.
He argues, for example, that European computer manufacturers should be
encouraged to collaborate with each other and with universities to eliminate
duplication of effort - 'everybody is building the same personal computer.
We are using our development funds the wrong way. It would be more efficient
to build everything but the final 20 per cent in common.'
The Esprit research programme, funded by the EU under its Framework research
initiative, was, he believes, too concerned with fundamental,
pre-competitive research.
A big issue is that the cost of manufacturing in Europe is high compared
with the US or Asia. Mr Hetzenhauer says that costs have to be stabilised,
tax rates cut and holidays curtailed. He also worries that illness levels
seem higher among European workers than their contemporaries in other
economies.
These social and macroeconomic issues apart, many manufacturers argue for
specific actions from the EU to cut the cost of manufacturing in Europe. Mr
Michael Spiro, finance director of Elonex, the fast-growing UK-based
microcomputer manufacturer, points to the import duties and anti-dumping
duties added to the cost of certain types of memory chip which, he reckons,
can add up to Dollars 50 to the price of a European-made machine.
The fact remains that indigenously-owned and foreign companies - with a few
exceptions including Compaq, the personal computer manufacturer - have found
the European market heavy going over the past few years. IBM and Digital
Equipment are among the companies which have blamed slow going in Europe for
poor results.
ICL, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake and which is the most
successful of the European-based large computer companies, has seen its
profitability fall steadily over the past three years.
This year pretax profits were a mere Pounds 23.4m and the company has
strengthened its balance sheet, raising a total of Pounds 100m from its
parent through a rights issue.
It is in a enviable position, however, compared with its European-owned
rivals. Groupe Bull's predicament is probably the most serious but Siemens
Nixdorf is still losing money and sales. Both sales and orders were down six
per cent at the half-way stage this year. In the past two years cumulative
losses have amounted to almost DM1bn.
Later this year, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, head of Siemen's computer business
for the past 10 years, will hand over to Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer, formerly of
Motorola and Asea Brown Boveri, whose principal challenge will be to bring
the ailing company to break-even point by 1996.
Olivetti of Italy cut its losses in 1993 to L465bn (Dollars 283.53m)
compared with L650bn (Dollars 396.34m) the year before and increased its
sales for the first time since 1990. On the other hand, it failed to break
even at the operational level. The group has been boosted, however, by the
award of a licence to run Italy's second mobile phone network. Olivetti led
a consortium including Bell Atlantic, Pactel and Mannesman. It intends to
use the licence as the basis of a new network to serve mobile phone and
computer users.
Europe's chief hopes of a resurgence in information technology lie in new
technologies and combinations of technologies where leadership has yet to be
established.
Mobile communications and multimedia are two such areas. But European
companies will have to move faster than in the past if they are not to
repeats their past failures.

(9): Better access to data / New ways to link 'islands of information'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The spread of desktop personal computers poses a special problem for
database developers: how can they bring the so-called 'islands of
information' together to form a coherent data resource and make it work for
the business?
It is probably an exaggeration to say that every piece of data on every
personal computer (PC), every departmental computer and the central
corporate mainframe is valuable. But there is no doubt that important data
sits on all of these computers and, for it to be of benefit to the business,
there must be a way to get at it and make it available for all those who
need it.
The proliferation of data across the network is the inevitable result of
distributing computer power to the desktop. As individuals get their hands
on PCs, they create their own local data resources. And, as PCs have been
plugged into corporate networks, users have been able to access data from
other sources. Usually this data has come from central corporate systems.
But increasingly it is being distributed to departmental database 'servers'
and even to individual desktop PCs.
This has become possible because of changes in the way that database
software works. Over the last decade, database technology has fragmented
into front-end tools to access and manipulate data and back-end server
'engines' which can store it in the most efficient way.
The client-server approach to designing computer systems has its origins in
this separation of data and the means to access it. Database software
suppliers have concentrated their efforts on improving the performance of
their server engines so that they can compete with the mainframe-based
systems. But attention has shifted to the front-end tools; software
suppliers have had to accommodate each others tools and engines to cope with
user demand for data - 'a lot of corporate data is sitting on desktop PCs
and companies want products that are flexible and can handle different
database engines. They cannot realise their data assets without these
tools,' says Mr Paul Hart, marketing manager at database supplier Unify.
'Standards have emerged in the database world and created a commodity market
for tools and server engines - and, at the same time, the market has become
more tool-orientated.'
Standards such as Structured Query Language (SQL) and Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) provide the software 'glue' necessary to link the front
end tools to the back end servers. This means, of course, that it is
relatively simple to use a tool from one supplier to access data on a server
from one or more different suppliers. Most database software suppliers must
now offer tools which can link to the most popular 'engines' - such as
Oracle, IBM's DB2, Ingres, Sybase and Informix - in addition to their own.
'We can supply a database server - but ours is one of many. You have to
provide links using SQL to as many as twenty different servers,' says Mr
Paul Salmon, UK marketing director at database specialist Gupta
Technologies.
Like its rivals, Gupta uses SQL and other standards to provide the links -
'we also support ODBC - although this does not necessarily give the
performance you need for large-scale applications. ODBC is fine - but it is
pretty basic and some customers have expressed concern over performance
because it puts an extra layer of software between the tool and the server,'
says Mr Salmon.
Companies are expecting more from database technology on their local area
networks (LANs) than before - 'companies want features such as security,
record locking and recovery. This way they can be sure that their important
corporate data is safe,' he adds.
Other database suppliers have found that the pressure to put important
applications on PC networks is putting pressure on database technology.
'There's a definite trend to put more serious applications on PC networks
and this can lead customers into a position where they have data all over
the place. They want the tools to bring it all together again,' says Mr Neil
Morgan, desktop product marketing manager at Oracle in the UK.
'To the individual user who wants to combine information from different
sources - it should appear as a single data resource,' he adds.
'We are building a set of transparent gateways to achieve this and let
desktop PC users access data from anywhere on the network.'
He points to the example of Rolls Royce: it has distributed its spare parts
database for aero engines from its IBM mainframe DB2 database to an Oracle
database running on a local server under the Unix operating system - 'there
is a significant business benefit in doing this. It speeds up local access
to the parts catalogue and improves customer service,' he explains.
'It also relieves the load on the central database server - an increasing
problem since client-server networks came along. We're working on technology
we call data staging which will make sure that the everything is kept in
line when the data is distributed across the network.'
A key part of distributing data in this way is to give users the desktop
tools to access data and perform their own processing - rather than relying
on complex applications software to do the job. The separation of these
tools from the underlying database management software has opened up the
software market - both for the database software suppliers and for others
who concentrate solely on desktop tools. This has made the software market
more competitive and gives users a wide range of choice.

(8): A serious challenge from the US / Japan's computer companies become
more vulnerable to aggressive outside forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The city of Mino, to the north of Osaka, may seem an unlikely site for a
progressive policy on technology. But the educational council in Mino broke
with widespread practice in Japan and chose Apple's Macintosh personal
computers for its 13 primary and seven junior high schools.
Japan's leading computer makers are being confronted with a serious
challenge from US companies like Apple to their own dominance in the home
market where they once ruled supreme.
Last year, Apple Computer won a 13.9 per cent share of Japan's personal
computer market, overtaking Fujitsu as the second largest PC vendor in Japan
after NEC, according to Dataquest, industry analysts.
US computer makers as a whole increased their share of the Japanese market
in 1993 to 24 per cent, up from 15 per cent in 1992, Dataquest notes. At the
same time, many Japanese computer makers themselves have started to market
IBM-compatible machines, completely reversing their previous strategy of
selling only their own proprietary systems in Japan.
Last October, Fujitsu, which had previously sold only PCs based on its own
architecture in the home market, began selling IBM-compatible computers.
Earlier this year, Seiko Epson, which had long stuck faithfully to NEC's
standard, also began marketing IBM-compatible machines in Japan for the
first time.
Apple's success in Japan and the growing trend among Japanese computer
makers to come out with IBM-compatible machines, point to a fundamental
change in the Japanese PC market that is forcing the country's computer
makers to confront difficult strategic decisions.
The hitherto protected Japanese market, which allowed Japanese companies to
set the standards and price levels, is becoming more vulnerable to outside
forces as a result of the aggressive entry into the market of US
manufacturers.
To be sure, NEC, the undisputed market leader, was able to maintain a market
share of just under 53 per cent last year despite fierce price pressures.
However, the presence of US makers in Japan has meant that Japanese
companies, including NEC, can no longer set the standards of price and
performance in their own market but must meet the more demanding standards
of the US, where competition has been more cut-throat than in Japan.
The consequence is that Japanese computer makers, which have not been
particularly competitive except in certain areas such as notebooks, have had
their weaknesses exposed in their own home market.
One such weakness has been in terms of cost. Competition from US companies
such as IBM, Compaq and Dell, which launched low-price models into the
Japanese market, has led to the collapse of the high prices which Japanese
computer makers enjoyed at home and has forced Japanese companies to tackle
their high cost structures.
Due to increased competition from US makers, and as familiarity among
Japanese consumers with computers has increased, PCs have increasingly come
to be regarded as commodity items and Japanese consumers have become much
more sensitive to the prices of PCs.
At the same time, Japanese companies have been struggling to continue to
come up with higher value-added products which can compensate for the
falling profitability of mass-volume PCs.
Steps are being taken on both fronts. In order to raise
cost-competitiveness, Japanese computer makers are shifting a greater
proportion of their manufacturing outside of Japan, where the yen's rise and
high labour costs have made manufacturing a relatively expensive activity,
and procuring more parts from low cost overseas sources.
NEC, for example, has launched an aggressive cost-cutting programme and has
introduced models since the beginning of last year with a price-performance
ratio of one-third to half the price-performance ratios of previous models.
The company plans to reduce costs by more than half over the next few years.
As part of its cost-cutting programme, it has this year started importing
motherboards from Taiwan for some of its PCs - a significant move since the
costs of motherboards accounts for a big proportion of the total cost of the
PC.
Companies with less of a presence in the PC market are resorting to OEM
arrangements to procure PCs at lower costs than they would be able to
manufacture them. Hitachi, for example, is buying IBM's PS/V series which it
will sell in Japan under its own brand while Sharp will buy IBM-compatible
machines from Taiwanese and Korean makers to sell under its own brand name
both overseas and in the home market.
But while such cost-cutting measures will have a beneficial effect on their
bottom line, Japanese computer makers also realise that they need to move
aggressively into more value-added products in order to boost profitability.
Here, some of the leading companies such as Toshiba and NEC, have an
advantage in their liquid crystal display operations which have provided
them with a leap over competitors in the notebook market.
Last year, NEC agreed to provide NCR, the US company, with notebook
computers under an OEM deal. NEC is increasing its investment in thin-film
transistor liquid crystal displays which provide the high resolution screens
that have made Japanese notebooks so popular. Other Japanese companies
including Fujitsu and Toshiba are also boosting investment in TFT-LCDs.
Their early investments in LCD are already paying off handsomely as notebook
PCs made by Japanese manufacturers have been highly popular in the buoyant
US market.
Japanese computer makers are also making further leaps into multimedia with
the introduction of PCs capable of displaying still photos, video and CD
sound.
However, as the multimedia industry develops, pulling in more elements of
the audio-visual and broadcasting industries into the world of the computer,
Japan's computer industry faces increasing competition not only from fellow
computer makers in the US, but from Japanese consumer electronics makers as
well.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (4): An embarrassment
of riches - Developments in the banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hilmar Kopper, the forthright chief executive of Deutsche Bank, is
renowned for his plain speaking.
Sometimes, though, he takes this a little too far - as when he dismissed as
'peanuts' the DM50m owed by the collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group to
trade creditors.
The off-the-cuff remark, in the middle of a long press conference on the
bank's role in Germany's biggest property bankruptcy since the second world
war, prompted outrage in the tabloid press and introduced another English
word into everyday use in Germany.
The bank was lead creditor to Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur
who disappeared after writing a letter to a Deutsche Bank board member in
early April.
At the press conference more than two weeks later the bank disclosed that it
stopped lending to Schneider in 1992 and had started to intensify checks
into Schneider's creditworthiness in February this year. But the bank was
satisfied with his answers to their queries and with his payments record and
had no suspicion that Mr Schneider was planning to abscond.
The 'peanuts' observation - for which Mr Kopper later apologised - served to
stir up the hostility of the general public to the big banks, so much so
that polls showed a majority blaming the bank for the collapse of Schneider
with debts of more than DM5bn - not Mr Schneider himself who has disappeared
with several hundred million D-Marks of funds owed to craftsmen and building
suppliers as well as banks.
That hostility has found expression in the success of a second best-selling
book from Mr Gunter Ogger, a business author who has an uncanny knack of
identifying popular issues.
His first book - Nieten in Madelstreifen (Nitwits in Pinstripes) - condemned
Germany's managerial and banking elite for complacency and cosy boardroom
connections.
Before too long, the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the large metals,
mining and industrial group rescued in January - in which Deutsche Bank is a
big shareholder - duly bore out his scathing criticisms.
His second book is called Das Kartell der Kassierer (The Cartel of the
Rip-off Merchants). It condemns Germany's bankers for stripping Germany's
honest burghers of their hard-earned cash.
In vain can heavyweight bankers such as Mr Kopper or Mr Martin Kohlhaussen,
Commerzbank's chief executive, attempt to stem the tide of public opinion by
arguing that German banks preserve jobs by rescuing German companies during
recession - and that the solidity and profitability of the banking system in
general is good for Germany.
The strength of the German banks was illustrated in last year's results from
Deutsche: group operating profits rose by 16 per cent to DM5.3bn.
This was after making provisions for bad and doubtful debts. At Deutsche,
provisions were increased 72 per cent to a massive DM3.3bn last year.
It is in this context that Mr Kopper's 'peanuts' remark must be understood:
the DM50m owed to Schneider's trade creditors is, indeed, immaterial in the
context of the Deutsche Bank's own DM560bn balance sheet and its luxuriantly
healthy profit-and-loss account. The bank's provisioning is substantial
enough to swallow up the bank's unsecured exposure to the Schneider empire
of DM500m, and more besides.
Mr Kopper's public relations gaffe - and that of the bank in being slow to
recognise the wider implications of the debacle from the moment that it was
clear that Mr Schneider had left the country - was in failing to make a
clear distinction between the implications for the bank, and the quite
separate question of the impact on trade suppliers.
That failure has left the bank's more junior employees out in the branch
network facing anger and incomprehension from creditors harassed over much
smaller amounts of money than the DM50m which counts as peanuts.
'But I can assure you that I and my colleagues know the value of DM50m,' Mr
Kopper told disgruntled shareholders at the bank's annual meeting earlier
this month.
Whether the damage to the bank will be lasting, remains to be seen. Three
separate investigations - one by the BAK federal banking authority and two
internal ones - are under way and it is not impossible that heads will roll
as a result.
But despite a sharp fall in the share price in the immediate aftermath of
the affair, most analysts continue to see Deutsche Bank shares as an
attractive investment opportunity and the institution's formidable earnings
power undented by embarrassment over the Schneider affair.
The same is true for Germany's banking sector as a whole. Last year, one
after another reported record profits despite large increases in provisions
for bad and doubtful debts. At Dresdner Bank, profits were up by 24 per cent
to DM2.04bn; at Commerzbank, by 24 per cent to DM1.13bn; Bayerische
Vereinsbank, by 32 per cent to DM1.16bn and Hypo-Bank by 33 per cent to
DM1.04bn.
These figures reflect an extremely favourable constellation of circumstances
 -falling interest rates, booming financial markets, strong demand for
credit - which meant they could defy the deep recession in their home
market.
As bank chief executives acknowledged at this month's round of shareholder
meetings, these circumstances no longer apply - the bund market has, for
example, been in the doldrums throughout much of the early part of the
current year.
Although bank lending, at the core of mainstream banking business, continues
to rise at a double-digit rate and provisions are on the way down, bankers
predict that profits this year may be down from last year's record levels.
Mr Kopper said that group operating profits after provisions were down at
the Deutsche Bank by more than 10 per cent in the first four months of the
current year.
By contrast, Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, said
that profits rose at a pleasing rate over that period, but he warned about
extrapolating the increase for the year as a whole.
As the German economy starts to pull out of recession, it may be that the
worst for the German banks is already over - and the worst constituted the
best year in their history.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (5): Highly innovative
issue - Dresdner Bank has transformed its image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest German bank, is known at home for
being big, profitable and profoundly conservative. In north America, the
bank is not well known at all, concedes Mr Hansgeorg Hofmann, one of the two
board members at the bank in charge of investment banking.
At least, Mr Hofmann contends, the bank was not well known in the north
American financial community until April-May this year when it conducted a
capital-raising transaction which stood the bank's reputation for stodgy
conservatism on its head.
It became the first Germany company or financial institution to launch a
global issue of new shares.
The highly innovative issue was conducted against a difficult market
background. As shares in German banks tumbled amid the fall-out from the
collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property group, and north American capital
markets reeled from interest rate jitters, Dresdner Bank successfully placed
DM1.16bn of fresh equity with international investors.
To support the bank's cash-raising exercise, four board members left their
comfortable fastness in the centre of Frankfurt's banking district, and took
to the road. Together with a team of senior executives, they undertook the
undignifying task of going on a roadshow, conducting a total of 60
presentations to institutional investors in Europe, the US and Asia.
While this sort of thing is bread and butter work for Anglo-American
executives, it is still a new experience for senior German businessmen to
undergo the often humiliating experience of being grilled by pimply
financial analysts who may not have heard of the Dresdner Bank.
'This was pioneering work,' reflected Mr Hofmann. 'In the US we have never
visited institutions or made information available before. We felt that the
response was incredibly positive.'
The new shares, representing 7 per cent of the bank's equity capital, were
placed without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders, although big
shareholders in the bank such as the Allianz insurance group (with a 22.31
per cent stake) did subscribe to the issue.
According to Mr Hofmann, who joined Dresdner in October 1989 after 20 years
in senior positions with US investment banks, the bank has benefited in a
number of concrete ways from the issue:
It managed to raise its profile with international investors, especially in
the US.
At 35 per cent, the percentage of shares owned by foreign investors is far
lower than at rival German financial institutions.
In the US, the bank's shares have traditionally been less popular with
investors than those of smaller German banks such as Commerzbank and
Bayerische Vereinsbank.
It has opened up a source of capital which may reduce the bank's financing
costs over the long-term - especially if demand from the international
investment community leads to a higher rating for Dresdner Bank shares.
The process of putting the issue together within a necessarily short
time-frame forced the bank to act in an entrepreneurial way.
Mr Hofmann says that traditional chains of management command and lengthy
decision-making processes were bypassed in order to get the deal done - a
healthy injection of Anglo-Saxon-style frenzy into the bureaucratic culture
of a traditional German bank.
The successful completion of the issue will have a powerful marketing
effect, giving Dresdner the chance to win lucrative global equity placing
mandates in the future (particularly in conjunction with the forthcoming
privatisations of Deutsche Telekom and Lufthansa).
Dresdner was joint global co-ordinator on the issue with Merrill Lynch - but
Mr Hofmann believes the financial technology associated with the issue is
not proprietory to the US investment banking community.
The bank was able take the offensive on the issue of German accounting.
Fund managers were especially impressed by the arguments deployed by Mr
Andreas Bezold, a former partner in Deloitte &amp; Touche who now heads up
Dresdner's finance deparment.
He denounced US accounting on issues such as marking securities to market
and the disclosure of derivatives risks, providing rare ideological support
for German accounting practices often, Bezold complains, condemned
unthinkingly by the Anglo-American investment community.
The US segment of the issue was placed with institutional investors under
Rule 144A of the US Securities Act. This mechanism allowed the bank to avoid
making the accounting disclosures required when a company seeks a full
listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Dresdner was able to follow this route within narrow time constraints
because shareholders in the bank had some years ago given the bank formal
permission to issue up to 10 per cent of new shares without pre-emptive
rights. This was in the context of the planned share exchange with Banque
Nationale de Paris which has in the meantime become more modest in scope.
Mr Hofmann believes that the Rule 144A placing undertaken by the bank may
prove to be popular with German institutions in preference to obtaining a
full listing.
The German government is intending to introduce legislation allowing
companies to place up to 10 per cent of their shares without offering
pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders.
This move could encourage more German companies to tap the US financial
markets, the biggest source of capital in the world, following the Dresdner
model.
To date, Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, is the only
German group to have sought and obtained a full listing in the US. It came
to the US market last autumn - without an issue of new shares - in a move
which provoked outrage among fellow German companies indignant at the idea
of complying with US accounting requirements.
The total issue of new Dresdner shares was comfortably oversubscribed,
although Mr Hofmann admits that hopes of placing 770,000 American Depository
Receipts in the US were overly-optimistic. But in a week when 24 out of 39
equity issues planned for the US were postponed or cancelled, Mr Hofmann
declares himself delighted with the level of demand for the new Dresdner
shares from north American investors. The follow-up demand from US
institutions who did not originally take up shares has also been high, he
says.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(4): Strategic shift by top companies / The move to client-server technology
is generally acknowledged as one of the key issues for business in the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 40 per cent of top companies anticipate a shift to client-server
computing in the next few years, according to a survey conducted by computer
industry analysts at International data Corporation. Companies view this
change as more important than open systems, outsourcing or facilities
management, the survey claims.
Client-server technology breaks computer systems down into front-end
'client' workstations and back-end 'server' processes.
In most cases, this means client personal computers used to access
centralised, corporate server systems across a network. Attention has, so
far, focused on the 'client' side of client-server systems. The advantages
of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are now widely acknowledged and few
companies would consider building new systems without them.
The server side, however, tends to be hidden from the user and has received
less attention. This is likely to change as the importance of server
computers grows over the next few years.
Part of the reason for the lack of attention to server systems is that many
of them are direct descendants of the previous generation of systems. Many
companies have replaced their 'dumb' terminals with PC workstations - but
have held on to their old mainframe or mini computers to act as server
systems.
While this is not necessarily the most efficient technological approach, it
is certainly more practical given the large investment that many companies
have in their so-called 'legacy' systems.
This could change, however. The economies of scale which once lay in large
systems have been transferred to chip manufacture and a new breed of
special-purpose server computers are beginning to emerge. These servers can
use the same mass-market, commodity chip technology which has brought down
the cost of PCs.
At the same time, traditional mainframe and minicomputer suppliers are
moving their underlying technology in the same direction to gain the same
advantages.
'Evolution is the key word and the transition that is taking place is more
to do with distributed computing than necessarily client-server,' says Mrs
Jolanta Pilecka, client-server programmer manager at Hewlett Packard in the
UK.
'We have to work out what we expect a server system to do and tie it back to
the business need. This means using different types of server to solve
different problems,' she adds. 'At one level, you might need a database
server for departmental use. At a higher level, you need an enterprise-wide
server which has different characteristics.'
Mrs Pilecka sees a future both for traditional servers based on proprietary
computers at the enterprise level and for 'open' servers at the departmental
level. Other established manufacturers agree - 'there are three levels to
client-server systems: the desktop client, the departmental server and the
enterprise server. We are using a range of technologies to meet the demand,'
says Mr Philip Crawford, UK managing director of Bull. 'This includes
everything from Intel's Pentium chip to the proprietary enterprise systems.
What is important is to reduce the cost of ownership of the server
technology for companies and you can do this with all kinds of technology,'
he adds.
Bull is now working on three fronts to produce server technology. It is
using the Intel Pentium chip to build low-level servers. It is devising new
multiple processor technology to improve the price/performance of its
proprietary systems. And it is working with IBM on a joint development touse
the PowerPC risc chip to create a new generation of server systems based on
the Unix operating system.
'We are trying to give our customers the option either to stick with
improved proprietary systems for their foundation applications or to move to
new technologies where it is appropriate,' explains Mr Crawford.
IBM is taking a similar approach - but points out that there are significant
advantages in proprietary server systems based on traditional mainframes -
'the mainframe has some characteristics which are especially suited to the
enterprise environment. Most companies who are looking at real busines
applications have taken an evolutionary path,' says Mr Steve Craggs, CICS
business manager at IBM UK. 'You start by taking the mainframe application
and put a GUI front end on it to deliver productivity to the desktop. You
can then start deploying local servers to act as a gateway to the mainframe
and off-load some of the processing overhead.'
Surprisingly, computer builders with a PC background also agree with this
approach: 'What we are saying to our customers is that client-server is not
all about technology and cutting costs; it's about putting a better
user-interface in front of the user and backing it up with good quality
services,' says Mr Steve Wanless, product marketing manager at Sequent UK,
the multiple-microprocessor systems builder. 'If you have a well-defined
interface between the client and the server, it doesn't matter what the
server is. It can just as easily be a legacy mainframe as a new multiple
processor system. You run the legacy server while it is economic and then
replace it with newer technology.'
Manufacturer's with a PC background do, however, have an advantage over
established mainframe suppliers: they can design their server technology
from scratch without having to worry about existing systems - 'the big
manufacturers have many different interests to reconcile - new frontiers to
explore and old ones to defend. We can design our server technology without
reference to the past,' says Mr James Minotto, marketing director at UK PC
builder, Elonex.
While he accepts that the mainframe server has a strong place in the
enterprise network because of its large capacity and power, Mr Minotto sees
a growing market for servers based on PC technology at the local level - 'of
course, the PC does not have the range of the mainframe, you have the
capability to produce 'state of the art' management information and you can
distribute the power to manipulate data with low-cost servers,' he explains.
One thing is clear: there will be plenty of choice for companies when they
come to select new server technology - whether it comes from the evolution
of mainframes or the new special-purpose servers now being developed by
PC-based manufacturers.

(5): Unfashionable giants / Mainframes, for 30 years regarded as the central
focus of the data processing firmament, are being re-cast as high powered
network servers

<TEXT>
Mainframe computers, large, expensive and energy-hungry are deeply
unfashionable. They are, nevertheless, for a broad range of data processing
tasks, indispensable.
This is the mainframe manufacturers' chief dilemma. Each the suppliers in
this sector - and there is only a handful left - has important customers:
large enterprises, public utilities and the like, for whom mainframes are
essential. Only a mainframe can provide the memory, the raw computing power
and ability to support several thousand users and a multiplicity of tasks.
But the number of such users is unlikely to grow much. Indeed, over the next
decade or so, they will probably contract and with them the aggregate
revenues manufacturers derive from mainframe sales. Overall revenues for
Groupe Bull's UK subsidiary grew 35 per cent last year for example;
mainframe revenues were essentially flat.
All these customers have, however, to be supported. First, because
mainframes remain a powerful source of revenue. Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's
chairman, might argue that the company 'no longer makes a lot of money on
mainframe computers,' but gross margins on large systems, while much reduced
from earlier years, are still appreciable. By comparison, a number of
manufacturers - Groupe Bull is one - have been losing money on their
personal computer operations.
Second, because it is important to keep faith with customers if they are not
to turn to other suppliers for their data processing equipment. All have
critical 'legacy' systems on which their business turns and which would
prove both inconvenient and expensive to rewrite.
Third, because the leopard is changing its spots: mainframes, for 30 years
regarded as the central focus of the data processing firmament, are being
re-cast as high powered network servers, designed to co-operate with other
computers instead of taking charge of the operation.
Mr Philip Crawford, managing director of Bull (UK) says: 'If we can continue
to drive down the cost of ownership while improving quality and
maintainability, there is no reason for users to rush to get off mainframes.
The only proper reason for downsizing is in pursuit of a business strategy,
not fashion.'
Many industry experts believe the move to client-server systems has been
driven more by fashion than by real user need, and that the true cost, per
workstation, of a client-server system is often under-estimated. They
believe that within a few years there could be a backlash against
client-server and Unix based systems which will see mainframes reinstated as
the centre of the data processing hierarchy.
The continued development, however, of mainframe technology is expensive.
Manufacturers are having to trade off investment in mainframes against
funding faster growing parts of the industry. And at the same time, the
price of mainframes is falling fast - at a rate of about 33 per cent last
year - both because the basic technology is becoming cheaper and because
manufacturers have to price their hardware in competition with apparently
cheaper industry-standard systems.
Mr Gerstner at IBM in a striking reversal of past policy has already made it
clear that the mainframe division no longer has first claim on the company's
research and development funds.
For some companies, mainframe ventures have proved a disaster. Digital
Equipment, once the leader in minicomputers, moved into mainframes with its
9000 series. Sales, however, were a fraction of expectations.
A number of alliances have been struck between companies to share costs and
technologies. Earlier this year Amdahl, a US manufacturer of computers that
are plug-compatible with IBM's announced an alliance with Fujitsu of Japan
which holds a minority stake in the US company. It calls for the two
companies to develop jointly the next generation of mainframes based on a
semiconductor technology called CMOS. The agreement is expected to reduce
research and development costs significantly for Amdahl.
ICL in the UK has already benefitted greatly from its technology alliance
with Fujitsu which has given it access to the Japanese company's
semiconductor and component technology at an early stage.
IBM earlier this year agreed to provide Hitachi of Japan - a bitter rival -
with the microprocessors at the heart of its newest systems. These are CMOS
chips that do not need the elaborate liquid cooling systems necessary with
earlier systems.
Earlier this month, NEC, the Japanese manufacturer which supplies Groupe
Bull with mainframe computers said the two companies are discussing
collaboration on the next generation of both mainframe and midrange
computers with the object of reducing the research and development burden
for both companies.
The implementation of CMOS chips in the circuitry of the latest mainframe
computers is significant. CMOS is widely used in personal computers where
its advantages lie in low power consumption and heat dissipation.
Increasingly, mainframe technology is being driven by personal computer
technology.
NCR, the US computer manufacturer taken over two years ago by AT&amp;T, led the
way in 1990 announcing that its entire range would be based on
microprocessors from Intel, the world's leading semiconductor company.
Over the next few years, a number of microprocessors and and processing
architectures are likely to jostle for position as the base technology for
large computer systems. They include Intel's 80/x86 range, IBM and Apple's
PowerPC, Hewlett Packard's PA Risc, and Digital Equipment's Alpha.
The trick will be to develop sound and reliable systems running many of
these chips in parallel. IBM, for example, is taking another crack at the
supercomputer market with a machine announced last month, the SP2, which is
claimed to offer up to 136 billions of floating point operations a second.
It is based on IBM's reduced instruction set computing (risc) chips, first
seen in the RS6000 workstation, running in parallel.
The launch of the SP2 is a big cultural change for IBM. One of its senior
executives once dismissed the significance of client-server computing with
the jibe that if you network together a thousand pocket calculators, it does
not make a mainframe. These days, given a little poetic licence, it does.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(6): New winners emerging / Delays in adjusting to shifts in computer usage
have proved costly for some of the largest system suppliers - US market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial problems of International Business Machines and Digital
Equipment have cast a pall over the US computer industry. Yet while these
two companies are struggling, the market is growing and some of their
competitors' sales are booming.
In particular, Hewlett-Packard has emerged as a new industry leader,
overtaking Digital to become second only to IBM among US companies in
computer revenues, while Compaq Computer goes from strength to strength in
the personal computers sector.
One of the most important factors that is sorting out winners and loosers in
the US computer market is the extent to which companies have adjusted to the
'new computing model,' based on networks of desktop computers, called
clients, linked to 'servers,' a term that covers the broad range of
computers that can be used to provide services on a computer network.
For IBM , with its roots firmly planted in centralised mainframe computing,
this
adjustment is proving difficultand painful - 'the failure to capitalise on
this sea-change in our industry (from centralised 'host' mainframe computer
systems to distributed networks) is the single most important mistake IBM
has made in the last decade,' Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief
executive, said recently.
Announcing plans to recast IBM's entire product line, he said that the
company must 'take all we know about powerful host-based systems and create
new products for the open, distributed world. We should have done it a
decade ago.'
Similarly, Digital Equipment was slow to react to changes in the computer
market, in particular the trend toward 'open systems' standards that make it
easier to link computers from different manufacturers into heterogeneous
client-server networks.
Although Digital was an early leader in distributed computing, its
traditional products were based on proprietary technology. Until the
appointment of Robert Palmer, who replaced company founder Kenneth Olsen as
president and chief executive in October 1992, Digital did not
wholeheartedly adopt the concept of open systems.
'We have finally established credibility in the UNIX (open systems)
marketplace after years of struggle and confusion,' said Mr Palmer said in a
recent address to employees.
These delays at IBM and Digital have proved very costly. Both companies have
recorded heavy losses over the past two years and although IBM has recorded
a small net profit in each of the past two quarters, Digital remains mired
in losses.
In contrast, Hewlett-Packard is reaping the rewards of an early shift to
open systems software and client-server computing. HP 'anticipated well
(the) necessary changes in technology,' says John Jones of Salomon Brothers,
the US broking house.
HP was in the forefront of the shift from proprietary computers to 'open
systems' based on industry standards. The company was the first to implement
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (Risc) technology in mid-range and
mainframe computer systems, providing high performance at lower costs.
HP has also been faster to come to terms with an industry-wide decline in
gross profit margins as computer prices fall. Over the past five years, it
has cut operating expenses from more than 40 per cent of revenues in 1988 to
28 per cent in the first fiscal quarter of 1994 (which ended on January 31).
For fiscal 1993, HP's net revenue rose 24 percent to Dollars 20.3bn,
compared with Dollars 16.4bn in fiscal 1992. Net earnings for the year were
Dollars 1.2bn, an increase of 21 per cent. Yet it would be a mistake to
dismiss HP's biggest competitors as 'has beens.' The remarkable turnaround
staged by Unisys is evidence that large, stumbing computer companies can
make a comeback. After three years of heavy losses, write-offs and layoffs,
Unisys has put its troubles behind it.
The turnaround began at the end of 1991, when Unisys recorded a modest
fourth quarter profit. The company has not looked back since.
Over the past two years Unisys' profits have doubled, to Dollars 565.4m in
1993. Net debts have been reduced from a peak of almost Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 1.1bn at the end of 1993.
'The turnaround is real . . . no management in the computer business has
executed better over the past two years . . .' commented Curt Rohrman of
First Boston in a recent report on the company.
Revenues, however, are still declining. For 1993, the company reported sales
of Dollars 7.7bn, down 23 percent from a 1990 peak of Dollars 10.1bn.
Currently only about 10 to 15 per cent of Unisys' sales are to new
customers. In a bid to boost flagging sales of mainframe computers, Unisys
has moved ahead of competitors in a transition to more cost efficient
semiconductor chips which will be manufactured for Unisys by its long-time
rival IBM.
Unlike traditional mainframes, Unisys' new computer systems will not require
elaborate water-cooling systems. This will make them better suited to
today's networked computer systems, and more cost competitive.
To further offset declining sales, Unisys is now focusing increasingly upon
the services side of the computer business, providing systems integration
and consulting services to its customers.
The contrasting fortunes of the leading US large and mid-range computer
systems companies are mirrored in the personal computer sector where Compaq
Computer is growing rapidly while Apple Computer is struggling to maintain
profitability and IBM's PC operations appear to be faltering after a strong
comeback in 1993.
Compaq Computer reported 'unprecedented demand' for its PC products in 1993
and set a goal of becoming the world PC market leader by 1996, overtaking
IBM and Apple Computer. Compaq's 1993 revenues jumped 75 percent to Dollars
7.2bn. Net income more than doubled to Dollars 462m.
'We feel very much like the market leader,' said Eckhart Pfeiffer, Compaq
president and chief executive. 'We have mapped out our strategy and I
believe that we can get there.'
According to market analysts at International Data Corporation (IDC), Compaq
may achieve its goal even sooner. In terms of unit shipments, Compaq led IBM
and Apple in the first quarter of 1994, according to IDC's preliminary
estimates.
The market research group estimates Compaq's unit shipments in the first
quarter at 970,000, up 40 per cent from the same period last year. Apple
shipped about 845,000 Macintosh PCs in the first quarter, an increase of
eight percent year to year, maintaining its second place position in the
market.
IBM, however, dropped to third place with shipments of about 840,000 PCs
worldwide in the first quarter, up six percent from the same period last
year, but 48 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Compaq has become the model PC company, which competitors aim to emulate.
The secret to Compaq's success, says a senior executive at one of its
competitors, is that the company 'has perfectly interpreted the new style of
computing.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (2): Central bankers
emerge from fog - Developments at the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After almost four post-unification years in the fog, Germany's central
bankers finally have a reasonably clear view of the future for interest
rates.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said so himself in mid-May. In case
nobody noticed, directorate colleague Mr Edgar Meister was to be heard
within hours repeating his boss's lines at a meeting with foreign
journalists. 'In the area of central bank interest rates the horizon is
clear for a more extended period,' he said.
Despite the typically fudgy Buba-speak, the expectations of the market and
the Bundesbank for once appeared to be pretty much in tune. Uttered shortly
after the bank's floor discount rate had just been cut further to 4.5 per
cent - making three reductions since the start of the year - the statements
signalled there was no need for any more action on rates for the time being.
Economists agreed, noting that with seven months of the year still to run,
their forecasts of last January that the discount rate would be down to 4
per cent or less by the year's end appeared to be rock-sure safe bets.
Such harmony is unusual at the best of times. That it should have been
achieved while the Bundesbank's main source of inspiration - the M3 measure
of growth in money supply - was apparently less than useless, makes it all
the more remarkable. For the first four months of this year, M3 expanded at
an annualised rate of three times the bank's mid-range target of 5 per cent.
The bank depends on monetary targeting as an early-warning system against
potential inflation. As a rule, excess M3 growth today spells price growth
tomorrow.
But instead of holding back, Mr Tietmeyer's team has continued the process
of salami-slicing interest rates which started in September 1992 when the
discount rate was 8.75 per cent.
As the bank has said repeatedly in accompaniment to its latest rate cuts:
'special factors' have been at work in the M3 formula, which includes cash
in circulation, current, sight and short-term deposit accounts.
Monetary growth rates were boosted at the start of the year by government
tax inducements which led to a sharp jump in loans for house purchases. Many
of these loans were 'parked' in short-term accounts while buyers waited to
exchange contracts. But the most special factor of all was the introduction
of a 30 per cent at-source tax on investment income which set in motion a
cash carousel. Money which had poured out of the country to avoid the levy
came flooding back in in the latter months of 1993. An estimated DM25bn came
in from Luxembourg alone.
Its arrival coincided with a period of uncertainty about interest rates
which prompted many wait-and-see investors to hold the funds in short-term
accounts, rather than in long-term instruments which are excluded from the
M3 calculation.
But as bank directors have made clear, there is no guarantee that that is
the whole story. As Mr Meister said in May, when his colleagues had had
several months to analyse what was going on, it was still not possible to
separate the special factors from the inflationary potential which might be
stored up in the M3 figures.
In the light of this lack of transparency, the Bundesbank's rate-cutting
actions have been seen in some quarters as foolhardy. Others have suggested,
despite protestations to the contrary, that the bank is preparing to abandon
or relax its controversial dependence on medium-term monetary targeting.
Probably the most charitable judgment is that Mr Tietmeyer, after some six
months into the job as controller of German (and European) monetary policy,
is living up to his earlier reputation as an internationally-minded
pragmatist with a touch more flexibility than was evident in the make-up of
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, his predecessor. Lower German rates have had a
welcome and discernible effect on economic recovery prospects both inside
and outside Germany.
But, as private sector economists point out, there are dangers. According to
Mr Thomas Mayer at Goldman Sachs, the main supporting arguments behind this
year's rate cuts so far were that inflation was slowing with little upward
pressure from either the demand or supply sides, and that the aberrations in
M3 could be justifiably ignored because they were temporary.
Inflation is falling, but the pace is painfully slow, and there have been
some uncomfortable signs. As Mr Mayer pointed out recently, the
three-monthly annualised rate of price rises in April was 3 per cent
compared with 2.5 per cent in March. As evidenced by frequent mentions in
Bundesbank directors' speeches in the early part of this year, this measure
of inflation was much in favour - at least while it was significantly below
the year-on-year rate.
In more recent statements, the Bundesbankers have made plain that they hope
or expect that recent 'corrections' to the interest rate structure will
encourage investors at last to siphon the liquidity currently inflating M3
into long-term capital formation. There seem to be few illusions that this
will be a rapid process.
The central bank also appears to hope that general economic conditions and
the popular mood, tempered by falling real disposable incomes - and despite
lower interest rates - will discourage bank borrowing and further help
reduce M3. If investors and borrowers fail to follow the bank's pointers, if
M3 fails to deflate and continues sending blurred signals, the question
arises of how long Mr Tietmeyer's team can continue ignoring the possibility
that inflationary pressure may be mounting undetected.
The bank, faced with calls to scrap its M3 'plaster saint' and seek guidance
by new means, has responded with clear and repeated rejections. Indeed, it
plans to lobby hard to have monetary targeting adopted by the future
European Central Bank.
Mr Meister, when asked about the prospects for money growth coming back into
line, replied: 'When you have a target, you must make an effort to achieve
it.'
Even though the bank probably favours more rate cuts, even if they require a
longer wait until the view of the horizon improves further, Mr Meister's
remark is a reminder that corrective action cannot be ruled out. However
distant the possibility of a rise in German interest rates may seem at
present, Mr Tietmeyer will need no reminders that his main responsibility is
the Bundesbank's reputation, not his own.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (3): A tightening of
the rules / Regulation will match that in other centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barring last minute complications, the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz -
Financial Markets Promotion Act - will become law on August 1 this year.
The new law fulfils a pledge made by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, at
the beginning of 1992 when he promised to introduce legislation to
strengthen the standing of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial
centre.
The Act, which implements European Union legislation outlawing insider
dealing and promotes a number of 'shareholder-friendly' revisions of
corporate law, will bring Germany into line with the regulatory framework
prevailing in the world's leading financial centres.
'Germany has finally agreed to implement this law in order to create an
environment for banks and other financial institutions which is competitive
and acceptable internationally,' comments Mr Kersten von Schenck, a partner
in Punder, Volhard, Weber &amp; Axster, a leading German law firm.
The law is not without controversy in Germany: for some businessmen it
represents the imposition of an alien, Anglo-American regulatory model on
the Finanzplatz. 'But on the issue of insider dealing for example,' says Mr
von Schenck, 'you can't stand up to majority opinion in world financial
markets - not if you want to be accepted as a major financial services
centre, that is.'
The main provisions of the act are as follows:
Insider dealing becomes a criminal offence, subject to a jail sentence of up
to five years and or a substantial fine. Currently, insider dealing is not a
crime in Germany, although many banks and companies follow a voluntary code
of conduct outlawing the practice of dealing in securities on the basis of
privileged information.
A new Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Dealing will be established,
a German version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The so-called
Bundesaufsichtsamt fur den Wertpapierhandel will be based in Frankfurt and
will be responsible for policing Germany's securities markets in conjunction
with individual stock exchanges and state governments.
New disclosure requirements will be established, under which the threshold
at which stakes in other companies must be disclosed will fall from 25 per
cent to 5 per cent of the voting rights. Share stakes will also have to be
disclosed as they move through successive barriers  - 10, 15 , 25 and 75 per
cent of the voting rights. This implements the EU Transparency Directive and
will do much to improve the lack of disclosure which characterises corporate
stake-building in Germany.
The new act will introduce an amendment to the Stock Corporation Act (the
Aktiengesetz) which will allow companies to reduce the nominal value of
shares from DM50 to DM5. This is designed to reduce the top-heavy share
prices prevalent on the German stock - share prices of DM500 or even DM1,000
are common - which are deemed to put off small investors.
Money-market funds - short-term investment vehicles popular in countries
such as France or the US - will be allowed for the first time. This
provision was introduced into the legislation only in May after the
Bundesbank dropped its opposition to such funds.
Several of the most important measures - for example those banning insider
dealing and introducing new disclosure requirements - do no more than
implement, somewhat belatedly, EU legislation.
But the collective impact of the new piece of legislation, which has
all-party support in the German parliament and seems set to be enacted this
summer despite the distractions of an election year, will be substantial.
It will counteract a series of mini-scandals in Frankfurt which - although
none have been as serious as any one of a crop of important scandals in the
UK or the US in recent years - have done much to tarnish the image of the
Finanzplatz.
These started with an insider dealing probe at Deutsche Bank, Germany's
biggest bank, in the summer of 1992, which led to the sacking of senior
Deutsche personnel for breaches of internal rules. A Frankfurt Stock
Exchange enquiry said there was no evidence of insider dealing but Deutsche
has never disclosed which internal rules were broken.
Last year, Mr Franz Steinkuhler lost his job as head of the IG Metall union
after allegations of insider dealing on shares in a Daimler-Benz holding
company. He was alleged to have profited from information gleaned as a
member of the Daimler-Benz supervisory board.
The 'scandals' of 1992 forced the big banks to put their house in order  -
appointing compliance officials to police new rules. Internal rules were
introduced to ban the practice of front-running - placing personal share
orders before executing a large order on behalf of a client in the hope of
profiting from the share price movement - and to encourage
Anglo-American-style chinese walls between different departments, with the
aim of eliminating conflicts of interest.
Even if insider dealing is no longer prevalent in Germany, as senior
businessmen argue, the new law will send a strong signal to the
international financial community that Germany is serious about promoting
its underdeveloped financial services sector. Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, said last year that one of the reasons why it decided to
make a big commitment to the Frankfurt Finanzplatz was because of the new
legislation.
However it would be wrong to expect the new law to transform the German
financial services landscape overnight. As is often the case in Germany,
change will be slow and the new securities and exchange commission will not
be up and running until well into next year. Important pieces of financial
legislation are not included at all - for example regulations on takeovers .
The biggest danger is that the new legislation proves too cumbrous - the
three-tiered structure for regulating the securities industry, for example,
looks extremely complicated, the product of political compromises rather
than an ideal solution.
But the new legislation will improve the image of Germany as a financial
services centre, with tangible benefits for German companies and banks. It
will help German companies raise funds more easily with international
investors. The German securities and exchange commission will be able to
represent the interests of the German securities industry at conferences of
international regulators. Hitherto, German interests have been represented
by government officials or not at all.
In the absence of a German securities and exchange commission, it has also
been difficult for the Deutsche Terminborse, the German screen-based
derivatives market, to obtain recognition for its products outside Germany.
With the new body, this will change.

raging in the computer industry as Intel, the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturer, defends its market dominance in microprocessor chips against a
hoard of challengers
</HEADLINE>

Microprocessor technology has brought profound changes to the computer
industry, starting with personal computers (PCs) in the 1980s and working
its way up to the most powerful mainframe and supercomputers many of which
are now built around microprocessor chips.
As the inventor of the microprocessor and by far the largest manufacturer of
these devices, Intel has reaped most of the benefits of this trend. The
company earned a record Dollars 2.3bn last year, up from Dollars 1.07bn in
1992. Revenues grew by 50 percent to Dollars 8.78bn.
Strong demand for PCs is driving Intel's growth. However, the company is
facing intensifying competition both from companies that aim to 'clone'
Intel microprocessors and from others that hope to establish new designs as
the next industry standard.
The most immediate challenge to Intel comes from Advanced Micro Devices, a
Silicon valley neighbour and former ally that has developed clones of
several Intel microprocessors.
Intel and AMD have been battling in the courts over intellectual property
rights for almost a decade. Although some legal matters have yet to be
resolved, AMD has recently gained the upper hand. Meanwhile, AMD is
expanding its production of its 486 microprocessors, which match the
functions of some of Intel's top-selling chips.
AMD said recently that it plans to ship more than 900,000 486
microprocessors in the current quarter, up from 350,000 in the previous
quarter, and is aiming for a 25 per cent share of the world market for PC
microprocessors.
In a significant blow to Intel, Compaq Computer, the second largest PC
manufacturer after IBM, recently announced that it will buy, for the first
time, some of its microprocessor chips from AMD instead of Intel. The shift
represents a strong endorsement for AMD that could influence other PC
manufacturers.
Cyrix, another US chip company with ambitions in the Intel-compatible
microprocessor market, is also expected to increase its sales as a result of
a recent manufacturing agreement with International Business Machines.
IBM will manufacture Cyrix's equivalent of Intel's 486 and Pentium
microprocessors in 'non-trivial quantities,' the companies said recently. As
well as supplying these chips to Cyrix, under the five-year deal IBM will
also sell about half of the chips, either to its own PC operations or to
outside customers.
The agreement with IBM will significantly expand Cyrix's opportunity to
participate in the microprocessor market, said Mr Jerry Rogers, president
and chief executive of Cyrix. At present, Cyrix holds approximately three
per cent of the PC microprocessor market, compared with Intel's dominant
share of at least 80 percent. This arrangement has bruised Intel's
long-standing relationship with IBM. The companies have been technology
partners ever since IBM chose an Intel microprocessor for the first IBM PC,
thus establishing Intel technology as the standard for the PC industry.
A new entrant into the Intel-compatible microprocessor field is United
Microelectronics, a Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer. The UMC chip,
introduced this month, is a relatively slow version of a 486 microprocessor
suitable for low-end PCs. UMC said that it expects sales of its new chip to
reach NTDollars 800m this year and NTDollars 2bn next year. The primary
target of UMC's efforts is Taiwan's large PC 'motherboard' industry. Dozens
of Taiwanese companies produce the main circuit boards that go inside PCs
for US and European computer companies.
Anticipating legal challenges from Intel, UMC said that it has filed
pre-emptive actions in Taiwan and France to challenge the validity of one of
Intel's key microprocessor patents.
None of Intel's competitors can, however, come close to matching its
resources. This year, for example, Intel is planning to spend Dollars 2.4bn
(Pounds 1.60bn) on new production plants and equipment and an additional
Dollars 1.9bn on research and development.
These investments will enable Intel to deliver new generations of
microprocessor chips that are smaller, faster, more energy-efficient and
less expensive to produce than those manufactured using today's
technologies, said Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executives.
In the longer term, however, Intel's most formidable challenges may come
from alternative Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor
designs. Apple Computer's recent introduction of Power Macintosh PC, for
example, represents the entry of a new microprocessor architecture into the
desktop computer arena. IBM is expected to follow, later this year, with a
new generation of PCs based on the same 'PowerPC' chips.
PowerPC was developed collaboratively by Apple, IBM and Motorola, the second
largest US semiconductor manufacturer after Intel. Together, IBM and Apple
aim to establish a 30 per cent share of the PC market for PowerPC by the end
of the decade.
PowerPC has a RISC architecture. Theoretically, this suggests that it may be
faster than Intel's microprocessors. However, PowerPC lacks the critical
base of application software that is available for standard PCs, based on
Intel microprocessors - and the PowerPC performance in commercial systems
has yet to be proven.
Another significant contender in the microprocessor race is Digital
Equipment's Alpha. Another RISC design, it is widely regarded as fastest
commercially available microprocessor technology.
Digital has introduced several products, including a powerful desktop
computer, based on Alpha chips. The company says that demand for these
products has been very strong, with sales increasing by 66 percent in the
latest quarter.
However, Digital has so far had limited success in winning support for Alpha
from other computer manufacturers. Broad support, both from computer and
semiconductor companies is an essential element of establishing a new
microprocessor standard.
Sun Microsystems has, for example, licensed several chip makers to produce
its Sparc microprocessors and recently reached an agreement to collaborate
in development of new, faster versions of the chip with Fujitsu of Japan.
The companies together plan to invest more than Dollars 500m over the next
five years on the design and development of new Sparc microprocessors and
related technologies.
Among the non-Intel microprocessor architectures, Sun's Sparc has achieved
the greatest market penetration to date.
Another contender in the microprocessor race is Hewlett- Packard's PA/RISC,
the technology at the heart of all of HP's computer products (except PCs).
HP now offers PA/RISC computers ranging from Dollars 4,000 desktop machines
to mainframe-performance systems.
In March, HP announced the latest version of PA/RISC with features
specifically geared to handle video and multimedia applications, which
typically require more processing power.
With competitors nipping at its heels, Intel is accelerating the pace of its
microprocessor technology development. The company recently slashed the
prices of its latest Pentium microprocessors and introduced new versions
that outperform the PowerPC chips used by Apple.
The strong momentum behind Intel's microprocessor technology will make it
difficult for any competitor to overtake the industry leader. However, it is
unlikely that Intel will be able to maintain its almost exclusive hold on
the PC microprocessor market for much longer.

for three years, wafer-thin margins and shortening product cycles continue
to take their toll on suppliers

Over the past 18 months there has been a pronounced resurgence in sales by
the large brand name manufacturers in the Dollars 66bn-a-year world personal
computer market, reversing the trend towards the cut-price 'clone'
manufactures apparent since the late 1980s.
The top five PC manufactures all increased their market shares last year in
terms of worldwide shipments, according to figures from Dataquest, the
market research company.
In western Europe, shipments by the top nine manufacturers increased by 7.3
percentage points to 54.4 per cent of the total market, in volume terms.
'There has been a marked swing back to the major manufacturers,' says Mr
Chris Fell, director of Dataquest's European PC group. Although
circumstances vary somewhat by country - for example, Vobis remains the top
PC vendor in Germany - in general terms IBM, Compaq, Apple and
Hewlett-Packard, are 'doing well across the board,' he says.
Compaq in particular has achieved a dramatic turnaround achieving the
industry's largest market share growth last year. The US computer group
whose fortunes looked decidedly jaded just a few years ago, reported a 75
per cent increase in sales last year to Dollars 7.2bn. Worldwide unit
shipments reached 3.1m, an increase of 98 per cent over 1992.
Mr Fell attributes the recent advances made by Compaq and the other large PC
manufacturers to several main factors.
First he says, 'they never used to be competitive on price - now they are.'
After watching as aggressive clone manufacturers grabbed market share during
the late 1980s and early 1990s by building PCs using commodity components
mostly imported from south-east Asia and the Far East and selling them off
the pages of computer magazines, the big brand PC manufacturers, led by IBM,
Compaq, ICL and Olivetti in Europe have finally hit back with 'clone-buster'
machines of their own.
'If price is equal, these guys will win,' says Mr Fell because of the
support and service they also provide. 'People may be willing to pay a small
premium for service.'
Although Chris Fell believes there will always be a place for the true
cut-price 'no-name' assembler/manufacturer, he says many of the 'second
tier' clone manufacturers have been hard hit by the more aggressive pricing
of the majors.
Second, Mr Fell argues the advent of the local area network - particularly
client-server networks - has placed a premium on PC networking compatibility
and on support and service. According to Dataquest, about 45 per cent of PCs
were connected in networks last year, but this percentage is forecast to
rise to 55 per cent this year and 77 per cent by 1997.
Meanwhile, customer buying habits for desktop computers have also moved back
towards established indirect distribution channels. Companies such as Dell
and Gateway pioneered direct telephone sales in the US and then the UK in
the late 1980s, forcing other PC manufacturers to follow suit or risk losing
market share.
However, in some markets including most of continental Europedirect
telephone/fax sales never took off - and even in the UK the indications are
that they have peaked at around 32 per cent of the market - 'direct sales
are at best holding their own,' says Mr Fell, and the trend back towards
indirect distribution channels - including PC superstores in some markets
such as the US and the UK - is clear. Within the indirect sector, retail
sales have grown from 14 per cent in 1991 to 20 per cent in 1993.
According to Marketline, another research organisation, the average price of
a PC in the UK dropped by 16.8 per cent between 1991 and 1993.
But although prices are expected to continue to fall, Marketline says the
trend is limited - 'what is perhaps more important is that the specification
of the models available is constantly rising so that entry-level computers
of 1993 offered features which were only available on top-level machines in
1990.'
Slim profit margins and shortening product cycles continue to take their
toll - on both sides of the Atlantic there has been a steady stream of
casualties. Even so, PC volumes are such that no serious contender in the
data processing industry can afford to ignore the PC market.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (1): Frankfurt's role
consolidated - Many foreign institutions have boosted their Frankfurt
operations. Meanwhile, pressure for reform of the financial system is
mounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's decision to site the future European Central Bank in Frankfurt
consolidated the city's position as one of Europe's leading financial
centres.
Despite this decision, few German bankers would dare suggest today that the
Frankfurt Finanzplatz will grow in stature to the point where it will become
the financial centre for Europe, knocking London off the pedestal which it
has traditionally occupied.
'It isn't really a question of eclipsing London,' commented Mr Herbert
Jacobi, chief executive of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt, the Dusseldorf-based bank
owned by Midland Bank of the UK. 'In the long term, the likelihood is that
we will have two strong financial centres for Europe.'
Even this prognosis would have sounded hopelessly optimistic a few years ago
when the German financial markets were renowned for being small,
overregulated and hostile to innovation. 'New ideas would travel their way
slowly from Wall Street to the city of London and then across to Amsterdam
and Luxembourg before they would finally filter into the German market,'
observes one banker.
Relative to Germany's standing as Europe's leading industrial power, the
country's financial system seemed unsophisticated and underdeveloped.
Outsiders gleaned the impression that the big commercial banks, which
dominate the German financial markets, were content to leave it this way.
The strength of the D-Mark and of the economy were matched by a robust
banking sector, quashing any latent calls for reform.
'But there is a growing awareness that if the German financial system wants
to become a major player in world markets - to compete effectively in debt
and equity markets - it has to adopt international standards on a variety of
issues, ranging from rules on insider trading to increased transparency for
shareholders,' said the chief executive of the Frankfurt arm of a US
investment bank.
'Up until recently I got the distict impression that these sort of things
were not taken at all seriously in Germany.'
The pressure for reform of the Finanzplatz - embracing the regulatory
environment, the structure of the financial markets as well as relations
between company management and shareholders - has come from a number of
different directions. The factors include:
The shock induced by the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the
Frankfurt-based industrial group which came to the brink of bankruptcy in
January, has been amplified by the failure of the Jurgen Schneider property
group in April this year.
In both cases the companies had close relationships with Deutsche Bank,
Germany's biggest bank. While the Schneider case raised questions about
Deutsche's lending procedures, the Metallgesellschaft debacle raised
questions about the system of 'corporate governance' prevailing in Germany.
Metallgesellschaft is owned by some of the most reputable companies in
Germany, including Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, the Allianz insurance group
and Daimler-Benz. Their representatives sat on Metallgesellschaft's
supervisory board, formally entrusted with the supervision of management,
but they signally failed to see the crisis coming.
While German bankers say that what happened at Metallgesellschaft pales into
insignicance compared to abundant scandals in the UK and the US since the
late 1980s, the affair raised questions about Germany's two-tier board
system and the cross-holdings between big German companies, provoking calls
for greater transparency in company affairs in order to protect the
interests of shareholders at large.
A second factor is the German recession combined with the costs of
reunifying eastern and western Germany. The government is running a large
budget deficit which it intends to eliminate in part via privatisations.
Bonn officials recognise that steps must be taken to improve German
financial markets in order to ensure that the coming sale of stakes in
Lufthansa and Deutsche Telekom can be effected smoothly and at the best
price.
Germany's equity markets are underdeveloped by international standards: only
6 per cent of German households own shares, compared to more than 20 per
cent in the UK and the US. The market capitalisation of German shares
equated to about 30 per cent of Germany's GNP at the end of last year,
compared to more than 60 per cent in the US and Japan and more than 100 per
cent in the UK. There are only 665 listed companies in Germany, compared to
more than 2000 in the UK alone. In Germany there have been approximately 200
new issues in the past decade, compared to 180 in the UK last year alone.
Germany is now a net importer of capital, rather than an exporter. It
imported DM186.5bn of long-term funds last year. As yet, this has had little
direct impact on the corporate sector, where companies are relatively liquid
and deferring important investment decisions until the upturn in Germany is
established.
But German companies will have to turn to foreign investors for finance when
the upturn is under way, forcing them to adapt themselves to the needs of
fund managers in the US, the UK and Asia, who will demand greater financial
information than German corporates are ready to disclose. The clearest
example of what is likely to develop into a trend is Daimler-Benz's move to
obtain a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange last autumn, a
precursor to a big rights issue scheduled for later this year.
International investors already exert growing influence as owners of German
shares. In 1990 - the last time the Bundesbank prepared statistics - they
owned 14 per cent of the market. This is almost half the 'free-float' in the
shares of Germany's tightly held quoted companies.
International competition in the securities markets. London's
telephone-based Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System succeeded in
gaining significant market share in the turnover of leading German equities.
Data on this is imprecise, but Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of the
Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, said recently that London had a
10 per cent share of trading in Germany's leading shares - a market share
which Seifert denounced as 10 per cent too much.
Competition is nakedly evident in the battle between the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), London's futures and
options exchange, and the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's screen-based
equivalent.
The DTB was set up in 1990 directly to counter the threat that Liffe would
drag business in German government securities and related derivatives
products to London. Liffe still dominates the market for the key Bund future
contract with a 70 per cent market share but the DTB has challenged Liffe on
other D-Mark products.
In equities, Germany has become conscious that its international competitive
position could be threatened by the fragmentation of liquidity between seven
separate stock exchanges. The creation of the Deutsche Borse last year was
designed to pool investment and technological resources between the
exchanges.
The government has responded to the above pressures for reform by promoting
the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz, Financial Markets Promotion Act.
This will make insider dealing a criminal offence and introduce a new
regulatory framework for the German securities industry.
For its part, the Bundesbank has gradually relaxed its opposition to
financial liberation. For example, it allowed the DTB to come into being and
more recently it has reduced its minimum reserves requirements - obliging
banks to lodge interest-free deposits with the central bank - and relented
after years of opposition to money market funds.
These measures alone do not make a Finanzplatz: critics argue that the
hierarchical structure of the big German banks hinders financial innovation.
Moreover, Frankfurt, however convenient a place to live, does not have quite
the same draw for international financial executives as London or New York.
But the backwardness of the German financial markets in comparison to the
size of the economy represents a powerful business argument for being in
'Mainhattan'.
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Kleinwort Benson, Mees Pierson
and Caisse des Depots are among the many foreign institutions which recently
boosted, or have recently announced plans to boost their Frankfurt
operations.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop
(1): A business shaken to the core / Advances in personal computing and the
emergence of multimedia are leading to surprising alliances within the
computing and telecommunications industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recessionary storms of the past three years have served both to
camouflage and to exacerbate the effects of the profound structural changes
which continue to shake the global computer business.
As they abate, it is now clear that the explosive growth of microprocessor
and data communications technology has effectively brought about the death
of the traditional industry.
The remarkable change of fortunes at Compaq of the US, now challenging IBM
for the number one position in personal computers, exemplifies the
phenomenon. Three years ago it led the market for high performance,
high-priced PCs, but found its lead being undermined by Asian 'clones.' It
re-organised, re-engineered its products and cut prices, resulting in a
demand it has taken months to satisfy - 'we have the best understanding of
the market and the best strategy,' says Mr Ben Rosen, Compaq chairman. IBM
has had to slash its own prices to stay in contention.
The causes and extent of the microprocessor revolution were not, however,
immediately obvious which perhaps explains why so many companies delayed
taking action until the last minute.
Mr James Unruh, president and chief executive of the full-line manufacturer
Unisys, now back in profit after several years of red ink, explained the
dilemma: 'Everybody was still calling it a problem of the economic cycle,
but I was not satisfied by that. We went back to ground zero and the first
thing we concluded was that the business had changed in very fundamental
ways.'
A combination of downsizing, replacing the mainframe with a cheaper machine
of equivalent power - open or industry standard systems and client/server
computing - have together knocked the stuffing out of the high revenue, high
gross profit margin mainframe business. The change has encouraged some
unlikely alliances. IBM, for example, is manufacturing processor chips for
Unisys and selling its own proprietary designs to the Japanese electronics
group Hitachi, once a deadly rival.
It has also collaborated with Apple, the personal computer maker and
Motorola, a leading semiconductor manufacturer, to develop a common family
of processor chips - Power PC - intended to challenge Intel's dominance of
the world microprocessor market.
Three broad trends are now apparent. The single most important new
development over the past year has been the emergence of multimedia as a
serious commercial proposition. Multimedia means the delivery of information
of all kinds - video images, data processing, sound and text - to the home
and office in digital form. Once translated into bits and bytes, the various
kinds of information can be processed, merged and altered. The service can
also be interactive. Multimedia promises a broad range of both new business,
information and entertainment services.
It will also require the collaboration of three industries - the computer
industry for the processing, the telecommunications industry to provide the
channels into office and home and the information and entertainments
industries to provide the content.
The returns on the substantial investment required, while so far impossible
to calculate, could be great which explains why so many companies are
staking noisy claims for part of the multimedia pie. Microsoft, the world's
largest software company, and Oracle, the database specialist, for example,
have been trading insults over the best approach to 'video-on-demand,' the
most obvious first candidate for multimedia in the home.
Second, it is clear that the older, established companies - International
Business Machines, Unisys and Digital Equipment among them - have lost the
initiative in data processing and are unlikely to influence the future
direction of the business to their former extent.
For the most part, they are still shedding staff - IBM will have got rid of
more than 150,000 jobs since 1990 by the year end - and coming to terms with
the impact of the new technology. So, too, are their customers. Mr Louis
Gerstener, after a year at the top of the troubled IBM, told securities
analysts: 'Customers have become very sceptical of the constant flood of new
information technology. Customers are saying: 'Give us technology we can
manage, that is easy to use, that evolves at a reasonable pace and, most of
all, helps us achieve measureable competitive advantage.''
This explains to a large degree the new enthusiasm for 'outsourcing' where a
company entrusts its data processing activities to a third party which
guarantees to provide, for a fee, an agreed level of service. In many cases,
the outsourcing company takes on ownership of the client's computers and
computer staff.
Companies such as Electronic Data Systems of the US, the world's largest
software and services company, or Hoskyns, a part of the CGS group, in the
UK have been in the outsourcing business for more than 20 years. Among EDS's
recent outsourcing clients are Chausson in France, a joint subsidiary of
Renault and Peugeot, and Heineken in The Netherlands.
On the one hand, outsourcing might seem the perfect solution for a company
keen to concentrate on its core competences and anxious to remove the burden
of managing its own data processing operations.
On the other, outsourcing is itself a complex exercise in management and
already there are signs that companies which rushed eagerly into outsourcing
deals are having second thoughts.
The chief difficulty is the terms of the contract. Business Intelligence, a
UK based consultancy investigated outsourcing deals at 30 large European
organisations. It warns, in summary that 'many companies have been tempted
by these perceived advantages into poorly thought-out outsourcing
contracts.' It emphasises 'the caution required in negotiating with tough,
experienced outsourcing providers in order to achieve the intended business
objectives.'
The prospects for the older companies remain mixed. IBM, three times the
size of its closest rival, has been the most spectacular victim of the
changes. After three years of restructuring, the first sign of recovery was
seen in the first quarter of the year when it made a profit of Dollars 392m
compared with a Dollars 399m loss for the same period last year. Wall Street
analysts were mildly encouraged that the computer giant might at last be
seeing light at the end of the tunnel, although as Mr Gerstener pointed out:
'No IBM margins are ever going to return to the levels we used to have . . .
we do not have as part of our game plan to create a dominant position built
on high prices relative to costs.'
For Digital Equipment, the minicomputer pioneer once second only to IBM
among global computer companies, the gloom seems to be intensifying. Mr
Robert Palmer, its beleagured chief executive warned that the company's
future was at risk unless it could swiftly achieve a competitive cost
structure. The implication was that staff levels had to fall to about 65,000
compared with 85,000 at present.
A third important trend is the jockeying for position among the leaders of
the new industry - Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Apple and Novell. Intel is
being challenged not only by IBM in collaboration with Apple and Motorola,
but by companies making functional copies of its own designs.
Microsoft, the dominant force in operating systems for single user computers
for more than a decade, is finding it less easy to establish its new,
networked system 'Windows NT' in the large organisations for which it was
designed. Novell, the market leader in networking systems, bought
WordPerfect, a maker of wordprocessing software, to flesh out its product
line and more effectively compete with Microsoft.
None of this makes life any easier for customers who now find their
uncertainties over technology compounded by uncertainty over industry
leadership. The vaccum left by IBM's 30-year domination of the business will
not easily be filled.

FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada slightly easier in search for
direction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Toronto stocks finished a lethargic session slightly lower after the market
had searched in vain for direction.
The TSE 300 composite index slipped 8.2 to 4,320.7 and declining issues
outscored advances by 353 to 283. Volume dropped to a mere 26.1m shares from
Friday's 60.9m and trading value was down to CDollars 209.8m from CDollars
636.7m, reflecting the holiday closures of the US and UK markets yesterday.
Inco, off CDollars 1 1/8 at CDollars 35 5/8 , said the company and the union
representing its hourly-paid Ontario employees have reached a tentative
agreement for a new three-year contract.
Aber Resources jumped CDollars 2, or 37 per cent, to CDollars 7 3/8 as it
reported good initial results from a diamond discovery in the arctic.

FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Athens stays volatile after last week's
two-year low - The battle to avoid devaluing the drachma is giving Greek
equities a hard time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's long drawn-out battle to avoid devaluing the drachma drove the
Athens stock exchange to a two-year low last week.
The index dropped 5.5 per cent to 806.73 on Wednesday as local institutional
investors liquidated holdings in order to buy 'repos' - fixed-term,
repurchase agreement instruments - at interest rates approaching 100 per
cent.
By Friday it had recovered to 855.4, following indications that the
government intends to permit a faster depreciation of the drachma over the
next few weeks. But yesterday it fell 10.10 points to 845.33.
Mr Yannis Tegopoulos, chief analyst at Midland-Pantelakis Securities, says:
'The market is going to stay volatile so long as the drachma crisis
persists.'
Last week's flight into 'repos' could be followed by another into government
bonds. New issues of Ecu and US dollar linked bonds next week will carry
higher interest rates, and a one-month Treasury bill may be issued at around
25 per cent. Brokers said there was heavy selling of stocks by mutual funds
last week as investors rushed to reedeem their holdings in order to buy
'repos' or the new bond issues.
The hardest hit were the newly listed construction stocks, with several now
trading below their issue price. Few big government contracts have been
awarded in recent weeks and fears are growing that budget problems may
result in spending curbs on public investment.
In dramatic contrast to the oversubscriptions of recent months, the
underwriters of a Dr1.2bn offering by Ergas, a construction company
specialising in Middle East projects, were left holding 36 per cent of the
issue.
It remains to be seen whether listings by several more construction
companies, already approved by the bourse, will be postponed.
On the other hand, the prospect of a devaluation of the drachma has boosted
demand for export-led companies such as cement and textile producers. Greek
textile manufacturers, who use locally grown cotton, are forecasting
much-improved profits this year following a rise in international cotton
prices in 1994.
Even if the government's efforts to defend the drachma by raising interest
rates to record levels succeed in staving off devaluation in the short term,
the outlook for the Greek currency still appears uncertain.
Analysts are concerned over the Finance Ministry's apparent unwillingness to
intro-duce new fiscal measures to bring the budget deficit under control.
The cost of interbank lending is being passed on to customers: Greek
companies must cope with a sharp rise in interest rates on working capital,
from 25 per cent to more than 40 per cent.
Mr Dimitris Verriopoulos of Alpha Brokerage says: 'The market is waiting to
see a fiscal package introduced that tackles the underlying economic
problems. Until that happens, confidence cannot be restored.'
The bourse had already discounted the government's decision - announced last
week - that 25 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly, would be
floated on the Athens bourse this year, he says.
The flotation, due to take place in October, is expected to raise Dr250bn,
with half the offering to be placed with institutional investors abroad. In
the meantime, the government is examining ways of speeding up partial
privatisations of other public utilities, such as the state oil and gas
corporation, in the hope of raising additional revenues this year.

FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses hold steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market holidays in London and New York kept volume low yesterday, and
exaggerated some share price movements, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's fall of 22.84 to 2,118.15 in the Dax index over the official
session obscured the fact that it was mostly higher, and at times a good
deal above the 2,112.80 level at which it closed in the post-bourse last
Friday.
It hit 2,133 during the session and, Ibis indicated, recovered again to
2,129.76 yesterday afternoon. Dealers said the trend was of limited
relevance as turnover slid from DM7.3bn to DM5.1bn.
Carmakers and most engineers and steels were weak, but Preussag recovered
DM6.50 to DM466 in the post-bourse on higher first-half profits, supporting
Commerzbank's earnings projections of DM14.50 for 1993, rising to DM21 this
year and DM29 in 1995.
ZURICH extended Friday's gains, with buying, mainly in financials, led by
domestic institutions. The SMI index finished 31.00, or 1.1 per cent, up at
a session high of 2,742.90.
Some analysts felt that the market's positive start was a good omen for the
week and, barring any significant downturn in the US, expected the trend to
continue, helped along by last week's encouraging inflation data.
Strength was seen in Roche and UBS, the former up SFr110 at SFr6,720 and the
latter gaining SFr29 at SFr1,199.
PARIS found little reason to change direction one way or the other and,
having managed a modest gain in the morning's session, eased back gently
later on. The CAC-40 index ended the session up 1.84 at 2,052.51 in turnover
of just FFr1.7bn.
Investors took another look at Schneider, which had dipped 5.6 per cent on
Friday on news that Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the chairman, had been
arrested and jailed in Belgium pending a court appearance tomorrow. The
shares rallied FFr9.90, or 2 per cent, to FFr399.90.
Total, which reported that 1994 first-half 1994 operating profit would be
similar to that seen in the same 1993 period, rose FFr2 to FFr314.
Eurotunnel was the most active stock, moving up FFr1.60 to FFr32.85 as
traders covered short positions.
MILAN saw advances in the construction sector following the government's
announcement late on Friday of a package of measures aimed at encouraging
new building projects. Incorporating a rise in Fiat, the Comit index was
4.81 higher at 735.50.
Among the construction stocks, Italmobiliare put on L300 at L44,900,
Italcementi L320 at L16,400 and Cogefar L60 at L2,500.
Fiat added L130 at L6,785 on expectations that the new administration will
also introduce plans in the near future to stimulate the vehicle sector.
Fondiaria declined L320 to L14,480 after the insurer reported a 1993 loss of
L465bn.
STOCKHOLM slipped back on a rise in bond yields, a 1.5 per cent fall in
banks and a 2 per cent decline in the construction sector. The Affarsvarlden
general index shed 13.0 to 1,506.1. Turnover amounted to SKr989m.
Volvo 'B' was the day's most active issue, closing SKr6 down at SKr734,
while Astra 'B' eased SKr3 to SKr168 as profits were taken following last
week's SKr15 gain.
AMSTERDAM's Aex index firmed 0.79 to 402.42. KLM and ING, both due to report
earnings later in the week, were sought, the former rising 40 cents to Fl
52.20 and the latter unchanged at Fl 76.00.

FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul drops 6.9% on bonds

<TEXT>
Turkish equities remained under pressure from the bond market on news of
another forthcoming treasury bill auction. The composite index fell
1,087.75, or 6.9 per cent, to 14,737.37, with most shares finishing limit
down.
Among the actives, Eregli weakened TL300 to TL4,050 as overall turnover
remained static at TL894.6bn.
Tel Aviv lost some of its gains on profit-taking after two sessions of
rising share prices.
The Mishtanim index closed 4.52, or 2.3 per cent, down at 194.82 following
an advance of 3.5 per cent on Sunday, when dealers were already becoming
pessimistic again.
Traders said that portfolio managers, anxious to realise profits in a
nervous market, dumped shares selectively.

FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei sets another
year's high
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong foreign buying of heavy industrial shares lifted equities to another
new high for the year, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average gained a net 61.81 at 20,838.97, having hit a high
for the day of 20,932.19 after a strong opening. Selling by domestic
institutions through much of the day was absorbed and overwhelmed by heavy
buying by overseas investors and securities dealers, but the index
registered a low of 20,817.16 in the process.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 7.57 at 1,678.33. Rises
led falls by 585 to 432, with 166 issues unchanged. Some arbitrageurs
unwound Topix-linked positions, thereby dampening the market's upward
momentum. The Nikkei 300 put on 1.43 at 307.18.
Volume was high for a Monday, reaching an estimated 600m shares on all first
section stocks, against Friday's 523m.
However, many traders viewed the recent market gains with caution, citing a
weight of sell orders overhanging the market at the 21,000 level.
Shipbuilders gained from speculation that China's economic growth and
increasing demand for foreign oil would spur demand for oil tankers.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y19 to Y768 and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries Y32 to Y475.
Electrical and communications stocks performed strongly and Hitachi moved
ahead Y20 to Y1,070 and Toshiba Y17 to Y838.
Fuji Photo climbed Y110 to Y2,310 after the company said it had started
clinical tests in the US of a chemical compound that could help develop an
anti-cancer drug.
In Osaka, the OSE average reached 23,058.32, a gain on the day of 177.13.
Volume amounted to 35.9m shares, well ahead of Friday's 26.8m.
Roundup
The region's markets put in varying performances yesterday. Pakistan was
closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG retreated from a midsession high of 9,577.67 as profit-taking took
hold, but the Hang Seng index nevertheless ended the day up 53.50 at
9,523.63. Turnover dropped to HKDollars 3.4bn, well short of Friday's
HKDollars 5.7bn.
Equities were also pressured by futures, with the Hang Seng May index
futures down 40 at 9,490 and the June contract off 55 at 9,505.
China H shares were popular after their recent underperformance: Tsingtao
advanced 20 cents to HKDollars 7.05, Shanghai Petro 2.50 cents to HKDollars
2.15 and Guangzhou Shipyard 7.50 cents to HKDollars 2.925.
TAIPEI recovered most of Friday's losses on a strong performance from the
electronics sector. The weighted index moved forward 62.80, or 1.1 per cent,
to 5,934.50 in turnover of TDollars 48.2bn.
United Microelectronics and Tatung, an electrical appliance maker, both rose
by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 102.50 and TDollars 67
respectively.
SINGAPORE eased as the banking sector was affected by fears of a further
tightening in US monetary policy. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
18.06 at 2,305.89, while volume was a low 66.4m shares.
Singapore Airlines foreign stock went against the trend, rising 30 cents to
SDollars 13.30.
MANILA saw foreign buying of Manila Electric, up 6 per cent, and San Miguel,
4 per cent higher, together with expectations of strong first-quarter GDP
figures to be released soon. The composite index added 44.39 at 2,951.39.
BOMBAY was moderately firmer on selective buying but volume remained low.
The BSE 30-share index closed 36.39 up at 3,824.90.
Some brokers commented that large institutions remained inactive because of
the continuing ban by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on badla,
or the carry forward system of trading.
SYDNEY fell back as sentiment was undermined by slightly worse than expected
current account data. The All Ordinaries index dipped 10.4 to 2,091.8 in
thin turnover of ADollars 263m. Among active stocks, the building materials
and sugar group CSR, which reported earnings much in line with expectations,
shed 21 cents to ADollars 4.93.
BHP finished 10 cents lower at ADollars 18.34 in volume of 2.03m shares and
News Corp eased 6 cents to ADollars 9.10.
WELLINGTON was softer in light volume, the NZSE-40 capital index slipping
6.16 to 2,142.43. Turnover was an unexceptional NZDollars 22.1m. Investors
were not encouraged by Standard &amp; Poor's upgrading of brewers Lion Nathan
and DB Group, the former losing 5 cents to NZDollars 3.55 and DB ending
unchanged at 85 cents.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Traders braced for supply of long-dated
state debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds drifted sideways in thin volume and eurobond
issuance ground to a halt as UK and US markets were closed for national
holidays.
However, supply looms large this week, with several markets preparing to
absorb long-dated government bond issuance.
The Bundesbank is expected this week to announce the German government's
first 10-year bund since last September, which is expected to be issued
within the first 10 days of June and seen totalling around DM10bn.
Meanwhile, after selling L4,000bn of three and five-year notes yesterday,
Italy plans to issue another L5,500bn of seven-, 10 and 30-year paper.
In addition, France is to issue FFr20bn, which most traders expect to be
raised via a new 10-year benchmark, while Sweden's National Debt Office
yesterday called for bids for Friday's auction of SKr3bn of 20-year
index-linked bonds.
Continuing uncertainty in the US market is also likely to weigh on the
markets, with traders nervously eyeing Friday's release of the latest US
jobs data.
All this is expected to lead to further yield curve steepening in Europe,
with investors still unwilling to commit funds to the longer-dated
instruments.
After last week's losses, German government bonds posted small gains
yesterday. The June bund futures contract on DTB rose 0.13 point to 93.60.
Bundesbank officials last week indicated that their securities repurchase
rate could continue declining even if cuts in official rates remain on hold
for now, so dealers this week will be watching the German central bank's
latest repo operation for an indication of continued easing.
'If they lower the repo rate by five basis points, that would allow the Bank
of France to cut (its intervention rate) by 10 basis points on Thursday,'
said Mr Steve Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais in Paris.
The French central bank left its intervention rate unchanged at 5.40 per
cent yesterday.
Moody's Investors Service has lowered the Canadian Province of Ontario's
long-term debt rating to Aa3 from Aa2, matching Standard &amp; Poor's
downgrading to AA- from AA in November.
The move followed a review of the province's financial and debt outlook and
reflects the fact that Ontario's budgetary imbalance is likely to remain
sizeable and wider than forecast.
Moody's added that debt levels will continue rising rapidly given the
anticipated requirements needed to fund the deficit and increasing
non-budgetary spending.
In addition, next year's provincial election and growing debt servicing
costs could affect the pace of fiscal recovery in the next few years.
The Hellenic Republic announced on Friday it has awarded the mandate for its
Dollars 500m syndicated loan to a group of banks led by NatWest and
Mitsubishi Bank.
Following last week's downgrading of Greece by Moody's to Baa1 from Baa3,
some bankers say the all-in price may have to be above initial indications
of around 110 basis points above Libor, closer to 120 over.
From June 1, Irish government bonds will be accepted for custody, clearance
and settlement in the Cedel system. Cross-border settlement between a Cedel
customer and a counterparty in the Irish market will be possible against
payment in Irish pounds through Citibank Dublin, the Cedel depositary in
Ireland.
The Cedel system now includes links with 18 domestic markets and, with the
inclusion of Ireland, government bonds from 13 European countries are now
eligible in the system.
Internationale Nederlanden Bank has established a Dollars 3bn euro
medium-term note programme, arranged by Merrill Lynch, which will facilitate
issuance denominated in a variety of currencies, the bank said.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Total sees steady first half
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Total, the French oil group, should achieve operating profits in the first
half of this year of about the same level as the FFr3.49bn (Dollars 591m)
recorded in the first six months of 1993, Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, said
yesterday.
Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Mr Tchuruk said there was
still much potential to improve the group's results through increased
production and improved productivity.
According to Total, it should double production of oil and gas by the end of
the decade, compared with the level of output in 1990.
At the end of 1995, Total will produce 40 per cent more oil and gas than it
did in 1993, excluding Middle Eastern output, said Mr Tchuruk.
Hydrocarbon reserves are in excess of 4bn barrels of oil equivalent, with
the majority coming from the Middle East, east Asia and Latin America.
However, as a result of growth in new areas, Mr Tchuruk forecast the
proportion of the group's production from the Middle East would fall to
about one-third by the end of the decade from 50 per cent.
The Total chairman noted the improvement in oil prices at the beginning of
the second quarter of the year, but said that demand for oil products
remained relatively weak, particularly in France.
The company said it would pay a dividend of FFr7.5 per share for 1993,
compared with FFr7 in 1992. Last year, the group recorded net profits of
FFr2.9bn, a slight increase from the FFr2.8bn achieved in 1992.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Inco agrees terms of settlement
with unions
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, has signed a tentative
three-year labour contract with almost 5,000 workers at its Ontario
operations, averting a strike which was due to begin tonight.
Uncertainty about the outcome of the contract talks has helped fuel a strong
rise in nickel prices this year.
But news of the settlement pushed Inco's share price down by 75 cents to
CDollars 36 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.
Members of the United Steelworkers of America union are due to vote on the
agreement today, and union leaders have urged them to accept the terms.
The settlement provides for no wage increases over the next three years.
However, a union official said that Inco has offered to maintain
cost-of-living increases and a bonus scheme which begins to operate when
nickel prices rise above USDollars 3.35 a lb. Pensions have also been raised
by a maximum of CDollars 300 a month for workers with 30 years' service.
'It's not a great collective agreement but with the recessionary times we're
in, it's one we can sell to our members,' the official said.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan's steelmakers under
pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's steel industry faces demands from the country's carmakers this year
to reduce prices for sheet steel.
The situation highlights the pressures on the big integrated steelmakers,
which reported some of the worst results in the industry's history, in line
with their forecasts last March.
Unless it agrees to the carmakers' demands, the industry faces the
possibility of losing orders from its best customers. But lower prices is
the last thing steelmakers want, with profits already severely squeezed by
recession and fierce price competition.
The companies' dismal results underline the severity of the trading
environment. Kawasaki Steel suffered a net loss of Y39.1bn (Dollars 374.5m),
the largest in its history.
The losses were incurred in spite of significant asset sales aimed at
boosting earnings. Nippon Steel is the only one of the five largest
integrated steelmakers to pay a dividend but is being forced to dip into
reserves to do so.
The figures reflect the impact of the slump on domestic economic activity
and the sharp appreciation of the yen, which is undermining Japanese
competitiveness.
Private consumption has been in the doldrums, with capital spending
persistently weak and investment in new office buildings unlikely to recover
in the near future.
Neither has there been much relief for the steelmakers from public works
projects under the government's economic stimulus programme, which have been
delayed due to unfolding bribery scandals.
Diversification moves have largely yielded unimpressive results, with some
attempts going badly wrong. Kobe Steel has said it would take on the losses
of a financial subsidiary which has been hit by the property and stock
market slumps.
Against that background, competition is increasing from lower-cost
producers, such as the Korean steelmakers. South Korea's Pohang Iron and
Steel Company (Posco) said last week it had acquired a Japanese steel mill,
where it will make steel products for the Japanese motor vehicle,
construction and electronics industries.
Korean steel has become more of a threat to the Japanese industry as
recession and the high yen have forced large steel customers, from carmakers
to builders, to look for cheaper materials to cut costs.
Japanese wages are among the highest in the world - four times as much on a
dollar basis as wages in Korea, says Mr Takashi Imai, president of Nippon
Steel.
At the same time, lower-cost domestic electric-furnace steelmakers are
moving aggressively into product areas that have traditionally been the
domain of the integrated steelmakers.
Major customers, such as carmakers and electronics manufacturers are moving
production overseas in an attempt to moderate the impact of the yen's rise.
Even increased orders from south-east Asia, where Japanese customers and
local businesses are enjoying strong demand, have not been much help in
lifting profits.
In the fiscal year to March, steel exports to south-east Asia grew 15 per
cent and in March alone they grew 31 per cent year-on-year.
However, the yen's appreciation has prevented that growth contributing much
to earnings.
The key to recovery for Japan's steelmakers lies in their ability to
restructure operations and cut costs dramatically to improve competitiveness
and profitability. They may be forced to consider reducing capacity further
if the situation worsens.
All five companies have launched stringent cost-cutting measures over the
next few years.
But unless the Japanese economy shows stronger signs of recovery than it has
in the first five months of this year, the axe may have to fall deeper and
sooner than planned.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bad debts continue to plague
banks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bad debts continued to undermine the performance of Japan's long-term credit
banks and trust banks in the year to the end of March.
Profits fell sharply and despite large write-offs, outstanding bad debts
remain worryingly high. The results suggest banks are still accumulating bad
debts almost as fast as they are writing them off.
The long-term credit banks reported an aggregate 36 per cent fall in pre-tax
earnings, to Y106bn (Dollars 1.02bn). Between them, the three banks wrote
off Y677bn in non-performing loans, partly offset by realised gains on
shareholdings.
Despite the record write-offs, problem loans remains at historically high
levels. Though the banks all claimed bad debt levels had peaked, total
outstanding non-performing loans and principal on loans more than six months
in arrears stood at Y1,888bn, or 3.5 per cent of the total loan book.
The Industrial Bank of Japan, the largest long-term credit bank, wrote off
Y154.3bn, up 63 per cent from 1992-93. But the balance of outstanding bad
loans declined by just 0.8 per cent to Y538.8bn.
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan wrote off Y316.8bn in problem loans, leaving
Y745bn outstanding, a 4.1 per cent increase. At Nippon Credit Bank the
figure was Y205.6bn, with Y603.9bn outstanding, up by 2 per cent.
Combined pre-tax profits at the seven trust banks declined by 30 per cent to
Y127.9bn as bad loan write-offs totalling Y577.7bn continued to weaken
performance. Despite the write-offs, total problem loans rose in the year to
Y2,700bn an increase of 4.8 per cent.
The bad loan adjustment more than offset an improvement in core banking
business. Net operating profits grew by 32.7 per cent to Y405.72bn as a
result of lower interest rates and cost-cutting measures.
The larger trust banks all reported sharply lower pre-tax profits as the
effects of the bad loan adjustments were felt. Only Nippon Trust Bank, the
smallest, reported an increase in profits as a result of large capital gains
on bonds.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: MAS falls 90% to MDollars 16.1m

<TEXT>
Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's national carrier, has been through
another tough year but sees a brighter future. Group results, released
yesterday, show a pre-tax profit for the year ending March 31, 1994 of
MDollars 16.1m (USDollars 6.2m), a 90 per cent drop on the previous year.
The airline pointed out that pre-tax figures for the past two years were not
strictly comparable. The 1992-93 pre-tax profit of MDollars 157m included a
profit of MDollars 337m from sales of aircraft. If this had been stripped
out, MAS would have suffered a pre-tax loss of MDollars 180m.
In 1993-94, MAS made profits of only MDollars 11.8m from the sale of
aircraft and spare parts. 'Group profit before tax and before profit on sale
of aircraft and spares was MDollars 4.3m, compared with a loss of MDollars
179.2m in 1992-93,' the company said. 'This represents an improvement of
MDollars 183.5m or 102.4 per cent.'
Turnover for the year improved by 9.2 per cent to MDollars 4.1bn. The board
has recommended a final ordinary dividend of two Malaysian cents, compared
with 10 cents the previous year.
MAS has become known as one of the world's most ambitious airlines. In the
course of its present five-year plan to 1996-97, it has orders for 72
aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn. Over the last year the airline
has taken delivery of 27 aircraft.
When many other airlines are pruning their services, MAS's route network has
been expanding rapidly. It has recently launched services to Buenos Aires,
Cape Town and Rome.
Passenger growth has kept well ahead of increases in capacity, resulting in
an improvement in the overall load factor to 63.9 per cent. Yields have
decreased - by 3.8 per cent on international routes and 3.9 per cent on the
loss-making domestic network.
Analysts said that though there had been some improvement, many problems
remained. MAS, more than 50 per cent controlled by the government, is still
regarded as an excessively bureaucratic, overstaffed airline.
MAS said there had been a small reduction in staff numbers over the past 12
months.

Four leading Indian companies have reported big gains in annual net profits
for the year ending March. They were helped by increased demand as the
economy recovered from prolonged stagnation.
The figures were lifted by cost-cutting and improved performance in response
to the economic liberalisation launched by the government three years ago.
ITC, the Indian affiliate of BAT Industries of the UK, saw net profit rise
33 per cent to Rs2.06bn (Dollars 65.6m) on increased revenues of Rs42.8bn.
The company announced a one-for-one bonus share issue.
While the large tobacco business saw a sales increase of 1 per cent, the
non-tobacco operations posted large gains. These activities include hotels,
financial services, paper, packaging and edible oils.
BAT, which holds a 31 per cent stake, earlier this year provoked protests
from ITC when it indicated it wished to increase its stake to 51 per cent,
following the government's economic reforms.
However, BAT shelved its plans but ITC promised to find ways for BAT to
become more closely involved in tobacco and financial services.
Tata Iron and Steel, the biggest company in the Tata industrial grouping,
saw net profits rise 42 per cent to Rs1.8bn on a 13 per cent increase in
revenues to Rs37bn. Exports advanced 11 per cent to Rs7.1bn. The company
expects further gains in 1994-95 as most of the modernisation programme in
its steelworks was completed last year.
Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (Telco), the Tata grouping's vehicle
manufacturer, posted a 239 per cent rise in net profits to Rs1.02bn on a 21
per cent increase in turnover to Rs37.5bn.
Telco, which has a 69 per cent share in medium and heavy lorries and 55 per
cent in light commercial vehicles, said it benefited from a sharp increase
in demand in the second half of the year.
Larsen and Toubro, the diversified engineering and cement group, reported a
65 per cent rise in net profits to Rs1.96bn on a sales increase of 27 per
cent to Rs22.0bn.

City.
BHP said no firm commitments had been made on the projects it was reviewing.
The Ho Chi Minh City power project was reported to have formed part of a
presentation made by BHP to the Vietnamese government last week. Gas to fuel
the project would come from offshore fields in the South China Sea. BHP is

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: IBM realignment aims to regain
market leadership - Focus of software development work is being switched to
client-server computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner is making his biggest product strategy change at
International Business Machines since his appointment as chairman and chief
executive just over a year ago.
The move is centred on realigning IBM's worldwide software development
operations through a strategic initiative, known internally as Workplace.
The aim is to re-establish its market leadership and improve the efficiency
of software development.
In a memo to managers, Mr John Thompson, IBM senior vice-president, said
Workplace technologies would 'revolutionise the way we and our customers
develop and use software'.
IBM will refocus much of its software development work on distributed
computer networks, known as client-server computing, rather than the
mainframe computers that have consumed most of its software development
budget in the past.
Last year, IBM spent almost Dollars 1.1bn on software research and
development, and its total software revenues were close to Dollars 11bn, or
more than 17 per cent of total revenues. However, most of the company's
spending and revenues have come from the mainframe sector, where sales are
declining.
Workplace technologies will create common building blocks for future
versions of IBM's most widely used computer operating systems: MVS for
mainframes, OS/400 for mid-range computers, AIX for workstations and OS/2
for personal computers and network servers. Currently, software for each of
these segments is developed separately.
The company-wide effort will involve unprecedented global collaboration
among IBM's product divisions, research laboratories and marketing
divisions.
This reflects the management philosophy of Mr Gerstner, who has been urging
co-operation, rather than competition, among IBM's product divisions.
The Workplace project emanates from IBM's PC software division where it
began as an effort to expand the capabilities of OS/2 and leap-frog
competition from Microsoft, the leading PC software company.
The elevation of Workplace to a company-wide initiative follows a review of
IBM's software strategies by the company's Corporate Executive Committee
(CEC), a group comprising 10 of the company's top executives that was formed
by Mr Gerstner last year.
'We've developed a single, unifying strategy for the entire spectrum of IBM
software,' said Ms Ellen Hancock, IBM senior vice-president and head of the
CEC task force that has been examining company-wide software strategy.
IBM announced several management changes in connection with the Workplace
initiative. These include the appointment of Mr Peter Schneider, an IBM
vice-president previously in charge of corporate software development and
environmental affairs, to take charge of the Workplace project. Mr Schneider
co-ordinates the development and implementation of the new technologies
across all IBM divisions.
A core element of the project is the development of a 'microkernel' of
software that contains the basic functions that control a computer. This
microkernel will become the common foundation for new versions of OS/400,
AIX and OS/2.
One of the advantages of such technology is that it will allow IBM's
operating systems to be more easily transported to different types of
computers. For example, OS/2 will be able to work on devices ranging from
hand-held PC to high performance workstations.
Another important aspect of the initiative is to incorporate 'object
technology' into IBM's software. Object technology breaks software programs
into components that can be re-used in new applications. IBM will use this
approach to create common 'services', such as database management and
network management, for all of its operating systems.
The object technology will be drawn in part from Taligent, IBM's joint
software venture with Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard. This move appears
to quash rumours that IBM was losing faith in Taligent.
Workplace will shorten software development cycles and reduce costs,
enabling IBM to bring new software products to market more quickly, said Mr
Thompson. 'With Workplace we have an opportunity to solve customer problems
and assert industry leadership, giving us a clear competitive advantage.'
These are ambitious goals, particularly in the PC arena where IBM's OS/2
operating system, with about 5m copies sold, is trailing way behind
Microsoft's Windows program, which is estimated to be in use on about 50m
PCs.
It will take considerable time for IBM to complete the Workplace project.
The first 'elemental' results will emerge this year, Ms Hancock said. 'You
will start to see more in 1995, but it will take us until 1996 and 1997 to
execute (fully) on these plans.'
The broad scope of the Workplace initiative will test IBM's management team.
Beyond the technical challenges, 'it will require tremendous teamwork,' Mr
Thompson said in his memo.
While senior IBM executives say Mr Gerstner has created an esprit de corp at
the highest levels of the company, they acknowledge this has yet to filter
down to the ranks where divisional loyalties are overriding. Mr Gerstner's
predecessor, Mr John Akers, encouraged product groups to operate as
autonomous business units.
There is a danger that as IBM struggles to co-ordinate software development
across its divisions, the company may lose sight of the real, external,
competition.
The name Workplace suggests IBM believes it can re-establish its role as a
setter of software standards, defining how computers are used in the
workplace. However, several other companies - including Microsoft, Novell
and Oracle - have strong claims to that role.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: CSR rises 40% and forecasts
further advance

CSR, the Australian building products, aluminium and sugar group, yesterday
reported a 40 per cent increase in profits after tax but before abnormals to
ADollars 296.5m (USDollars 212m) during the year to end-March.
CSR, which reported trading gains from all its main divisions and forecast a
continued profit improvement in the current year, said the advance was
reached on revenues up by 16 per cent, at ADollars 5.36bn.
The progress translated into earnings per share of 33.6 cents, compared with
25.1 cents in the previous 12 months (before abnormals).
The company incurred no abnormal charges in the most recent 12 months, but
suffered a ADollars 35.1m item in 1992-93, leaving profits after tax and
abnormals in that year at ADollars 231.3m.
The biggest divisional improvement came in the timber operations, where
operating profits jumped to ADollars 71.3m from ADollars 28.8m.
The core building and construction materials business saw profits of
ADollars 241.4m against ADollars 226m, while the North American construction
materials division made ADollars 106.3m compared with ADollars 79.1m.
CSR said it expected demand in its domestic market to remain close to
current levels this year. It acknowledged that Australia's house building
improvement might ebb, but suggested that commercial construction should
recover.
The aluminium division saw operating profits rise to ADollars 76.4m from
ADollars 41.5m, largely due to falling production costs. CSR said it was
surprised by the recent rise in aluminium prices. Because of the high level
of world stocks, it did not expect a significant recovery in price levels
until 1995.
The sugar division made a profit of ADollars 127.7m against ADollars 118.6m.
CSR said it expected 1994 raw sugar production to reach record levels. But
it said longer-term prospects for the Australian refined sugar industry were
less encouraging, with persistent oversupply.
CSR said it was retaining a ADollars 40m reserve against asbestos-related
claims, though it suggested legal developments in the US had generally been
favourable.

<TEXT>
Elektrim, one of the biggest companies on the Warsaw bourse, yesterday cut
the price of its planned rights issue by almost 20 per cent to 1.22m zlotys
a share, reflecting the weakness of the market.
The move by the foreign trade company, which specialises in
telecommunication and power generation, slices 187bn zlotys (Dollars 8.4m)
off the company's expected capital increase.
It comes as Polifarb Cieszyn, a listed paints producer, said a mere 4,632
shares had been taken up of its 765,000 rights issue.
The Polifarb rights price yesterday stood 4 per cent higher than its
ordinary share price yesterday while Elektrim was trading yesterday at
1,350,000 zlotys per share.

this year

Mannesmann, the German industrial group which lost DM513m (Dollars 298m)
last year, yesterday said it hoped to make a profit in 1994. Earnings at the
company's mobile telephone operations have increased and cost-cutting in
other divisions contributed to the improved outlook, said Mr Werner Dieter,
chief executive.
Sales in the first four months rose 11 per cent to DM6.4bn while orders
jumped 21 per cent to DM8.4bn, up from DM6.9bn in the same period a year
ago.
Eight of the group's 11 divisions were growing, Mr Dieter said, although
domestic demand was slight compared with improving export orders. Foreign
business, including overseas subsidiaries, rose 2 per cent to 59 per cent of
group turnover.
Mannesmann operates D2, one of Germany's two mobile phone networks, where
losses of DM224m contributed to last year's results. However, the company
said the telecommunications division, which accounted for 3 per cent of
group turnover, was the fastest growing unit within the company with a
first-quarter turnover of DM340m, up 136 per cent on the year before. The D2
network has 580,000 clients.
Orders at the company's engineering and plant division, which represents 42
per cent of group turnover, rose 37 per cent to DM4.1bn while orders at the
automotive division, which accounts for 20 per cent of group turnover and
last year lost DM160m, rose 19 per cent in the first four months to DM1.7bn.
First-quarter turnover at the electronics and electrical engineering
divisions fell 6 per cent, with Hartmann &amp; Braun unable to repeat a series
of big orders which it received in the same period last year.
The company shed about 8,000 workers last year, leaving it with 126,300
employees worldwide.
The company said 'certain adjustments' to the workforce were still necessary
but would give no figures.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Suez in property deal with
Unibail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company, is selling a
large part of the property assets of its Compagnie Fonciere Internationale
property subsidiary to Unibail, the property management group, for between
FFr3.2bn and FFr4bn (Dollars 570m to Dollars 712m).
The deal forms part of the long-term strategy of asset sales adopted by
Suez, which has for the past two years been rationalising its labyrinthine
web of interests and is expected within the next few weeks to finalise
negotiations to sell Victoire, its insurance business.
Suez said it expected to make a capital gain of between FFr1.5bn and
FFr1.9bn on the CFI deal, which includes the sale of a number of commercial
centres, offices and residential property developments.
Yesterday's announcement followed months of talks with Unibail and other
prospective purchasers.
Mr Leon Bressler, chairman of Unibail, said the acquisition offered 'a rare
opportunity' for his company to expand its commercial centre interests.
Unibail will help finance the transaction with the proceeds of its recent
FFr1.25bn convertible bond issue.
'For the past two years we've pursued a policy of investing in commercial
centres, as it is an area of the French property market that has
traditionally been neglected,' said Mr Bressler. 'It isn't very often that a
large portfolio of commercial properties like this becomes available in
France.'
Unibail already has interests in a number of large commercial centres,
notably in the Paris region. It has made several acquisitions in the field
over the past two years, culminating late last year in its purchase of a
number of retail properties from the Pinault-Printemps group.
Meanwhile Suez, which over the past two years has raised FFr20bn from asset
sales, is trying to conclude negotiations to sell Victoire, which is valued
in its books at around FFr18bn. Victoire has been up for sale since last
autumn when Suez ceded control of its German interests to Union des
Assurances de Paris.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, last month announced that Suez had received four
offers for Victoire and that it would decide which to accept by the end of
June. The potential purchasers are believed to include Italy's Generali,
Commercial Union of the UK and AEG of the US.
Suez yesterday said the Victoire talks were proceeding smoothly and that it
was still on course to conclude the deal by the end of next month.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Former PM given Mondadori board
seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday took further steps
to distance himself from his business interests by appointing a respected
Italian parliamentarian to the board of Mondadori, the publishing company he
intends to float on the Milan bourse.
However, at the same time, it was revealed that Mr Pier Silvio Berlusconi
and Ms Marina Berlusconi - the prime minister's two grown-up children from
his first marriage - had been given seats on the board, indicating that the
media magnate has no intention of abandoning ultimate ownership of his stake
in the group.
The appointment of Mr Giovanni Spadolini, a Republican senator and former
prime minister, is intended as a guarantee, if only symbolic, that Mr
Berlusconi will keep his political and publishing interests apart. Mr
Spadolini stood against Mr Berlusconi's candidate in last month's election
for speaker of the senate, and lost by only one vote.
A handful of the media magnate's close political and business associates
have stepped down from the Mondadori board ahead of flotation, which is
likely to take place in July.
The company said its chairman, Mr Leonardo Mondadori, had asked Mr Spadolini
to become a director 'as a guarantor of the cultural continuity and of the
independence of the publishing house'.
At the moment, only 2 per cent of Mondadori is quoted on the Milan stock
exchange.
Mondadori has now merged with Silvio Berlusconi Editore, the private company
which holds the prime minister's other publishing interests, and yesterday's
board meeting formally approved the plan to float up to 53 per cent of the
company. The roadshow for the sale will begin tomorrow.
Mr Franco Tato, Mondadori's chief executive, revealed at yesterday's meeting
that the combined company would have shown a gross operating profit of
L252bn (Dollars 149m) in 1993, on sales of L1,830bn.
