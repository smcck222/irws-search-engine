<TEXT>
Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, lifted pre-tax
profit for the first four months of the year to NKr659m (Dollars 89m) from
NKr640m. The result was achieved in spite of lower crude oil prices, partly
offset by an increase in oil sales and higher production volumes.
Group operating revenue was little changed at NKr1.97bn while operating
costs rose by NKr206m to NKr1.47bn due to higher depreciation, production
and transport tariffs and carbon taxes.
Operating profit fell by NKr156m to NKr502m. Saga blamed lower oil prices,
which averaged NKr105 a barrel against NKr128 in the same period of 1993.
Net financial items contributed NKr157m, against a charge of NKr18m.
Petroleum output rose to 2m tonnes oil equivalent from 1.7m as crude oil
sales increased to 12.2m barrels from 10m and gas sales to 187m cubic metres
from 158m. Saga set a target for oil production from the Snorre field in
1994 of nearly 63m barrels. During the first four months, Snorre produced
21.6m barrels of oil.
The group intends to submit a revised plan to domestic energy authorities
during the second half of 1994 for approval of an expansion of the
development and operation of Snorre.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Banesto moves to resolve
Portuguese bank dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Banco Santander and Banesto yesterday put forward proposals aimed resolving
a dispute over the Spanish groups' shareholdings in Banco Totta e Acores, a
Portuguese bank, according to Portuguese officials.
Banesto, which was acquired by Santander last month, owns just under 25 per
cent of BTA directly and a further 25 per cent through nominee shareholders.
Portugal contends that this contravenes legislation limiting foreign
ownership of the bank to 25 per cent.
Mr Emilio Botin, Santander chairman, and Mr Alfredo Saenz, Banesto chairman,
met Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portugal's finance minister, and Mr Miguel Beleza,
the governor of the central bank, yesterday for talks requested by
Santander.
Both sides declined to comment on progress. But Lisbon bankers said
Santander was seeking an agreement that would avoid court action by either
side. Santander affirms that the limits imposed by Portugal are at odds with
European Union regulations.
Banesto and its associate shareholders in BTA are contesting a decision by
the Portuguese central bank that restricts their joint voting rights in BTA
to 25 per cent.
Mr Botin said last week Santander would not dispose of its stake in BTA,
which he considered a high-value asset and one of the main reasons for
acquiring Banesto. But Lisbon bankers said a compromise might involve
selling other Santander assets in Portugal.
Santander's purchase of Banesto gave it control of an estimated 10 per cent
of Portuguese banking. In addition to BTA, which owns Credito Predial
Portugues, a mortgage bank, Santander controls Banco Comercio e Industria
and Banco Santander de Negocios, two Portuguese merchant banks.

FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fondiaria trims losses and sees
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fondiaria, the Italian insurance company indirectly controlled by the
Ferruzzi industrial group, announced continued heavy losses for 1993, but
claimed that there were 'encouraging signs of an improvement'.
Losses last year reached L465bn (Dollars 275m), compared with L576bn in
1992, but the group pointed out in a statement issued at the weekend that
its insurance losses had been cut from L664bn in 1992 to L252bn.
Directors of the company expressed their confidence in the correctness of
the group's accounts, following the news last Friday that two former
managers of the group had been put under investigation by Ravenna
magistrates for allegedly declaring false accounts, a criminal offence in
Italy. The directors said they were confident the true facts would soon be
established.
The group said its debts had fallen to L2,139bn at the end of last year,
from L2,451bn at the end of 1992, of which L1,046bn was owed to banks.
In 1993, gross premiums increased by 8.3 per cent to L6,607bn, of which
L6,016bn came from consolidated companies. Italian premiums contributed
L5,349bn to this figure - L4,369bn from non-life business, and L980bn from
life insurance.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: To the victor the jewel in the crown - If
Enterprise's bid is successful it will take over Lasmo's Indonesian oil
interests, centred on the gas liquification plant at Bontang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the contested takeover between Enterprise Oil and Lasmo develops, part of
the battle is being fought in the rain forests and mangrove swamps of East
Kalimantan.
Here, on the shores of the island of Borneo, Lasmo is a leading force in
Indonesia's fast-growing liquified natural gas industry, already the world's
largest.
Enterprise, by contrast, has only a minor presence in Indonesia, but sees
good potential provided it can get in at the right price.
Not that Kalimantan is an easy place to do business. In this remote
equatorial region, rainfall is measured in metres and roads are scarce.
Indonesia's state oil company, Pertamina, also runs a tight regime which
effectively relegates all foreign oil companies to the status of
contractors.
Nonetheless, Lasmo - and Enterprise - see the operation here as something of
a jewel in the company's crown. Lasmo's operations, which are centred on the
giant gas liquification plant at Bontang, consist of a 38 per cent interest
in the Indonesian joint venture, a part-nership of foreign oil companies and
consumers which explores for and produces gas in the Sanga Sanga contract
block.
Lasmo is also half owner, with Union Texas Petroleum, of Vico, the company
which operates the block. The properties came to Lasmo when it acquired
Ultramar in 1991.
Sanga Sanga currently supplies about half of the gas requirements of
Bontang, which ships 15m tons of liquified natural gas a year under
long-term contract to electric utilities in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Vico's
reserves were estimated at the end of last year at 13.5 trillion cu ft of
gas, equivalent to about 2bn barrels of oil, enough for another 10-15 years.
However, the challenge facing Lasmo in Kalimantan is to hold its leading
position in this key industry. Vico's reserves were the first to be
discovered in the area, more than 20 years ago, and the effects of depletion
are beginning to show. Although reserves continue to rise, the rate of
increase has slowed, and some of the rise is coming from better reserve
management rather than new discoveries.
Although this is not affecting Vico's ability to meet its commitments to
Bontang, its position is beginning to be overshadowed by the newer arrival,
Total, which has made some very large discoveries offshore and is set to
become Bontang's biggest supplier later this decade.
At 15.2 trillion cu ft, Total's reserves are already larger than Vico's.
Total's success is one of the main reasons why Pertamina is going ahead with
plans to add a seventh 'train' or production line to Bontang by 1998, and is
also talking about an eighth shortly after that. There is little doubt in
Pertamina's mind that the market for the gas exists: it is merely a question
of finding enough of it.
According to Mr Subroto, the manufacturing manager at Bontang, Pertamina
expects the Pacific market for LNG to double from its present 43m tonnes a
year by the year 2010. Under the arrangements at Bontang, the gas producing
companies get to supply the plant in proportion to the size of their
reserves, which have to be independently certif-ied.
In the first contract, Vico's share was 97 per cent. But in the most recent,
the fourth, it had fallen to only 27 per cent.
This share is likely to be even lower in the new contracts which Pertamina
is currently negotiating with its utility customers. (These contracts are
concurrent, which is why Vico still supplies over half Bontang's needs). The
contract participation system 'provides a strong incentive for the producers
to maintain the pace of exploration' if they want to keep supplying Bontang,
says Mr John Lofthouse, Vico's president.
Lasmo's hopes of holding its position in the long term are pinned mainly on
Runtu, a 13,000 sq km block next to Sanga Sanga where it has a production
sharing contract with Pertamina - in its own name rather than through a
joint venture with other foreign partners.
This huge block, which extends deep into Kalimantan's remote interior, is
now being explored with seismic tests. According to Lasmo, it shares many of
Sanga Sanga's features, and the company is hoping for positive results.
'There's tremendous potential,' says Mr Lofthouse.
Enterprise has declined to comment specifically on what it would do with the
Kalimantan properties if it won control of Lasmo. But Mr Graham Hearne, the
chairman, has said that part of the rationale for the takeover would be to
make Lasmo's assets 'work harder'.
Given its own small position in Indonesia (it only has two production
sharing contracts, one of which it is selling in order to focus on a more
promising offshore gas prospect at Natuna in the north) Enterprise could,
however, be expected to step up the pace of exploration in the region in the
hope of increasing the 'upside' return through larger finds.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Life companies likely to use derivatives
more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of derivatives by life insurance companies is set to increase
significantly, according to a study by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants,
published today.
The KPMG survey found that only half a sample of 50 UK life companies are
currently using derivatives - instruments such as swaps, futures and options
whose value is 'derived' from more conventional financial assets - for
either portfolio management or product design.
However, virtually all these companies are preparing to increase their use
of derivatives and four out of every five intend to use the instruments in
the future.
Mr Rupert Yardley, the author of the report, suggests that the relaxation of
regulations in July is one of the reasons. 'Life offices have been inhibited
in the past from using derivatives by the restrictive valuation rules
applied by the Department of Trade and Industry in measuring solvency and by
the virtual prohibition on holding derivatives in unit-linked funds,'
explained Mr Yardley. 'However, most of these restrictions will be removed.'
Mr Yardley said the disparity between the largest offices and the rest was
'striking' and reflected the fact that larger offices could devote more
resources to considering tax and regulatory implications.
The larger life offices have long been using derivatives for hedging and
asset allocation purposes and, more recently, to match FT-SE linked
products. A large majority of the companies believed there was a significant
opportunity to design new products and derivatives could be the key to
offering products with guarantees.
The survey also found that life companies have been very conservative in the
extent to which they have used derivatives for tactical asset allocation
purposes and may be missing out on opportunities for more efficient
portfolio management.
Life companies make most use of equity options and futures, with 40 per cent
of the companies in the survey - mainly with-profits offices and mutuals -
currently using equity options.
'This probably reflects the use of call options to pre-invest cash flows and
the need for such offices to protect their equity portfolios against sharp
falls in value,' said the report.
The survey said few companies had considered the use of derivatives from an
explicit tax perspective.
'This appears to be an area where there may be opportunities for the use of
derivatives which are not being taken advantage of at present,' it said.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: On course against the odds - US purchase
became a black hole / Logica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can Logica recover the panache which in the early 1980s made it the UK's
most buccaneering and stylish computing services company? Or is it condemned
to further restructuring, decline and eventual acquisition?
The company remains a maze of contradictions. Highly visible, oozing with
technological expertise and with the bluest of blue chip customer lists, it
has nevertheless been a financial stretcher case more than once during its
25 year existence.
The shares at 292p on Friday are where they were a decade ago. In the year
to June 30 1993, the company made pre-tax profits of only Pounds 9m on sales
of over Pounds 217m.
Logica was a leader in some superficial aspects of corporate culture when it
pioneered annual reports which were masterpieces of good design. However,
few companies have so relentlessly underperformed both the market and their
sector.
Mr Richard Holway, a computer industry authority, describes it as a missed
UK opportunity: 'It is Britain's largest indigenously owned computing
services company, yet it is not even in the European top 50'. The
appointment of Mr Martin Read as chief executive a year ago may mark the
beginning of the long journey back.
As the UK's last large independent computing service company, Logica has
been a perennial acquisition target - most notably in 1985 when a
parliamentary furore helped prevent a swoop by Electronic Data Systems of
the US.
Some would argue that Mr Read's appointment is proving tantamount to a
takeover given the radical changes he is trying to make.
Formerly with GEC-Marconi where he had responsibility for businesses with
sales of Pounds 500m, he is injecting a cool measure of market realism into
Logica's technological hot-house culture.
He has begun to put his own people into key positions: Mr Jim Yates,
recruited from GEC, has direct responsibility for the company's poorly
performing international businesses, while Mr Jim McKenna has been brought
in as human resource director, a key role in transforming the corporate
cul-ture.
The problem, in part at least, is that within Logica, founded by engineers,
technology has always come first with sales and marketing dragging along at
the rear. 'We have lacked punch, focus and an international, market-led
culture', Mr Read explains.
The company's lack of competitiveness over the past five years was
exacerbated by the worldwide recession, by the retirement of co-founder
Philip Hughes, the company's style guru. But most of all Logica was hit by
the problems of Data Architects, a US-based banking and telecommunications
software company which it bought in 1988, hoping it would provide a platform
for US expansion.
It became, instead, a financial black hole for the company, pulling down
profitability and leading to successive waves of restructuring in the US.
Now the problem seems to be nearly solved although the US subsidiary is
still losing money because of the continuing cash needs of developing a
funds transfer package.
How do Logica's management regard the purchase of Data Architects now? Mr
Colin Rowland, currently director of international operations, believes on
balance it was 'a great mistake'. Mr Yates, however, argues that an
international services company has to have a base in the US to provide a
pathway into a broad range of opportunities.
Mr Read's strategy at Logica is based on two elements. First, a drive to
improve margins and profitability. He plans to build on the company's
existing technical excellence and the loyalty of its customers. He is also
anxious to instil 'rewards-led' rather than 'technologically' driven
attitudes.
The aim is to achieve a return to at least a 10 per cent return on sales;
between 1988 and 1992, operating margins fell from 10.2 per cent to 3.1 per
cent followed by a return to 4.1 per cent in 1993.
Second, a renewed search for repeatable sales, leveraging the company's
international network to find new markets for products and services that
have proved successful in the UK. Some 50 per cent of the company's turnover
comes from the UK; Europe accounts for 28 per cent, North America, 12 per
cent and the rest of the world, 10 per cent.
Mr Read has a lot to do, however, to sharpen the company's focus. About a
third of its business is in the finance sector while the rest is spread
between government, energy and utilities, defence, telecommunications,
transport and industry.
About half the business is in fixed price contracts, the rest being charged
on a time and materials basis.
Mr Read and his senior executives talk of the company as being 'liberated'
from the layers of bureaucracy which, they say, built up over the past
decade, stifling initiative and drive.
'Mobility' is another watchword. He is working towards a flat, flexible
corporate structure which will enable highly skilled and mobile
technologists to move anywhere their services are needed.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BPC looks forward to flexible digital
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Holloran, British Printing Company's chief executive, describes the
digital revolution in the printing industry as, 'the most exciting thing
since movable type.'
He believes the use of digital technology will enable commercial printers
like BPC to become even more efficient and provide customers, including
magazine publishers, with a 'more flexible, faster and more creative
service' - probably on a European-wide basis.
Mr Holloran's vision of the future of the printing industry is tied up with
the plans to float BPC, the UK's largest commercial printer with about 20
per cent of the UK high volume magazine printing market, on the London Stock
Exchange.
The flotation is expected to place a value of about Pounds 250m on BPC,
which was known as BPCC until Mr Holloran led a management buy-out from the
late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire in January 1989. Mr Maxwell is
always refered to in BPC as 'the previous owner.'
Funds raised through the flotation are expected to be used to repay debt
associated with the Pounds 240m buy-out, backed initially by Electra and
Candover, and will eliminate about Pounds 25m a year in interest costs.
This will free BPC to invest even more heavily in new technology and the
setting up of a Europe-wide network of printing plants.
BPC has already invested heavily in new plant and equipment in the UK as
part of a Pounds 108m capital investment programme undertaken since the
buy-out.
As part of this programme the group's 25 main plants, which include both
gravure and web-offset print plants, have been linked together by an
electronic network and digital design studios have been created for each of
the main businesses. 'We have spent Pounds 5m on IT alone,' says Mr
Holloran.
He also claims that the investment has been customer driven. For example BPC
worked closely with the Radio Times to improve and develop the product.
At the same time the group has been completely restructured. Before the
buy-out Mr Holloran says BPC was a collection of 40 separate businesses
riddled with infighting and lacking focus. In the two years following the
buy-out the group was restructured and the workforce has been cut from 7,500
to 5,000.
The group operates in six main markets, magazines, catalogues, books &amp;
journals, packaging, labels and security documents such as cheque books and
direct mail.
The magazines and catalogues division is by far the largest, accounting for
more than 50 per cent of group turnover. It prints more than 1bn magazines
each year on 27 web offset and 6 gravure presses including eight of the top
10 weekly magazines - the other two are printed in Germany by a competitor.
Among the titles it prints are the Radio Times, TV Times, Bella, Woman's
Own, Country Life and Readers Digest.
It also produces books and journals, as well as catalogues for Thomson
Holidays, Next and Argos.
BPC prints 125m labels a week for customers like Heinz, Nescafe and Cadbury
and claims a 4 per cent share the highly fragmented labels market together
with a 2 per cent share of the folding carton markets. Its folding cartons
are used to package Silk Cut cigarettes, Mcleans toothpaste, Thorntons'
chocolate and Twining's tea.
BPC produced operating profits of Pounds 19m last year on turnover of Pounds
317.6m. Mr Holloran says that now is the right time for a flotation because
of the recovery in the printing market.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lipton appeal setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle by Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, to block a
deal in which British Land acquired a 29.9 per cent share of Stanhope has
suffered a further setback in the Court of Appeal.
In a unanimous decision the Court of Appeal dismissed an application by Mr
Lipton's private company for leave to appeal against an earlier court ruling
striking out proceedings by his company against British Land and the Bank of
Nova Scotia.
Mr Lipton had claimed pre-emption rights over the 29.9 per cent stake which
British Land acquired from the Bank of Nova Scotia in March.
However, his case was dismissed by Mr Justice Vinelott earlier last month.
The judge refused leave to appeal and costs were awarded to the defendants.
On Friday in the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Millett upheld that ruling
describing the case as 'speculative' and adding that the plaintive's
allegations were 'wildly implausible'.
Mr Lipton had been anxious to overturn British Land's acquisition of the
stake, which is seen as a step to gain control of Stanhope's half-share in
Broadgate, a development in the City of London.
He said he had the right of first refusal to buy the stake.

<TEXT>
RJ Kiln, the highly rated Lloyd's agency, and John Head &amp; Partners, a
private New York-based investment partnership, are discussing the possible
injection next year of fresh capital to support syndicates managed by Kiln.
Kiln, which is also in talks with other potential investors, is preparing
for a fall of up to 20 per cent in the number of Names - the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market - at Lloyd's and could
be looking to make up a shortfall of about Pounds 100m, according to Mr
Andrew Fleming-Williams, a director of Kiln.
The agency is one of a number keen to launch a new so-called 'dedicated'
vehicle for the 1995 year. This would channel corporate capital solely to
its own syndicates.
Last year John Head &amp; Partners, which specialise in the insurance industry,
invested Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) in a new Bermuda-based insurance company,
Partner Re. Mr Head is also a significant investor in Sphere Drake, a
London-based insurance company listed in New York, and Integon Insurance, a
US motor insurer which specialises in non-standard risks.
Many Names are expected to leave Lloyd's later this year after the insurance
market's fourth consecutive year of losses. Lloyd's, which reports its
results three years in arrears, earlier this month announced a deficit of
Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said he
expected Names would need to pay between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.7bn in
cash this year.
With the amount of capacity supplied by Names set to fall from its present
level of Pounds 9.3bn to Pounds 7.5bn, agents will be under pressure to
generate extra corporate cash. But with UK institutions unlikely to provide
sufficient backing for a new wave of Lloyd's investment trusts, such as
Limit and CLM, the emphasis is likely to be on the new dedicated vehicles
which allow for a closer relationship between investor and syndicate
management.
Hiscox Group formed a dedicated vehicle last year and Brockbank is among
those agencies examining the option. Agents will hope to persuade Stock
Exchange regulators to relax current rules which would make it difficult for
'dedicated' funds to be listed on the SE on the grounds that they do not
have a three-year trading record.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Bulls run upagainst realists in bleak Japan: Why companies
are much more pessimistic than the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For months the world's fund managers have been selling Japan to their
clients. In a world haunted by rising inflation and interest rates, Japan,
they say, offers growth potential. For the past two weeks, the corporate
reporting season has put the sales pitch to the test.
The hard facts of the 1993-94 results offered little more than the bleak
superlatives of decline: a record fourth successive year of falling earnings
pushed corporate profitability to depths last seen in the early 1970s;
pre-tax profit margins as a percentage of sales fell below 2 per cent, down
from a postwar high of nearly 6 per cent in 1989. Overall, turnover fell by
5.4 per cent and pre-tax earnings by 16.2 per cent.
Manufacturers were worst hit. Their aggregate profits dropped by a fifth.
But it has been an undiscriminating recession; other sectors fared only
marginally better. The culprits were familiar: weak demand at home and a
surging yen abroad.
And yet for the moment it seems the equity market believes not only that the
worst is over, but that Japan's companies are actually set for years of
rapid growth. While the rest of the world's stock markets have taken to
heart the principle of selling in May and going away, the Nikkei greeted the
results season with a sustained rally, building on its steady rise since the
start of the year. It now stands 21 per cent above its year-end level. The
earnings collapse and equity price surge have sent price-earnings ratios
back to their bubble highs.
The bullish justification is that things can only get better. The company
results, though poor, actually beat market expectations, or as Mr Jason
James, equity strategist at James Capel, puts it: 'The results were better
than expected, because it was always possible that they would be
disastrous.'
Just a month before the reporting season, analysts were forecasting an
average 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. By that yardstick, a 16 per
cent fall is encouraging.
But while results were better than expected, companies' own expectations for
the current year have turned out to be worse than market forecasts. Most
observers had been expecting a rebound of more than 16 per cent in 1994-95
earnings. But the annual reports projected an aggregate improvement of just
9 per cent. For the first time companies are much more pessimistic than the
market.
Some see this as an encouraging sign. 'Japanese companies are at last having
a dose of realism,' says Mr Jesper Koll of SG Warburg. 'They are no longer
relying on either an economic or a policy bail-out to keep them afloat, but
are instead looking to real improvements in their own performance.'
If real improvements are to be found in 1994, they are likely to come in
three areas.
Demand: While many companies reported improving conditions in overseas
markets, particularly Asia and the US, there was little optimism about
domestic demand. Their average forecast is for another fall in sales, of
around 0.2 per cent, as real demand weakness is exacerbated by price falls.
The yen: Exporters were caught out by the appreciation of the yen in
1993-94. Last year on average they expected a rate of Y115-Y120 to the
dollar. The actual figure was nearer Y105. This year most major exporters
are playing safe and basing their earnings forecast on an exchange rate of
Y105. This assumption may prove conservative and offers some hope for
improving profits.
Many companies have taken out protection against the currency's gyrations by
shifting production offshore. According to Mr Robert Burghart, strategist at
Smith New Court, the most striking feature of the 1993-94 results was a
direct correlation between earnings and the scale of the company's offshore
production. The electronics sector led the way, with companies such as Aiwa
seeing higher profits as a result of an aggressive reorganisation of
manufacturing operations.
This reorientation is reflected in forecasts: manufacturers are much more
optimistic for the current year than other sectors, expecting pre-tax
profits to rise by 18 per cent, while non-manufacturers expect a fall of 4
per cent.
Costs: 'Restructuring' has been the vogue word throughout the recession. The
1993-94 results suggest that companies have indeed trimmed costs to keep
afloat. Employee bonuses, on average 30 per cent of total employment costs,
have fallen by about 4 per cent this year. Headquarters costs have been held
back for a third successive year.
Exemplar of the trend was Ricoh, the photocopier manufacturer, which was one
of the few companies to post higher profits, despite falling sales, thanks
largely to the disposal of unprofitable divisions and better control of
other costs.
But such measures have not yet yielded results for most companies. There is
little hard evidence that deep, structural cost-cutting, as distinct from
cyclical shrinkage, is widespread. Payroll numbers have fallen only slightly
and the commitment to lifetime employment, a significant contributor to
companies' long-run costs, remains mostly undiminished.
It is possible that companies' relative pessimism about the current year
will prove excessive. The yen may fall and domestic demand may turn out
stronger than expected. But if their expectations prove well-founded,
earnings growth will be sluggish at best, and they will rely on their own
internal reforms for recovery. Only those businesses for whom restructuring
is a reality rather than an aspiration will justify the market's optimism.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Nikkei at a high as Europe stays quiet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE, JOHN PITT and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 benchmark index hit a new high for the year of 20,838.97
yesterday as the volume of shares traded rose to 600m from 523m on Friday.
In Europe, London was on holiday and Frankfurt and Paris were subdued, but
the Dax index eventually recovered to 2,129.76 in the afternoon from the
2,112.80 it saw at the close of post-bourse trading on Friday.
The CAC-40 index closed a fractional 1.84 higher at 2,052.51 in very low
turnover. Eurotunnel attracted attention from investors, the shares rising
more than 5 per cent, but the buying was said to be technical.
Swiss equities saw the reverse of the coin, the SMI blue chip index breaking
two resistance lines, at 2,720 and 2,740, before it closed 31.0, or 1.1 per
cent, higher at the day's high of 2,742.9. The financial sector enjoyed
strong support.
In Milan the feature of the session was a strong performance from
construction stocks following the government's announcement late on Friday
that it was to encourage investment in this sector. In Amsterdam the Aex
index advanced slightly to 402.42, with Philips, the electronics group,
standing out.
European bond markets received little impetus in the absence of US and UK
market participants due to holidays.
German and French bonds edged cautiously higher in light volume, while the
rest of Europe remained little changed from Friday's close.
Market participants this week will focus on bond issuance in Germany,
France, Italy and Sweden.
Moreover, traders will watch the Bundesbank's latest open-market operation
tomorrow, seeking confirmation of recent comments from senior Bundesbank
officials that the securities repurchase rate still has room to fall, even
if official rates are on hold for now. The repo rate currently stands at
5.20 per cent, well above the 4.5 per cent discount rate which acts as a
floor for money market rates.
Amid continued uncertainty over the US interest rate outlook, European bonds
will also continue tracking US Treasuries, where all eyes are on Friday's
jobs data for April.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Mediobanca falls under Ferruzzi investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four top executives of Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, were
yesterday warned they were under investigation by Ravenna magistrates for
alleged irregularities in their role as advisers to the Ferruzzi-Montedison
group which collapsed last June.
The notice, served yesterday by the Guardia di Finanza, includes Mr Enrico
Cuccia, the octogenarian honorary chairman still regarded as the single most
influential figure in Italian finance. The other three members covered by
the notice were Mr Vincenzo Maranghi, Mr Gerardo Braggiotti and Mr Maurizio
Romiti.
Mediobanca reacted with an uncharacteristically angry statement expressing
its 'bitterness' that it was being 'criminalised' for its attempt to 'save
Italy's second largest industrial group from bankruptcy'. Mediobanca,
controlled by former state banks and a group of large companies, has watched
its share price fall sharply in the last month, just when it is planning to
launch a L1,500bn (Pounds 620m) rights issue.
This is the first time the inquiry has been directed towards persons in an
institution not directly linked to Ferruzzi-Montedison. The magistrates
ordered the Guardia di Finanza to take documents from Mediobanca's Milan
offices a fortnight ago. This followed denunciations by Mr Carlo Sama,
former chief executive of Ferruzzi who is facing corruption allegations,
that Mediobanca had abused its role as an adviser and failed to help
Ferruzzi- Montedison properly.
He also claimed that Mediobanca was aware last June of some L400bn of
undeclared bad debts in offshore companies but allowed these to be excluded
from the 1992 accounts, technically a criminal offence.
Mediobanca said yesterday that it had submitted 'incontrovertible' evidence
to the magistrates that it had neither the power nor a duty to vet the
balance sheet. However, the Ravenna magistrates said they were obliged to
investigate Mr Sama's claims.
It is the first time that Mediobanca - under fire for its accumulation of
financial power - has been caught up in the corruption scandals. But Mr
Braggiotti's father Enrico, former chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana,
is sought by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving Dollars 50m in the
'Enimont affair' and Mr Romiti's father, Cesare, chief executive of Fiat,
has fallen foul of other investigations.

FT  31 MAY 94 / IBM aims to unify software development in 'Workplace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is realigning its worldwide software
development operations following a management review ordered by Mr Lou
Gerstner, chairman and chief executive.
IBM, which spends about Dollars 1bn a year developing software in several
product divisions, plans to co-ordinate these efforts behind a set of
technologies called 'Workplace'. The shift is part of Mr Gerstner's plans to
unify IBM's product development work, eliminating contention between
divisions.
Workplace technologies are designed to create a common core for IBM's
computer operating systems. Similarly, the company has fixed on a common
hardware technology, the PowerPC microprocessor, for a broad range of
products ranging from hand-held units computers to powerful multi-processor
units.
The software strategy shift will achieve several goals, according to a memo
sent to senior IBM managers by Mr John Thompson, senior vice president, who
headed a taskforce formed by Mr Gerstner to evaluate Workplaces
technologies. The aims include shortening software development cycles and
cutting costs.
Mr Thompson said the new technologies would enable IBM software products to
work together better in distributed computing systems. This addresses one of
the 'strategic imperatives' established by Mr Gerstner to increase IBM's
share of the fast-growing market for computers linked to networks.
During the overhaul, Mr Thompson stressed that the company aimed to enhance,
rather than replace, its existing software. 'Our customers' investments (in
software) will be protected,' he said.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Costs soar in battle for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil is expected today to extend its hostile Pounds 1.3bn bid for
rival explorer Lasmo as the costs of the battle between Britain's two
largest independents spiral to more than Pounds 30m.
By the time the offer period expires at the end of July, Lasmo will have
spent Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m defending its independence. Enterprise is likely
to pay a similar price in fees and charges if successful and a mere Pounds
5m if the bid fails. Combining the two companies could cost Enterprise more
than Pounds 80m in restructuring charges, although advisers say overhead
savings of Pounds 30-Pounds 40m a year could be achieved.
The offer is likely to be extended to June 17, with most investors expecting
the all-paper bid to be revised. A new offer could include some form of cash
or a revised paper deal in the light of Enterprise's weakened share price.
As the battle nears the half-way stage, Lasmo is set to question further
Enterprise's accounting standards, but it is also expected to retract an
earlier charge that Enterprise has had little international success. It did
not include Enterprise's Norwegian operations in its calculations. It has
been invited to give the Takeover Panel additional details of allegation
that Enterprise's techniques allowed it to inflate earnings.
Lasmo will come under pressure to persuade institutional investors that it
has the financial resources to exploit all its development opportunities.
One shareholder said price was not the main issue. Lasmo needed to show that
it was a better developer of assets than Enterprise. 'Lasmo has to prove to
us that it deserves its independence.'
Although Enterprise has come under attack for not fully explaining the logic
behind its offer, speculation intensified that the bid had been motivated in
part by the chance to swap some of Lasmo's assets.
'There is a bit too much confidence on Enterprise's part for them not to
have done deals or know they can do them,' said one institutional investor.
A combined company would have the largest acreage in the UK continental
shelf. Asset trading would strengthen cash flow and the combined balance
sheet, allowing the larger group to accelerate appraisal and development of
Lasmo assets in Algeria and Colombia.
The bid values Lasmo paper at about 130p, compared with Friday's 148p close.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Less than a full EU welcome for Italy's rightwing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Neo-fascist ministers of Italy's new government coalition made their first
appearance on the European political stage yesterday and found that not all
hands were extended in welcome.
The Belgian telecommunications minister, Mr Elio di Rupo, refused to shake
hands with his Italian opposite number, Mr Giuseppe Tatarella.
He is one of five Italian ministers from the rightwing National Alliance,
and one of three from its neo-fascist core, the MSI, two of whom made their
debut at the Council of Ministers in Brussels yesterday.
Mr di Rupo, a rising star in Belgium's socialist firmament, and whose
Italian father came here after the second world war, broke all the club
rules on welcoming newcomers to the European Union Council, and underlined
it by issuing a statement.
For the first time in the history of the European Community and Union, he
said, the Council counted among its members the representatives of an
'ideology that has been condemned for ever'.
Disquiet about the neo-fascist presence is widespread, although few senior
officials or ministers are prepared to discuss it. Officials from Germany,
Spain, Greece, and Portugal in particular say that they fear it might make
fascism respectable in their own countries once again.
Meanwhile, the European parliament's dominant socialist group has voted not
to work with the Italian neo-fascists.
Yesterday, the Danish social democrat telecommunications minister, Mr Helge
Mortensen, admitted under questioning that he, too, had not seen fit to
shake hands with Mr Tatarella, because 'I did not find it suitable'.
Mr Tatarella was not unprepared for his reception. He observed to Mr di Rupo
that it was Benito Mussolini's regime in Italy that had first abolished the
handshake - in favour of the Roman-style fascist salute.
The Greek presidency of the EU calmed the waters by issuing a bland
declaration on democratic principles. Among the larger member states, there
was mostly silence yesterday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said his government 'had no
reservations about working with the Italian government'.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UK may stem imports of subsidised building steel: Companies
unable to compete with foreign rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulations to stem imports into Britain of cut-price subsidised
construction steel, mainly from Italy and Spain, are being considered by the
UK government.
Transport and Environment Department officials are working with the British
Constructional Steelwork Association to devise quality control and company
registration schemes to make it harder for foreign companies to break into
the UK. The standards will be similar to schemes operating in other European
countries and will be carefully worded so as not to fall foul of European
Union trade liberalisation rules.
Companies including British Steel have become increasingly irritated that
foreign rivals find it easy to win work in the UK while, they claim, many
continental European markets remain heavily regulated. They are particularly
concerned at a sharp rise in the number of UK bridge contracts awarded to
Italian and Spanish companies. They claim that they use cheap subsidised
steel produced in their own countries to undercut competitors.
There were strong protests by British companies and MPs 19 months ago when
Cimolai, an Italian steelwork fabricator, won a Pounds 7m contract to supply
steelwork for the Pounds 300m new river Severn crossing.
The BCSA estimates that Pounds 30m of work, representing roughly half of all
steel road bridge contracts, has been placed with Italian or Spanish
contractors during the past 12 months.
The largest is a 3,600-tonne contract to cross the A406 Angel Road in north
London, awarded to Ensidesa, a Spanish steelwork contractor. Wimpey, the UK
construction group, is the main contractor for the road contract.
BIT of Italy recently won a 1,600-tonne contract for a crossing of the A417
Brockworth bypass near Gloucester for which Amec is main contractor.
Main contractors say they are working for little or no profit margin and
have no choice but to accept the lowest price from steelwork subcontractors.
Initiatives being pursued by the UK government include a quality assurance
scheme requiring British and foreign companies to be certified by a
recognised body that they can meet standards drawn up by the transport
department.
The Department of the Environment is proposing a registration scheme
requiring companies to meet financial, environmental, technical and health
and safety standards before being allowed on tender lists.
Environment officials say construction companies operating in Spain must be
registered before they can do business. Italy also requires companies to
register for various categories of public works.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Second arrest in Schneider inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian investigation into Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of
France's Groupe Schneider, broadened with the announcement yesterday of the
arrest of an Italian businessmen as part of a fraud inquiry involving
Belgian subsidiaries of the electrical engineering company.
Belgian justice officials said yesterday that Mr Valentino Foti had been
detained on the same charges as Mr Pineau-Valencienne. The Schneider
chairman, held in Brussels since his arrest on Friday, is charged with fraud
and falsification of accounts. This follows an investigation triggered by
complaints from minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two Belgian
subsidiaries of the French company.
Mr Foti, 60, appears to be linked to the investigation through his role in
PB Finance, a shell company which used to have interests in mining. He was
the majority shareholder in PB Finance, in which Schneider held a minority
stake through Cofibel.
Groupe Schneider sold its stake in PB Finance earlier this year and has
firmly denied reports in the Belgian press which claim the company may have
been involved in money-laundering.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne and Mr Foti both presented themselves voluntarily in
Brussels to make statements concerning an investigation into the management
of Schneider's Belgian subsidiaries.
They are both due to appear in court tomorrow when a decision will be taken
on whether to prolong their custody.
Industry observers in Paris played down the impact of the events on
Schneider.
'The Belgian companies represent only 5 per cent of the Schneider group
assets which would suggest that the financial effect of these complaints
will not threaten the group as a whole,' said one market analyst. Shares in
the company, which fell by 5.6 per cent on Friday following the announcement
of Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrest, rose yesterday by FFr10 to FFr400.
French businessmen and the media have reacted with dismay to Mr
Pineau-Valencienne's arrest. French prime minister Edouard Balladur
telephoned his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, at the weekend to
discuss the issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK cable companies plan to return to the flotation trail when market
conditions improve. But it would be a mistake to think that better equity
prices, on their own, will do the trick. The rot started when Comcast UK
Partners failed to sell shares at even 15 per cent below the mid-point of
its initial target range.
One can argue that Comcast was foolish to seek a flotation in the US. The US
cable bubble was punctured earlier this year when regulators imposed tariff
cuts. One can also argue that the other cable companies - in particular
TeleWest - represent better investments than Comcast. They enjoy economies
of scale, have made bigger pushes into telephony and have developed their
networks faster.
Still, it will be hard to get the UK cable bandwagon rolling, even for
TeleWest. For a start, the group's financial backers will no longer be able
to tell UK investors that, if they do not pile in, the issue will snapped up
in the US. And while US regulations do not affect the UK industry directly,
it faces regulatory uncertainty of its own.
Investors are likely to be wary of valuations which seem expensive when
judged by the industry's own shorthand valuation yardstick - 'price per
home'. TeleWest's desired capitalisation of Pounds 1.7bn would have equated
to Pounds 500 for each home. Recent trade sales have occurred at much lower
prices.
The cable industry will also have to overcome suspicions of the discounted
cash flow calculations that underlie the industry's more elaborate
valuations. A comparison with Eurotunnel may be unduly pessimistic given
that cable companies are much nearer break-even than Eurotunnel was when
floated in 1987. But a comparison with Vodafone, the principal success of
the discounted cash flow method in UK flotations, goes too far in the other
direction: it was in the black when floated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that two long-term trends
supported the equity market in the 1980s. The steady rise in dividend payout
ratios, recently highlighted by the government, helped support share
valuations. The steady drift of UK pension funds out of bonds and into
equities underpinned liquidity. Whether or not the government moves to
reverse the first trend, pension funds may start to drift back in favour of
bonds.
At the start of the 1980s, the average scheme belonging to the National
Association of Pension Funds had 2.5 active members for every pensioner. By
the end of last year, that ratio had fallen to almost one to one. Industrial
restructuring and the wave of early retirements doubtless accelerated this
process. While there is no reason to expect a further sudden shift in the
balance, the assets of many pension funds are already a poor match for their
liabilities.
Exactly what proportion of funds' liabilities now relate to pensions in
payment is difficult to judge. For the average scheme, though, the figure is
likely to be around one third. While such liabilities would normally be
matched by investing in bonds, pension funds have on average only 11 per
cent of assets held in fixed-interest and index-linked bonds. Large
surpluses built up during the 1980s allowed trustees to ignore the problem.
But with surpluses falling - the reduction in gross funds' tax credit on
dividends contributed to the erosion - the mismatch of assets and
liabilities is more difficult to defend.

<TEXT>
Financial markets were expecting US interest rates to rise this year, even
if they responded badly when they did. They were less inclined to factor in
the more optimistic economic mood in Germany. Helped by rising export
orders, it now looks as though the first quarter's gross domestic product
figures could show surprisingly robust growth. Bond and equity markets must
soon learn to cope without the prop of falling official rates. Indeed, they
may start to wonder when rates will rise again.
When the Bundesbank was operating a restrictive policy, its basic concern
was inflation and it tended to remain unmoved by economic slowdown.
Optimists argue that, conversely, it will now be less worried about economic
recovery as long as inflation continues to fall. On that basis, the easing
could have some way further to go. But inflation is now below 3 per cent and
the fall may decelerate. It is hard for the Bundesbank to justify lower
interest rates while money supply continues to exceed its target by such a
wide margin. At 4.5 per cent, the discount rate is already close to its 4
per cent trough in 1983. It looks unlikely to revisit the 2.5 per cent low
of 1988, which in any case held for only six months.
In the short run, this looks more of a problem for the bond market. Yields
on 10-year paper, which historically tend to average around 4.3 points over
the inflation rate, already assume inflation well below 3 per cent. Factor
in the poor international climate and it is difficult to see why they should
fall back again.
Equities at least have the economic recovery to consider. Earnings should
reap the double benefit of corporate restructuring and increased demand. But
much of this was already reflected in last year's 50 per cent rise. Even the
equity market is likely to flag if high long-term interest rates prove a
drag on the recovery next year, when tax increases will also sap consumer
demand. It would then be scant consolation if weak demand for credit made
the Bundesbank as slow to raise rates as it was to bring them down.

After Friday's 53-point fall, the UK equity market has at least been spared
any further unpleasant surprises over the long holiday weekend. The US was
also closed yesterday, but continental European markets regained some of
their composure. German equities were somewhat lower, but bond markets there
and in France recovered part of the lost ground. Maybe bargain hunters will
appear in London, too, but equities still do not appear to enjoy solid
support. For a start, there is today's MO number to worry about. Second, the
recovery increasingly appears to be gathering strength despite April's tax
increases. Gilts can hardly relish worries about base rates when the
government still has a heavy borrowing programme to complete.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Too soon to rule alone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's Socialist party won an absolute majority in the second round of
the general elections over the weekend. But it will probably do a service to
itself and to the country if it rejects the temptation to go ahead alone.
Instead, the Socialists should seek to attract the Free Democrats into a
broader-based coalition government, even though the price of such a
government would be the sacrifice of the prime ministerial ambitions of Mr
Gyula Horn, the veteran former communist who led his Socialist party to
victory. Despite the fact that voters have given the Socialist party a
powerful vote of confidence, many Hungarians will question the legitimacy of
one-party rule by politicians with roots in the communist past.
There are also doubts whether the party alone would be able to keep to the
difficult path of market-based reform, given the strength of support shown
by the election for traditional socialist policies. Higher social spending,
greater job security, a slowdown in privatisation, and higher taxes on the
emergent business class are the sort of policies which many of the party's
former communist voters and its powerful trade union wing are likely to
demand from a one-party Socialist government.
Such pressures would be diluted if the party, at its extraordinary congress
this coming weekend, demonstrates that it is indeed a reforming, modernising
force in Hungarian political life. It could do this best by endorsing the
market-orientated reform line associated with Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the party's
finance minister.
The most convincing endorsement would be to chose Mr Bekesi himself as the
party's prime ministerial candidate. This would please the Free Democrats
and open the way for a coalition which would be the best guarantee of
reforms needed to reduce the current account and budget deficits, and
continue the modernising process begun by the outgoing Hungarian Democratic
Forum.
Main obstacle
The main obstacle to such an outcome appears to be the understandable
ambition of Mr Horn, who gives every indication of wanting to lead the next
government.
He is undoubtedly a tough and skilled politician and a survivor. As foreign
minister in the last communist government Mr Horn executed the decision to
open Hungary's western borders to East Germans in 1989. This act fatally
undermined the government of the late Mr Erich Honecker and led to the
domino-like collapse of communist governments throughout the region,
including Hungary's own reform-communist regime led by Mr Miklos Nemeth.
Old regime
For that act alone Mr Horn is warmly regarded by many in the west,
especially in Germany, with which he has already indicated a desire for the
closest possible relations once the new government is formed.
But for millions of Hungarians Mr Horn remains a man of the old regime, a
participant in the suppression which followed the Budapest rising of 1956.
His leadership could open up barely healed scars and would be watched
apprehensively by the international community. Foreign investors, who hold
Dollars 25bn of Hungarian debt and have invested Dollars 7bn over the last
four years in what has been perceived as a stable, pro-market reforming
country, would focus a particularly close eye on such a government.
In Poland, under similar circumstances, the victorious Democratic Left led
by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski offered the premiership to the Peasants party as
the price of bringing its junior partner into a coalition. Hungarian
Socialists on the reformist wing of the party in particular will argue at
this weekend's congress that the party must make similar concessions to
bring in the Free Democrats, who made clear before the second round of
voting that they would not serve in a coalition headed by Mr Horn.
Now the Free Democrats' position is weaker because the electorate has given
the Socialists the power to rule alone if need be. Paradoxically, however,
the Socialists probably need the Free Democrats more than ever. A coalition
provides the best way for the Socialists to convert their return to power
into good government for Hungary, and longer-term rehabilitation for a party
which has sole power in its grasp too early for its own good.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Britain's voice in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's performance in standing up for the country's economic policy
interests in the European Union has been at best patchy during recent years.
The government's successes in European bargaining have generally been
negative, shown by its 'opt-outs' over economic and monetary union (Emu) and
social policy at Maastricht in 1991. The UK's tactical position has been
weakened by setbacks such as sterling's exit from the ERM and, more
recently, the fruitless tussle over prospective changes in majority voting
rules.
The government likes to declare that the 'tide of argument' in Europe has
been moving in Britain's favour. Yet such pronouncements are less than
convincing as long as the UK remains impeded - partly because of the Tory
Eurosceptic minority in the House of Commons - from proposing firm policies
to set the EU agenda.
Britain undoubtedly made a significant contribution to agreement on the
single market, but it has had less effect in assuring that the programme's
precepts are properly enforced. In another field of special interest, the UK
has been unable to prod its partners into forging a consensus on necessary
cuts in subsidies in areas like steel.
In view of this less-than-impressive track record, today's letter in the FT
from leading UK industrialists is a timely reminder of the important areas
where Britain ought to be able to muster strong EU support. Important
passages of this mini-manifesto would find as much assent from
industrialists in Germany, France or the Netherlands as from those in the
UK.
Labour deregulation
On policies aimed at promoting further integration and improving prosperity
and employment, there is more agreement than often imagined between the UK
and its EU partners. This was underlined by yesterday's report from
Franco-German experts proposing far-reaching labour market deregulation -
even though the text was pointedly described as 'provisional' by the Paris
government.
Some of this common ground, admittedly, is often obscured by sharp
differences over Europe's long-term goals. Last week, Chancellor Helmut Kohl
said he was certain a single currency would one day be realised, while Mr
John Major restated his scepticism. German opinion polls and shifts in Mr
Kohl's own statements since 1991 make clear, however, that establishing a
single currency has slipped well down the Germans' list of priorities.
On social policy, the UK business community says, with justification, that
full enactment of European employment legislation would damage the outlook
for jobs. In spite of 11 EU countries' support for the social chapter, it is
difficult, however, to detect enthusiasm among member governments for
further action in this field.
Policy realism
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, has expressed disquiet about
deregulation throughout the EU. Yet far from signalling a new wave of
legislation, Mr Delors is demonstrating that countries which sign the social
chapter are in no way barred from improving labour market flexibility. The
apparent agreement, reported today, between the UK and its EU partners on
flexible application of labour legislation to contracting-out is another
sign of new social policy realism.
Across the EU, electorates' desire to promote a Europe a la Maastricht has
fallen during the last three years, partly as a consequence of recession. As
a result of a series of elections, European policies in many EU capitals are
likely to take on a less federalist hue during the next 18 months, more in
keeping with British instincts.
In 1989-90, the UK government was concerned by changes in the post-cold war
balance of power in Europe. Since then, it has not been able to give Britain
a leading role in assuring a sound EU balance of policies. As the time
approaches for the 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty, the UK has a good
chance of increasing its weight in the councils and congresses of Europe.
First, however, it will have to do more to convince its partners that it
wants to make a positive rather than simply a spoiling contribution.

Big picture stuff. But the City University, which is hosting the event on
June 15 as part of its centenary celebrations, has found just the man for
the job. A round of applause please for Professor Clive Holtham, young
accountant of the year 1974, inventor of the Business Flight Simulator,
active innovator in the use of information technology for improved planning,
control and customer service etc . . .
The promotional handout notes that he moved to the City Business school in
1988 after six years as a director of finance and information technology.
Surely, he's not the same Clive Holtham who was director of finance for the

pickle in the sterling interest rate swap market in the late 1980s?

Richard says: 'It is not always best to prescribe the cheapest medicine.
With chronic stomach problems one often gets better results with treatment
by an acid-pumper like Losec.'
No doubt Sir Richard was just displaying his normal clinical honesty. But
Astra, the maker of Losec, is not impressed. It says that something has been

So who did win the war? As the D-day celebrations get under way there seems
to be considerable doubt, according to a poll commissioned by France's Le

Two-thirds of Americans and nearly half the French believe the US did most
to beat the the Nazis. The Germans believe their defeat was jointly
attributable to the then Soviet Union, the US and Britain. Only 18 per cent
of Britons thought that the Americans were the most important factor, whilst
64 per cent of the French believed their Resistance movement was as
important as the Allies in liberating France.
Only thing that everyone agrees on is that the Germans lost.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Observer: A tale of two companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What would Sir John Swire, the president of his family's Far Eastern trading
house, or Sir Ron Brierley, the corporate predator, make of the Ocean Group
today? Both men know the company well. Sir John sat on the board for several
years and Sir Ron once made a bid for the company.
Ocean used to pride itself on the breadth of its management, picking its
chief executive from a band of 'crown princes' groomed for succession. The
late Sir John Nicholson was one, as was Sir Lindsay Alexander. However,
Ocean is down to its last 'crown prince'. After 30 years with the company,
chief executive Nicholas Barber, 53, has handed in his notice and
headhunters are trawling for a successor.
Warning lights start flashing when a sizeable company cannot find its own
chief executive from within. But then Ocean today is a scarcely recognisable
descendant of the Liverpool shipping company formed nearly 130 years ago by
Alfred Holt with the help of another local merchant, John Swire.
There was a time when you could not visit a Far Eastern port without
spotting one of Ocean's Blue Funnel liners and Swire's early growth in the
Far East owes much to Holt's support. But by the 1960s the two companies,
whilst retaining close links, were going their separate ways. Ocean went
public and has been struggling to adapt ever since. Its vulnerability was
obvious to an outsider like Sir Ron Brierley, who made a Pounds 300m bid in
the late 1980s. He lost because City institutions felt Ocean's management
should be given more time to transform the business.
Meanwhile, Swire has prospered as a very private UK family business, albeit
with stakes in two big public companies, Cathay Pacific and Swire Pacific.
Its success in the Far East proves that the decline of an old family
business need not be inevitable.
The next chief executive of Ocean, on the other hand, may have a tough task
proving to the institutions that Ocean still deserves their support if
another Ron Brierley turns up on its share register.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Still warning and encouraging: On the eve of his 90th
birthday, Warburg's Henry Grunfeld gives Ian Hargreaves his views on today's
financial world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Grunfeld plans to celebrate his 90th birthday tomorrow with a day off.
That will, indeed, make it something special; there have not been many
working days off for Grunfeld in the 60 years since he fled from Hitler's
Germany and teamed up with Siegmund Warburg to create what has become
London's leading investment bank, SG Warburg.
Today he works, a portrait of Siegmund over his right shoulder, in a plain
corner of Warburg's offices in the City. At one end of the building,
razor-headed young traders punch keyboards and grab phones. Around Grunfeld,
an oracular stillness sits.
Warburg announced last week that Grunfeld will surrender his position as
president of the bank next year, but he has no plans to change his routine:
weekdays in the office, evenings at home in Belgravia, weekends in his
Surrey country home, talking, reading and listening to music. 'I still come
in each day because I enjoy it, because it's healthy and because I can make
a contribution,' he says. That contribution he sums up in Bagehot's phrase
about constitutional monarchs, 'to advise, to encourage and to warn'.
The years have not decreased the flow of subjects about which he feels
inclined to warn. Whether discussing the 'absolute menace' of hedge funds,
Wall Street-style bonuses or the risky financial edifices of derivatives,
Grunfeld is forthright.
Hedge funds he denounces as anarchic and speculative vehicles. 'I've nothing
against Mr (George) Soros personally; I don't know him, he appears on TV and
makes a nice impression. But if Mr Soros and his hedge fund can effectively
force us to leave the European exchange rate mechanism, there must be
something wrong,' he says. The hedge fund technique reminds him, he says, of
an earlier generation of British stock pushers. 'They would buy quietly a
great number of shares and then make it known that they were buying, so lots
of people follow and the price goes up. That's the philosophy of hedge
funds.'
He discounts the idea, however, that regulators can or should act against
such funds, arguing that 'if there are a few more losses, they will regulate
themselves'. More serious, he suggests, are the increasingly large and
exposed trading positions of many commercial and investment banks. 'That is
quite rightly a worry of the central bankers and the regulators. In America,
we have the situation where banks which have federal deposit insurance are
holding large trading positions. The New York Stock Exchange actually
delayed the opening of trading in Bankers Trust until the bank had made a
statement about rumours of heavy losses. This is an extraordinary event
which has not been sufficiently highlighted.'
The spread of derivatives - complex financial instruments based upon future
commitments to buy, sell or swap financial assets - has, Grunfeld believes,
only compounded the problem by giving traders and their employers a false
sense of security. 'A lot of this business is pure speculation,' he says,
although he thinks that a recent spate of problems with derivatives
contracts involving the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, Metallgesellschaft, Arco
and Dell Computer will cool the over-enthusiasm. 'If more and more customers
are losing money, then the volume will go down.'
For the banks, he says the key is 'complete separation of traders and
accountants', given the long tail of risk that derivatives contracts can
drag behind them. Warburg, he acknowledges, has joined the scramble to amass
derivatives expertise, which plays a crucial part in the design of many
deals for customers, but he argues that Warburg has spent the necessary time
training its accountants and displayed prudence in proprietary trading.
'It's all a question of volume. It is not a question of whether Warburg does
these things, it's a question of how much we are doing.'
As for fat bonuses and remuneration packages, Grunfeld says that years of
watching Warburg salaries dragged skywards by American competitors has not
altered his underlying view that pay systems have lost touch with reality.
'We can't help it', he says of Warburg's own pay levels, recalling a debate
with an American member of the firm about a rumoured Dollars 6m-a-year
contract at a rival bank. 'Why shouldn't a man earn Dollars 6m if he makes
Dollars 50m for his employer?' came the question. 'I say, 'but what if he
loses?' ' says Grunfeld. 'Why, then he is sacked,' says the American. 'That
is the great difference between us,' says Grunfeld. 'If someone here makes a
mistake, we don't sack him, we try to help him so that it doesn't happen
again.'
Grunfeld couples this earnest and unfashionable paternalism with passionate
advocacy of a more patient approach to banking, based upon building
relationships with clients and countries, rather than fighting an endless
succession of contests for the next transaction, based chiefly upon price.
Asked what Warburg has to learn from its competitors, especially the big
American houses it trails in the battle for the so-called 'bulge bracket' of
top business-getters, Grunfeld snorts: 'I wouldn't like us to learn the
pushy and ruthless way that some of the American houses try to get
business.'
Asked about Warburg's strategic priorities, however, he names only one: to
become a more effective global player, with an ever more effective network.
'The global aspect of the financial services industry is something that will
last,' he says, unlike the latest fad in leveraged buy-outs, or emerging
markets. 'I like the New York definition of emerging markets,' he adds,
'that an emerging market is one where, when there is an emergency, they
don't pay.'
He sees the biggest competitive resistance to Warburg on the continent
coming not from the American houses, but from the continental universal
banks, whose tight links with local business are used to harry foreign
investment banks from their turf. 'To me, it is incomprehensible that these
banks should be creditors, shareholders and members of the supervisory board
of their customers,' he says. 'The power these banks have is far ahead of
the American banks.'
Behind all these comments lies half a century of culture-building inside
Warburg. Grunfeld acknowledges that cultural change has been inevitable as
numbers have increased from the dozens he once supervised to the 5,500 who
work for the bank across the world today. But the relatively
non-hierarchical structure of the bank, designed to encourage teamwork and
keep stars happy, is something Grunfeld works hard to maintain. He recalls a
recent conversation with a director in his mid-30s looking for guidance
about the next decade of his career. Grunfeld's advice: 'If you stay here,
you must feel that what you say is being taken into account, that the head
of your department only runs the department, but not you. I believe he left
my room with a happier face.'
Managing large numbers of high-powered, opinionated and ambitious
individuals is of the essence in investment banking. With the announcement
last week that Sir David Scholey is also to step down next year as the
bank's chairman, Warburg faces a shift of generation in its leadership. What
are the qualities the new bosses will need? 'The first thing is a strong
personality,' Grunfeld says. 'As the business has developed, no chairman can
know everything, but he needs to want to be a leader.'
The last time Grunfeld was interviewed by the FT, in 1987, he commented
famously that 'hiring people is similar to buying a tie. You don't buy the
tie when you need one. You buy the tie when you see one and like it.'
Although he still believes in his own instinct for spotting talent, he says
the days when Warburg would spontaneously hire bright journalists or
diplomats in the belief that knowledge of banking could come later are
probably gone.
He retains his faith, however, in one of the bank's better-known recruitment
eccentricities, its use of graphology. In the 1920s, he was working in the
family steel business in Germany and petty cash started to go missing. There
were three suspects, all of whom had worked for the company for more than 15
years. Grunfeld was persuaded to seek the advice of a handwriting expert,
who immediately identified the culprit. Confronted by Grunfeld, the employee
confessed. 'We didn't dismiss him and he never did it again,' he says.
Grunfeld maintains to this day that graphology will reveal flaws in
personality and even health, such as proneness to depression. 'There is not
one case in 60 years where the graphologist has said something that turns
out to be wrong,' he says. 'The practice is regarded as odd in Britain, but
it's widespread in Germany, Switzerland and France.'
He thinks it not altogether untypical of his adopted homeland to discount
the wisdom and experience of foreigners, even, he notes, while being driven
by them from most sections of manufacturing industry. 'Somehow we haven't
woken up to the end of empire,' he says. 'All those jokes about frogs may be
very funny, but it doesn't help. Frenchmen are to be taken seriously. All I
can do is to educate.'
One wonders whether Grunfeld, with his self-discipline and his principles,
would have been attracted to banking if he were now in his 20s rather than
his late 80s. 'Oh yes,' he replies, without hesitation: 'It's the only
business I can think of where you have every 30 minutes a new problem or a
new situation. In industry, it's more or less the same every day.'
He is equally certain that Siegmund Warburg would have wanted none of it.
'He would have accepted the need for the changes, but he wouldn't have liked
it.' His co-founder's genius, he says, was 'that he had ideas. He was really
two or three persons in one. He was a very good banker, but he never wanted
to be a banker, he wanted to be a teacher in a university. He was interested
in many things, in people and politics, as well as having a great knowledge
of banking.'
He admits to not liking the recent account of the Warburg family story, by
the American writer Ron Chernow. 'My real objection is that he leaves you
with the impression that you would rather not have liked to know Siegmund
Warburg. As Goethe said: 'Where there is a lot of light there is a lot of
shade.' That applies to human beings. Siegmund Warburg was an outstanding
person, with a superb instinct.'
How would Grunfeld himself like to be remembered? There is a pause, then a
comment about the formative years of the bank in which Grunfeld became a
confidant of many senior British industrialists. 'I was like a doctor to
them and that's why there will be no memoir. I will leave this world without
telling anybody,' he says. Then another pause. 'So far as my role in the
firm goes, well someone here said it the other day in three words. 'You ran
it.' Well, I did.'
The interview over, Grunfeld shuffles to the door. As we disappear down the
corridor, he's tapping at the monitor outside his office, muttering: 'Now,
what's going on in the stock market?'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Support for Agnew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON J ISRAEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having attended the Lasmo annual meeting as a small shareholder, I feel
the nicest word I can use to describe Robert Corzine's reporting of it
('Lasmo board comes under attack', May 25) is uneven. While there were a few
carping voices, the majority of small shareholders were relieved that Mr
Rudolf Agnew had assumed the chairmanship and there was an overwhelming vote
in support for his appointment.
As far as the alleged violations of the Cadbury Code and cosy rolling
contracts are concerned, the bitterness of those small investors who prefer
to dwell on the mistakes of the past is understandable. Nonetheless, Mr
Agnew made it perfectly clear that there is a new hand at the helm and that
a new philosophy of exclusive focus on shareholder value prevails. Lest the
tone of Mr Corzine's article lend comfort to the Enterprise Oil camp, I am
but one of the vast majority that has no intention of acceding to such a
derisory offer. At current oil prices, there is no bid premium in the stock.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's 'silent industrial majority'
must show support for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord CHALFONT and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, British industry must stand up and be counted in the forthcoming
European election.
There are four key issues which we, as chairmen and chief executives of
leading industrial and business organisations, support and regard as vital
if Britain is to play its full part in Europe, as well as creating jobs and
wealth:
1) We support the development of a single market on the assumption that
Europe remains able to compete successfully in a global marketplace and does
not become 'Fortress Europe'.
2) We believe it is inappropriate to speculate on the formation of a central
bank or a single European currency until it is much clearer how and when the
economic convergence of European states, which vary significantly in
economic and political terms, will be achieved.
3) We believe the full implementation of European employment legislation
would severely damage the competitiveness of British industry in world
markets and increase levels of unemployment. While recognising the
responsibilities of industry to its employees, the British government must
continue to resist the implementation of such legislation as European works
councils and restrictions on working practices.
4) We wholeheartedly support the continuing government commitment to the
geographical expansion of the European Union.
The silent industrial majority must make its voice heard above the political
bickering.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: The ways of Confucius in business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN OGDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Edwards (Letters, May 27) stresses the importance of a
knowledge of the 'Analects of Confucius' in doing business in Taiwan. He
speaks not just for Taiwan but for East Asia, a quarter of the globe.
Maybe only a few scholars are word perfect in the Confucian classics.
Everyone in East Asia inherently understands and follows the basic precepts
of the Confucian Way. Anyone who tries to do business here without that
understanding will probably fail. That Samuel Brittan ('Changing culture of
capitalism', May 25) and other great western commentators deny this is
another instance of how much further the west has still to go to understand
the east.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Map fogs view of Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VINCENT NUTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was much intrigued by the map used to illustrate the front page of
your survey on Ireland published on May 25. The map of Ireland itself is
accompanied in the top left-hand corner by a smaller scale map showing the
area of the main map in relation to the British Isles. Why, I wonder, was
Ireland not shown in relation to a map of Europe? After all, the survey on
Tennessee, published with the same issue, positions that state within the
whole of the Americas.
I do not suppose the FT really regards Ireland as a sort of dependency as
the map seems to imply; could it be that this is an example of the island
mentality which many continental Europeans attribute to the British
stereotype? It certainly smacks of that apocryphal headline: 'Fog in Channel
 -Europe cut off from England.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / The dye is cast by growth and costs: European chemicals
companies are shifting bulk capacity to Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dragon shifted one way, then the other, as it advanced on the Scotsman.
The creature twisted, contorting to the sounds of drums and cymbals, the din
momentarily overwhelmed by the spatter of fireworks.
Then there was silence. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of the UK's top
chemicals company, Imperial Chemical Industries, stepped forward. The dragon
had warded off the evil spirits that could have jeopardised his company's
latest venture: a plant, capable of making 350,000 tonnes a year of pure
terephthalic acid, a plastic used mostly in bottles. Sir Denys could now
open the Pounds 150m factory in Kuan Yin, Taiwan, with confidence.
The ritual was a far cry from ICI's traditional manufacturing centre in the
bleak landscape of the River Tees in the north-east of England. The ceremony
some months ago heralded a trend in the European chemicals industry as it
refines its global strategy, shifting bulk chemicals capacity from the
industrial centres of Europe to the rapidly expanding economies of Asia.
Sir Denys is not the only European chairman opening plants in Asia. His
counterparts from Swiss, German, French and other UK chemicals groups have
been investing in locations as diverse as India in the west, Vietnam in the
east, China in the north and Jakarta in the south. If successful, the
migration could ensure the long-term survival of the European companies. But
it raises serious questions about Europe's prospects as a manufacturing
base.
The reason for the reorientation is Asia's rapid economic growth, explains
Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI chief executive. The buoyancy of the region's
economies is having a knock-on effect on the Asian chemicals market which,
excluding Japan, grew 8 per cent in 1993, according to BASF, the German
group. Such heady progress contrasts with a European chemicals market which
recorded zero growth last year. By the end of the decade, the Asian
chemicals market, including Japan, will be worth Dollars 500bn a year -
about the same as the European or the US market, forecasts BASF.
This expansion is being fuelled by the shift of entire sectors to low-cost
south-east Asian countries. 'The area enjoys high growth rates in textiles,
electronics, and automotive engineering, all of which are significant
customers of the chemicals industry,' says Dr Manfred Schneider, chief
executive of Bayer.
A further factor is that Asian chemicals groups will become serious
competitors to the Europeans in the next decade. By shifting production to
Asia, the Europeans hope to compete effectively. 'A combination of lower
costs and modern technology will enable them (the Asian countries) to become
exporters to other parts of the world. Asia's share of world exports of
organic dyestuffs grew between 1982 and 1991 - just one decade - from 13 per
cent to almost 24 per cent,' says Dr Schneider.
Dr Hans-Helge Stechl, BASF board director responsible for Asia, says the
company is building a dyestuffs plant in Shanghai that will export to the US
and Europe. The group is also constructing a dye plant in Mangalore, western
India.
Sales growth in south-east Asia has been rapid. Ciba, the Swiss group, has
benefited from double-digit growth in turnover in the Asia-Pacific for the
past three years. In 1993, more than 16 per cent of group turnover was
generated in the region. The company plans to increase that proportion to 20
per cent by the late 1990s. Similarly, Bayer's turnover in the Asia-Pacific
area has increased by more than 30 per cent since 1990, and reached DM5.58bn
last year, 14 per cent of group sales.
Capital investment has followed sales. 'At an early stage we realised it
would only be possible to share in the dynamic growth of the market by
committing ourselves to local production,' says Dr Stechl. The company had
invested DM1.2bn in Asia before 1993, but has a further DM1.8bn committed to
new projects in south-east Asia, excluding Japan. It presently invests
between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of its capital spending in the region, a
figure that is expected to rise to between 15 per cent and 20 per cent over
the next few years, according to Dr Stechl.
For ICI, capital for investment over the past three years has been in short
supply. But Asia remains a priority, says Mr Hampel. Last year, the company
spent more on capital projects in the Asia-Pacific than in the UK,
continental Europe or the US.
Most European investment is being put into the fast-growing Chinese market,
which could be worth as much as Dollars 100bn by the year 2000, the same
size as Germany. BASF, which has five joint ventures in China, hopes to have
sales of DM1bn by the end of the decade. Ciba of Switzerland has also set
China as its priority in the region and has invested Dollars 200m there.
One country not benefiting from investment into Asia is Japan. Apart from a
plant to make replacements for ozone-depleting CFCs used in refrigeration
and air-conditioning, opened by ICI this year, little European money is
being invested by chemicals companies in the region's largest economy. This
is partly because of the recession. But the strong yen, high manufacturing
costs, and the migration of the electronics and automotive industries to
low-cost centres elsewhere in Asia, have also contributed.
While European chemicals companies are being lured to the rest of Asia, at
the same time they are being driven away from their home bases by high costs
and what manufacturers perceive as an ever-tightening regulatory
stranglehold.
Dr Schneider warns: 'The main disadvantages we have to face are higher
labour costs and expensive social security systems, coupled with widespread
regulation of environmental affairs by the state. We have to overcome these
handicaps. If we do not, many areas of our business (in Europe) will become
uncompetitive and therefore in danger of being squeezed out of the market.'
Dr Stechl agrees. 'High costs in the established countries are forcing
producers to take evasive action, moving to countries where labour and
capital expenditure costs offer a more favourable economic framework.'
Labour costs in Taiwan are 21 per cent of those in western Germany; those in
Singapore and Hong Kong are 20 and 16 per cent respectively, according to
Bayer.
The consequences of this evasive action are clear. Last year, for the third
year running, capital investment by the chemicals industry in Europe fell,
down 14.3 per cent. Employment continues to decline: since 1990, the number
of jobs in the sector has fallen by 160,000, according to the European
Chemical Industry Council, which predicts a further drop of 60,000 this
year. The prospects for Europe as a manufacturing centre for bulk chemicals
is grim.
While Asia offers the chance to escape from the low-growth lethargic markets
of Europe, industry leaders warn that significant profits could prove
elusive in the short-term. The reality of doing business is challenging,
says Sir Denys. Industrial relations, taxation and foreign exchange problems
all pose difficulties, he says. Some companies have had to pull out.
Hoechst, for example, withdrew from its foray into South Korea - a joint
venture with Lucky Goldstar - because of lack of profitability.
'Anyone who thinks the streets of Asia are paved with gold needs to have his
illusions shattered. It's bloody hard work,' Sir Denys adds. It looks as if
ICI will be using the services of dragons for some time to come.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Hunger not yet sated: The rebound of UK commercial property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK commercial property has staged a remarkable recovery after the worst
recession of the post-war period. Since last summer, property prices have
risen by nearly a quarter.
Yet it is far from being a broad-based recovery. Paradoxically, the rise in
property values has occurred despite continued falls in rents. Letting
boards still litter most cities, testifying to a near-record oversupply of
space and weak demand from tenants.
But investors are undeterred. Once institutional investors became convinced
that property prices had hit bottom, they spent more than Pounds 1bn in the
last three months of 1993. Their appetite for property is far from sated.
The Prudential, the UK's largest life assurer, for instance, is prepared to
spend Pounds 1bn on property if it can find sufficiently attractive deals.
Competition from rival institutions has driven up prices. Scottish Amicable,
the life company, beat the Prudential in the race to buy the Camberley
shopping centre in Surrey by paying Pounds 90m, well above the Pounds 77.5m
asking price. The Equitable Life Assurance company has bought a Reading
office building for Pounds 60m from a subsidiary of Germany's Hypo bank,
which bought it for just Pounds 45m a year earlier.
Property companies, which raised some Pounds 1.5bn in new capital last year,
have also been big spenders. Recently, hundreds of millions of pounds have
been spent on property portfolios by companies such as Imry Holdings,
Hammerson and MEPC.
One of the biggest single players has been the British Land Quantum Fund,
formed last summer out of collaboration between Mr George Soros, the
international financier, and British Land's entrepreneurial chairman John
Ritblat. The fund's latest deal - a Pounds 70.5m purchase of a large office
building in London's Leadenhall Street - has brought its spending to Pounds
500m.
As property prices rise, salaries in the industry are spiralling upwards. Mr
Michael Slade, an ebullient 47-year-old who heads Helical Bar, the
investment and development company, received a Pounds 1m bonus last year
after his company increased net assets per share by 77 per cent.
This trend, together with the re-emergence of some of the movers and shakers
of the last property cycle, brings back memories of the boom at the end of
the 1980s. But there are important differences.
First, there is not yet a return to the days when almost anybody -
regardless of their resources - could become a property speculator. The
banks, which lost billions in the last property downturn, are cautious about
making new loans. Equity is king.
Second, the surge in property values over the past year was not, primarily,
due to high expectations about rising rents, but to a rising bond market. So
far this year the bond market has not been helpful to property prices, which
last year moved up in tandem with bonds. Bond values have fallen sharply,
which has blunted demand, particularly for poor-quality office buildings
with little prospect of rental growth.
As a result, office values edged downwards in April, according to Richard
Ellis, chartered surveyors. Moreover, nervousness about future prospects has
hit the share values of property companies, which fell by an average of more
than 13 per cent this year.
'The market has run out of steam,' says Mr Nick Leslau of Burford, a quoted
property company. 'The recovery so far has been driven entirely by a change
of sentiment, which is vulnerable to shocks,' says Mr John Whalley, director
of property investments at AMP Asset Management, the fund management group.
'If the long-awaited rental growth disappoints, purchases made at today's
prices will look less than astute.'
Investors have not seen much evidence of rising rents - which ultimately are
needed to underpin rising property values. But they can draw comfort from
the fact that rents appear to have stabilised, after falling by a third
since their peak in August 1990.
In some parts of the market, rents could rise quickly. James Capel, a City
stockbroker, believes that rents in the West End of London could rise by as
much as 30 per cent over the next 18 months. This is because there is a lack
of suitable properties to meet tenant's demands. 'There are surprisingly few
options,' says Mr Andrew Sturt, head of property at ICI, who has examined
more than 100 buildings in the search for a new headquarters for the
company.
While it may seem odd that potential tenants have difficulty finding new
premises when there are so many empty buildings in London - more than 9m sq
ft in the West End alone - many empty buildings are too old and poorly
designed to meet tenants' demands.
The downturn in development activity since 1990 has exacerbated this
problem. 'The development famine over the last few years has deprived
markets of the quality and quantity of space that the business recovery will
demand,' says Mr Richard Lay of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
Already, developers are dusting down plans for schemes shelved at the end of
the 1980s. For the most part, developers are cautious; they insist on
winning a commitment from tenants before starting construction. Moreover,
the banks, still licking their wounds from ill-judged lending to the
property sector at the end of the 1980s, are so far unwilling to lend to
developers.
But gradually, speculative developers are getting back in business, having
secured funds from institutions. Mr Slade of Helical Bar, which has a Pounds
100m speculative development programme, argues that the first to get back
into the market will reap the rewards. 'We are going to be there with the
first wave of development and then let others fight it out,' he says.
Land values are starting to respond to the improved prospects for
development: Argent's Birmingham site is now worth more than Pounds 26m,
compared with its net cost of Pounds 1m last summer.
While the return of speculative developers conjures up the spectre of
late-1980s excesses, this time round, the caution of the banks is likely to
restrain the scale of new building. Although the industry is inherently
prone to periods of boom and bust, the signs are that this property upturn
will be relatively muted.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Weak grounds for single currency
defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS JOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse is quite wrong to argue that 'Nearly all economists
agree that (a single currency) would considerably enhance the commercial
attractions of a single European market' ('No sympathy for Eurosceptics',
May 30). Most economists would in fact agree that the merits of a single
currency depend on the technical question of whether or not Europe is, in
the jargon, an 'optimal currency area'.
Given the nature of Europe's sclerotic labour markets - lack of labour
mobility in particular - it is actually quite hard to think of the EU as
something technically suitable for monetary union. Countries that have
similar economic structures may benefit from a common currency but even then
only when other conditions - such as fiscal union - are in place.
The technical issues associated with the creation of a single currency are
often lost in the wider debate over the political attractions of a monetary
union. Eurosceptics have two arguments. First, the EU is not a collection of
similar economies (far from it). Second, Emu is in fact all about political,
not economic, ambitions. Many economists would agree with, for example, the
recently expressed sentiments of Paul Krugman (perhaps the leading economist
of his generation). This is where he explicitly acknowledges the technical
deficiencies of a monetary union but goes on to argue that he nevertheless
thinks a single currency would be a good thing because of the benefits that
would flow from the implied - and necessary - degree of political union.
This is the more honest approach: the agenda for Emu is explicitly political
and is all about federalism; you either want to be part of that or you
don't.
Mr Prowse would have a stronger case if he simply admitted that his belief
in federalism leads him to conclude that the economic risks associated with
a common currency are worth running. Defenders of the single currency are on
very weak ground if they base their arguments on economics alone.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: In the prime of life with Three Tall Women - The
renaissance of controversial Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Edward Albee,
author of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fallen genius of the American theatre is back on his feet again. What
has been a renaissance season for Edward Albee peaked last month when the
66-year-old writer was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, his third, for
Three Tall Women, an autobiographical play that is running at the Promenade
Theatre off-Broadway.
Three Tall Women is the work of a great writer in his later prime: rich and
ruminative, but still exhibiting Albee's trademark capacity to scathe.
Albee grabbed public and critical attention in the early 1960s with his
first plays, strychnine-soaked family dramas filled with dissatisfied people
taking their frustrations out on everyone around them. His merciless view of
married life in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? so shocked the Pulitzer
Prize committee that it chose not to give the Award for Drama in 1963 rather
than give it to Albee's play - the nominating panel's unanimous choice for
the award. It was the only slightly less disturbing A Delicate Balance which
won Albee his first Pulitzer, in 1967.
Albee's longtime interest in the works of Ionesco showed through not only in
his spare, often barely linear dialogue, but also in his penchant for the
absurd situation: Seascape, which won him his second Pulitzer in 1975,
features as main characters a married couple of life-sized lizards.
As Albee's work became more abstract and, in some cases, self-indulgent, he
fell into critical and popular disrepute among the New York mainstream. He
found a second artistic home in academic and regional theatres, and in
Europe: Vienna's American Theatre was the first producer of both Marriage
Play, in 1987, and Three Tall Women, in 1991.
The current interest in Albee's work at home was sparked by the tiny
Signature Theatre Company off-Broadway, which devotes each season to the
work of one playwright.
The New York premiere of Marriage Play launched Signature's Albee season
last autumn, followed by several evenings of shorter plays - some moody and
abstract vig-nettes, others fully fleshed-out one-acts - written in the
1960s and 1970s. Though the routes they take are different, all of these
shorter plays seem part of a journey into the looking-glass of experience
that has lent Albee, in his later efforts, a deeper understanding of -
perhaps even compassion for - human foibles.
This is not to suggest that he has gone soft on us. Jack and Gillian, the
couple whose union dissolves in the course of Marriage Play, might be
Virginia Woolf's George and Martha 15 years on - no longer swinging machetes
in verbal combat but twisting daggers.
Yet there seems in Marriage Play a striving for, and achieving of, some kind
of enlightenment, even if the revelations are of the bleakest sort: 'We come
to the moment when we understand that nothing has made any difference,' says
Jack, 'that the failure is built into us, that the greatest awareness gives
to the greatest dark.'
In Three Tall Women, Albee delves deeper yet into his characters' psyches,
smoothly melding his interest in formal abstraction with his roots in
naturalistic family drama.
In the play's first half, we meet a cranky, spirited dowager in her nineties
(a character based on Albee's adoptive mother, with whom he had a troubled
relationship), her long-suffering 50-ish carer, and her 26-year-old female
lawyer who has come to the elder woman's home to put her affairs in order.
The play's heart is in the second half, which features a simple but
effective staging device.
The figure of an old woman lies in a bed upstage, while downstage the
actresses portray the older woman at three crucial stages in her life -
callow and selfish youth, hardened middle age and sadder-but-wiser old age.
They rant, reminisce, bicker and philosophise while a fourth character, the
woman's young gay son who left her long ago, enters and sits silently by his
dying mother's bedside, his wordlessness evoking the extremity of their
estrangement.
Piecing together a total picture of this woman from the bits of information
we are given is an engrossing experience, and one, we gradually realise,
more like real life than straightforward dramatic exposition.
Lawrence Sacharow's understated production at the Vineyard Theatre allows
the writing - at turns poetic, thoughtful and deliciously barbed - and the
actresses' marvellous performances to carry the evening.
Jordan Baker gives a fine and detailed performance as the younger woman, but
cannot help but be overshadowed by her elders. Marian Seldes, never the
subtlest of actresses, brings a bold theatricality to her performance as the
middle-aged woman - sweeping gestures, exaggerated postures, rolling eyes -
that is entirely appropriate and a wonder to watch. Myra Carter, as the
dowager herself, is mercurial - girlish, then dottily forgetful, then
fiendishly cruel. Like the play itself it is a performance full of venom,
full of insight, and still very full of life.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: A talent heavy on evasions - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rakhmaninov used to claim, no doubt simplistically, that every good piece
had a uni-que high point. The performer had to locate that, and adjust the
musico-dramatic structure around it. The pianist Ian Fountain (five years
ago, at 19, the youngest winner of the Artur Rubinstein competition) seems
to have a natural bent towards the other extreme. At the Wigmore last week,
he displayed an almost Tantric knack for evading the climax.
There were nicely controlled swells, and every sustained, high-tension,
note-crammed passage rang out brilliantly and in due course subsided -
without ever having marked a clear peak. In Schubert's last A major Sonata,
celestially discursive, this curious penchant passed well enough for
judicious even-handedness, refusing to impose any simple dramatic form upon
the com-poser's teeming, interrelated ideas. Besides, the evasiveness cast
unexpected lights in familiar places, and the pianist's grasp of the purely
musical structure was confident and affectionate.
In the three biggish Liszt pieces of the second half - the neglected but
memorable B minor Ballade, the Harmonies du Soir from the Transcendental
Etudes and the Vallee d'Obermann from the Annees - the shy quirk seemed
odder. They all revel in the same decadent harmonic climate (which Fountain
rendered quite luminous); they also share the same pattern, basically
rondo-form with elaborations and pianistic titivations. What should make
them pungently distinct is their individual dramatic trajectories:
extra-musical, if you like, but crucial to their effect.
Without honest climaxes, however, there are no clear trajectories. Under
Fountain's cultivated hands, Liszt's dramatic studies melted into a muchness
 -a series of artful panels, a sensitive survey of a fresco. To make their
own stamps they wanted only a tougher forward sweep, such as gut-instinct
might supply; but if Fountain has gut-instincts, he suppressed them with
eerie success. This admirable young pianist will be more exciting when he
lets himself go.
A word of thanks to the excellent Ondine Ensemble, whom I heard last week in
the Purcell Room. Besides Messiaen's evergreen Quatuor pour le fin du temps
(their collective Danse de la fureur made electrifying compensation for
heartfelt string-solos that missed the ultimate degree of security), they
offered three earlier French pieces that devotees like me had despaired of
hearing.
A youthful Milhaud quartet from his Brazilian years proved bluntly original
and muscular, with mere traces of the Latin rhythms that inform his
better-known Saudades do Brasil from the same time. Dear old Charles
Koechlin's late Sonate a sept (op. 221]), really an airy chamber-concerto
for oboe, displayed his usual unpretentious originality. Best of all was
Roussel's 'last work', his sprightly Elpenor suite for flute and strings.

<TEXT>
There is conceptual art and conceptual art. The fatuities of what we have
come to call it in its limited sense are only those of its exclusive and
self-conscious avant-garde extreme.
Yet all art, and all true craft too, must have something of the mind, of
sentience and intention to them, some informing idea, at least at the
outset, or the activity and engagement are nothing more than mindless
occupational therapy. Pace Saint John, all things were made by it, that is
to say the idea, and without it was not any thing made that was made. The
artist declares his initial interest and method, the patron his requirement:
the rest is a matter of emphasis.
It is only when that informing idea alone is taken as the justification of
the work, and the form left unconsidered to shift for itself, that
conceptualism becomes limited, pretentious and self-serving. For the rest,
we can only wait upon results as they come, to take on their merits, for
better or worse. So it is that within the scope of conceptualism in its
broader sense, these 30 years past, we have had isms and attitudes that have
produced work of real and lasting quality and interest, for all that it has
come sailing in under the Jolly Roger of the experimental, the radical and
avant-garde. Minimalism, for example, with its reduction to the simplest
physical presence or statement; systems art, in which form is the function
of process and the application of a set of rules; nature art or arte povera,
of which the point is to celebrate and exploit the qualities of found and
natural objects and materials.
Roger Ackling, whose largest show in this country in number of works
exhibited is filling the Annely Juda Gallery, contrives in his quiet and
self-effacing way to engage fruitfully with all these conceptual isms at
once. His Flooded Margins of his title are, in this instance, the beaches
and foreshores of East Anglia, from which he takes the driftwood fragments
that are his tabulae rasae. Only a pair of wretched, derelict plimsolls here
seems out-of-place. His principal tool is the burning glass, which makes him
entirely dependent upon the sun, just so long as it shines. He works where
he is, while the moment lasts, the rules which he accepts - as opposed to
imposes upon himself  - the arbitrary ones of weather and sunshine and
whatever the object is that chance throws in his way.
But that is not to say that the work itself is arbitrary or automatic, left
to run on of itself. Rules and process may together determine its nature and
appearance in the general sense - just as a painting may be a thing of paint
on canvas - but its singularity lies in what the artist alone makes of it.
And Ackling's creative signature is unmistakable. He moves the glass
laterally across the surface of the wood, the scorched line steady and set
at regular intervals. But even here, innate and intuitive differences and
decisions reveal themselves.
The wood itself is hard or soft, to be worked in its appropriate way. It is
washed clean perhaps, or perhaps dense with a surface history of old paint,
rusty nails, vestigial hinges, and all to be taken into account. The
compositions are thus as various as the objects themselves, subtle and
responsive, for all that Ackling's approach is insistent in its formality -
frontal, architectural, hieratic. The horizontal bands set up a moire shift
against residual streaks of old paint or tar on a weathered disc: a pristine
shadow is left within the linear system by the removal of the protective
skin of old metal: the scorched diptych holds attention upon the clean,
sharp gap between its component panels: surfaces are disrupted, systems
interrupted, contradicted.
But in spite of all such explanation and special pleading, all this order
and process, all this conceptualising, what we end up with is a set of odd
and ambiguous objects, beautifully made under the artist's own hand, and
each one just as he thought it might be, not at the moment he started, but
when he left off. None of them are exactly big, many of them tiny. They are
what they are, no more, no less, rich in the associations and references we
may care to bring to them, but that is entirely up to us. These things are
like fetishes and talismen, perhaps, trophies of long-forgotten rituals and
special moments, half-remembered.
For the artist himself such memories are naturally more particular, but then
he alone knows the place where he picked up his trophy, and how he felt
about it, and how warm the sun was as he marked it for his own. And he is
artist enough, romantic and imaginative, to keep his counsel. The boring,
portentous conceptualist would hardly resist spelling out the message.
Ackling, for his part, is saying nothing, and good for him.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Arts: Controlled turmoil - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We were promised one set of solo manoeuvres from leader/pianist McCoy Tyner
before the big guns blew in to the Festival Hall. In the event, the
orchestra was in full sail after just two brief standards.
From there on in it was grit the teeth and surrender yourself to the gale
forces of a nine-piece brass section fronted by three reeds and steered by a
weighty rhythm section. For those jazz fans who are braced by a big band at
full tilt, an evening with this McCoy Tyner ensemble is equal to a week at
Cowes for blowing out the cobwebs.
In the game of name association that plagues more than a few individualists
in jazz, Tyner is forever linked with the memory of John Coltrane, thanks to
a 20-album partnership which includes items of jazz history such as A Love
Supreme. Tyner left 'Trane in the mid-1960s as the saxophonist began moving
further into the left field and instead devoted himself to refining his
turbulent post-bop style of piano playing in small and large group settings.
Straight-backed and two-handed, Tyner plays fast and fortissimo now.
He hooks mightily into the keys with the right, the left erupting into
showers of chords in a style that can encompass stride and frenetic bop in
the course of a single solo.
But last week, with the (amplified) firepower of 15 other pieces vying for
earspace, it was too difficult to discern the sharp nuances of the leader's
playing. Instead, the brute force of the brass was the focus of attention.
Trombonists Steve Turre and Frank Lacy combined classical colour with New
Orleans vigour to crowd-pleasing effect; the rasping tenor of John
Stubblefield, cheeky in a Lester Young hat, put a skew on Blues On The
Corner.
Jerry Gonzalez, as fourth trumpet, added to the controlled turmoil with an
extended conga solo.
The arrangements provided little in the way of changing dynamic, save for
some sweet harmonies in Tyner's Juanita. A big band can stimulate in many
ways: last week we heard only the invigorating one.

Today's Life Stories (8.00 BBC1) is one of those episodes that make you
touch wood and mutter 'There but for the grace ..' In the 1960s Alan
Crabtree left Rochdale for South Africa. His career in banking progressed,
he met and married Tish, and they had children. Then he unearthed a fraud at
work and, as seems to happen in these matters, lost his job and his home.
Back in the UK in 1986 the family found themselves in a council flat in
Bethnal Green. Today they are still there, with Alan working as a courier
and Tish bringing in more money from her job in a City optician's.
BBC1 is launching a new drama and, having looked at what is provided
elsewhere, channel controller Alan Yentob and his colleagues have decided
that what we need is a series about a policeman. Yes really. But don't
worry, The Negotiator is no ordinary policeman, gosh no. How about this for
novelty: Charlie King uses unorthodox methods but his superiors overlook it
because he gets results. King is played by Brian Cox who has not played an
idiosyncratic policeman since 'Grushko' (9.35).

European Court

<TEXT>
Air France's appeal against the European Commission's 1992 decision
approving the acquisition by British Airways of a 49.9 per cent stake in TAT
European Airways, has been dismissed by the Court of First Instance.
The acquisition, about which the Commission was notified under the EC Merger
Regulation, also gave BA the option to buy before April 1 1997 the remaining
50.1 per cent retained by its parent, TAT SA.
The Commission decided the transaction was a concentration with a Union
dimension but raised no serious doubts as to its compatibility with the
common market.
BA had no share of the French domestic market. TAT EA had only 3.8 per cent
of it, while Air France together with Air Inter had 84.9 per cent. BA and
TAT EA overlapped on the Paris/London and Lyons/London routes. Because they
were not substitutable, the Commission treated each airport pairing as a
relevant market for the purpose of assessing market dominance.
The combined market shares of BA and TAT EA on these routes exceeded 50 per
cent and on the route between Gatwick and Lyons there was no effective
competition. However, the parties undertook to make slots available to
competitors at Heathrow and Gatwick airports where new entry was otherwise
impossible.
In the light of the shareholders agreement and agreed business plan which
covered strategic commercial decisions, the Commission concluded that BA and
TAT SA exercised joint control over TAT EA. Key decisions required the
approval of at least one of the board members appointed by each shareholder.
The agreement was to last for 6 1/2 years until April 1 1999 if the option
was not exercised. The Commission considered that sufficient indication of
the durability and permanence of the change to the structure of the parties.
On the other hand there was no risk of co-ordination of behaviour between
competitors which remain independent because TAT SA left the market in which
TAT EA operated. BA itself was not in competition because it exercised
substantial influence (industrial leadership) over the common subsidiary,
TAT EA.
The main criticisms of the Commission's decision made by Air France were
that the Commission had not recognised that BA had sole control over TAT EA
on the basis of the purchase option and that the relevant market was defined
too narrowly.
The Court first said Air France had sufficient standing to appeal the
Commission's decision although there was no formal complaint procedure under
the Merger Regulation. Applying by analogy the European Court of Justice's
approach to standing in state aids cases, the CFI found that Air France had
participated sufficiently in the Commission's procedure and was the main
competitor affected by the acquisition. The CFI ruled that the Commission
was right to conclude TAT EA was jointly controlled by reference to the need
for both parents to take strategic decisions and the fact that TAT SA had a
50.1 per cent holding. These were the circumstances of fact and law which
the merger regulation required the Commission to take into account. The
ultimate purpose of BA to integrate TAT EA into its international
operational network, was not among them. Nor was the future and hypothetical
possibility that BA would gain sole control by exercising the purchase
option.
The coincidence in the date by which the option had to be exercised and the
date for liberalisation of air transport cabotage was not such as to justify
the conclusion that it was inevitable BA would exercise its option.
The CFI also upheld the Commission's definition of the relevant market as
the services between the airport pairs primarily affected by the
acquisition, namely London/Paris and Lyons/London.
The Commission was required to examine whether the merger in question
created or strengthened a dominant position which resulted in a significant
impediment to effective competition. Air France had no grounds to complain
because it never even suggested that the acquisition would have such an
effect on a more widely defined market.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Rolls-Royce defeated by shareholders -
Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt by Rolls-Royce to buy out the listed preference shareholders in
one of its member companies, Northern Engineering Industries, against their
will, has been defeated in the Court of Appeal.
Rolls bought Northern in 1989. In January last year it called an EGM to
authorise a reduction of its share capital by repaying and cancelling its
preference shares. Rolls, as the holder of all ordinary shares, passed the
resolutions. Commercial Union, which held some preference shares through a
nominee, objected.
The Appeal Court upheld that objection. It said the attempt to buy out the
preference shareholders was not in accordance with their rights. The case
hinged on Northern's articles of association, which entitled preference
shareholders to a separate class meeting to approve any 'reduction in
capital'. Northern argued that repaying the whole of the paid-up capital on
the preference shares was not a 'reduction'. The court disagreed.
Mr Edward Walker-Arnott, senior partner of City solicitors Herbert Smith,
said the case had established 'an important point of principle for all
institutional shareholders'. Many listed companies have articles protecting
preference shareholders' rights.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Knowledge on the network - Electronic
highways can help lawyers improve the service they offer - and win new
clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD SUSSKIND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international business world is buzzing in anticipation of electronic
information superhighways - but are business lawyers prepared for this
telecommunications revolution?
The daily lives of lawyers are dominated by the processing and transfer of
information - so information technology could help them improve the service
they offer and give their firm competitive advantage in the legal services
marketplace.
Much of a lawyer's job involves the transfer of information - on
legislation, case law, client information, accounting and management
information, and in-house know-how - to clients, barristers, other law firms
and the courts.
Any lawyer with a computer and a modem can exchange messages and documents
with similarly equipped colleagues and clients. Lawyers can also search
external legal databases and offer clients access to information held on
their own firms' systems.
If this is done with technical proficiency, appropriate procedures and
sensible security precautions, the business benefits for clients are clear -
a less costly, more responsive, better focused and more controllable legal
service.
Why then are many lawyers ignoring the potential of recent advances in
communications technology?
There is some justification for caution, even cynicism. There have been a
number of attempts over the years, in the UK and internationally, to deliver
general-purpose, electronic networks for lawyers, all of which have
foundered.
These networks or systems have tended to be opaque to non-specialists,
incapable of integration with working practices, and insufficiently useful
to merit persistence in overcoming these shortcomings.
Some law firms have not been deterred completely by the disappointments of
the various network projects, and have themselves explored less ambitious
avenues, such as internal electronic mail, direct communication links with
some clients and even collaboration among international groups of firms.
However, if the legal profession is to move towards a more generic network -
its own legal information highway - experience from other information
services markets suggests that there are three critical success factors:
availability of useful information; simple technology to deliver the
information; and, from the outset, a critical mass of committed users.
Two recent initiatives seem to have recognised these factors - Lexis Counsel
Connect (LCC) and Legal Information Network (Link).
LCC was created by American Lawyer Media, the US legal publisher, and is now
offered in collaboration with Mead Data Central, the provider of the legal
information service, Lexis. Launched in early 1993, it is described as an
electronic network through which law firms, for a monthly fee, can make
their memos, newsletters, case notes and other work available to in-house
company legal advisers.
These users can also access various directories - of lawyers, law firms and
expert witnesses - and they can use the system's message exchange, document
transfer and conferencing facilities.
While LCC seems primarily to be a tool for American attorneys and their
clients, Link is targeted at the UK market. Scheduled for release in
mid-1994, Link is being promoted as an online network for lawyers. It has
been developed by Legalease, the UK legal publisher.
Legalease plans to distribute 50,000 free copies of Link software to
solicitors, barristers, judges and lawyers working in commerce and industry.
The package offers access to current legal news, case reports, periodicals,
legal directories and forms, as well as messaging, document transfer and
conferencing facilities similar to those of LCC.
Link will also allow direct ordering of law books and access to some other
external information services.
The two systems have much in common. Neither is offered by conventional
legal publishers, specialising in traditional legal scholarship and source
materials. Rather, they are distributed by innovative, modern information
service providers, which recognise that lawyers have information needs
extending beyond traditional law books to less formal legal knowhow and to
data about law firms and lawyers.
Link is likely to prove more popular than LCC in the UK, largely because the
information it holds and the underlying approach to design is more
UK-oriented. Whether either service succeeds will depend largely on keeping
the information useful and easily accessible to non-technical users, and on
establishing a critical mass of satisfied and committed users.
For many lawyers the main motivation for using systems such as Link or LCC
will be the demands of clients who have become convinced of the benefits,
and who begin to insist on doing business this way (hence, LCC's and Link's
focus on in-house lawyers). In turn, this could result in radical change for
the legal profession.
Consider the challenge for a construction lawyer in this new era. Rather
than confining work on, say, collateral warranties to drafting them and
advising on their impact in given circumstances, a law firm might compile
guidance notes on this subject and make them available to all users roaming
the electronic legal highways.
A firm's expertise would be widely promoted in this way; potential clients
could learn about the subject without always instructing legal advisers; and
those who later want more focused counsel may turn to those lawyers whose
initial overview has proved useful and impressive.
A strong business imperative emerges for those firms hesitating today over
whether to contribute to such networks. Failure to participate in the
emerging electronic legal marketplace might mean lost opportunity -
spontaneous awareness of a law firm's specialities may soon be derived from
users' experiences while using the online services; and invitations to
tender and requests for proposals will inevitably be distributed through
this medium.
A glimmer can be seen here of a new legal marketplace, for which lawyers
will package their knowledge as information products, not immediately
discarded after use (as effectively happens with most current legal advice),
but as commodities capable of attracting new clients and being reused on
numerous occasions by different clients.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Focus on training in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by a recent survey of European business attitudes, the UK government
is right to focus on training, the only area to receive significant new
money as a result of last week's competitiveness white paper.
But according to the latest Grant Thornton European business survey* 19 per
cent of UK companies saw no need for training. Only 16 per cent of UK staff
received training in the last year, about the same as the Germans and Dutch,
behind the Austrians and Danes, but more than the Italians or French.
Cost and time were the main reasons training was limited; lack of government
support was seen as the least of the obstacles.
Grant Thornton is running a conference on June 24 in London aimed at
equipping companies with a practical understanding of the European market.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Keep family and firm
together - A feud among relatives is especially harmful when they own a
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALDEN LANK and MONICA WAGEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once a family that owns a business gets down to serious feuding, both the
familial ties and the company are at risk. One remedy is to set up a 'family
council' - a practice which has been adopted by some continental European
companies. Its aim is to reach consensus on difficult issues.
The family and the company are two disparate systems. The family invokes the
idea of stability, caring, co-operation and fidelity; the company focuses on
change, evaluation, competition and efficiency.
Family proprietors have to find ways to minimise the inevitable and
dangerous conflicts between the business and the family - or face the risk
of a commercially damaging argument. An effective family council comprises
chosen members of the owning family that meet regularly to discuss concerns
of the family as a family as well as the family business.
The council provides a forum that can discuss issues such as: what do we
stand for as a family?; what is our responsibility to each other and to the
outside world?; and what is the family's role in relation to the business?
The council should encourage shareholders, heirs, spouses and other family
members to talk to each other, enabling them to anticipate problems, such as
a lack of liquid assets or succession, and to seek equitable solutions.
The very existence of a council also serves the purpose of reminding
employees of the family's continued interest in and concerns for the
enterprise.
A family council that shares anecdotes about, say, the founder or episodes
in the company history keeps alive and refines the traditions that the
family - and the business - value. The council can pass these to the next
generation, while instilling a sense of responsibility towards company and
community.
Family council meetings are appropriate for discussing philanthropical
objectives, contributions to cultural schemes, improving the company's image
by sponsoring social activities, and so on.
It can inculcate among family members the notion that the privilege of
ownership brings financial advantages but also generates responsibilities.
A family council is one of the best ways to help the business family to
explore what ties them together - and that helps to prevent conflicts that
could harm the company. The council can also develop a family spirit that
encourages consensus as well as effective and constructive communication.
The tricky issue of transferring ownership and management to the next
generation is probably the most significant factor in the demise of family
companies. It is important that the ambitions of children, expectations of
the retiring generation, the option to sell or merge and the repurchasing of
shares, to name a few debating points, are considered and studied freely by
the council.
Precise rules - such as age, education, training and experience - should be
laid down and observed when family members take certain jobs in the company.
Conditions for promotion, transfer and leaving should be made explicit. The
selection process of a new chief executive officer, whether or not a member
of the family, may also be eased by discussion in the il.
Many family company boards of directors exist to rubber stamp decisions or
to take an advisory role. Such arrangements suit certain companies, but at
some point the composition of the board can make the difference between
success and failure.
The effectiveness of boards whose membership only reflects various interest
groups in the family can be seriously hampered. Family councils can be an
excellent forum for determining the ideal number and qualifications of board
members, family or non-family, thus increasing the board's professionalism
and effectiveness. Some families use their council for choosing who
represents the family on the board.
Resistance to forming a family council tends to come from those who have
power and responsibility in the company. They do not like sharing
information because they fear criticism and loss of authority. But these
concerns can be allayed by keeping to some rules.
A family council should not be used for solving problems directly linked to
management of the company. Day-to-day operation of the business is not a
suitable subject for debate by the council. This means drawing clear lines
between the family and the company that are understood by family members and
top management.
A family council must not intrude on the functions of the board or of the
general management, but should keep to its distinct role - defining and
preserving certain family values, both as a family and as owners of the
business.
It is particularly unfortunate if a family council is exploited for
influencing or even manipulating certain members of the family to gain
advantage in purely personal matters. The council is effective only if the
common interests and the objectives of such meetings have been clearly
stated - perhaps in a document - a kind of constitution or mission for the
family.
This would set out the values and aims that the family adheres to and the
way they should be expressed towards the company and the community. It would
be the basis for fixing objectives and practical strategies, and for
steering a joint effort.
Family councils are not a cure-all and must be tailored for each family and
its business. What they do offer is a formal way of getting relatives to
talk to each other usefully and make better business decisions.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Permission to proceed -
Local planning officials can be potential allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month South Tyneside councillors in the north of England will try to
resolve a nine-year planning wrangle.
They will consider an application by Mayflower Glass, a local company that
has twice won the Queen's Award for Export for its decorative glassware, for
retrospective planning permission for its storage warehouse and ancillary
buildings, part of a former Ministry of Defence depot on green belt land
bought in 1985.
Mayflower Glass says the controversy has left it in limbo. Its expansion
plans are blocked, and 100 jobs are threatened should it be forced to vacate
the warehouse and use part of its nearby factory, outside the green belt,
for storage.
The problem, which has already caused two public inquiries, is a headache
for the company and the council. But, says Jed Griffiths, president elect of
the Royal Town Planning Institute, time-consuming dogfights can be avoided
if businesses treat the planners as potential allies.
'I see planning as a positive force, maintaining a balance between local
interests, environmental concerns and the need to regenerate the economy,'
he says. This, he admits, is not how many businesspeople view it. 'There is
still a lot of suspicion and mistrust of planners.'
Griffiths, formerly chief strategic planner with East Sussex County Council,
concedes some planners may be too 'finicky'. But he believes current changes
in the planning regime in England, described by the Department of the
Environment as a move to a 'plan-led system', should make it easier for
companies to understand the planning context in which they are operating and
avoid pitfalls.
By 1996, all local planning authorities must have in place district-wide
local plans, looking at least five years ahead. 'The new system puts the
development plan at the centre of things - it's the framework,' says
Griffiths.
Many of these plans, called Unitary Development Plans in metropolitan areas,
are currently undergoing public consultation. Companies should take an
interest, says Griffiths, as this could affect what they will be able to do
at their existing premises.
For those seeking sites, now or in the future, his motto is simple: be
positive and consult the planning authorities first. At the very least, this
can save wasted time in fruitless applications. And, with local authorities
increasingly active in economic development, companies may find a warmer
welcome than they expected.
Important information arising from these discussions is worth getting in
writing, just in case. 'Too many conversations take place in the rugby
club,' observes Griffiths.
Nor should companies forget that the democratic process involves councillors
as well as planners. Kenneth and Jill Wheeler, who run a pet crematorium
near Langley Park, County Durham, discovered this to their cost when they
decided to combine an expansion of their small business with an improvement
of their facilities to meet new environmental legislation.
Derwentside district planners recommended the go-ahead for the Wheelers'
plans: the councillors, lobbied by locals worried about the issue of
incineration, rejected the application. The Wheelers won their case at a
public inquiry, but it cost them anxiety, wasted time and Pounds 20,000 in
solicitors' and consultants' fees.
In the case of Mayflower Glass, a proposed modification in the currently
very restrictive national green belt guidelines may come to the rescue.
The government has proposed that the re-use of existing, redundant buildings
in the green belt should not be refused without 'specific and convincing'
reasons, a change intended to tackle the problem of sites like MoD depots
and psychiatric hospitals.
A final decision on this modification is expected in the autumn but
Griffiths' basic dictum still holds true. 'Land use planning is all about
being in the right place.'

Guy McCracken, 45, an executive director of Marks &amp; Spencer, has resigned as
a non-executive director of the TSB Group in order to avoid any possible
conflicts of interest as Britain's most profitable high street retailer
expands into the financial services sector.
M&amp;S entered financial services in 1984 when it launched its chargecard. It
added a unit trust management company in 1988 and started offering personal
loans. Earlier this year it announced that it was entering the pensions and
life assurance market. In its latest financial year operating profits from
financial activities rose 26.4 per cent to Pounds 41.7m.
McCracken joined the TSB board in October 1991 and was the bank's youngest
non-executive director.
McCracken's place on the TSB board has been filled by Paddy Linaker, 59, who
retires in July after seven years as chief executive of M&amp;G, the fund
management group. Linaker (left), a chartered accountant, started his career
with Esso Petroleum and joined M&amp;G in 1963.

FT  31 MAY 94 / People: Last of the old guard at Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Watkins, 48, senior partner of the Hong Kong office of Linklaters &amp;
Paines, is to be Trafalgar House's top legal expert. He will join the group
in October as an executive director and is expected to fill a slot on the
board currently occupied by Ian Fowler who has been company secretary since
1962.
Fowler, 58, who joined the board in 1984 and is expected to retire at the
end of the year, is the last of the old guard who served under Sir Nigel
Broackes and Lord Matthews, the founders of Trafalgar House.
Hongkong Land, which bought a 25 per cent stake in Trafalgar House last
year, has been changing the top management team and Watkins' appointment
bears all the hallmarks of the group's new owner.
He joined Linklaters in 1967 and has been senior partner of the firm's Hong
Kong office since 1986. Among the many projects he has been involved in are
the Macau International airport, Hong Kong's second cross-harbour tunnel and
the privatisation of New Zealand Telecom.
Trafalgar House chief executive Allan Gormly will be replaced soon by Nigel
Rich, the former managing director of Jardine Matheson, an affiliate of
Hongkong Land. Gormly, who takes over as chairman of Royal Insurance in
August, is to be a joint deputy chairman of the group along with Sir Charles
Powell, who joined Jardine Matheson after he retired as an adviser to the
former British prime minister. They take up their new roles at the end of
September replacing Alan Clements, the current deputy chairman. Clements
remains on the board.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Technology: Forecasters feeling under the weather - Nice
days for a white wedding are still unpredictable, despite advances in
meteorology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ability to control the weather has long been the stuff of science
fiction novels. But real scientists have a hard enough time predicting
conditions more than a couple of days ahead. A Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.8bn)
modernisation programme at the US National Weather Service may soon change
that.
'Within the next 10 years, very accurate 10-day forecasts will be
commonplace,' predicts Bruce Schwoegler, a meteorologist for WBZ TV in
Boston. 'You'll see them on the nightly news and get them in the morning
paper.'
The National Weather Service recently launched a weather satellite which
will provide information on temperatures and cloud formation every 15
minutes, 24 hours a day. Resolution will be 4km instead of the 8km offered
by older models. The satellite uses infra-red imagery, which enables it to
see in darkness, and will be on-line by the end of the year.
The service has also been investing in new generation Doppler radar, which
provides information detailed enough for scientists to detect swarms of
insects.
'The Doppler actually allows us to see inside storms, measure wind gusts and
the exact amount of precipitation that's falling,' says Barbara Konrad, a
meteorologist with Channel 56 in Boston. The Weather Service plans to have
175 Dopplers in place in the US by 1996, at a total cost of about Dollars
437m.
The new systems will be well worth their high prices, says the Weather
Service. A study by the National Institute of Science and Technology
predicted the total Dollars 4.2bn investment in modernisation would pay for
itself within 16 to 18 months. Uncertainty about the weather can be
expensive.
Weather delays cost the aviation industry Dollars 1.5bn last year, according
to the US Commerce Department. Farmers suffered even more, losing some
Dollars 20bn in crop damage in 1993. 'That's more than the entire corn
(maize) crop was worth,' says Frank Lepore, a public affairs specialist at
the National Weather Service.
Marine transport and construction are other sensitive sectors. With more
knowledge about forthcoming weather events, the Weather Service hopes many
of these losses can be avoided.
'For every 1ft rise in the Portland River in Oregon,' explains Lepore, 'the
river can take Dollars 100,000 in extra cargo business. If they know ahead
of time how much precipitation there is going to be, they can call the barge
haulers and take full advantage of a heavy rainfall'. Better weather
predictions would give a boost to the information sector as well.
A substantial industry based on weather forecasts already exists in the US.
Local news programmes say weather forecasts are one of the main attractions
for viewers. Computer services such as Internet and CompuServe offer
detailed weather information to subscribers, and numerous fax and telephone
services provide specialised forecasts to boaters, skiers, farmers and
weather buffs.
Cable television provides a Weather Channel, which runs forecasts 24 hours a
day. 'If demand picks up,' says Raymond Ban, head of operations for the
Weather Channel, 'we may launch new, more specialised channels, such as one
for boaters. Specialisation by geography is also a possibility.'
Accurate weather forecasts can be extremely lucrative. 'Precise weather
forecasting is very valuable from a selling perspective,' says Gerard
McNiff, a meteorologist for the popular television show Good Morning
America. 'I would be a billionaire if I knew the weather 90 days from now.
Imagine, people would plan weddings and vacations around the information. A
film crew could lay out its shooting schedule. The better we can predict,
the more the industry will grow.'
Weather forecasting has already come a long way in recent years.
Meteorologists used to content themselves with general descriptions, such as
a 'cool, rainy day'. 'Now, people want to know what time the rain will
start, exactly how much will fall, and when it will stop,' says Schwoegler.
The main challenge for the weather industry over the next few years will be
processing the overwhelming amount of data the modernisation programme will
produce.
To cope with the onslaught, the National Weather Service is investing in a
Cray supercomputer, scheduled to come on-line this year. And news programmes
say they will be investing heavily in computer and display equipment.
Even with the new technology, weather forecasting will still maintain enough
uncertainty to continue to be referred to as an art rather than exact
science. 'It comes down to the chaos theory,' says Lepore. 'If a butterfly
flaps its wings, will it cause a hurricane in China? The further out we go,
the more uncertainty we'll face.'
It will still be some time before meteorologists can guarantee a sunny
vacation or cheerful weather for the wedding.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Technology: Pizza on a PC - The computer, rather than the
television, will become our 'window on the world'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As viewers await the impact of multimedia technology, they want to know what
sort of programmes and services they will be offered.
But equipment providers have another concern: which receivers will be used -
personal computers or televisions? One company with no doubt is Intel, the
world's largest semiconductor company and the leading supplier of
microprocessor chips to the PC industry.
'There are close to 8m interactive PCs, linked to on-line services, in US
homes today and precisely zero interactive TVs in US homes,' says Andrew
Grove, Intel chief executive. He believes the PC rather than the TV set will
be the primary receiver of new interactive services in the home.
While Grove expects the TV to remain the 'home theatre', the home PC will
become a 'window on to the world' bringing myriad interactive services into
the home.
Over the next 12 months, Intel will begin trials of technology developed
with General Instruments that links the home PC to cable TV networks. These
so-called PC-cable adapters will enable signals to be delivered to PCs at up
to 1,000 times the speed of today's fastest telephone line modems.
Intel and GI recently announced agreements with two of the biggest North
American cable TV companies, Telecommunications Inc and Rogers Cablesystems
of Canada, to develop cable to PC multimedia services. These follow similar
agreements with two smaller companies, Viacom and Comcast Cable.
Although the cable TV industry's efforts to develop interactive services
have been focused primarily on the TV set, there is a growing body of
opinion in the US high-tech industry that the interactive home PC market
will develop much faster than interactive TV.
'The cable television industry has recognised that there are two devices in
the home that can generate revenues - the TV and the PC,' says Avram Miller,
Intel's vice president of business development. The TV is clearly better
suited to 'video-on-demand' services that enable viewers to select from a
large library of films, Intel acknowledges. 'You are not going to watch
Casablanca on a PC,' says Grove.
However, the company is convinced that the PC has several advantages for
services that require higher levels of interaction, such as home shopping,
personal news on demand, multimedia games and information services.
One advantage of the PC is that it has a higher definition display so that
users see truer colours, texture and detail than on a TV screen. This is
critical for the display of text and may also prove important in home
shopping applications. 'You can't tell the mushrooms from the anchovy on a
TV screen' when ordering a pizza, complains Miller.
More importantly, perhaps, the superior data processing power of a PC
enables more sophisticated services such as personal financial and travel
planning, interactive catalogue shopping or access to the Internet's global
networks.
With its built-in processing power the PC also eliminates the need for
expensive new 'TV set top boxes' that consumers will have to buy or lease
from the cable TV company to use interactive TV services. 'The beauty of the
PC-cable technology is that most of the investment is already made; the PCs
are here, the cable is here and multimedia applications are being developed.
The connection of the PCs to the cable system will create a brand new medium
with applications and services for the whole family,' says Miller.
The US cable industry already has broadband networks reaching some 60m US
households, the Intel executives point out, and the proliferation of PCs in
US homes has created a market ripe for development of new services.
Some 24m US households own PCs and sales are booming. Home PC sales reached
a record 6.5m units in the US last year, about half going to first-time
buyers and close to 20 per cent to purchasers who want more than one PC in
their homes, according to Intel's market research.
Also, US home PC buyers are choosing high-performance machines well suited
to multimedia services in record numbers. Close to half the PCs containing
Intel's latest Pentium processors are going to home buyers.
The combination of 'a lightning-fast communications network, like cable,
connected to lightning-fast PCs, like those with Intel Pentium
microprocessors, will create a fertile environment for multimedia-rich
services and software for the PC,' says Grove.
The demographics of home computer owners make them an especially attractive
market for multimedia services. In US households with annual income of more
than Dollars 75,000, about 50 per cent own PCs and the average annual income
of home PC owners is more than Dollars 35,000. The overlap with the 60m US
homes that have cable TV service is also high.
Another factor giving PCs an edge over TV sets is that while traditional
'media' industries such as film and television producers are struggling to
come to terms with interactive technology, the computer software industry is
spawning dozens of entrepreneurial companies developing interactive
programming for the PC. Intel provides seed funds for a few such ventures.
To prime the PC-cable market, Intel has also reached agreements with several
computer on-line services, including Prodigy and America-On-Line, to deliver
new interactive services for PCs via cable networks. These companies will
begin testing their services on US cable systems in the next few months,
offering programs ranging from travel planning to catalogue shopping,
financial services and software distribution.
By 1998, interactive home computer services could be generating annual
revenues of up to Dollars 6bn in North America, Miller predicts. He sees
three sources of revenues for this nascent industry: consumer subscriptions,
fees from companies offering on-line transaction services, and advertisers,
who are expected to create 'infomercial' services such as travel guides.
Will the PC ever push the TV out of the living room? Probably not, says
Grove. If Intel has its way, however, the home PC will become almost as
ubiquitous as the TV set. The company expects about 50m PCs to be in use in
US homes in one to two years and world PC production to overtake TV
production by the end of 1995 or early 1996.

FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Big assumptions made on costs and demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hualon says its proposed plant near Belfast aims to compete with Asian
producers' exports of polyester, polyamide and polycotton fabrics to Europe.
The plant is to be built in four phases. It will initially dye and finish
imported fabric, then weave and finally spin the yarn for fabrics to make
low-cost clothes.
However, the plant's viability and claimed benefits for the Ulster economy
depend on questionable assumptions:
That Hualon can compete with Asian producers on price.
That there will be a sufficient market for its products.
If the plant is to undercut Asian producers, its costs will need to be lower
than theirs. But although its start-up costs are being subsidised, it is
hard to see how this will be achieved.
Savings on transport costs will be negligible because Hualon plans to import
its raw materials from its own plants in Asia.
And while Ulster's Industrial Development Board says the plant's technology
will make it one of the most efficient producers in Europe, the same
technology is already used by Hualon and many other producers in Asia.
Meanwhile, the plant's labour costs will be considerably higher than its
Asian equivalents.
The British Textile and Apparel Confederation, which opposes the Belfast
plant, estimates that with the proposed technology and output levels it
would require only 950 jobs, rather than the 1,800 promised in the case that
was put to Brussels.
A 1993 index of labour costs in the spinning and weaving industry showed the
Irish wage cost per operator hour to be 80 per cent of that in the UK. But
in Taiwan, Malaysia and Vietnam the labour costs were only 57 per cent, 12
per cent and 4 per cent of those in the UK.
Other producers have relocated output to other sites such as Turkey, Hungary
and Egypt, where labour costs are 26 per cent, 16 per cent and 4 per cent
respectively of the UK's.
On the demand side, the odds also seem stacked against Hualon.
European consumption of woven fabrics is contracting rapidly as clothing
manufacturers, which buy most of the industry's output, move production to
lower-cost countries. In the six years to 1993, total consumption fell 14
per cent.
The decline is likely to gather pace after the recent deal under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to end the Multi-Fibre Arrangements, which
have long restricted cotton textiles and clothing imports from low-cost
countries. Furthermore, the market appears to be contracting fastest at the
low-cost end of the clothing industry, where Hualon has chosen to compete.
European producers have tried to fight competition by offering greater
flexibility and speed of delivery.
Hualon will find this difficult because of its bulk-run production methods,
which cannot be tailored to particular orders without raising costs
considerably.

FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Why Brussels bent its own rules on aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the European Commission's activities, few are more likely to set it
on a collision course with EU governments than its policing of their
financial support to industry.
The commission has autonomous powers to prohibit state aids when it judges
they threaten free competition. But the exercise of that authority can
expose it to pressure from governments backing projects of interest to
sensitive political constituencies at home.
The Hualon case was no exception. In an effort to secure a favourable
decision, the UK mounted one of its most active Brussels lobbying campaigns
in recent memory, involving a barrage of visits and telephone calls by
ministers, MPs and MEPs.
The commission's decision was made more difficult by the fact that, in this
case, its own rules oblige it somehow to seek a balance between two
incompatible sets of criteria.
One set, intended to foster regional economic development, permits
exceptionally large state aid for investments located in the EU's poorest
areas. Belfast is one such area, and the UK government's proposed subsidy to
Hualon fell within the limits laid down by Brussels.
However, the particular nature of the project meant it also had to pass
another stiff test. Under EU rules, all state-aided investments in synthetic
fibres, along with those in cars, steel and shipbuilding, receive special
scrutiny by Brussels.
These sectors have extensive excess capacity. The commission frowns on new
subsidised investments in these sectors because it fears they will unfairly
drive other producers out of business, disrupt markets further and impede
orderly industrial restructuring.
The Hualon plan immediately set red lights flashing. Indeed, commission
officials say that if the project had been assessed purely on a strict
interpretation of the sectoral rules, the UK government aid would have been
found illegal.
Objections from sector experts in the commission's industry directorate,
whose views were sought by watchdogs in the competition directorate once the
investigation started, were particularly strong.
The industry experts rejected the UK government's claim that the plant would
make 'innovative products'. In reality, they said, the products were mature
and already in over-supply from within the EU.
The experts also rejected UK arguments that output from the plant would
substitute for imports from outside the EU and help reverse a shift of
manufacturing to Asia. Instead, they concluded, the plant would simply add
to existing excess capacity.
These findings - from which the competition directorate did not initially
dissent - left Mr Karel van Miert, the competition commissioner, with a
problem.
He sympathised with the need to create jobs in Northern Ireland and
recognised that was made more urgent by the delicate peace process under way
 -a point of which he and other commissioners were repeatedly reminded by UK
political lobbyists.
Commission officials say they included Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry
minister, Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and technology minister, and Mr Tim
Smith, Northern Ireland economy minister. as well as Ulster MPs and MEPs.
Some of them also lobbied Mr Bruce Millan, the British regional affairs
commissioner.
According to officials in Brussels, at least one unnamed minister told Mr
van Miert that if the project were blocked, it would have political
consequences not just in Belfast, but also in London.
The officials said this remark was never clearly explained, but that they
took it to refer to the balance of political power at Westminster.
Mr van Miert is said to have spent months agonising privately over how to
come up with a proposal to his fellow commissioners which would enable the
Hualon project to go ahead without breaching his own guidelines on state
aid.
The escape route was found in a renewed examination of the project, which
persuaded Mr van Miert and his colleagues that it was an extremely
low-technology operation. 'It was unique. Every other producer in Europe
trying to survive in this market is investing in high-tech equipment,' said
one official in Brussels.
Although that conclusion conflicted with Hualon's public assertions that the
project would use advanced automation to cut costs, it enabled the
commission to argue that the plant would not disrupt the market because its
technology meant it was not competing directly with existing output.
When Mr van Miert put the argument to the full commission earlier this
month, along with the political case for helping Belfast's economy, the
decision went through un-opposed.
Even Sir Leon Brittan, the liberal-minded trade commissioner - who, when
competition commissioner, called for 'a bonfire of the subsidies' - is said
by colleagues to have raised no objection.

FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Brothers continue to run group despite
allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hualon group, based in Taiwan, is one of the Far East's leading textile
producers. It is also a manufacturer of electronics and a financial services
company.
Listed on the Taiwanese stock exchange as the Hualon Corporation, the group
is controlled by the Oung family.
Mr Oung Ta-ming, eldest of the three brothers who run the group, was
chairman until 1988 when he took early retirement.
Although he is no longer listed as an officer of the company, he remains in
the driving seat.
Mr Oung Yi-ming, his brother, is chairman of the electronics and
financial-services arms of the group.
The chairman of the textiles side - now run as the Hualon Corporation of
Malaysia, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hualon Corporation of
Taiwan - is Mr Oung You-ming.
The criminal charges outstanding in Taiwan against Mr Oung You-ming have not
prevented him from continuing to run the group's textile operations from
Malaysia, where he arrived in May 1991 after jumping bail.
Hualon has been expanding its textiles operations rapidly, and since 1990
Malaysia has approved the construction of three Hualon textile plants set to
employ an estimated 5,000 workers on completion.
At the end of last year, the group announced a Dollars 240m investment in
eight textile and dyeing plants in Vietnam.
It also announced last year a Dollars 250m expansion of its main Taiwan
textiles facility, and has been investing heavily in mainland China.
Hualon has not yet decided whether the Northern Ireland plant will be part
of its Malaysian-based textiles company, although Northern Ireland's
Industrial Development Board negotiated the deal with the Malaysian Hualon
Corporation. Nor does the group know when, or if, Mr Oung You-ming plans to
return to Taiwan to face the charges which prompted him to leave.
Mr Oung Ta-ming has already been sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail in the
case over which Mr Oung You-ming is charged, but he is appealing the ruling
in Taiwan's supreme court.
Since his conviction he has been elected an MP, giving him parliamentary
immunity which can only be lifted by a vote of congress.
In a separate case, Mr Oung Ta-ming was charged in 1991 in connection with a
land deal, together with another brother, Mr Oung Yi-ming.
The two brothers were alleged to have given money to an associate to buy
land.
It was alleged that the associate then sold the land to a Hualon company at
a large profit, which he and the Oung brothers shared.
Mr Oung Yi-ming was sentenced to 1 1/2 years for improper enrichment of
others, but the ruling was overturned on appeal.

OCTOBER 1990
The Irish Republic announces a deal with Hualon to set up a IPounds 45m
textile plant at Gillogue in Limerick.
MARCH 1991
After visiting Taiwan, Mr Des O'Malley, the Republic's industry and commerce
minister, cancels the project, following allegations of stock fraud by two
of the three brothers who run Hualon.
APRIL 1991
Oung Ta-ming, who heads the Hualon group, and Oung You-ming, chairman of its
textiles division, are charged with breach of trust in a stock scandal that

SEPTEMBER 1991
Oung Ta-ming and Oung Yi-ming, chairman of another Hualon division, are
charged in Taiwan over irregular land deals.
1992
Talks open between Hualon and Northern Ireland, and re-open between Hualon
and the Republic, on the possibilities for an aided textile plant.
OCTOBER 1992
Oung Ta-ming convicted on stock scandal charges, which are upheld on appeal
to the high court. He appeals against a 2 1/2 -year sentence to the supreme
court. Oung You-ming had already jumped bail to Malaysia. Oung Yi-ming's
conviction on land deal charges is quashed.
1993
The Republic again backs away from the Limerick project, this time because
it believes it is not economically viable.
The British government agrees to back a proposal by Hualon for a Pounds 157m
textile plant near Belfast with Pounds 61m aid.
JULY 1993
The European Commission announces an investigation into the legality of the
aid package.
MAY 1994
The commission clears the aid, in spite of expert objections that a market

FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Authorities knew of management's
criminal charges - The government is making a Pounds 61m grant for a Belfast
textile plant. The company behind the project and on the failed attempts of
EU officials to block the deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the morning of June 9, the UK's polling day for the European elections,
the government plans to sign a contract agreeing a Pounds 61m grant towards
the building of a textile plant at Mallusk near Belfast.
The deal has progressed to this point although the government knew that
senior managers of the company making the investment had been charged with -
and in one case convicted of - criminal financial offences.
The European Commission approved the grant in spite of strong objections
from officials on competition policy grounds. And the economic case for the
plant, which is to compete with low-cost Asian producers at the toughest end
of the market, has been challenged by European industry bodies.
The plant - to be built in a political stronghold of the Ulster Unionist
party - will cost Pounds 157m, and will be the biggest inward investment in
Northern Ireland since the De Lorean car plant was approved in 1978. De
Lorean collapsed four years later with the loss of a substantial amount of
government aid.
After the failure of De Lorean, whose problems were compounded by financial
irregularities, the government announced new procedures to assess project
viability. These included looking at the 'worst-case scenario' and
investigating the quality of management and the personal qualities and
reputations of the entrepreneurs involved.
The Belfast plant is to be built by the Hualon Corporation, a Malaysian
subsidiary of Hualon, a quoted Taiwanese textiles, electronics and financial
services group.
The Oung family that controls the group nearly clinched a similar deal with
the Republic of Ireland, in 1990 for Gillogue, Limerick. But Mr Des
O'Malley, then industry and commerce minister, spent a week in Taiwan where
he found investigations were under way in what later turned out to be one of
Taiwan's most celebrated stock scandals.
He said yesterday: 'We decided not to go ahead with the deal because the
chairman of the company was arrested in Taiwan over an alleged share fraud.
We had found it difficult anyway for about six months for them to honour the
verbal agreement we had come to in 1990.'
The case involved two of the Oung brothers: the chairman of the textiles
subsidiary, Mr Oung You-ming; and the head of the group, Mr Oung Ta-ming.
The brothers had sold 5m shares in an insurance company to the daughter of
Taiwan's communications minister for one-fifth of their market value. The
prosecutor alleged the transactions were for the 'improper enrichment of
others'.
But by the time the UK had approved the grant for a Belfast plant 21 months
later, Mr Oung Ta-ming had received a sentence for breach of trust of 3 1/2
years' imprisonment - later reduced on appeal to 2 1/2 years - Mr Oung
You-ming had jumped bail to Malaysia, and the communications minister had
resigned. Mr Oung Ta-ming is appealing his sentence to a higher court.
When Mr Chang Liang-chin, a Hualon group spokesman in Taiwan, was asked
yesterday whether Mr Oung You-ming would return to face trial, he said: 'I
don't know. Maybe some day.'
Mr Oung Ta-ming and one of his brothers have faced other criminal charges
since, but they were eventually dropped.
Mr Oung Ta-ming is known to be one of a group of speculators known as the
'Big Hands', who trade up to a third of the daily volume on the Taiwanese
stock exchange.
Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland minister until he was appointed
environment minister in January, said the Hualon project was 'set in train'
by Mr Richard Needham, his immediate predecessor at the Northern Ireland
Office.
Mr Atkins said he 'did not play too much of a part' in the project, and that
detailed negotiations were handled by the Industrial Development Board,
Northern Ireland's development agency. Mr Needham, now trade minister, was
said by the Department of Trade and Industry to be on holiday and
uncontactable.
The development board, which arranged the grant for the Belfast plant, said
it was aware of the controversy surrounding the Oung family, and of the
outcome of the criminal cases. The Northern Ireland Office has refused to
comment.
The development board was enthusiastic about the project. It had been
criticised for its performance on creating jobs in the province.
The development board said the plant, to be based in the Ulster
Unionist-held constituency of South Antrim, near Belfast, would employ 1,800
people on a continuing basis and generate 500 associated jobs.
The plant will produce 23,000 tonnes of synthetic fabrics for low-cost
clothing manufacturers in Europe, competing with Asian producers.
However, European trade groups and some commentators question whether Hualon
will be able to undercut imports from the Far East, and say that demand from
European textiles producers, which has been contracting, cannot absorb the
additional output. They also query the employment projections.
The development board said its standard procedure for appraising and
approving projects was confidential, but it was satisfied that all relevant
aspects were considered.
However, in December 1992, when the UK put the proposal to the European
Commission, which has to approve state aid, Brussels was not impressed. It
asked for more information and received three further submissions, in
February, May and June last year.
In July 1993, the commission said it was opening a full inquiry into the aid
and told Britain: 'There is nothing in the arguments put forward to support
your government's contention that Hualon's output will take the place of
imports from outside the (European) Community.'
The commission was also publicly sceptical about the UK's forecasts of a
growth in demand that would absorb Hualon's output, describing its
assumptions as 'debatable'.
The investigation did not allay these fears. Soon after it began the UK
government started lobbying the commission. Senior commission officials say
at least one British minister indicated that London as well as Belfast had a
political interest in the project. After 10 months - which officials say is
unusually long - the full commission approved the project.
Industry bodies across Europe were furious. UIT, the French textile
manufacturers association, said the decision was incomprehensible. The
British Textile and Apparel Confederation said it would appeal to the
European Court on the decision.

FT  31 MAY 94 / College faces cuts after union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department for Education is expected to cut funding for a Manchester
further education college which has offered lecturers new contracts limiting
teaching time.
Any such move by ministers would be a further escalation of the dispute
between the Natfhe lecturers' union and college principals. The dispute
started in April last year when colleges were removed from local authority
control.
On Saturday the union used its annual conference to announce an agreement
with the Manchester College of Art and Technology. This places a limit of
756 hours on each lecturer's teaching time a year and gives contractual
safeguards on the length of the working week.
In February Mr Tim Boswell, the further-education minister, said that up to
Pounds 50m would be withheld from colleges' budgets unless they removed
'restrictive practices'. The money would be released only 'when there had
been satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible contracts
of employment'.
However, lecturers plan to strike in 120 colleges next month, aiming for
contracts similar to Manchester's.
The union yesterday inducted a new president, Ms Doreen Cameron, while Mr
John Akker, the union's next general secretary, pledged that the union's
tactics would not change.
Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the Colleges' Employers' Forum, which
negotiates on behalf of most principals, said the Manchester contract was
'largely irrelevant' because 332 colleges were already implementing new
contracts in line with the government guidelines.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, last night defended the government's
criminal justice strategy after Mr John Bartell, chairman of the Prison
Officers' Association, warned that Britain's overcrowded prison system was
'spiralling rapidly out of control'.
A report by the Prison Reform Trust showed that the number of prisoners
awaiting trial had risen to a record 12,100 in January from 9,281 in January
last year. The total prison population rose 13 per cent last year, to
47,000.
Mr Howard said that people released on bail committed at least 50,000
offences every year. 'That is at least 50,000 victims of crime, and the
public deserves to be protected.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates will rise 1.5 percentage points over the next year, touching
6.75 per cent by next summer, National Westminster Bank warns today.
A report by the bank predicts the rise will begin this autumn, with rates
going from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent by the end of this year.
This prediction is gloomier that most City forecasts but roughly in line
with the interest rate levels now assumed in sterling futures markets.
Meanwhile, the Nomura research institute has warned that the current account
deficit could severely undermine sterling if it deteriorates any further. In
a report that seeks to challenge the common view that the trade gap is
manageable because it is 'financeable', Nomura argues that international
capital flows are not as mobile as believed.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Unit trust sales at record for April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net unit trust sales fell last month to Pounds 976m but this was still the
second highest monthly figure this year and the best April figure on record,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
Strong sales of unit trust personal equity plans (Peps) had contributed to
making March the best month ever, with net sales of Pounds 1.37bn. But April
5 signalled the end of the rush to buy tax-free Peps for the last financial
year.
Private investors accounted for 73 per cent of overall net sales last month.
UK equity income and international growth were the most popular sectors for
private investors, while institutions preferred the fund-of-funds and UK
growth sectors. The two sectors which fell most out of favour were Europe
and the Far East excluding Japan.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, said: 'Investors are buying unit trusts for the long-term,
irrespective of short-term trends in the stock market.'
Gross sales of unit trusts in April were Pounds 1.77bn, while the value of
funds rose to Pounds 97bn.

Businesses are contracting out their data processing operations at an
unprecedented rate in spite of growing evidence that many deals prove
unsatisfactory and more expensive than in-house operations.
The sharp rise in outsourcing - or facilities management - was the principal
reason for an average 11 per cent rise in revenues among British computing
services companies last year, about twice the rate of the previous year and
a faster growth rate than elsewhere in Europe.
The Holway Report, an annual analysis of the financial performance of UK
computing services companies which is being published this week, says
outsourcing revenues of the main computing services companies grew 25 per
cent in 1992 and 33 per cent last year to Pounds 665m.
The report says the value of new contracts awarded last year exceeded Pounds
3bn, equivalent to Pounds 400m a year. It says the value of the market will
grow by at least 40 per cent in 1995. By 1997 the UK outsourcing market is
likely to be worth more than Pounds 2bn annually.
Companies are turning to outsourcing for a variety of reasons, but mainly to
do with cutting the cost of data processing. Typically, a business sells its
data-processing operations to a computing services company which undertakes
to provide an agreed level of service for a fee.
Anecdotal evidence that outsourcing does not always bring the anticipated
benefits is given credence by a survey of 160 large European companies. This
shows that poor preparation and inadequately drafted contracts were common
and a frequent cause of disputes.
One respondent said: 'The contract did not have strong enough performance
measures. I think they took advantage of us and I do not blame them. We were
not very professional.' Another said: 'The contract was too loose; every
time we sneezed it cost us Pounds 10,000.'
Mr Kevin Tomlinson of CMS, a British Steel outsourcing subsidiary, said:
'Outsourcing contracts are agreed in concept and delivered in detail and
that is why they break down.'
The survey, by Business Intelligence, a London-based consultancy, says the
companies most likely to experience difficulties were those which approached
outsourcing as a solution to a problem 'without adequate consideration of
the wider implications'.
The result, it warns, can be loss of control of critical IT resources,
disruption to the organisation and a cost far in excess of retaining data
processing in-house.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Nuclear Electric to seek aid for Sizewell C
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity company which wants to be
privatised, is to tell the government that it is unlikely to be able to
build Sizewell C, a twin-reactor power station in Suffolk, without 'material
support' from the state.
Its acknowledgement that it needs government assistance for the Pounds 3.5bn
project, for which the company is seeking planning permission, will be seen
by environmentalists and rival generators as a significant retreat.
Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and
Wales, has frequently said that Sizewell C can produce electricity at
competitive prices and that the company requires no government subsidies
after 1998 when the 'nuclear levy' on household power bills ends.
The company's policy of asking for 'material support' is being formulated
for the government's review of nuclear power which started 10 days ago. The
review, likely to take at least until the end of the year, will investigate
whether to end the government's temporary ban on new nuclear power stations.
It will also consider whether Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the
other nuclear generator, should be privatised or be allowed to seek private
investment for projects.
According to an internal Nuclear Electric document, the priority in the
review should be privatisation and the commercial freedom it would allow
rather than the construction of Sizewell C.
The document says, however, that there are 'strong strategic and
environmental' reasons for retaining the nuclear option and Sizewell C would
be the cheapest way of doing so.
'Material support will be needed from government to give private-sector
investors confidence that they will receive the rates of return which they
expect. The government will therefore need to decide whether to support
Sizewell C'
Nuclear Electric said the document represented company policy but denied it
was a climbdown. It had always said its claims of competitive prices from
Sizewell C assumed government rates of return of 8 per cent rather than the
higher rates required by the private sector.
The company had also revised downwards its predictions for electricity
market prices. That reflected changes in expectations for gas prices and the
recent cap on prices in the electricity pool agreed between the industry
regulator and National Power and PowerGen, the two main generators using
fossil fuels.
Nuclear Electric said material support would not necessarily mean direct
subsidies. The government could, for example, underwrite liabilities or
agree that a certain proportion of electricity be generated from nuclear
power.
Rival power companies and environmentalists will argue that even those would
be a form of subsidy. Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace, the environmental
lobbying group, said yesterday: 'There is going to be another round of
special pleading for nuclear power. But there is no case for a special
case.'
Nuclear Electric's critics will also argue that its revised stance confirms
their belief that the company would struggle to survive as a stand-alone
private company in a fully competitive market.
Nuclear Electric said yesterday it was confident that it could manage its
existing power stations profitably in the private sector without subsidy or
a levy after 1998.

FT  31 MAY 94 / North-west sees patchy recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest companies in north-west England are struggling out of recession,
but with a performance that is far from uniformly good, according to an
analysis of local companies.
The analysis, aggregating the results of the 127 quoted companies reporting
to the London Stock Exchange and those of private ones filed with Companies
House, shows lacklustre results from the region's two conurbations - Greater
Manchester and Merseyside - but strong contributions from Lancashire, the
Potteries and Cumbria.
The research, by accountancy firm KPMG and Insider, a regional business
magazine, has been published as North West England plc in the style of an
annual report.
Mr Alan Benzie, head of KPMG corporate finance in the north-west, says in
the report that the financial sector was the strongest in the last year,
with leisure and media industries also doing well. There were 'creditable
performances' in electricals, retailing and textiles.
However the food sector was flat while chemicals, industrials, property and
construction all struggled.
Aggregate turnover rose 5.5 per cent but operating profits were only 1.5 per
cent up. Cheaper money saw interest paid fall 8.7 per cent.
Recovery was confirmed by improved investment in fixed assets, a 10 per cent
increase in depreciation provision, and an increase in stocks of 4.3 per
cent, reversing the de-stocking trend of the recession.
Jobs continued to be shed with a 1.9 per cent fall in numbers employed.
Total pay rose 4.7 per cent, well ahead of an inflation rate of about 3 per
cent.
'Fragility and patchiness' is one of the principal messages of North West
plc. Mr Benzie says flickering trading conditions are improving slowly but
there is some way to go before there is a 'sustainable glow'  - and national
and international factors, not the north-west's own efforts, will be
decisive.
Trafford Park, the Greater Manchester industrial estate, appears to have
reversed the decades of decline that prompted the government to put it under
an urban development corporation in 1987.
A census of companies in the park shows a net increase of 126 since 1991,
bringing the total to 1,314. New businesses accounted for 360. The rest were
relocations.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Blunkett backs work scheme to curb crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A citizens' volunteer service to encourage thousands of school-leavers to
spend three months on community projects was backed yesterday by Labour's
Commission on Social Justice.
Most of the cost of a national Citizens' Service with places for up to
150,000 young people would be offset by a reduction in crime and an increase
in the employability of young people, the commission says in a report to be
announced today.
The scheme would cost less than Pounds 2,000 per person including a weekly
allowance of Pounds 50 for the volunteers.
Mr James McCormick, a research fellow for the commission and author of the
report, says: 'Improved employment prospects and reduced crime rates would
pay back the investment. By its fifth year every Pounds 100 invested in a
service covering 150,000 young people could yield savings of up to Pounds
25.'
The scheme should not become a public works programme or be a means of
substituting for paid labour, says the commission, a think-tank set up by
the late John Smith at the end of 1992 to advise on social policy.
Instead the scheme would bridge the gap between education and work, break
down social and ethnic barriers, and encourage more involvement in public
service.
Sir Gordon Borrie, chairman of the commission, said: 'Almost 1m young adults
between the ages of 16 and 24 are not in employment, nor are they training,
nor studying.
'The costs of social exclusion for this group are all too obvious. Citizens'
Service could give them and every other young adult a new stake in society.
It would combine volunteer commitments with meeting community needs.'
Labour is likely to strongly back such a scheme at the next election.
The commission's scheme is echoed by a cost-benefit analysis from the Henley
Centre, the independent forecasting organisation, which is also published
today. It says that introducing voluntary service for young people could
save Pounds 13.5bn over five years through a resultant fall in crime, and
Pounds 298m by reducing long-term unemployment.
The Henley Centre report, commissioned by the Community Service Volunteers
charity, envisages a voluntary work scheme costing Pounds 300m with 250,000
places each year for people aged 18 to 21. It would pay them Pounds 20 a
week plus a lunch allowance.
The report adds that the estimates of savings are 'very conservative'.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour chairman, yesterday said: 'There are 1m young
people not in work, training or further education. We need to offer them
some real hope.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Extra help for war widows urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alf Morris, Labour MP and parliamentary adviser to the Royal British
Legion, yesterday wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging him to
mark the 50th anniversary of D-day next week by giving widows of men killed
in the Second World War a Pounds 2,000 one-off payment.
He pointed out that last year's budget of Pounds 1.2bn for war pensions was
to be cut to Pounds 1.1bn. 'The total of 51,300 war widows in 1992, the
latest year for which figures are available, must mean that today there will
be no more than 50,000 still alive. I am not asking you to increase
expenditure, but simply to maintain it.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Begging split blows Labour off-course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's European election campaign was blown off-course yesterday by
differences among shadow ministers about the party's response to
Conservative attacks on begging.
Claims by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that begging is unnecessary and
offensive have been widely condemned by opposition and Church leaders.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday that Mr Major had
worsened the problem of poverty by withdrawing benefits from those aged 16
and 17 as a minister in 1988.
But Mr Brown refused to commit Labour to providing funds to reintroduce
teenage benefits. He said that the problem could be solved 'within existing
budgets'.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said teenagers needed
more support. 'If more money is required then that will have to be
considered,' he said.
Ms Joan Lestor, shadow minister for the family, said that there would be
less homelessness if 'the benefits to the young, in particular, equalled the
benefits in most of Europe'.
Conservative ministers were quick to exploit the differences of emphasis
between Labour's treasury and social security teams.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, wrote to Mr Brown
demanding details of Labour's plans for financing a resumption of teenage
benefits.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said it was clear that Labour 'would
not find more facilities beyond what we have done ourselves'.
Labour's disarray will hearten Conservative strategists, who believe that
the first week of their campaign was far from the disaster predicted by many
commentators.
Conservative divisions on Europe have been minimised by Labour's split on
begging, and the Liberal Democrats' divisions on the national veto in the
council of ministers.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told Conservatives in Aberdeen: 'The
campaign has been going well for us.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / LDP ex-official jailed over bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party suffered a fresh blow yesterday
when Mr Fumio Abe, a former senior LDP official, received a three-year jail
term for taking bribes.
The downfall of 71-year-old Mr Abe, once a close associate of former prime
minister Kiichi Miyazawa, comes at a time when a demoralised LDP is trying
to disassociate itself from its corrupt past and attract public support for
a return to government. This follows the arrest in March of Mr Kishiro
Nakamura, a former LDP construction minister, on charges of receiving
bribes.
Mr Abe's jailing is the latest in a recent resurgence of political
corruption scandals, a factor in the instability of Japanese government and
near paralysis in policy making.
Mr Abe, who is to appeal against the Tokyo district court ruling, was found
guilty of taking Y630m (Pounds 4m) from Kyowa, a now defunct steel frame
maker and property company. In return, Mr Abe helped Kyowa get construction
jobs in Hokkaido, where he was head of the local development agency.
The Kyowa scandal was one in a chain of events that led to last June's
collapse of the Miyazawa government.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa - Mr Miyazawa's immediate successor - resigned last
month after just eight months in office because of alleged financial
impropriety.

Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa yesterday escaped unhurt after a
gunman fired a shot in his direction while he was leaving a Tokyo hotel, AP
reports.
The gunman was wrestled to the floor. Police say they believe he may be a
member of an extremist right-wing group who could have acted out of anger
over Mr Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's actions in the second world war.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Colombian victor will face fall-out from oil boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Only about 18,000 votes separated the two leading candidates in the first
round of Colombia's presidential election on Sunday, which did little more
than confirm what was known before: the country's next president will be
either Mr Ernesto Samper of the Liberal party or Mr Andres Pastrana of the
Conservatives.
Mr Samper emerged fractionally in the lead with 45.2 per cent of the vote
against his rival's 44.9 per cent. The two representatives of the parties
that have run Colombia since the last century now face a run-off on June 19.
The third force in Colombian politics, the former guerrilla group M-19,
emerges from the elections weakened: its candidate Mr Ramon Navarro, polled
under 4 per cent of the vote, less than a third of what he obtained in the
1990 election.
The vote was hardly a triumph for Colombian democracy. About 65 per cent of
the 17.1m eligible voters abstained - high even by the standards of
Colombian presidential elections. It could be worse on June 19 when the
election competes with the World Cup for the attention of voters.
Whoever takes over in August will follow a Liberal president who looks set
to end his term as one of the most popular of recent times. President Cesar
Gaviria - forbidden by law to stand for a successive term and headed for a
five-year spell as head of the Organisation of American States in Washington
 -has an approval rating of over 50 per cent.
His policy of economic modernisation - called apertura to signify the
opening of the economy to the outside world - has helped to encourage
growth: 5.2 per cent last year, perhaps slightly less this year. But the
criticism that it has hurt the poor, many in rural areas, appears to have
contributed Mr Samper's greater emphasis on social issues in his campaign.
Mr Samper would also move more slowly on the North American Free Trade
Agreement than Mr Pastrana, believing Colombia should negotiate jointly with
other South American partners rather than on its own.
The central economic question for the four years of the next president will
be how to manage the expected oil boom. As the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields
come on stream, crude oil output will rise to more than 1m barrels a day by
the end of the decade. The Washington-based Institute of International
Finance, a think-tank owned by financial institutions, estimates oil will
add an annual 0.5 per cent to growth starting next year. Already capital
inflows into the country have elevated the exchange rate and this, say
critics, has damaged the country's ability to export products other than raw
materials, oil and cocaine.
Mr Juan Manuel Santos, trade minister, says the government will need to
continue strict fiscal discipline and spend mainly to enhance both the
country's inadequate infrastructure and to improve education. To stop
economic overheating, it should also establish a fund outside the country,
which could, for example, buy foreign companies to ensure retail outlets for
Colombian products in industrialised countries.
However, critics of apertura, such as Mr Eduardo Sarmiento, dean of
economics at the University of the Andes in Bogota, reckon a much more
activist government policy is needed to direct the dividends from oil to
investment in other areas. Mr Sarmiento, who says he has the ear of Mr
Samper, argues that too much of current growth arises from consumption of
imports, which is expanding the trade deficit, and from growth in
construction of office blocks and luxury housing, which masks the fall in
employment caused by apertura by providing low quality jobs.
The problems of overabundance are not the only ones facing the next
government. Violence continues at an alarming rate - some 29,000 people are
murdered each year in a country of 33.4m people. The persistence of drugs
traffickers, guerrillas and widespread banditry is not much help in the
government's search for foreign investment. The government also faces a
battle with overseas human rights groups, such as Amnesty International,
which say the government has not faced up to the role of its own armed
forces and police in political killings.
Neither will the drugs issue go away. The decision by the country's
constitutional court that, in effect, legalises the use of small amounts of
drugs for personal consumption has raised the question of why, if
consumption is legal, should trade in drugs be illegal. Both candidates have
reiterated they will fight either through a referendum or congressional
action to reverse the court decision.

FT  31 MAY 94 / UN likely to discuss N Korea sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN Security Council is expected to meet today to discuss actions against
North Korea for its refusal to let international inspectors examine fuel
rods being removed from its nuclear reactor.
The council has been divided over the issue, with the US threatening
sanctions and China warning against punishing North Korea. It is likely that
the council will consider a resolution urging Pyongyang to reach an
agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on sampling the fuel
rods.
In a separate move, the Japanese government yesterday offered North Korea
financial aid if it allows full inspections of nuclear sites.
The proposal, while vague, appears to mark a softening in its policy policy,
as Japan has previously insisted official aid to North Korea will only come
after normalisation of diplomatic relations.
The IAEA wants to analyse the fuel rods to determine if North Korea has
removed any plutonium-rich fuel rods from its 5MW reactor and diverted them
for its suspected nuclear weapons programme.
If North Korea fails to guarantee the testing of the fuel rods, the US is
likely to ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions on the
North. North Korea has warned that the imposition of sanctions would amount
to an 'act of war'.
'The North Korean nuclear problem is entering its most serious stage and the
present situation is extremely worrisome,' said a South Korean foreign
ministry spokesman.
Talks on the inspection procedures between North Korea and the IAEA broke
down at the weekend. North Korea is removing the spent nuclear fuel at a
rapid pace and preventing the IAEA from selecting samples for later testing.
Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, reported North Korea had proposed the IAEA
could analyse the fuel rods once a package deal is completed between
Washington and Pyongyang on diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
An aide to South Korean President Kim Young-sam suggested that Pyongyang's
actions in recent days were equivalent to a hard bet in poker: 'It is a
risky gamble to obtain the maximum gains, but they may have miscalculated
this time because the US appears to running out of patience.'
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, said his country was ready to do
much to help improve living standards in North Korea, and was prepared to
offer assistance in exchange for concessions on the nuclear dispute.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Japanese chip makers plan to boost capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's six leading electronics companies plan to increase investment in
semiconductor making capacity by 15.3 per cent to a combined Y461bn (Pounds
2.93bn) in the year to next March.
The increase, the first since the economic slowdown began nearly three years
ago for some groups, is in response to a surge in demand for personal
computers in the US and Japan.
This is one of the few Japanese sectors to show growth at a time when
industrial production continues to bump along the bottom. Industrial output
declined 1.4 per cent between March and April, according to preliminary
figures from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday.
Most of the new electrical industry investment, outlined in the companies'
recent annual results, is for production of 16-megabit dynamic random access
memories (Drams). Demand is driven by the fast growth in Windows and other
advanced software, which need more memory than older programs able to run on
4-megabit Drams. The personal computer market grew by 16 per cent in the US
and 10.6 per cent in Japan last year, according to Dataquest.
NEC, the leading producer of 16-megabit Drams, plans to triple monthly
capacity from 1m units now to 3m next March, with investment of Y90bn this
year. Most of that will be at its Roseville, California plant, whose output
at present levels of several tens of thousands per month is booked for the
year ahead, said an NEC spokesman.
Hitachi is planning to challenge NEC's leadership by boosting its capacity
to 3m units per month by next March. Fujitsu has earmarked more than Y100bn
for investment in memory chips, while Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric, plan
the first increase in chip investment in three years.
The decline in industrial output announced yesterday represents a rebound
from the 4.6 per cent increase between February and March. Manufacturing
output will fall again this month but recover in June, forecast Miti
officials.
Despite the production decline, stocks of unsold goods shrank by 0.7 per
cent, the third monthly decline running, evidence the decline might be near
the bottom, said Miti.
Month on month, production has been fluctuating, showing alternate months of
rise and fall since last August, a reflection of the disparate fortunes of
different industrial sectors.
This was highlighted yesterday by the latest figures from Japan's car
producers, still burdened with overcapacity. Exports of all vehicles fell by
12.6 per cent last month, from April 1993, the 13th monthly fall running,
said the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Andean Pact nations in tariff accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The five countries of the Andean Pact have agreed to a common external
tariff, 25 years after the formation of the group. Officials agreed in Lima
last week that a four-tier external tariff should come into force at the
start of next year, with some exceptions.
Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador agreed to a four-tier external tariff
structure of 5, 10, 15 and 20 per cent. For Colombia, according to Trade
Minister Juan Manuel Santos, the weighted average tariff will be 11 per
cent.
Ecuador has negotiated a list of 600 exceptions for which it can, for a
four-year period, set a tariff of 5 per cent either side of that agreed for
other countries.
As the least developed country in the group, Bolivia will stick at its
current two-tier tariff level of 5 and 10 per cent.
Peru will accept the 5 and 10 per cent tariff, but its acceptance of other
tariff levels is still not settled and will depend, for example, on
concessions from Colombia over its free trade zone.
'We have come further in two years of negotiations that in the previous 23,'
Mr Santos said in an interview. He said the reasons for the success were the
involvement of the private sector in the negotiations, and the concept of
'open integration', meaning the group remained open to trade with the
outside world.
He said Colombia was moving ahead with other free trade negotiations. The
Group of Three accord with Venezuela and Mexico should be signed in mid-June
at an Ibero-American heads of state meeting in Cartagena.
Negotiations with the Caribbean Community resume on June 5 with a view to a
free trade deal, and he expected an accord with the Central American Common
Market before the government of Mr Cesar Gaviria quits in August.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Pace quickens in rebuilding of Beirut / A look at the
immensity of the task and progress so far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than three years after the end of Lebanon's devastating civil war,
there are few visible signs of reconstruction and recovery. Parts of central
Beirut have street lighting. Electricity supplies are less erratic. Schools
are being rebuilt. Opulent shopping malls and marbled apartment buildings
are rising in Beirut's more select areas.
But for the planners of Lebanon's redevelopment programme, the big heave is
only now getting under way. The government of Mr Rafik Hariri, the
billionaire contractor who became prime minister in 1992, has set itself the
target of re-establishing Lebanon as an 'upper middle income country' by the
year 2000, and of restoring its role as a regional commercial, financial and
services hub to capitalise on a prospective Middle East peace.
The government estimates this will need public investment of Dollars 11.7bn
(Pounds 7.75bn) over the next decade and total private investment of twice
that. Lebanon, with gross domestic product of around Dollars 5bn, must
therefore simultaneously raise these immense amounts and the confidence
among local and international investors that will be needed if the project
is to succeed. 'It is a Herculean task,' says one Lebanese banker. But work
is in progress.
The Council for Development and Reconstruction, the state agency contracting
out the bulk of Lebanon's infrastructural work, is advertising for 50 new
professionals - planners, economists, lawyers, engineers - to join its 150
staff because, says Mr Boutros Labaki, CDR's vice president, 'the rhythm of
reconstruction is going to accelerate'.
Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn company created by the government in a flotation
this year to develop downtown Beirut, meanwhile, is set to double its staff
to around 160 in the next two months, by which time preparatory works will
have begun on Lebanon's crown jewel project to revive Beirut's commercial
core.
Mr Nasr Chamaa, Solidere's managing director, says the Dollars 560m turnkey
project to repair central Beirut's basic infrastructure, a four-year task,
should be awarded by mid-July and work begun by August. Twenty two companies
have already bid for the project.
CDR has awarded 380 contracts worth Dollars 625m in the power, water,
transport, telecommunications, water, housing, education and other sectors.
The biggest so far, a Dollars 422m deal for refurbishing and expanding
Lebanon's telephone lines was awarded earlier this year to Siemens, Ericsson
and Alcatel.
A flush of other big deals is imminent. The cabinet last week, for instance,
is understood to have approved a Dollars 300m deal with France Telecom and
Finnish Telecom to establish a 500,000-line cellphone network. Letters of
intent have been agreed with Hochtief, the German construction group, and
local partners Consolidated Contractors Company, for the Dollars 400m
rebuilding of Beirut international airport.
Within the next couple of months, CDR is expected to announce the winner of
a Dollars 720m tender to build two 450MW combined cycle power plants. There
will also be a Dollars 400m project to revive the coastal railway, and a
Dollars 126m refurbishment of Beirut port.
CDR calculates its investment requirements over the next five years at
Dollars 7bn, after which officials say Lebanon's infrastructure will be
rebuilt and expanded.
The sheer scale of the project raises the question of how it is to be
financed, not least while the government pursues tight economic policies
which aim to reduce domestic and foreign debt from a predicted peak of 84
per cent of GDP next year (it was 50 per cent in 1992) to 39 per cent by
2002.
So far the government has won international loans and grants, mostly from
Arab and other international agencies, for Dollars 1.6bn - 23 per cent of
its proposed investment spending over the next five years. It is discussing
further lending and aid with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the World Bank, and with
France on the financing of the two power plants.
No one in government underestimates the task of raising the billions of
dollars still required, particularly in the face of competing regional
demands, most notably in Gaza and Jericho.
Part of the solution, according to Mr Labaki, will lie in varying the
financing of projects on an almost case-by-case basis. The cellphone deal,
and a proposed Dollars 60m Beirut-Syria motorway will, for example, be on a
Build-Owner-Transfer basis. Bidders for the power plants are required to
provide their own financing for the deal. Mr Labaki says the government
plans to issue, for the first time, dollar-denominated treasury bills in a
Dollars 300m sale to finance housing and road-building in Beirut's suburbs.
But the effort is considerable and it will prove feasible, in the view of
local economists, only if the government can tempt back more of the billions
of dollars of expatriated Lebanese wealth it began to tap with the Solidere
flotation. This raised Dollars 650m through the sale to Arab investors of
Dollars 100 shares, a secondary market in which will open next month.
No one knows the scale of such overseas wealth, held by the often wealthy
Lebanese communities in West Africa, North and Latin America. Mr Freddie
Baz, economist for Banque Audi, a local commercial bank, estimates that
resident Lebanese alone hold Dollars 8bn in overseas deposits. He says new
instruments such as the proposed dollar T-Bills could raise up to Dollars
500m a year from those Lebanese investors shy of taking a risk on the
Lebanese pound.
Some other Lebanese - and Gulf - investors are nevertheless happy to take
that risk, and the flow of money into currently high-interest local currency
T-Bills has contributed to Lebanon enjoying its first balance of payments
surplus in the first quarter since 1988.
But economic growth is currently a more modest 4 per cent, and Mr Baz
describes productive investment flows as 'stagnant and timid'. Lebanese, and
international investors, happy perhaps to make short-term plays on local
T-Bills, generally want to 'wait and see'.
The dilemma for Mr Hariri's government is that while investors may prefer to
bide their time, the fate of his project for the country demands otherwise.
CDR and Solidere, which resemble as much as anything sophisticated marketing
machines, must prove within the next few years, that their and Mr Hariri's
hard-sell self-belief is infectious.

FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Experts likely to eclipse incoming
'stars' - It will not always be names best known to voters who hold real
levers of power in new assembly

On July 19, when the new European Parliament elected on June 9 and 12 holds
its inaugural session, Mr Franco Iacono, an Italian Socialist MEP not
standing for re-election, will have more than usual regrets. A tireless
campaigner in the outgoing legislature for mandatory bidets in European
hotels, he may face charges in Naples on corruption allegations once his
parliamentary immunity expires.
The European Parliament hopes the elections will flush away its lesser
talents. It needs a new intake of calibre to project its influence and
exploit the new powers invested in it by the Maastricht treaty.
The new assembly will not lack grandees, but it will not always be the names
best known to voters who hold the real levers of power. And although voters
nationally have entrusted their governments to Socialists in only three of
the 12 EU member states (Spain, Greece and Denmark), everything indicates
that the Union's only directly elected body will be more Socialist-dominated
than ever before.
The leadership of the Socialist group, the largest at Strasbourg, is the
parliament's most influential position. It is expected to go to Mrs Pauline
Green, a tough-minded former policewoman who has commanded effectively the
British Labour contingent.
That UK Labour MEPs, already the largest single national unit and expected
to increase heavily at Tory expense, should aim single-mindedly at the group
leadership rather than the presidency accurately measures how power flows in
the Parliament.
It is the leaders of the political groups - in which Mrs Green would be
prima inter pares - which set the agenda. Her counterpart in what looks set
to be a diminished Christian Democrat bloc is likely to remain Mr Leo
Tindemans, the former Belgian prime minister, set to be re-elected alongside
another former Belgian premier, Mr Wilfried Martens.
But the presidency of the parliament, hitherto a politically ill-defined
role trapped somewhere between parliamentary speaker and lacklustre
figurehead, could yet grow in stature. 'The potential for the presidency
becoming the job is growing,' believes Mr David Harley of the assembly's
secretariat-general.
Ms Elisabeth Guigou, former French minister for Europe standing in the
Socialist list, is a figure many insiders reckon has enough clout to give
the parliament an image of respect.
The Socialists also control environment - possibly the single most
influential committee in shaping law - under Labour MEP Mr Ken Collins, who
could face challenge from former EU environment commissioner Carlo Ripa di
Meana from Italy's Greens. They chair too the foreign affairs committee,
under Mr Enrique Baron, a lightweight former president of the parliament
whom some would like to see replaced by Mr Fernando Moran, a former Spanish
socialist foreign minister.
Formal structures aside, it is the preparation for the 1996 review of the
Maastricht treaty, in which parliament will have an important say, that will
define which MEPs rise. A key figure here will be the Scots Labour MEP and
parliament vice-president Mr David Martin, the Socialists' main
constitutional expert.
Mr Martin made a highly regarded submission to the Maastricht treaty
negotiations, and also chairs the 'conciliation' committee which operates
the parliament's new legislative powers in negotiation with the Council of
Ministers.
With these sorts of priorities, many incoming national 'stars' could well be
eclipsed. Mr Bernard Kouchner, flamboyant founder of Medecins sans
Frontieres and former minister for humanitarian affairs in the last French
socialist government, or Mr Jose-Maria Mendiluce, former UNHCR
representative in Bosnia, could fade in a body now concentrating more on
issues it can influence than on the human rights gestures it was famous for.
Nor is it clear what role other national figures, like former French
Socialist premier Michel Rocard, or Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the
former Italian Communists, intend to play.
Mr Occhetto, already an MEP, appeared so seldom at Strasbourg that when he
turned up for May's historic enlargement vote to admit four new countries
into the Union, he missed the first two votes on Norway and Austria because
he did not know how to work his voting card.

FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Ex-PMs and Greek soccer coach vie for
Euro-seats

Elections for the European parliament can be an arduous business - at least
for those keeping track of the candidates. Officials in Brussels yesterday
counted 10,210 hopefuls in the race, spread across 304 lists in the 12
countries. Across Europe 269m eligible voters will send deputies to a
567-strong parliament.
However, the absence of a common electoral system, and the concentration on
national rather than European issues, makes it difficult to regard the poll
as a genuine transnational contest.
The contestants range from the 'Shooting, Fishing and Nature' ticket in
France to the Popular Monarchist Party in Portugal, campaigning - among
other things - against Brussels-imposed uniformity on the length of condoms.
Among the candidates are a bevy of former prime ministers (and one sitting
one, Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi), German Green party activist Mr Daniel
('Dany the Red') Cohn-Bendit, and Mrs Helene Carrere d'Encausse, well-known
French author and specialist on Russia. More down-to-earth, they include the
former secretary of Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, and the
Greek football team coach.
Two businessmen candidates, Mr Jose Maria Ruiz-Mateos, former head of
Spain's collapsed Rumasa business empire, and France's Mr Bernard Tapie, are
hoping a good score from the voters will give them immunity from creditors
and prosecutors.
Eleven of the states use some form of proportional representation. The
exception is Britain with its first-past-the-post constituency system. Most
countries on the Continent deploy national party lists to determine seat
allocations - a form of voting that makes it difficult for voters to
establish a direct link with the people they are sending to parliament.
Party lists are usually headed by familiar faces backed up by a cast of
unknown names, most of whom hardly feature in the campaign. 'The top names
are often drawn purely for public relations purposes,' a European parliament
official concedes. Mr Michel Rocard, former French prime minister, is
heading his party's list in France and is almost certain of election. But he
is almost equally certain to step down again when he starts campaigning for
French presidential elections next year.
Among other well-known politicians campaigning are Mr Poul Schluter, the
former Danish prime minister, who heads his country's conservative list, and
Mr Leo Tindemans and Mr Wilfried Martens, two Belgian ex-prime ministers.
One sign of cross-party ties in Denmark is the presence on the list for the
Radical Liberal party of Ms Lone Dybkjaer, who lives with the Social
Democratic prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.
In Italy, Mr Berlusconi, the victor of the March general election, is
heading the list of his Forza Italia party in all five Italian regional
constituencies, even though as a member of a national government he is
prohibited from taking up a seat. Mr Francesco Bove, a candidate in central
Italy, defends Mr Berlusconi's 'symbolic' candidature as an indication of
the importance which the new government gives to Europe.
A more down-to-earth line is being taken by Mr Berlusconi's main coalition
partner, the federalist Northern League. Mr Marco Formentini, mayor of
Milan, and one of the League's prospective MEPs, says the presence of
several local mayors on the party's list shows how the League wants to put
'a strong popular feeling into the construction of Europe'.
The practice of packing lists with prestige figures, tame party bureaucrats
or political has-beens is particularly prevalent in southern European
countries and the list system can sometimes push valuable candidates out
into the cold.
Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, the French leader of the Socialist group at Strasbourg,
and an influential figure in the outgoing assembly, has merited only 11th
place on the French Socialist party list, displaced by a clutch of former
Socialist ministers.
Another Socialist party casualty, this time in Portugal, was Mr Joao
Cravinho, an experienced MEP, who was passed over as number two in the list
in favour of Mr Joao Soares, son of Portuguese President Mario Soares.
'Portuguese candidates for the European elections are chosen, with a few
exceptions, because they are no longer required for national politics or
because they have earned a sabbatical,' says Mr Antonio Barreto, a political
analyst and member of the Portuguese Socialist party.
In the Netherlands, a conflict of interest between national and European
parliamentary obligations disturbed preparation of the Labour party's list.
Party managers wanted its leading candidate, Ms Hedy D'Ancona, the current
minister of culture, to stand both for Strasbourg and for the national
parliament in the general elections on May 3. However, the Labour party
congress turned down the idea, forcing Ms D'Ancona to drop her national
ambitions. 'The party's members considered each of the jobs to be full-time
posts,' a Labour party spokesman says.
The German Social Democratic party (SPD) offers an instructive example of
how a strict quota system influences the choice of prospective members of
the European Parliament. The SPD's national executive draws up lists
reflecting the requirement that every second name among the top 10
candidates must be a woman.
In the top 40 - the number realistically expected to be elected - at least
40 per cent must be female. Additionally, there has to be at least one east
German in the top 10 names, while in the top 40, at least one MEP from each
of the five east German Lander is designed to be elected. At a European
party conference called to endorse the lists, one sitting German SPD MEP
objected that he had been allocated too lowly a place.
Decisions on lists are sometimes made for contradictory reasons. In Spain,
Mr Fernando Moran, the 68-year-old former foreign minister, is heading the
Socialist list for the third time. The party hopes Mr Moran's popularity
will help stave off humiliating defeat, even though it is widely recognised
that he does not get on with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, who
sacked him from the cabinet eight years ago.
In Portugal, the main candidate chosen by the governing Social Democratic
party (PSD) reflects its new stance of putting Portuguese interests before
visions of Europe. Mr Eurico de Melo is a crusty elder statesman on the
right of the party better known for his influence in northern Portuguese
business lobbying than for interest in European affairs. Mr de Melo's lack
of detailed knowledge of European issues was so clearly exposed during the
early stages of the campaign that he refused to participate in television
debates - until TV stations threatened to fill his place with an empty
chair.

FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Dutch crusader determined to open
decision-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister for European affairs, plans to wage from
the European parliament his crusade for more openness in EU decision-making.
He insists that one of the main reasons behind the erosion of public support
for the European Union is its secretive decision-making.
He believes this so strongly that in February he got the Dutch government to
take the Council of Ministers of the 12 to the European Court of Justice, in
an effort to overturn the decision by a majority of 10 member states to
limit public access to EU information.
Since then, Holland has picked up support from Denmark, and from the
European Parliament - to which Mr Dankert, its Socialist president in
1982-84, is virt-ually certain to return after next month's Euro-elections.
'The idea that we are run by our bureaucrats, not only at European but at
national level, is deadly for the Union, and we have to tackle that,' Mr
Dankert says.
Before joining the last Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition in the Hague,
Mr Dankert was an influential figure in the European Parliament from 1979 -
when it was first directly elected - to 1989.
He was instrumental in Strasbourg's rejection of the Community budget in
1979, and exposed a butter fraud in the Dutch dairy industry. In the
mid-1980s, it was his written questions to the Commission which uncovered
the cartel in the Dutch construction industry.
'In the European Parliament you can do that sort of thing,' he says, and
much more so now with the increased powers (of veto over much new EU law)
Strasbourg got out of the Maastricht treaty.
Under the 1991 Dutch presidency of the 12 just before the Maastricht summit,
Mr Dankert's blueprint for the Union treaty - which would have made
parliament almost equal to the council - was famously torpedoed by 10 of the
Netherlands' partners. But now, as then, the Dutchman is undeterred by 10-2
odds, and is going for the long haul.
After the backlash against Europe and amid the struggle to ratify
Maastricht, five successive EU summits had 'decided that urgent action was
needed and that that action was openness,' Mr Dankert recalls. 'Everybody
agreed on that analysis, but in the Community, when you come to concrete
action, very different powers prevail.'
The openness policy originally proclaimed full right of public access to all
EU information except where national security, monetary stability,
commercial confidentiality, privacy or relations with non-EU countries could
be endangered.
But last December, a majority in the Council slipped in a catch-all
discretionary clause for refusing access to documents 'in order to protect
the confidentiality of the Council's proceedings'. This is now being used to
turn down requests for even relatively banal information.
Mr Dankert blames national justice, interior and home affairs ministries in
general, and the UK, France and Germany in particular for this evisceration
of the new information policy. He cautions that 'how far it is the civil
services and how far it is the ministers (who are responsible) is very
difficult to judge'.
He notes with irritation the growing power of Coreper - the committee of
permanent representatives or ambassadors of the 12 to the EU - in Euro
decision-making, and argues that judgments on issues such as access to
information should be taken through political discussion, and not by Coreper
or the council bureaucracy.
He reckons the Dutch court case has a reasonable chance on procedural
grounds, but acknowledges that getting an acceptable information policy
could take a long time. 'But if you keep hammering away at the subject, in
the end, people give way, or at least find a possible modus vivendi for
everybody.'
Reinforcements should arrive if Sweden, Finland and Norway join the EU next
year as planned, bringing with them their fierce attachment to open
government, affixed as political declarations to their accession treaties.
'The Scandinavians will reinforce our side of the debate,' Mr Dankert states
confidently, 'and that debate will not stop.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Ireland's domestic issues dominate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Olive Braiden, a Fianna Fail candidate for the four-seat Dublin
constituency, sums up the general level of interest in Europe among
Ireland's 2.6m voters. Sipping a bowl of hot potato soup in a cafe in a
south Dublin shopping centre, after passing a bitterly cold morning shaking
hands and chatting with shoppers, she says, 'I am absolutely appalled at how
little people know about European affairs'.
Most of the 54 candidates contesting the 15 Irish seats are discovering that
domestic issues such as taxation and unemployment are of more concern to the
electorate than European affairs. At the Dublin bookmakers, Ireland's
performance in next month's World Cup is attracting considerably more
attention than the odds on Ireland's Euro-candidates.
This indifference comes in spite of the large amounts of EU funding flowing
to Ireland. The country's diplomats in Brussels are so effective in lobbying
for funds that one EU official gives them the collective appellation
'Ireland Inc'.
Up to the end of the decade, Ireland is due to receive IPounds 6.2bn (Pounds
6.08bn) in EU structural and cohesion funds from the EU, about 9 per cent of
total payments. Per head of the population this is significantly more than
will be obtained by Greece and Portugal.
Most Irish people derive their favourable view of Europe from the image of
Brussels as a cash cow to be milked thoroughly and regularly. In the
referendum on Maastricht in June 1992 the electorate voted by a majority of
more than two to one in favour of the treaty on European union.
Nevertheless, according to a random poll conducted by one of the Labour
candidates a fortnight ago, only 2 per cent of constituents can name their
local sitting MEPs.
On the Dublin campaign trail, Ms Braiden has been canvassing for the past 11
weeks, assisted by an enthusiastic crowd of friends and relatives. They have
already seen Ms Braiden's brother-in-law, Mr Ray MacSharry, successfully
climb the Euro-ladder, first as an MEP and then as the Commissioner for
agriculture in Brussels.
Reflecting how constituents are mainly concerned by national issues, Ms
Braiden says, 'It depends on what part of Dublin you are in. Here in the
wealthier southside, people are concerned about property tax. On the
northside, where unemployment can be as high as 75 per cent in some
neighbourhoods, people just want to know what is going to be done about
jobs.'
For the European elections, Ireland is divided into four constituencies.
Three of them - Dublin, Leinster, Munster - have four seats each.
Connacht-Ulster has three. As in the country's general elections, a single
transferable vote system is used.
The Fianna Fail party of prime minister Albert Reynolds has six outgoing
MEPs. Its junior partner in the coalition government, Labour, has just one.
Labour in particular, will be hard-pressed to repeat its performance of the
1992 general elections when it more than doubled its share of the vote from
9.5 per cent to over 20 per cent.
Judging from recent opinion polls, Fianna Fail is likely to emerge with five
to seven seats, Labour with none to two and the opposition Fine Gael and the
Progressive Democrats (PDs) with four or five and one respectively.

Orders for Germany's engineering sector in April rose 3 per cent in real
terms compared to April 1993, the VDMA, the engineering industry
association, reported yesterday. The increase in orders, which appear to
confirm that the industry is now emerging from recession, was boosted by a
particularly strong growth in exports to European Union countries. They rose
21 per cent over the same period, increased by 15 per cent during February
and April of this year when compared to the same period last year, and rose
by 8 per cent between February and April this year. However, domestic demand
remains sluggish. The VDMA reported a fall of one per cent between April
1993 and 1994. Judy Dempsey, Berlin
Italian employment in major industrial companies with over 500 workers fell
5 per cent in February 1994 from the corresponding month of 1993 and was
unchanged from January, the state statistical office Istat said yesterday.
The decline was evident in all sectors. Among the worst hit areas were
textile and clothing jobs (down 8.2 per cent) and chemical and related
sectors (down 8.3 per cent).
Belgium's year-on-year inflation was a preliminary 2.56 per cent in May, up
from 2.41 per cent in April but down from 2.69 per cent a year earlier, the
Belgian government said yesterday.
Sweden's current account showed a surplus of SKr2.7bn in the first quarter
of this year according to new calculation methods, the Central Bank said in

FT  31 MAY 94 / Socialist win unsettles Hungarian business: Why an absolute
majority is not necessarily cause for rejoicing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An absolute majority like that gained by the reformed communists in
Hungary's elections on Sunday is normally cause for rejoicing. And the mood
in the Socialist party headquarters on election night was euphoric even if
one old-fashioned supporter did get carried away on the entry of Socialist
leader Mr Gyula Horn, crying out: 'Long live the party.'
But the Budapest business community does not make the positive equation
between comfortable majority, one-party government and stability that is
standard in the West. Nor are the free marketeer technocrats among the
Socialists overjoyed by the extent of the party's defeat of the liberals and
governing conservatives. Some might share the comment of their opponents,
drawing on Hungary's rich reservoir of animal metaphors, that the electorate
has got up on to its horse only to fall off the other side.
The size of the Socialist success - the party won 209 seats to give it a
majority of 32 - has emboldened the left-wing of the party. Mr Gyula Horn,
the 61-year-old Socialist party president and a long-time communist,
reasserted the Socialists' western orientation in his victory speech, saying
his first visit would be to Bonn. But he also indulged in the kind of
left-wing rhetoric that had been absent from Hungarian politics since the
communists lost power in 1990. 'Finally the tower-block estates, the
industrial areas and the villages have a voice in Hungarian political life,'
he said.
The scale of the election victory, which exceeded even the Socialists'
forecasts, also reduces the likelihood of a coalition mooted with the
liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, which came second with 70 seats. That is
the combination privately favoured by many in the business and diplomatic
communities, for it would provide an institutional guarantee that the
Socialists would stick to the western oriented and free-market platform that
they propound.
Mr Horn said he would, notwithstanding the left's absolute majority, seek
talks with the Free Democrats. But the Socialist party is now likely at a
congress later this week to nominate Mr Horn as its candidate for prime
minister.
The liberals regard Mr Horn, who served in the workers' militia that helped
suppress Hungary's 1956 uprising against communist rule, as a divisive
figure. The Free Democrats have not formally ruled out serving in a
government led by Mr Horn. But party president Mr Ivan Peto said yesterday
that there would have to be a guarantee that the new government would pursue
a liberal economic line. That appears to mean that the Free Democrats would
insist the premiership go to Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialists' free
marketeer economics spokesman and a former finance minister, or to Mr Miklos
Nemeth, the reformist prime minister before 1990, now at the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr Horn appears reluctant, however, to sacrifice the power which is in his
grasp for the sake of coalition. 'He wants it as much as it is possible for
anybody to want anything,' says a leading liberal. Mr Bekesi was
conspicuously absent from the line-up of Socialist party leaders at their
victory press conference and Mr Nemeth is in London and deemed out of touch
by the Socialist leader. So the betting in Hungarian political circles is
that the revamped communists will govern alone and under Mr Horn. Mr Bekesi
has said that only a broad and solid coalition could implement the austerity
programme necessary to contain twin current account and budget deficits.
No one suggests that the left, unrestrained by coalition, will return to
communism. But one-party government has uncomfortable connotations for
sensitive Hungarians after the one-party dictatorship under which they
suffered for four decades.

Norway yesterday announced it will scrap a controversial plan to revise
taxation of the petroleum industry. The government last autumn began
drafting changes to the petroleum tax regime in which it was considering
reducing tax concessions to oil companies that use high levels of debt to
increase their tax allowances. The measure was meant to offset government
revenue losses suffered after special tax concessions were introduced in
1992. The new rules had led to higher dividend payments and profit
repatriations by foreign oil companies operating in Norway. But critical

Ukraine's ultimatum to Crimea to rescind its independence-seeking
constitutional legislation passed yesterday. Kiev's leaders reconsidered how
they should approach both its Russian-dominated region and its Russian
neighbour. Urging both sides to 'avoid sharpening the situation', Ukrainian
parliamentary chairman, Mr Oleksandr Moroz, said that debate on the Crimean
problem would be delayed until Wednesday.
Torn between taking a strong stand to control Crimea and avoiding a
confrontation, Kiev is also seriously considering a bold reversal in its
policy toward Russia. Instead of dividing the Crimean-based Black Sea fleet
with Russia, it may tell the Russians to go home.

Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, yesterday told telecoms
ministers that the liberalisation of telecommunications networks across
Europe could be achieved without large injections of public sector finance.
Presenting findings of the long-awaited industry report on the future of
Europe's telecoms markets, he said discrepancies between member states in
areas such as data protection and the remaining constraints on public sector
telecoms companies acted as more of a hindrance than scarcity of funding.
Ministers decided to press ahead with preparations for arrival of digital
television, agreeing to step up research and pave the way for harmonious
development across the continent by adopting joint standards. But the tricky
question of conditional access - ensuring only viewers who pay for
programmes get them - remained unsettled. No decision will be made until
September.

Plans to restructure Alitalia, loss-making state-owned national carrier,
will be scrutinised for the first time by the new Berlusconi government at a
meeting between the airline's chief executives and Mr Publio Fiori, the
transport minister. Within the Berlusconi government there are strong
pressures for cuts and changes even more radical than those proposed by the
three month-old board of Alitalia.
Several ministers want to use Alitalia as a demonstration of the
government's resolve to pursue free market policies and extend the scope of
the previous Ciampi administration's privatisation plans. Alitalia has
accumulated losses of L1,229bn (Pounds 513.3m) over the past six years, and
almost a quarter of that during 1993. The restructuring plan, which has been
presented to representatives of air and ground staff over the past two
weeks, has yet to be made public. But the unions fear the restructuring
proposed would involve cuts of over a fifth of the workforce.

One of four polls published yesterday showed Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic

<TEXT>
France's minister for European affairs, Mr Alain Lamassoure, yesterday
floated the idea that a hard core of European Union states should commit
themselves in 1996 as 'new founders' of the Union to carry out all its
policies - in order to stop a growing tendency of countries to apply only
those policies that suit them. In an article published in yesterday's Le
Monde newpaper, Mr Lamassoure argued that 1996, the year earmarked for a
revision of the Maastricht Treaty, should mark the creation of a 'new
founding contract'.
'A group of countries determined to set the example should announce its
intention of applying at the outset all the (measures) provided for by the
treaties - these are the 'new founders',' Mr Lamassoure said.
Speaking later at the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, Mr Lamassoure,
explained that the EU was faced with the 'double urgency' of enlarging
towards the east and retaining some efficiency in its decision-making.
'Neither goal can be sacrificed to the other' he said, 'and that is why I
have come up with this concept.'
Essentially, it would involve deciding that the planned 1996 constitutional
revision of the Maastricht treaty would be 'if not the final one, then at
least the last one for some 20 years,' the minister said. This would give
countries like Britain 'the pause in European integration they say they
need,' he said.
Mr Lamassoure said France and Germany would both need to be among the 'new
founders' in 1996. Mr Lamassoure has cited a single currency and joint
policies on foreign policy, defence, border controls and crime as the aims
of a 'hard core' of states.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Russia demands veto over Caspian oil deals: Moscow's salvo
seems designed to stall BP's Dollars 7bn project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has demanded the right to reject Caspian Sea oil projects that its
former Soviet neighbours are negotiating with western companies, a move
which could undermine some of the world's largest energy deals.
In a previously undisclosed letter sent on April 28 to the British Embassy
in Moscow, the Russian government declared that Caspian projects 'cannot be
recognised' without its approval.
Western diplomats regard the letter, evidently aimed at stalling a British
Petroleum-led consortium negotiating a Dollars 7bn oil deal in Azerbaijan,
as a new salvo by Moscow in its months-long attempt to reclaim a measure of
control over the energy-rich sea.
A source close to the Russian government said yesterday the position
outlined in the letter would be officially announced within the next few
weeks.
The letter says 'the Caspian Sea is an enclosed water reservoir with a
single eco-system and represents an object of joint use within whose
boundaries all issues or activities including resource development have to
be resolved with the participation of all the Caspian countries.'
It concludes that 'any steps by whichever Caspian state aimed at acquiring
any kind of advantages with regard to the areas and resources ..cannot be
recognised ..(and) .any unilateral actions are devoid of a legal basis'.
The letter also threatens two other massive projects, both in Kazakhstan,
the Dollars 20bn Tengiz oil project and the Caspishelf oil and gas venture.
Tengiz is largely offshore and has been awarded to the US oil company
Chevron, while Caspishelf, is run by a consortium led by Mobil, with BP,
British Gas, Agip, Statoil, Total and Shell.
Russia's moves come two years after the Soviet collapse led to the dispersal
of the Caspian's oil and natural gas reserves among Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan and Russia. In recent months Russia has demanded equity stakes
in western energy projects in the region.
Lukoil, a Russian state oil company, secured a 10 per cent share in the BP
consortium in Azerbaijan. Moscow also appears to have achieved approval in
principle for a stake in a giant British Gas/Agip venture at Karachaganak in
Kazakhstan. The Russians are also thought to want an equity stake in
Chevron's Tengiz field.
But Russia's latest assertion that it has pre-emptive rights over Caspian
energy ventures is the first concrete evidence that it intends to control
the flow of oil and natural gas from the ex-Soviet Union to the west.
Already, Moscow has achieved a large degree of success in steering the
republics away from building new pipelines through Turkey or Iran. Oil and
gas are now shipped through Russia, which enjoys complete control over the
republics' hard currency energy earnings from the west.
The letter to the British government is certain to frustrate the BP-led
consortium, which in the past year has seen at least two apparently firm
agreements on developing the Azeri and Chirag fields ripped up by the Azeri
side.
The latest talks in Istanbul follow a visit to London in February by Azeri
President Heidar Aliev, during which he signed a document that reinforced
the republic's intention to reach agreement with the western consortium. The
companies include the US producers Pennzoil and Amoco, with Statoil of
Norway, , McDermott, Ramco and the Turkish Oil Company.
The Azeris, who need cash to finance the six-year-old war with neighbouring
Armenia, is seeking a bigger share of the profit in the first few years of
the 30-year deal than the western companies earlier agreed to.
Under a previous agreement, the companies would receive the lion's share of
initial profits until the Dollars 7bn development costs are covered - though
they have already agreed to pay a Dollars 500m 'bonus' once the contract and
a pipeline are agreed. The deal's eventual value is estimated at Dollars
118bn in oil sales over its lifetime.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Greeks wrestle with the ins and out of banking: Turbulence
in financial markets has led to some unorthodox limits on withdrawal of
funds
</HEADLINE>

Just before closing time in a crowded National Bank of Greece branch in
central Athens, the cashier shouted: 'Will anybody with a deposit to make
please come to the head of the queue.' Two people in a line of 30 customers
walked forward, each clutching a single cheque. Conserving funds at a time
of financial turmoil, the bank was willing to give priority service for any
customer willing to make a deposit.
The call for depositors at National's branch in Skoufa Street has echoed in
banks across Athens as turbulence in Greece's financial markets moved beyond
dealing rooms and into the streets.
Bank customers complained that withdrawal slips had suddenly disappeared
from local branches.
They also said some 24-hour automated teller machines had been unplugged by
midnight - just the hour that Greeks planning a plate-smashing session at a
bouzouki club are looking for extra cash.
The unorthodox limits on withdrawals have come in the wake of moves by the
socialist government, to avert a devaluation of the drachma. It has lifted
short-term interest rates as high as 500 per cent and, with overnight
inter-bank borrowing rates averaging more than 200 per cent last week,
branch managers were determined to conserve funds.
Following the lifting of capital controls this month, Greek businessmen can
now take abroad as much foreign currency as they want, but there are now few
dollars or D-Marks to be found in Athens. One clothing trader complained:
'On Friday, it took a trip around seven banks in the centre of town to
collect DM1,500.'
The National Bank, the largest commercial bank, which has about 35 per cent
of total deposits in Greek banks, should be immune from pressure. However,
it told some customers last week that they would withdraw no more than 50
per cent on money deposited last week.
It also refused to open new corporate accounts and was charging interest
rates at an annual rate of 150 per cent on one-week loans, which are
generally used by small businesses to cover payroll costs at the end of the
month.
However, the banks complain that some company treasurers were quick to
exploit the surge in short-term money market rates by raising additional
loans and exploiting interest rate differences. These were used to buy repos
 -fixed-term repurchase agreements - from other banks, at interest rates
ranging from 55 to 90 per cent.
'This week we've been looking very carefully at loan requests, even from our
best customers,' said one banker.
Consumer lending, on the rise since the socialists tried in February to
inject some life into the economy by raising the ceiling on consumer credit
to Dr8m (Pounds 21,500), has collapsed as a result of the surge in interest
rates.
Greece's smaller private banks, generally run by shipowners or insurance
companies, specialise in devising imaginative loan products, and are
suffering under the weight of interest rates.
'What looked like a promising market has died,' said a car dealer, whose
hire-purchase network is linked with a bank's consumer lending programme.
'There's no way anyone can risk offering an instalment agreement in this
climate.'
The rise in short-term interest rates will be reflected in government
borrowing from this week. New issues will include a one-month zero-coupon
bond at 27 per cent, restricted to investors who can put up a minimum of
Dr15m and a three-month treasury bill at 25.5 per cent, up from 16.5 per
cent last month.
While the new bond issues should attract large cash inflows for financing
the public sector deficit, the cost to the government will include further
losses in VAT revenues as companies postpone payments. VAT revenue is
running at only 3 per cent above last year against a budget target of 22 per
cent. 'Companies are preparing to postpone their VAT payments in order to
take advantage of high interest rates for repos and treasury bills,' said
one analyst.
High rates are also the socialists' main weapon in the battle to prevent a
flight of capital, now that the last capital restrictions have been removed.
However, the lifting of restrictions has been accompanied by a web of
bureaucratic regulations likely to make transfers abroad will be complicated
and time-consuming.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Germany aims to privatise military support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has followed Britain in starting a drive to rationalise and where
possible privatise support services for its armed forces.
The German proposals on procurement and possible privatisation of logistics
and maintenance operations, launched quietly this month by Mr Volker Ruhe,
defence minister, could reduce the nominal price of Eurofighter 2000, the
controversial military aircraft.
While not as radical as Britain's Front Line First project, a cost saving
drive whose details will be announced by July, the German exercise includes
ideas familiar to defence planners in London.
Both countries' armed forces are now expected to move to a new system of
procuring spare parts that will operate more like the civilian motor
industry, using a reduced number of large depots supplying components in
response to computerised orders. Up to now, spare part depots serving allied
forces in Germany have been small, numerous and scattered to avoid
vulnerability to attack. This factor is now felt to be less important.
The German plan, to be overseen by Mr Jorg Schonbohm, calls for the possible
privatisation of weapons maintenance and some military training. It also
envisages wider use of the British practice of market testing, in which
private companies and internal divisions of the armed forces are invited to
compete for engineering or maintenance contracts.
But in some fields the plan could require increases in short-term
expenditure as a prelude to longer term savings. It calls for upgrading of
logistics and transport systems, seen as necessary when German defence
policy is placing greater stress on creation of rapid reaction forces.
Introduction of ISDN communications systems is also to be speeded up in the
belief that the corresponding increase in efficiency will pay for the
innovation in a few years.
The initiative follows submission in March to the German defence ministry of
a set of recommendations prepared by General Lorenz Huber with the help of a
management consultancy firm.
Although the plan makes no reference to Eurofighter, it appears to provide
at least part of the explanation for reports suggesting the unit cost of the
aircraft will be slashed as a result of privatisation of logistics and
maintenance.
Stern magazine has suggested that the aircraft's price tag of DM125m (Pounds
50m) per unit includes a DM68m logistics component which could be slashed by
up to 30 per cent if the work were farmed out to the private sector as
opposed to in-house engineers.
A spokesman for Deutsch Aerospace, the German manufacturer of Eurofighter,
confirmed that the company had put it to the government that privatising
logistics and maintenance could lead to substantial savings.
Germany has provisionally said it will buy 140 of the aircraft, starting in
2002, but no final decision will be taken till next year.
The defence ministry is currently engaged in delicate negotiations with
Deutsche Aerospace over funding of the development phase. Completion of the
development phase by the four partner countries - others are Britain, Spain
and Italy - will be seriously complicated unless the dispute is resolved in
the next few weeks, before the German parliament goes into summer recess.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Airbus ministers get tough with US
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four nations which make up the Airbus consortium yesterday urged the
European Commission to 'act vigorously' in talks with the US on an
international trade regime for civil aviation.
European irritation has grown over alleged interference in the aviation
market by the White House and the US Commerce Department, which are
perceived to have leaned heavily on foreign governments to buy US aircraft.
Trade and economy ministers from Britain, Germany, France and Spain were
meeting in the margins of the Berlin Air Show to discuss the issue.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economy minister, said he and his colleagues
had decided to write to the Commission urging it to maintain a firm stance.
Negotiators from the European Union and the US started work a month ago on
renewing a trade pact sealed in July 1992 which covers civil aviation but is
regarded by the Europeans as unsatisfactory.
Another European complaint is that the US government is heavily subsidising
US aviation through the back door by funding research which is nominally
connected with defence but has beneficial side effects for the civil sector.
Mr Rexrodt said: 'There are indications that the Americans are proceeding in
a very unconventional way.'

FT  31 MAY 94 / Oil predicted 'to remain' at around Dollars 12-Dollars 15 a
barrel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The widespread perception that oil prices are 'low' may be incorrect,
according to a new study which suggests that prices in the Dollars
12-Dollars 15 a barrel range in 1993 money are the long-term norm. Current
prices for the benchmark Brent Blend are hovering around the Dollars 16 a
barrel level.
The report by London brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnball finds no
evidence to suggest that there will be any long-term shortfall in oil. The
'inherent tendency (is) for oil supplies always to exceed demand,
irrespective of the rate of growth in oil consumption,' it says.
Mr John Toalster, oil analyst and one of the report's authors, said oil
supply, rather than demand, was the primary influence on prices. 'This
pre-eminence is likely to become even more marked in future,' he said.
The study dismisses current fears that a capital shortage among
financially-strapped members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries could lead to long-term supply shortages later this decade, when
demand is expected to rise strongly as areas such as Europe and Japan move
out of recession.
Mr Toalster concedes that there could be a temporary 'mismatch' between
supply and demand which could push prices up. But he contends that over the
longer term there is 'always a tendency for prices to fall.'
The report is optimistic that non-Opec output, widely expected to fall in
coming years, could be maintained through cost-cutting and the application
of new technology. This could further dampen price pressures.
The report suggests that trade wars could arise between Opec countries,
non-Opec producers and the oil producing countries of the former Soviet
Union vying for market share. It also suggests that fuel competition between
oil and natural gas is likely to intensify.
The historical record shows that oil production has been profitable even at
low price levels. The 'wealth, power and prestige' which flows from control
of oil reserves ensures the 'rapid and relentless' growth in reserves, a
process that is accelerated by advances in technology.

Mr Pierre Berge, chairman of Yves-Saint-Laurent, the famous French fashion
house, and a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand, yesterday was
questioned by a Paris court over allegations of insider dealing in
Saint-Laurent's shares.
The questioning follows a legal coup for Saint-Laurent earlier this month
when it won FFr2m (Pounds 230,000) in damages by successfully suing Ralph
Lauren, a leading New York fashion designer, for copying one of its designs.
However, the same court slapped a FFr500,000 fine on Mr Berge for making
defamatory remarks about Ralph Lauren in the US press.
Yesterday's case was the latest instalment in an investigation into
suspected insider trading in Yves Saint-Laurent's shares during the summer
of 1992.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Paris resists timetable on liberalisation: Row over air
routes
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday confirmed that it would open Orly airport to
UK airlines flying from London from June 13, but said it would resist the
timetable demanded by the European Commission for the liberalisation of some
domestic routes.
Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister said that Orly airport, in southern
Paris, would be opened to British carriers with a limit of four daily return
flights per airline. From the summer of 1995, the routes will be limited to
aircraft with more than 200 seats during the morning and evening peak travel
periods.
However, it was necessary to implement competition on a gradual basis, he
said. France would appeal to the European court of Justice concerning an
order by the European Commission to open the Orly-Toulouse and Orly
Marseille routes by the end of the autumn.
Britain welcomed the opening of Orly airport to London flights, but
expressed concerns about the limits placed on the frequency of services.
British Airways, which must share its allocation of four daily flights with
TAT European Airlines, its French affiliate, said it would challenge the
restrictions.
Yesterday's announcement follows a compromise agreement between France and
Britain which was reached two weeks ago and which averted a damaging
showdown between British airlines and the French government.
Mr Bosson said that the opening of the London-Orly route was in line with
French policy and would allow cheaper air travel.
The French government also stressed that French carriers must receive
improved access to London's Heathrow airport as part of the compromise
agreement with the British government. Air Liberte, a small French airline,
however, said that the problem of access to Heathrow had not been resolved.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Tapie: man of the moment in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The assembled Eurosceptics at a recent Paris rally of Sir James Goldsmith's
L'Autre Europe movement greeted the video images of the conservative and
socialist party leaders with mild derision. But when the permanently tanned
face of Mr Bernard Tapie appeared, the crowd went wild with jeers, boos and
hisses.
Love him or loathe him - and it is hard to find anyone in France who admits
to being indifferent to him - Mr Tapie, 51, the leader of the left-wing
Energie Radicale movement, is the man of the moment in the French campaign
for the European elections.
Thanks to his leadership Energie Radicale, once a motley assortment of
activists with little more than 2 per cent of the votes, now scores 10 per
cent in the opinion polls. Mr Tapie himself has raced ahead of the other
left-wing contenders to claim third place in the polls for next year's
presidential elections. He fares even better among young voters by tying for
first place alongside Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right prime minister.
His success is all the more surprising in the light of his financial and
legal problems. Mr Tapie, who was born in a poor Paris suburb but made a
fortune in the 1980s by buying bankrupt companies, has sold off his business
empire leaving a bitter legacy of heavy debts and court cases.
Olympique-Marseille, the football club that he groomed into the first-ever
French winner of the European Cup, is reeling from a recent match-rigging
scandal and faces relegation to the second division. Mr Tapie is currently
embroiled in no fewer than six judicial investigations.
Credit Lyonnais, his bank, is so concerned about his financial situation
that it has given him until Thursday to repay FFr450m (Pounds 52.4m) of his
FFr1.2bn debts. If Mr Tapie fails to pay, Credit Lyonnais will seize the
contents of his Paris home. It recently sent a bailif to take an inventory
of the contents of his Paris town house only to discover that its own
private detectives had previously filmed the removal of some of the most
valuable objects. The prospective Euro MP said he had lent a few 'favourite
pieces' to his mother-in-law.
His legal and financial plight is so dire that Mr Tapie's critics claim the
only reason he is standing in the European elections is the hope that yet
another layer of parliamentary immunity might help keep him out of prison.
Yet his personal problems seem only to have enhanced his standing among his
supporters and to have helped, rather than hindered, his progress in opinion
polls.
'The public sees Bernard Tapie as an adventurer, as part of modern French
folklore,' says Serge Raffy, a political commentator on Nouvel Observateur,
the current affairs magazine. 'To them he's one of the few people who dares
to wave two fingers at the establishment. Every time Credit Lyonnais, the
legal system or the tax authorities gang up against him, it just adds to the
Tapie myth.'
Mr Tapie has always styled himself as a man of the people. He is known for
his love of fast cars, big boats, flashy clothes and for devotion to his
football club. Whereas most French politicians pride themselves on peppering
their speeches with obscure literary or historical references, he is
notorious for livening up television chat shows by threatening to throttle
his opponents.
His image has made him an anathema to the Paris political establishment. Mr
Franz-Olivier Giesbert, editor of the conservative Le Figaro, recently
described Mr Tapie as the 'prince of swagger' and 'a loud-mouthed
guttersnipe'.
But the same earthy style has made him one of the few public figures that
ordinary people can relate to in a country where the upper ranks of finance,
industry and politics are filled with the haut bourgeois products of the
snooty Grandes Ecoles. Besides some people actually like Mr Tapie. He
recently topped a poll as the man most French women wanted to go to bed
with.
Mr Tapie's street chic has proved invaluable during his current crises. Each
time that Credit Lyonnais has stepped up the pressure over the past few
weeks, he has been swift to style himself as the victim of an establishment
plot. His conspiracy theories have struck a chord with the public.
A poll in last Sunday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper showed that nearly a
third of the electorate think he is being hounded by the establishment.
Yet even Mr Tapie seems to be finding it difficult to wriggle out of Credit
Lyonnais's clutches. He often claimed in past crises that all he really
wanted was to sail away on the Phocea, his luxury yacht. But the Phocea is
now the subject of a tax probe and is also threatened with seizure by Credit
Lyonnais as security for Mr Tapie's outstanding loans.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Brussels bows to UK on Ulster aid: Objections to Pounds 61m
grant for Taiwanese plant overruled after heavy lobbying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission overrode strong objections from its own officials
earlier this month in approving a Pounds 61m UK government grant for a
Belfast textiles plant to be built by a Taiwanese group, two of whose top
managers have been charged in connection with an alleged share fraud.
The Pounds 157m project, the largest industrial investment in Northern
Ireland since the De Lorean car venture which collapsed with heavy losses in
the early 1980s, has been backed by heavy lobbying in Brussels by British
ministers, MPs and MEPs.
According to senior Commission officials, one unnamed minister told Mr Karel
van Miert, the competition commissioner in charge of vetting the project,
that failure to approve it would have political consequences in London as
well as in Belfast.
The plant is to be built in a political stronghold of the Ulster Unionist
party by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese conglomerate.
Mr Oung You-ming, chairman of the division, jumped bail and moved to
Malaysia in 1991 after being charged by Taiwanese authorities with breach of
trust in a stock market scandal that led to the resignation of a Taiwanese
cabinet minister.
Mr Oung Ta-ming, his brother, who heads the Hualon group, has been convicted
on the same charges and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail. The
sentence was reduced on appeal to two-and-a-half years. Mr Oung is appealing
against his conviction before Taiwan's supreme court.
Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board, which handled negotiations
on the project and is due to sign a contract with Hualon on June 9, said it
knew of the investigations into the Oung brothers and of their outcome.
The IDB said it had not met or talked to any Oung family member involved in
the court cases. It said it had 'a well-established procedure for assessing
all relevant aspects of any project and its promoters'.
Mr Clifford Forsythe, Ulster Unionist MP for South Antrim, where the plant
will be built, and Mr Jim Nicolson, Northern Ireland's Ulster Unionist MEP,
said the IDB had never told them of the allegations surrounding Hualon and
the Oung family.
'I was not aware of any of this . . . and I have never heard anyone mention
it before,' Mr Forsythe said yesterday. 'In any of these situations you
expect the government department responsible to look at the situation very
carefully.'
It has also emerged that the Republic of Ireland twice turned down similar
proposals from Hualon. Mr Des O'Malley, then industry and commerce minister,
said yesterday: 'We decided not to go ahead with the deal because the
chairman of the company was arrested in Taiwan over an alleged share fraud.'
The Commission approved the Belfast project, expected to create 1,800 jobs,
on May 4 after a 10-month investigation. Officials in Brussels admitted
yesterday that the decision was politically influenced and said the project
would probably have been refused if it had been judged strictly on
competition criteria.
Commission officials investigating the case argued that it breached European
Union restrictions on state-aided investments in the troubled synthetic
fibres industry by adding to existing excess production capacity.
However, Mr van Miert and fellow commissioners concluded the plant would not
directly affect existing EU producers because it would use much less
sophisticated technology. They argued that it would probably be built
outside the EU if they blocked it. Their analysis appears to conflict with
statements by the IDB that Hualon will use advanced and highly automated
production methods to enable it to compete with low-cost imports from Asia.
UK and other EU textile manufacturers object that the project will create
unfair competition.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Government near victory on contracting-out reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is on the verge of winning an important policy reform from
the European Commission over limiting the scope of European labour
legislation in the case of the contracting-out of public services.
The victory would come at a useful time for the government just before the
European elections and would offer some evidence that the European Union is
moving to accommodate the UK's deregulatory approach on employment matters.
The government has been lobbying in Brussels for several months to exclude
contracting-out from the European Acquired Rights Directive (1977) - known
in the UK by the acronym Tupe - which protects the jobs and conditions of
employees when the undertaking they work for changes hands.
The government has faced strong opposition from the social and employment
affairs directorate general in Brussels and from the European trade union
movement. But it has support from the governments in France and Italy, who
are both interested in reform of the public sector.
More decisively, the German government has swung its weight behind reform of
the directive after a recent ruling from the European Court of Justice,
involving a German insurance company, which said that a single woman cleaner
should be covered by Tupe.
The belief among UK businesses that Tupe does apply to many cases of
contracting-out has impaired the government's programme of encouraging the
public sector to contract out services to private companies, and it has
reduced the expected savings to the exchequer.
There has been much legal dispute in the UK over what kind of business
undertaking is covered by Tupe and how much of an employee's pay and
conditions should be transferred. But the courts, most recently the Court of
Appeal, have often sided with the trade unions which have argued for the
widest possible application of Tupe.
The UK government has been arguing that Tupe should be amended to make it
clear that it applies to only whole economic undertakings, rather than to
individual activities, such as cleaning or catering, within such an
undertaking.
The latest proposed revision of Tupe states: 'The transfer of only an
activity of an undertaking . . . does not in itself constitute a transfer of
an undertaking'. This revision is being examined by Commissioners in
Brussels and if none of them strongly objects it could become law next month
without going to a full Commission meeting.
Officials in Brussels are privately optimistic about clinching the reform.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Chaos is the new order for economic planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Want to run a company? A country? the Treasury? Then rip up the planning
sheets and embrace creative chaos.
That is the message of a book from the Institute of Economic Affairs, the
free market think-tank that supplied Baroness Thatcher with many policy
ideas.
After decades in which economists have built convoluted mathematical models,
the book argues that long-term economic planning is based on a huge academic
illusion.
The argument is based on 'chaos theory', the scientific theory that opposes
the idea espoused by scientists since Isaac Newton that the universe is a
predictable place governed by simple rules.
Chaos theorists argue that disorder is the norm and that even simple
processes can yield a random outcome.
The concept is already in use: the London meteorological office incorporates
chaos theory in weather forecasts; some personal finance managers use it to
explain the stock market; it is used to help design washing machines; and
British innovators claim to have used it for developing bed springs. Mr
David Parker and Mr Ralph Stacey, authors of the book, argue that the
principle should be applied to economic planning.
Mathematical models can never capture the complexities of the world, the
authors say, so businesses and governments should accept that economic
forecasts are an art rather than a science. They should abandon
neo-classical economic thinking and embrace the chaos-driven theories of
'Austrian' economics, with its 'themes of spontaneous self-organisation,
enterprise and creative destruction'.
The political implications of that may have left even Lady Thatcher uneasy.
Governments should abandon market planning or even economic 'fine tuning'.
Companies should accept that they cannot plan for the long term, and the
Treasury should endorse institutional anarchy to allow creative change from
below.
The authors themselves refuse to predict how the government may react to
this - they note that since the future is unpredict-able, forecasts would be
mis-guided.

FT  31 MAY 94 / Big shake-up of Europe's labour market urged: Franco-German
study urges free trade and flexible working to cut unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MULHOUSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe should reduce labour market regulation, link pay to productivity and
lower barriers to cheap imports in order to increase competitiveness and cut
chronic unemployment, a Franco-German study recommends.
A summary of the study, prepared for the German and French governments in
the run-up to their year-long 'co-ordinated' presidency of the European
Union, was released yesterday and coincided with the first day of a two-day
Franco-German summit in the French border town of Mulhouse.
The report was issued by the economics ministry in Bonn and was welcomed by
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, as showing a high degree of
agreement between Germany and France on structural reform.
He described it as 'a major contribution to joint initiatives to solving
employment problems in Europe during the forthcoming German and French
presidencies of the EU'.
However, Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economics minister, appeared to
distance himself from the report, saying it was provisional and did not
commit his government.
Germany takes the EU presidency in July for six months and will be followed
by France, prompting the two countries to co-ordinate their agendas over the
next year.
Though commissioned by both governments at their Beaune summit a year ago,
the joint study was headed on the German side by Professor Johann Eekoff,
number two to Mr Rexrodt at the Bonn economics ministry, and, on the French
side by Mr Roger Fauroux, a former industry minister in the socialist
govern-ment.
In a separate communique, Mr Alphandery and Mr Theo Waigel, the German
finance minister, hailed the prospect of low inflation and rising growth
rates in their two countries, and called for measures favouring more
flexibility in the labour market.
The report says the two countries have different employment weaknesses.
Germany's drawbacks are said to include high wage costs, short working hours
and products often too complex for customers' needs. French companies suffer
from a heavy social security burden and invest too little in research.
However, the study says both countries suffer from 'far-reaching labour
market regulation, insufficient training and retraining . . . and lack of
wage differentiation'. It recommends:
Reducing regulation, 'above all in services, and promoting new companies and
technologies, instead of subsidising outdated structures'.
Basing wages policy on productivity, introducing more flexible working hours
and 'reviewing rules governing dismissals'.
Regarding cheap imports from east Europe as a potential benefit, rather than
a threat, because they 'lower production costs' for west European industry.
While most of the report's conclusions would seem more painful for France
than Germany, the study would not be without consequence for Germany which,
it is noted, has even more inflexible working hour rules than France.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regulations to stem imports into Britain of cut-price subsidised
construction steel, mainly from Italy and Spain, are being considered by the
UK government.
Companies including British Steel have become increasingly irritated that
foreign rivals find it easy to win work in the UK while, they say, many
continental European markets remain heavily regulated. They are particularly
concerned at a rise in the number of British bridge contracts awarded to
Italian and Spanish companies which, they claim, use cheap subsidised steel
produced in their own countries. Page 16; Japan's steelmakers under

FT  30 MAY 94 / Erich Honecker: hardline keeper of the Berlin Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Erich Honecker, who personified the intransigence of communism during the
1980s, died yesterday of cancer in the Chilean capital, Santiago, his home
since January 1993. He was 81.
The former East German leader, who started life as a roofer and spent years
in prison as an opponent of Nazi Germany, left for exile after the collapse
of his trial in which he was charged with responsibility for the death of 13
East Germans on the border with West Germany. His orders for border guards
to shoot at escapees, which resulted in 190 deaths, had led to a warrant for
his arrest in November 1990 after German unification.
German television brought almost hourly updates during the court case and
even boarded the aircraft that took him to Santiago after judges in Berlin
ruled he was too ill with liver cancer to stand trial.
By then pale and wizened, fascination with the man, seen by many as the East
German Politburo member responsible for the building of the Berlin Wall,
only faded after he had retired to his daughter's house halfway around the
globe.
He was born a miner's son in the Saarland, Germany's southwestern state.
Both his parents were members of the Communist party and the young Honecker
distributed party pamphlets at the age of eight and joined the Young
Spartacus Union, a children's communist organisation, aged 10.
He went on to join the Communist party in 1929, studied in Moscow, and
worked under various aliases to expand the party in Germany.
In 1935 he was arrested by the Gestapo charged with high treason and
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
It was Walter Ulbricht, East Germany's first Communist party leader, who
brought Honecker into the central committee after the second world war. He
earned Ulbricht's trust as leader of the Free German Youth (FDJ), the
party's youth wing, during a campaign led by Honecker to destroy all
television aerials which were being used to receive West German television.
Long Ulbricht's 'crown prince,' he was given responsibility in the ruling
politburo for military and state security. The top job fell to him in May
1971 after Ulbricht resisted Moscow's efforts to reach an accord with West
Germany.
Few East Germans expected much from the stern-faced Honecker who had a
reputation for orthodoxy and was a notoriously bad speaker.
However the early Honecker years, until about 1975, were seen in retrospect
by many East Germans as the country's most prosperous. With prompting from
Moscow, relations between the two Germanies were allowed to improve as Willy
Brandt, West Germany's Social Democratic chancellor, sought to improve ties
between Bonn and Berlin. In this respect Honecker played a crucial role.
Western politicians and businessmen beat a path to his door. A Sunday
afternoon meeting in 1973 over cakes and coffee with the late Herbert
Wehner, Social Democratic whip in the Bonn parliament, led to a series of
high-level meetings with West German leaders.
This two-track policy of strict domestic delimitation from West Germany
while courting the West German political and financial elite was crowned by
the visit to East Germany in December 1981 by Mr Helmut Schmidt, then West
German Chancellor.
But Honecker was pulled between the West German need for detente and the
Soviet need for legitimising a separate East German national state.
Honecker's desperately poor childhood coloured his outlook on life. On
inspection tours of cramped new East German housing estates he would remark
that workers under the Kaiser could never have dreamed of such superb living
conditions.
He failed to realise that East German workers did not compare their lot with
that of their grandfathers but instead with West German workers whose flats
were larger and equipped with more modern appliances.
Throughout the mid-1980s Honecker had longed to crown his political career
with a visit to Bonn.
Yet, in 1983 and 1984, as Moscow moved from one geriatric Communist party
leader to another, he was prevented from visiting West Germany and it was
only under the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he was at last
allowed to do so.
However, Honecker, increasingly divorced from the reforms which were taking
place in the former Soviet Union and Mr Gorbachev's refusal to intervene to
protect the Communist parties of Eastern Europe against popular uprisings,
in the end found himself up against the very Wall which was supposed to
protect East Germany.
Towards the end of 1989 the people of Leipzig and of East Berlin themselves
demonstrated against the Wall and eventually breached it on the night of
November 8. Honecker had failed to sense the shifting nature of power in
Moscow and in the West. Moscow had dropped him.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK group abandons Pounds 400m US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steep slide in share prices on the London stockmarket in recent weeks
has forced FKI, the Halifax-based electrical engineering and electronic
components group, to abandon a Pounds 400m US acquisition.
FKI has been involved in discussions with its target, thought to have been a
bulk handling systems manufacturer, since the start of the year and agreed a
purchase price, only to see its ability to fund the deal whittled away by
the slide in its shares.
Rumours of a possible rights issue from FKI, to fund a big international
acquisition, have been circulating in the London stockmarket since the turn
of the year when Kleinwort Benson Securities was appointed as the company's
stockbroker, succeeding Panmure Gordon. FKI was demerged from FKI Babcock in
1989. The company's financial adviser is NM Rothschild.
FKI sought to finance the deal via a rights issue but dropped its plan at
the last minute because of worries that shareholders might balk at an issue
in current volatile market conditions. The rights issue would have had to
have been priced at a deep discount to FKI's share price which has fallen 15
per cent to 180p since hitting an all-time high of 212p on March 21. Over
the same period the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index has dropped 7.1 per cent
and the FT-SE Actuaries Engineering sub-sector by 6.8 per cent.
The abandonment of the US deal is seen as a blow to FKI's strategy but the
company is thought to be still seeking further acquisitions, albeit of a
smaller size. FKI's last purchase was in the US in November last year when
it acquired the Truth hardware business from SPX Corporation for Pounds 68m.
The company is scheduled to announce preliminary results on June 16.
Analysts' estimates of pre-tax profits for the year to end-March range from
Pounds 50m up to Pounds 53m. Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, expects
it to achieve profits of Pounds 52.5m. The dividend total is forecast to
rise more than 20 per cent to a consensus figure of 3.7p.
Mr Jeff Whalley, FKI's chairman, was on holiday in France yesterday and
unavailable for comment. Mr Bob Beeston, FKI's chief executive, was on
holiday in Devon.

Former East German leader Erich Honecker (left) died in the Chilean capital
of Santiago, aged 81. He was charged with manslaughter over the deaths of
people trying to escape to the west over the Berlin Wall, but his trial in
Berlin was abandoned in January last year because he was suffering from
liver cancer. He left Berlin to live with his wife in Chile, where his
daughter had married. Obituary, Page 3

Holland Festival
Riccardo Chially is the conductor of a new production of Verdi's Falstaff,
which should set the Holland Festival off to a sparkling start on Wednesday.
The festival is based in Amsterdam and lasts for the month of June. Falstaff
apart, there are several themes this year, including new music written in
China since the end of the Cultural Revolution - a generally unknown
quantity, advertised as 'expressive, theatrical, exotic'. Dance and theatre
events, led by Merce Cunningham and Peter Brook, support the main music
programme.
Royal Academy Summer Show
Once it signalled the start of the London season and it remains a social
event of a very English sort. The Summer Show, in which members of the
public are invited to contribute up to three works of art for exhibition
alongside Royal Academicians, has been held annually since 1769. This year
there were 13,000 entries - paintings, sculpture and architectural designs.
A final 1,300, among them The Bathers by Bill Jacklin RA, were selected.
After a week of private views and parties, the exhibition opens on Sunday.
Royal Ballet
Marking its return to Covent Garden after its American tour, the Royal
Ballet revives Anthony Dowell's production of Don Quixote. Sylvie Guillem
is, according to our dance critic Clement Crisp, 'trapped aboard this
Titanic of the dance: she may have the wit to find the only life-belt.'
Performances, all with Mlle Guillem, tonight, Wednesday and Saturday.
Ballet-lovers in New York will be at the State Theater for New York City
Ballet. Tonight in Paris, the Opera Bastille hosts the wonderful La
Bayadere.
Jazz
The spirit of carnival and tropical Bahia comes to London on Wednesday when
the original Tropicalia musicians, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, are
reunited for the first time in 20 years at the Royal Albert Hall. Joined by
Gal Costa and Caetano's sister Maria Bethania, the Doces Barbados (the four
great Bahians) will perform alongside the 50 drummers and dancers of the
Mangueira school of Samba in an exciting climax to the Brazilian
Contemporary Arts 'Festival of Bahia'.
Bonn Opera
One of the most unusual operatic premieres of the season takes place on
Sunday when the Bonn Opera stages Il Guarany, a four-act opera-ballet by
Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Gomes. Based on a love story about the
Guarani Indians, it was first performed at La Scala in 1870. Long forgotten
outside Brazil, it owes its revival to Placido Domingo who sings the title
role. The producer is Werner Herzog, of Fitzcarraldo fame.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday: With the dollar still weak, attention will focus on this week's
spate of US industrial and monetary data. Figures published today are
expected to show a slight drop in personal consumption in April, but little
change in consumer confidence in May.
Wednesday: In the UK, the purchasing managers' index is likely to provide
further evidence of recovery. Last month, it rose to its highest level ever.
Another strong figure would suggest the pick-up in manufacturing continued
into May.
Thursday: Speculation about French interest rates will be raised when the
Bank of France holds its council meeting. Although the Bundesbank's failure
to cut rates last week suggests that the French authorities will also sit
tight, some analysts believe a small monetary easing, of around 10 basis
points, is possible.
Friday: A flood of US data will shed further light on the strength of the US
recovery. The May non-farm payroll is expected to show a small rise, with a
larger rise in the manufacturing pay roll. But home completion and car sales
figures are expected to remain flat.

MONDAY 30
Franco-German summit
A two-day Franco-German summit begins in Mulhouse, France, between President
Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They are expected to commit
themselves to a common European Union programme for their consecutive
presidencies over the next 12 months, beginning with the German term in
July. Job creation, opening the market to eastern Europe, and making the
Maastricht treaty work are key themes. They must also agree on a favoured
candidate for the future presidency of the European Commission, to be
finalised at the EU summit in Corfu.
Mad cow fever: European Union agriculture ministers meet in Brussels today
and tomorrow to discuss farm prices and how to respond to German pressure to
ban all imports of British beef because of the risk of BSE, or mad cow
disease.
Crimea: An ultimatum from Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk (below) for
the Crimean parliament to reverse its virtual declaration of independence
runs out today.
On May 20, the parliament decided to adopt a separate constitution for the
peninsula, whose population is more than two-thirds Russian and which was
part of Russia until 1954. The move was regarded as a prelude to secession.
Ukraine has moved in national guardsmen and armoured personnel carriers, but
has also opened a dialogue with Crimea's parliamentarians and sworn to
eschew violence.
East Timor is the subject of a conference being held in Manila, capital of
the Philippines (to June 4). The meeting, organised by private groups, is to
debate Indonesia's 1976 annexation of the former Portuguese colony and
alleged human-rights abuses on the island.
Telecoms ministers from the European Union meet in Brussels to discuss among
other things trans-European data highways, and a discussion paper on mobile
telephones.
Croatian currency: Croatia is from today, Croatian Statehood Day, reviving
the kuna, the currency used by the Nazi puppet Ustashe regime of the second
world war. The kuna, which is replacing the Croatian dinar introduced at
independence in 1991, will be pegged to the D-Mark at the rate of 4 kunas to
1 D-Mark.
Holidays: UK (Spring Bank Holiday), US (Memorial Day); Congress is in recess
all week.
TUESDAY 31
Bank of Italy annual report
Antonio Fazio (below), the governor of the Bank of Italy, presents his
annual report on the economic and financial state of the country.
Mr Fazio's statement, his second in office, is keenly awaited as the key
indicator of how the bank assesses the policy options of the Berlusconi
government. The report will also be read for any hint that the bank might
fear political interference from a government which does not necessarily see
eye to eye with Mr Fazio and his team.
Algeria meets its chief western creditors in Paris to discuss the terms
under which it will reschedule that part of its Dollars 14.5bn foreign debt
owed to foreign governments.
Germany's leading industry association, the Bundesverband der Deutschen
Industrie, will consider the outlook for German industry at its annual
assembly in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading politicians will
address the gathering.
Guatemala talks: Representatives of the Guatemalan government and guerrillas
meet in Oslo for peace talks (to June 4).
UK economy: The release of May's narrow money supply figures is likely to
fuel debate about inflationary pressures in the UK economy. The market
predicts that M0, which largely measures notes and coins in circulation,
grew by 7.1 per cent in May, measured year on year, compared to 6.2 per cent
in April.
Government officials point out this rise partly reflects strong retail sales
and low interest rates. But with M0 growth running well above the
government's target range of 0-4 per cent, a large monthly jump will
intensify speculation about future monetary tightening.
Non-Aligned Movement: Foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement gather
in Egypt for a meeting expected to focus on the fighting in Bosnia and
Rwanda and to set out plans to tackle the economic problems of developing
nations. The ministers are likely to decide on whether to grant official
guest status to Russia. Belgrade has been excluded from the meeting.
Light up at your peril: Today is World No Tobacco Day.
FT Surveys: German Banking and Finance and The Computer Industry: The Battle
for the Desktop.
Holidays: South Africa (Republic Day).
WEDNESDAY 1
UN names pleasantest land
The United Nations Development Programme publishes its fifth annual Human
Development Report, which aims to measure quality of life rather than simply
economic growth. Its core is the Human Development Index, ranking 173
countries by a measure that combines life expectancy, educational standards
and basic purchasing power. Canada is expected to be ranked first.
Its appearance is timed to coincide with the start of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development at the World Bank headquarters in
Washington, DC.
German economy: With the markets increasingly pessimistic about the chance
of a further interest rate cut from the Bundesbank, April's output figures
are likely to be watched for signs of the recession bottoming out. The
markets expect to see industrial production up 0.4 per cent in April, after
falling 0.8 per cent in March. Although a recent survey showed German
business confidence had also risen in April, many analysts remain doubtful
about the strength of any pick-up.
George Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the
heavily indebted leisure and property group, and Wilfred Aquilina, former
group finance director, go on trial at Southwark Crown Court, south-east
London, charged with conspiracy, theft of Pounds 12.5m from the company and
false accounting.
Euro poll:
Europeans have become increasingly ambivalent - not to say Eurosceptical -
about the goal of political and monetary union enshrined in the Maastricht
treaty. Just over a week before the elections for the European parliament on
June 9 and 12, an FT opinion poll across all 12 EU countries provides a
wide-ranging survey of Europeans' feelings and forecasts about the future of
the continent. The poll, carried out in association with seven other
European newspapers, throws light on divergences in European attitudes on
the widening and deepening of the EU.
D-Day anniversary: US President Bill Clinton leaves Washington for his
second European trip of the year, pegged to the D-Day commemorations but
with room for political business on the side. His first stop will be Italy.
Racing: The Derby is run at Epsom, south of London.
Holidays: Kenya (Madaraka Day).
THURSDAY 2
Bosnia factions at UN talks
Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders meet in Geneva for talks on a comprehensive
ceasefire in Bosnia (to June 3). It is understood that the warring factions
could be prepared to sign a four-month, Bosnia-wide ceasefire. This would be
likely to entail interposing UN troops between the combatants, the creation
of a buffer zone and withdrawal of heavy weapons. Last week, Bosnian Serb
forces agreed to allow UN observers to patrol freely in the heavy weapons
exclusion zone around the Moslem town of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.
Chambers of Commerce: About 500 executives gather in Birmingham for the
British Chambers of Commerce annual conference (to June 3).
The main concern is the impact on profitability of outside factors such as
the environment, finance and, of course, government, European and economic
policy. Speakers include foreign secretary Douglas Hurd and secretary of
state for trade and industry Michael Heseltine (above).
Education: John Patten, UK education secretary, risks humiliation when he
addresses the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers
at Eastbourne today. Last year, he was booed, hissed and heckled at the
conference, which coincided with the height of the controversy over national
curriculum tests. A year later, there are signs of increasing anger among
heads over new requirements for teaching religious education, while the
indications are that only marginally more tests were taken in secondary
schools this year.
Children's rights: Romanian government hosts a conference in Bucharest with
UN and Save the Children.
India: bank staff plan two-day strike.
FT Surveys: Belgium and Foreign Exchange.
Belgium's political and business leaders are regaining their confidence
after a year in which the prime objective was to ride out the country's
worst recession for 60 years.
Cricket: England plays New Zealand in the first Test at Trent Bridge (to
June 6).
Holidays: Austria, Brazil, Chile, parts of Germany, Portugal (Corpus
Christi).
FRIDAY 3
FDP annual conference
Germany's ailing Free Democratic Party gathers in Rostock, on the Baltic
coast, where Klaus Kinkel, party leader and foreign minister, will try to
revive his troops. The party is in danger of failing to win any seats in the
European elections on June 12, and ending up too weak in October's general
election to perform its traditional role of king-maker in the ruling
coalition.
World Environment Day sees the UK hosting a conference on the United Nations
environment programme at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London.
The Global 500 environmental awards will be presented.
Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary will deliver 'a major policy speech' at
a lunch hosted by the Confederation of British Industry in London. It will
touch on world trade, foreign investment in the US and current US economic
policy.
D-Day anniversary: US president Bill Clinton in Italy to meet the Berlusconi
government and Pope John Paul, and attend commemorations of the Anzio and
Nettuno allied landings during the second world war.
WEEKEND 4-5
OAS general assembly
The 34 members of the Organisation of American States gather on Sunday in
the northern Brazilian city of Belem (to June 10). On the agenda are
democracy and human rights, environmental issues, drugs and the region's
economy.
Inhuman rites: A protest March leaves Oxford on Saturday for nearby
Campsfield detention centre, where would-be immigrants can be held
indefinitely while it is decided whether they have a right to enter the UK.
Motor racing: Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races start (to June 10).
Rugby: England play South Africa in the first test in Pretoria on Saturday.
The Royal Academy of Art's summer exhibition opens (to Aug 14).
Bill Clinton visits the UK. On Saturday, he visits a US military cemetery in
Cambridge, then lunches at Chequers with John Major, before a state banquet

FT  30 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: US data and Buba hold key to dollar -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar will again be the focus of attention when traders return to their
desks tomorrow, with central bank activity and US labour data likely to be
foremost in their thoughts.
The dollar took a tumble last week when comments from senior Bundesbank
officials left the impression that the pace of German interest rate
reduction was likely to slow.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has since said that he was
referring to official rates, so the repo auction on Wednesday is likely to
be closely watched.
The main focus, however, will be the release of US economic data -
particularly the labour market statistics on Friday - but also the
purchasing managers' index on Wednesday.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said
that if the data supports the belief that growth in the current quarter is
going to be above 4 per cent, then the market will start speculating about
another monetary tightening.
Whether shifting interest rates will be sufficient to support the dollar
must be doubtful. The currency has failed recently to benefit from interest
rate differentials moving substantially in its favour.
In the short term the dollar is more likely to be led by developments in
Japan. The announcement last week that US-Japan trade talks would resume
should have been dollar positive, but its effect was evident for less than
24 hours.
A possible wild card would be a lowering of short term interest rates by the
Bank of Japan. Consumer inflation figures, released last Friday, showed
inflation was still very low, at only 0.8 per cent in the year to April.
Sceptics are still predicting a softer dollar. Swiss Bank Corporation, in
its latest currency commentary, recommends clients to 'sell US dollars for a
renewed test of the historic lows.' SBC says a rally to Y106-7 will not
arrest the downward trend that will take the dollar to Y98-95.
In Europe attention will revert to the drachma and the escudo, both of which
have been under selling pressure recently. Traders are predicting that the
escudo will be in the firing line again, while the Bank of Greece's
intention to lower interest rates could put the drachma under renewed
pressure.

ZURICH
Sandoz holds an analysts meeting in London on Thursday and, says NatWest
Securities, is likely to present last week's acquisition of Gerber as part
of a strategic refocusing which emphasises food and pharmaceuticals as core
businesses. NatWest expects the company to hint at further acquisitions in
these sectors and divestments in non-core areas.
It says that while this is likely to be well received by the market, it
remains cautious following the Gerber acquisition, which brings with it
little apparent synergy with the existing nutrition business.
Roche, whose certificates came under pressure after its acquisition of
Syntex, has its annual general meeting tomorrow. In the insurance sector,
Winterthur holds its annual news conference on already-announced results
tomorrow, and Zurich Insurance's annual news conference takes place on
Wednesday.
AMSTERDAM
First-quarter figures come from ING and KLM on Thursday. Hoare Govett
forecasts net attributable profit from ING up 11 per cent to Fl 400m
(Dollars 217.4m), with profit improvements coming in all lines. Results will
also benefit from the absence of losses at Orion and NRG, which were still
consolidated in the first quarter of 1993.
Hoare Govett expects KLM's growth in operating income to be much higher than
growth in operating costs, and therefore estimates an operating loss of Fl
128m against one of Fl 266m in the same period of last year.
STOCKHOLM
The privatisation of Pharmacia, expected to raise SKr13bn (Dollars 1.7bn),
begins on Wednesday with domestic investors being offered 40m shares, with a
further 32m earmarked for foreign investors.
Four-month figures come from Saga Petroleum on Monday. Unibank forecasts
turnover down to SKr1.88bn from SKr1.92bn, and net profits of SKr205m, after
SKr209m last time.
TOKYO
Last week's rally of large capital steels and heavy industry stocks suggests
that liquidity in the stock market is increasing. However, many corporate
and financial investors are looking to sell holdings around the 20,800 to
20,900 level. So, while activity may increase, a sharp rise in prices is
unlikely.

<TEXT>
Last Friday offered distinct contrasts in sentiment on China's fledgling
stock markets after President Clinton announced the renewal of China's
privileged trade access to the US market.
In Shanghai, particularly, but also in Shenzen, B shares denominated in US
and Hong Kong dollars for foreign ownership recovered strongly as the
indices of A shares for local investors finished down in lacklustre trading.
After bottoming in April, Shanghai Bs rallied this month, in line with
performance elsewhere in the Pacific Basin, excluding Japan. Most Favoured
Nation renewal took them ahead of the pack on Friday, with a gain of 4.7 per
cent, Shenzen rising 2.6 per cent in thin trading.
However, local observers are not impressed. They note that the latest rally,
which took Shanghai B shares up 12.5 per cent last week, was fuelled partly
by the entry of Japanese investors into the market; but also that it follows
a period of severe underperformance, with a preceding fall of 40 per cent
this year.
Their scepticism is based on the poor performance of A shares, in which the
bulk of trading is conducted and which have lost more than two thirds of
their value since their highs in early 1993.
Investors, who had besieged the markets when trading began several years
ago, have been deserting stocks in droves for bonds, currencies and futures
 -although the latter form of investment has hit a rocky patch under the
weight of tighter government regulation.
Market managers seeking an explanation for what is now a protracted downturn
 -the slide became a rout in the second half of last year - blame delays in
the promulgation of a national securities law for the collapse of
confidence.
But while it is true that slow progress towards formulating a National
Securities law, now in its ninth draft, has harmed confidence, there would
seem to be other more telling factors.
Among these is the psychology of the market. Inexperienced investors,
starved of investment opportunities for so many years, plunged into equities
(Shanghai opened in December, 1990 and Shenzen in July, 1991) without due
regard for the quality of the stocks offered, or their earnings potential.
Because of the limited number on offer, shares also enjoyed a scarcity value
way out of proportion to likely returns. Inevitably, stock market fever
cooled after the initial burst of enthusiasm, leaving a long trail of
casualties.
Indeed, hard-luck stock trading stories have become standard fare in the
Chinese press. Some read like soap-opera scenes, with a surfeit of unhapping
endings - including suicide.
In one case, which captured particular attention, a wife sued successfully a
securities company for her husband's suicide. The hapless stock trader had
jumped to his death after losing millions in margin trading.
The authorities, sensing that crumbling confidence in equities is harming a
key element of their market reforms, have sought recently to bolster the
markets, but this is likely to be a slow and complex process.
Measures announced earlier this month included an effective freeze until
next year on new stock listings and the requirement that companies seeking
listings be obliged to undergo 'six-month-long coaching by relevant
departments.'
China had planned to issue some Yuan5.5bn (USDollars 634m) of A shares in
1994, a similar figure to last year. But this target clearly has been
abandoned. The freeze on A share listings will not affect B shares. The
authorities are committed to adding further listings to the 42 traded on the
Shanghai and Shenzen bourses.
China's official Business Weekly yesterday quoted an official of China
Securities Regulatory Commission in Beijing as saying that, in an effort to
lift the market, larger enterprises in energy, communications,
transportation and railways would be considered for B share listings.
The authorities are also seeking to crack down on stock market abuses such
as widespread insider trading and wilful peddling of misleading information.
Exacerbating the problem is the fact that companies and brokerage houses are
all state-owned.
The China Securities News, a Shanghai-based publication, reported last week
that securities regulators and police were joining forces to stamp out
market manipulation and fraud by securities company officials, company
directors and even by stock market regulators themselves.
Misuse of public funds in an evolving system where distinctions between
public and private are often blurred is a considerable problem. In Shanghai
in the first quarter of this year, the authorities reported 49 cases of
stock-market speculation, involving public money of Yuan91.11m.
Another factor bedevilling China's markets has almost certainly been the
focus in the past year or so on listings abroad. Nine mainland companies
were cleared for listing in Hong Kong last year, and another 22 are under
consideration for primary listings abroad this year - both in Hong Kong and
on other exchanges, such as New York and London.
Foreign investors, including proliferating China funds, have tended to
favour these opportunities above those on the mainland, partly because of
greater confidence in the regulatory regimes of offshore exchanges and the
discipline required of Chinese companies seeking listings abroad.
All of this is proving an immense challenge for China's hard-pressed
stock-market regulators, who are responsible for guiding what is largely an
experimental market to maturity.
With limited staff and resources, officials of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission are being obliged to oversee a highly complex process
that is far from immune to political interference. Not least of their
problems is the artificial distinction between A and B shares.
Ideally, the distinction should be removed, but this does not seem possible
until the yuan becomes freely convertible, and that process may taken up to
five years.
In the meantime, another option might be to allow local Chinese to purchase
B shares in foreign currency, but the worry is that this would almost
certainly further devastate the A share market. For China's stock regulators
there are no easy choices.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Collapse puts chartists back in limelight -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity chartists are back in the limelight as the community of stock
market analysts struggles to find its footing again after last week's
collapse swept away many of the signposts. The fall of the Footsie to 3,150
was significant; the threat of 3,015 was very worrying. Are we heading for
2,910, and how seriously should we take the chartists' warnings that the
next serious support levels are around 2,850 or 2,550?
The downside argument, marshalled by Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research -
who has long seen the market at 2,800 - is that the failure of last week's
bund auction pinpoints the probability that yields have further to rise, in
the UK as well as in continental Europe. He says that rising interest rates
are sinking investors' perceptions of equity valuation - 'therefore, the
market is not getting any cheaper'.
On the other hand, at Footsie 2,850, the equity yield would be around 150
basis points above expected inflation, and the yield ratio at levels last
seen before the economic recovery began.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, for one, finds this 'an unlikely
scenario'. A more likely outcome, he believes, is a rising yield relative as
economic growth continues, and a more stable valuation of UK equities.
None of this gave the market any protection as the stock index future
contract on the Footsie plunged below 3,000. This happened several times
last week - three times in one session, in fact - before the line was
finally abandoned in a hurry on Friday afternoon. Given the importance of
the future contract as a mechanism for portfolio rebalancing, the headlong
retreat from the Footsie 3,000 mark is distinctly worrying.
The sudden upset in equities underlines the wisdom of fund managers chasing
the utility stocks over the past fortnight. Water stocks have outperformed
by about 5.5 per cent. BZW believes the yield attraction will continue to
score with investors as long as the overall equity background remains so
difficult, although possible regulatory questions will resurface when the
market concerns are resolved.
Consumer stocks continue to lose supporters, as price competition and
sluggish personal spending undermine optimism. The market reception for
Marks and Spencer's trading statement was cool.
The engineering vehicle sector was identified early as an area primed to
benefit from economic recovery, but has underperformed by around 4 per cent
recently. Smith New Court comments that the European car market, after a
promising opening to the reporting season, is now showing little sign of
overall recovery.
Lucas Industries, with a large exposure to the continental European car
industry, may prove to be late in the recovery cycle, thinks Smith, although
its grip on around one third of both Europe's foundation brake and diesel
car systems markets augur well for 1995 and 1996.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Data deluge will set tone for summer - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US, the Memorial Day weekend traditionally marks the beginning of
silly season. As Wall Street gets back to work tomorrow after the three-day
holiday, investors will face an avalanche of economic reports which could
set the tone for the summer months.
Tuesday will bring news of personal income, consumer spending and new homes
sales during April. The flow of data will intensify the next day, when the
National Association of Purchasing Management will release its monthly
survey of business activity. It will culminate with the Commerce
Department's report on May employment, due out Friday.
The optimistic scenario sees stocks holding up well, even if the bond market
slips further. The leading indices could show modest improvement if the data
confirm expectations that the economy slowed slightly in May.
'I think we are in a phase in which most of the monthly numbers will remain
subdued,' says Mr James Solloway, head of equity research at Argus in New
York, whose estimates are generally below those of his colleagues.
If there are surprises, however, share prices could suffer a setback in
sympathy with bonds. 'We are faced with a bond market which still on the
defensive,' Mr Solloway says, 'It will stay that way until it becomes clear
that monetary policy is tight enough to slow the economy.'
If the NAPM index comes in at 60 or better, against a consensus forecast of
57, or if the gain in non-farm payrolls exceeds 300,000, against an expected
rise of 285,000, the season may prove to be more sombre than silly. The next
move by the Federal Reserve to tighter money would then loom larger.
A fortnight ago, the Fed seemed to suggest it would hold off further
interest rate increases until autumn. However, then it had not made any
guarantees, a point underscored on Friday by Alan Greenspan in testimony
before Congress. The chairman did not spell out the Fed's intentions, but he
stressed that 'uncertainties regarding the economy remain'.
His remarks left the bond market, already riding out a big bump caused by
the Commerce Department's upward revision of its first-quarter Gross
domestic product, on even shakier footing going into this week.
However, Mr Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read in New
York, believes stocks will hold steady despite the data barrage. 'The
markets may enter a temporary period of calm,' he writes in his May
advisory. He argues that none of the reports this week will shed light on
the impact of the Fed's series of four policy tightening. He says the effect
of tighter money on the economy will not show up until at least July.
However, the analyst remains bearish. He characterises his lazy summertime
scenario as the 'eye of the hurricane', a period of calm in the middle of a
two-phase market correction. 'We continue to believe that the second leg
will kick in when the end-of-the-summer inflation reports come in worst than
expected.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Fresh challenge for users of derivatives -
Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as the world's bank and financial regulators are making a heroic effort
to adapt to the new challenges posed by interest rate, foreign exchange and
equity derivatives, the world's bankers and broker-dealers are in the
process of taking high-tech risk management to another level.
Derivatives, particularly the plain-vanilla type of interest rate swaps and
options that help mitigate market risk, have become standard tools of
treasury management. Once viewed as exotic, they have achieved widespread
acceptance, a point underscored last week when Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the US Federal Reserve, asked Congress not to single out derivatives for
regulatory reform.
Now, financiers are taking the applications of options and derivatives
technology they've used to harness interest rate risk and applying them to
to another broad area of institutional exposure: credit risk.
Managing credit risk has long been the purview of bankers and provided the
bread and butter of credit rating agencies. Transfering, or trading the
credit risks of a particular instrument or portfolio has, until recently,
been difficult or impossible. Managing credit risk required a banker to deal
directly with the the cash instrument in question.
Now, derivatives experts say transferring credit risk can be as easy as
transferring interest rate risk, using tailored instruments written by the
likes of Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse First Boston. As
with interest rate derivatives, these credit risk transfer instruments break
down the various aspects of credit risk, repackage them, and make them
available for an offsetting trade.
If a banker has exposure to senior corporate loans with relatively high
yield and high credit risk, Merrill Lynch might offer a choice of three
derivatives strategies to manage that risk, says Mr Joseph Arigilagos, head
of the firm's investor strategies and credit derivatives group. 'We might
write a put option on the price of the debt, or an option on the credit
spread between the yield on the loans and a Treasury instrument. It's even
possible we could write options on the default risk of the loans,' he says.
The options would insulate the banker if the credit risk of the loans rose,
while still allowing him to keep the loans and collect the higher yield.
Having written the specialised options, Merrill Lynch would reach into its
global network of corporate credit dealings and perform trades that would
offset its exposure to the deal.
These strategies and others are being used to manage credit risks for LDC
loans, low-grade bank loans, and junk bond portfolios. As do other
derivatives, credit derivatives increase leveraged exposure, in this case to
high-yielding debt. The strategies assume that for every person or company
that has a natural credit exposure to be managed, there is another party
willing to assume that credit risk in return for higher yield.
The year-old move into credit derivatives has hardly been a calvary charge,
but the bankers who are enthusiastically backing the new products predict
that the credit-risk management business could boom into a Dollars 1,000bn
market in a matter of years. Some of their early attempts at credit
derivatives marketing backfired when an early strategy - repackaging
low-grade debt into trust securities that were reissued as top-rated but
high-yielding bonds - ran afoul of Standard and Poor's. The credit ratings
agency insisted the rating of the credit derivative be linked to the ratings
of the component junk bonds, and not to the rating of the derivative issuer.

Thailand
The Stock Exchange of Thailand has agreed to lower the entry fee for four
new brokerage seats from Bt350m (Dollars 14m) to Bt305m, following vigorous
complaints from the market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and Thailand's 37 sub-brokers, writes William Barnes.
The revised fees are still much higher than the Bt200m suggested by the
Commission, which has the power to insist that the charge be cut again.
The Dollars 12m entry fee is one of the most expensive in the world: Tokyo,
for example, charges Dollars 9.5m, while Hong Kong and New York extract only
a 10th of what Thailand's 40 full members expect to squeeze from newcomers.
'This is only a cosmetic reduction - the fee is still far too much. It makes
the members of the exchange look very cynical,' said Mr Korn Chatikavanij,
managing director of Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities, one of the
sub-brokers hoping for a seat.
Stock exchange officials say the fees are needed to develop the market and
are based on the expected growth in the volume of trading over the next five
years; critics argue the members are trying to protect their higher
commissions.
The SET has also signally failed to address the request of Mr Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, that it comes up with a sensible and
explicit policy on admitting new members. The exchange says it will admit
only four new members in two months time and merely review the situation
every two years. Three sub-brokers are strongly tipped for full memberships:
JF Thanakom Securities, Ekachart Finance &amp; Securities, and Nithipat Capital.
Taiwan
Mr Samuel Shieh, the central bank governor, denied a television report that
the central bank had bowed to political pressure and agreed to raise the
ceiling for foreign investment in the island's stock market from Dollars
7.5bn to Dollars 20bn.
Taiwan raised the ceiling from Dollars 5bn in March. Foreign institutions
have been allowed to invest directly in Taiwan since early 1991.

FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe endures cycle of price pressures
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been the same pattern for months now: each time Europe's bond markets
edge cautiously higher after a bout of weakness, they get battered by
another wave of selling pushing prices to new lows.
Last week, European government bond markets were subjected to their latest
pummeling, with Germany leading the way. By Friday, the yield on the 10-year
benchmark bund had vaulted to 6.87 per cent, from 6.47 per cent a week
earlier. Europe's other markets have been dragged down by the German
sell-off, and stock markets have followed.
Early in the year, it was the US Fed's monetary tightening which prompted
the sell-off in world bond markets. And while US Treasuries dragged European
bonds lower, Europe managed to outperform the US during that period. Now,
Europe is racked by its own worries, and is underperforming the US.
This puzzles many observers, who feel European bond markets are defying
their bond-positive fundamentals of declining inflation and slow economic
growth, accompanied by continued cuts in short-term interest rates.
The latest wave of selling was triggered by comments from Bundesbank
president Mr Hans Tietmeyer which were taken to mean that German, and by
extension European, interest rates don't have much further to fall. The
futures market began pricing in monetary tightening as early as December,
with the three-month Euromark contract discounting German three-month
interest rates at 5.2 per cent by year-end, up from the current 5.05 per
cent.
The Bundesbank's cancellation of its scheduled auction of four-year treasury
bills on Wednesday sent further shudders through the markets, raising fears
that Bonn was having problems finding takers for its massive debt programme.
Moreover, some countries seem to be staging stronger-than-expected economic
come-backs which, with rising commodity prices, have reinforced fears of a
pick-up in inflation and higher interest rates.
Battered by wave after wave of selling, shell-shocked investors have fled to
the sidelines, holding most of their funds in short-term instruments which
are protected against price swings at the long end of the yield curve.
'The psychology is incredibly weak - some people who used to be really
confident players are now saying they're nervous, confused and unsure where
to go,' said Mr John Hall, head of European interest rate research at Swiss
Bank Corporation. Banks' proprietary trading desks and hedge funds have also
scaled down operations, shying away from the volatility that has been
plagueing markets for months.
However, many analysts feel the gloom has been overdone, and while few see a
strong recovery, some expect a period of consolidation, interspersed with
some trading rallies.
Many still pin their hopes on the Bundesbank, which is expected to continue
lowering its securities repurchase rate over the summer, even if it leaves
its official rates unchanged. Indeed, Mr Tietmeyer on Friday clarified that
his recent comments referred only to official rates, not the repo rate.
'Money market rates must be free to move within the bands (set by the
Lombard and discount rates) and that naturally includes the repo rate,' he
said. The discount rate stands at 4.5 per cent and the repo rate is at 5.20
per cent.
'Once people realise the Bundesbank is continuing to ease, that could bring
some life back into the market,' says Mr Werner Kramer, bond strategist at
DB Research in Frankfurt. But he warns any recovery is likely to be
'gradual, with the danger of setbacks'.
While Mr Kirit Shah, international strategist at First Chicago, feels the
bearish trend remains intact, he recommends buying 10-year bunds as their
yield approaches 7 per cent. 'This offers good support, and there is a
reasonable chance that yields will head back to 6 1/2 per cent.'
However, even if Europe returns to calmer waters as the Bundesbank continues
its cautious easing policy, it will remain prone to transatlantic shocks -
as last Friday showed. The upward revision of first-quarter US GDP sent
Treasuries tumbling, dragging Europe sharply lower.
'Europe is still very much tracking the US, where monetary policy is still
not seen to be in neutral,' says Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist
at Midland Global Markets.
With most European countries having to fund hefty budget deficits, supply
pressures also won't help markets. 'The auctions schedules will remain
burdensome in the absence of stronger investor participation, and supply
will exert further upward pressure on real yields in an environment of
economic recovery and reductions in liquidity,' says Mr Kit Juckes,
international economist at SG Warburg.
In the current environment, Mr Hall at SBC suggests buying two- to
three-year German debt which, he says, 'still offers very, very good value'
after the recent sell-off at the short end.
For medium-term investors, he recommends buying bunds around current levels.

The focus of the German government bond market this week will be the figures
on new manufacturing orders and industrial output. Attention will also be
directed towards the next government auction, expected to be of 10-year
bunds, which is scheduled for early June.
After the Bundesbank was forced to call off its auction of four-year
treasury bills last week due to lack of bids, analysts think this next sale
will be a good test of the market's health. Most analysts reckon there will
be enough demand for the auction to go ahead successfully.
Economic data will be scrutinised for signs of stronger economic growth. Mr
Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi, thinks final figures
for industrial output in March could show a marked upward revision in
manufacturing output, which would set a more cautionary tone for the week.
Some analysts say there is potential for further falls in German bonds amid
continuing fears that short-term interest rates are not about to fall
further.
However, Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in
Frankfurt, is more optimistic. He was surprised bunds did not fall further
than they did on the back of Friday's slide in US Treasuries, and says this
bodes well for this week.

Japanese government bond yields continued to ease last week, and are
expected to fall further this week, ignoring the turbulence that has
dominated US and European bond markets.
Some observers are looking for Japanese 10-year bond yields to reach 3.5 per
cent during the summer, compared with the current 3.73 per cent level, as
domestic conditions remain favourable.
Amid strong rumours in Japan that some short-term interest rates may soon be
cut, economists say there is increasingly strong pressure being put on the
Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy. They point to the favourable
inflation outlook, sluggish monetary growth and non-existent bank lending.
DKB International, part of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, said the
authorities 'may wish to lower rates in order to divert funds from cash into
the equity market as a recovery in the Nikkei could provide an important
boost to confidence'.
Bonds should be helped by a stable currency in the near term following the
decision of the US and Japan to resume bilateral trade talks. Underlying
confidence in the dollar appears fragile.
Official data released last week indicated continuing weak consumer demand,
with department store and supermarket sales down 3.5 per cent year on year.

Employment figures have developed a habit of spooking the Treasury market. A
month ago, news of a 267,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for April wiped
two points off the price of the 30-year bond. The bond had earlier tumbled
one and a half points on news of a 456,000 increase in March (later revised
to 464,000).
The memory of those routs will make the markets nervous ahead of the May
figures, due out on Friday. Most economists are expecting an increase in
non-farm payrolls of about 300,000, with the unemployment rate unchanged
from the previous month at 6.4 per cent.
Anything higher would rattle the markets afresh. Last Friday, first-quarter
GDP growth was revised up to 3 per cent (most observers had been expecting a
downwards revision, to 2.4 per cent). Faster-than-expected employment growth
would imply a pick-up in consumer spending, in turn leading to higher GDP
growth in the current quarter.
It may be less than two weeks since the Federal Reserve appeared to put the
market out of its misery with a half-point interest rate rise, but the bond
market is already getting another bout of the jitters.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's May index, due on
Wednesday, will set the tone ahead of the employment numbers.

FT  30 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Big borrowers ride out turbulence -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For big borrowers in the eurobond market, hell is something other people go
through.
Investors and banks might be running scared, but the large companies and
countries which raise funds in the market claim to have weathered the recent
bond market storm and fulfilled their requirements, at least for now.
Merrill Lynch shows in its most recent statistics for eurobond issuance that
in February, March and April this year, Dollars 75.5bn of debt was launched,
a figure sharply below last year's Dollars 104.7bn but well up on previous
years.
And floating-rate note (FRN) issuance, the attractive choice in a climate of
rising interest rates, is higher than at any time in the past six years.
The world's biggest borrowers all claim to be up to date in their funding
programmes this year.
Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, says: 'We have already
raised Dollars 4.5bn of a proposed Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn.'
Officials at the Swedish national debt office say two-thirds of the
country's Dollars 10bn annual borrowing programme has been fulfilled.
Abbey National, the UK bank, says it doesn't have annual quotas, but is
'very comfortable' with its funding this year.
Mr Jean-Claude Bresson, deputy manager of capital markets at the European
Investment Bank, shrugs off any suggestion of a funding problem.
Issuers may be sitting pretty, but for the syndicate managers who launch the
deals, it is a different story. Privately, and in relation to offerings from
rivals, they say deals are being priced too aggressively as banks fight for
business. They add that large amounts of new eurobonds are returning to the
underwriters.
One way to track the performance of a eurobond issue is through the yield
spread at which it is priced over the relevant government bond. A rising
spread suggests more supply than demand.
Among the first to take advantage of the seemingly more stable environment
provided by the Fed rate rise almost a fortnight ago was the Republic of
Finland, which offered FFr6bn of debt priced to yield 32 basis points above
10-year French government bonds. The issue has widened to yield 35 basis
points over on Friday.
A similar deal for the Kingdom of Spain saw the yield spread widen to 30
basis points from 24 basis points at the launch a week ago.
Mr Thomas Keller, assistant director to the treasury at Germany's L-Bank,
which has completed about half of its funding, says syndicate managers have
found themselves at the mercy of a volatile market. 'Many bookrunners have
so many bonds that they don't have the flexibility to calm the markets.
Every time the market goes up they sell into strength to unwind their
portfolio and it goes down again,' he says.
The amount of debt on underwriters' books, fuelled by over-enthusiastic
buying during last year's bull market, is difficult to quantify. However,
the costs of carrying these bonds have increased because of the collapse in
bond prices this year. In addition, the buyers' strike among investors has
made it virtually impossible to get rid of the bonds.
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, estimates that in early April some
Dollars 8n of FRNs were unsold. It says the figure might have fallen to
between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn, but that the overhang is still
depressing prices.
Mr Tim Skeet, at Kidder's capital markets desk, says those with big
positions to unwind will suffer whatever happens in the markets. 'Whether
the market falls further or simply moves sideways, syndicates will have to
start worrying about their costs and put greater emphasis on inventory
turnover.'
Mr Jonathan Nicholls of Abbey National's treasury department agrees. 'There
is a lot of inventory out there. I would not be considering issuing a large
transaction at this time,' he says.
The exceptionally high volatility in bond markets has left investors bruised
and confused. With no clear idea of the direction the markets are taking,
they prefer to be in a more heavily-traded arena such as government bonds,
which can be offloaded more quickly than the less liquid eurobonds.
So who is buying? Eurobond salesmen pinpoint Swiss retail investors and
wealthy individuals who have been attracted by the relatively high yield on
short-dated dollar-denominated debt.
However, insurance companies and pension groups, which are traditionally
drawn to longer-dated maturities, are keeping a low profile.
What buyers there are in the market are also being more selective, choosing
to invest only in bonds issued by highly-rated or well-known names. And as
Mr Roger Gray, head of fixed income and currency at Rothschild Asset
Management points out: 'The highest quality issuers tend to be able to issue
in any circumstance.'
However, if the sticky conditions continue, the investors who are there will
fall by the wayside and borrowers might find that their funding programmes
and confidence fall off with them.

With the trading week shortened by the Whitsun holiday, and few important
economic statistics due, analysts expect little scope for a gilts revival
this week.
The main influence, again, is likely to be overseas bond markets. Last week,
gilts were hit by German bund market weakness and the strong US GDP number;
this week, US non-farm payrolls and the purchasing managers' index may prove
to be pitfalls.
Following last week's cautious statements about further German interest rate
cuts, the Bundesbank's repo reduction will also be closely watched.
'Anything less than a six basis point cut will be bad for bonds,' said Mr
Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe.
Figures for UK M0 in May are expected to show a sharp jump in the annual
growth rate, to around 7.1 per cent in May from 6.2 per cent in April. While
M0 is not a very important indicator for the market, such strong growth will
not help sentiment.
In any case, economic fundamentals do not seem to be the major influence.
'Ten-year gilts on a 8.5 per cent yield should be really attractive to
institutions on fundamental grounds' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist
at Midland Global Markets. 'But recent losses limit their appetite for
stock. Short-term sentiment is shot to pieces.'

<TEXT>
Election euphoria is waning in Italy and the Milan equities market, which
has far outperformed other leading European bourses this year, has been
falling steadily over the past two weeks.
Those clever enough to have taken profits at the top will have locked in
capital gains of almost 30 per cent since January 1 in local currency terms
and roughly 40 per cent in dollar terms. Even with the recent slide, the
market stands some 20 per cent higher in Lira terms than at the turn of the
year. So should investors sit tight in the hope of a rally, or lighten their
Italian exposure in expectation of a further decline?
Trans-European jitteriness apart, the main reason for the slide appears to
have been profit-taking by foreign investors, and a growing realisation
among domestic shareholders that the right-wing Berlusconi coalition has a
fragile majority and could face difficulties in producing a united policy
front.
More technical factors also seem to have played a role. On a price/earnings
basis the market looks highly valued, and it faces a series of heavy cash
calls, both from rights issues and the government's privatisation programme,
with the sale of Ina, the state-owned insurer, set for June 27.
Investors may have been selling shares to raise their cash levels in
preparation for Ina, and for tax payments which fall due around this time of
year, suggests Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan. The bull case for
the Italian market remains essentially intact. For all the Berlusconi
administration's potential weaknesses, there is no serious political
alternative.
Its free-market platform, promising fiscal austerity, accelerated
privatisation, a looser labour market and tax breaks for business, should
give additional impetus to what is shaping up as a strong cyclical upswing
in corporate profitability from 1995.
Equity prices should also be underpinned by falling fixed income yields,
provided the government fulfils its pledge to take firm action on the
gargantuan budget deficit and inflation falls, as expected, below 4 per
cent.
That said, the current correction may have some way to run. The market is
likely to remain edgy, and the lira under pressure, until Berlusconi gives
greater insight into his fiscal policies. The Comit index, which tested
support around 720 on Friday, could fall through 700 before finding solid
ground, but could then present a good buying opportunity.
Global telecoms
A week today the Dutch Government will announce the precise share price for
the flotation of KPN, the state-owned postal and telecommunications group.
With the prospective price/earnings ratio expected to be around 12, and the
yield about 4.5 per cent, the conservatively priced issue should fare
reasonably, provided the European market recovers its nerve.
But with a flood of other telecoms offerings in the pipeline, in both Europe
and Asia, the Dutch flotation raises the question of how investors can make
comparative global valuations in the sector. AT&amp;T, for example, is selling
on a prospective p/e of around 16 and a dividend yield of 2.5, Hong Kong
Telecom's p/e is 19 and its yield 3.4 and some Latin American and Asian
carriers have p/es in the 20s.
The most extreme disparities are due to the higher valuations the market
places on companies which represent pure plays in fast growing, riskier and
more lightly regulated telecommunication sectors, notably cellular, and the
more plodding performance to be expected from the established 'wireline'
operators.
Among the latter, differing valuations are due in large measure to
perceptions of national economic prospects, per capita wealth, teledensity
(number of telephone lines relative to population), political and currency
risk, and the quality of management.
Two other, relatively new factors need increasingly to be entered into the
valuation equation: the degree of local competition faced by the wireline
operator (high in the case of BT and AT&amp;T, low for KPN) and the extent to
which the company is involved in inter-active multi-media. Both are likely
to clip valuations - in the case of multi-media because of high initial
capital outlays and uncertain consumer demand.
None of these factors are sufficient on their own to explain the wide spread
of current valuations. For example, a recent study by Baring Securities
found a very weak correlation between p/e valuations around the world and
teledensity.
But in an attempt to create a more rational investment framework, Barings
has come up with a complex formula, factoring in potential expansion in GDP
per capita and teledensity, which ranks the world's telecoms companies by
growth opportunities over the next six years.
Not surprisingly, its top five (both mobile and wireline) are all in Asia:
Dai Ni Denden, the Japanese mobile company; Japan's NTT; Hong Kong Telecom
(on the assumption its territory will also embrace the mainland China
hinterland); Singapore Telecom and Korea Mobile.
However, many fund managers may be tempted to take the easy analytical
course and use telecoms stocks as a rough and ready proxy for a particular
national stock market.
Cable companies
The US cable television industry has been down in the dumps this past week.
Its annual conference in New Orleans was dominated by complaints about the
Federal Communications Commission, which insisted in February that the
industry cut the price of its basic service by 17 per cent - a ruling blamed
for scuppering at least two much-vaunted takeover deals between cable
companies and telephone operators.
But for shareholders there is a silver lining: the sharp fall in US cable
stock over the past three months means they are very cheap. Ms Jessica Reif
of Oppenheimer reckons that the largest US operator, Tele-Communications
Inc, is trading at around 6 times 1994 operating cash flow, adjusted for
debt and off-balance sheet assets.
At prices like this, the telephone companies may come calling again - though
probably on smaller players, rather than giants like TCI.

FT  30 MAY 94 / The Markets: Investment hopes rise - Economic Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When politicians and opinion formers worry about an economic trend, it is
often a sign that something is about to go right.
This could be the case with Britain's laggard investment performance, which
has long been of concern to the government and groups such as the
Confederation of British industry.
Investment has so far played only a small part in the UK's two-year-old
economic recovery. The picture of a consumer-led upturn was apparently
confirmed by last week's news that manufacturing industry's capital
expenditure fell in real terms by 1 per cent in the first quarter, compared
with the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1993.
Recent CBI polls of manufacturers' investment intentions give little hint of
strong growth to come. The April survey showed that the number of companies
planning to increase investment in plant and machinery exceeded those
planning a decrease by only 4 percentage points. The CBI's latest economic
forecast cautiously predicts an increase in manufacturing investment of just
2.7 per cent this year and 4 per cent next year.
But the chart shows that a subdued level of investment intentions among
manufacturers is not unusual for this stage of the business cycle. When the
UK was at exactly the same point of recovery from the recession of the early
1980s, the balance of companies planning to raise spending on plant and
machinery was also just 4 per cent.
It turned out that April 1983 was the start of a two-phase investment boom.
Central Statistical Office figures show that the quarterly level of business
investment grew by a strong inflation-adjusted 32 per cent between the
second quarter of 1983 and the beginning of 1985. After a pause, the economy
picked up again, so that in 1989 business investment hit a record Pounds
71.25bn in 1990 prices and was 72 per cent higher in real terms than in
1983.
Capital expenditure by manufacturing industry - the type of investment
surveyed by the CBI - only accounts for about a fifth of total business
investment. It takes an even smaller share of overall UK gross fixed capital
formation. This broadest measure of domestic investment, which includes some
non-business investment such as housing, was up by 2.2 per cent in the first
quarter of 1994 compared with final quarter of 1993 and was 3.4 per cent
higher than in the first quarter of last year.
The idea that the UK could be heading for a period of robust investment has
supporters in the City. Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson
Securities, believes that investment in Britain is set to follow the US
pattern of the past 12 months of strong growth after a hesitant start.
An extended period of low interest rates has enabled companies to repair
balance sheets damaged by the recession and build up liquidity, providing a
good springboard for increased investment. With UK final demand moving into
its third year of recovery, Mr Doyle thinks 'everything is in place for a
year of double digit business investment growth.'
Mr Kevin Gardiner, Morgan Stanley's UK economist, believes that capital
spending will gather pace this year and next and give the recovery an extra
boost. Corporate profits, he says, held up well in the recession and will
continue to grow so that rates of return are likely 'to return to levels not
seen since the 1960s.'
Although Mr Eddie George, the Governor of the Bank of England, last week
told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee that he was still
concerned that UK companies were holding back from investments because they
were demanding too high a rate of return, Mr Gardiner thinks strong profits
will mean that high 'hurdle rates' may be less demanding than many observers
fear.
However, Britain would not be Britain, if there were not some fly in the
ointment. James Capel's UK economics team subscribes to the view that
investment and manufacturing output will be increasingly important motors
for the UK recovery over the next two years and believes that higher
investment will eventually strengthen Britain's exports.
But, argues Capel's Mr Adrian Cooper: 'Long term gain may imply some short
term pain.' Because Britain's investment goods industry is relatively weak,
UK investment is very import intensive. Imports account for nearly 34 per
cent of UK spending on fixed investment, compared with only 21.5 per cent of
consumer spending. Strong growth in domestic investment could therefore lead
to a short-term increase in Britain's current account balance of payments
deficit.
Indeed, it may be optimistic to think that a revival of investment will ease
the UK's current account problems in the longer term. In the jargon of
economists, the UK can look forward to a deepening rather than a widening of
its industrial base.
The recession of the early 1980s left Britain an insignificant competitor in
several manufacturing sectors. While the UK has some world beating companies
and areas of excellence - such as pharmaceuticals, processed food and jet
engines - it relies mainly on foreign suppliers for many products, including
machine tools, 'white goods', such as refrigerators, kitchen furniture, and
mens' suits.
Even if business investment takes off over the rest of the 1990s, it is
unlikely to provide the industries that Britain no longer has, leaving it to
depend heavily on imported manufactured goods.

FT  30 MAY 94 / The Markets: Coffee takes a well-earned break - Commodity
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an enforced break today from the heat and hysteria that has held
sway in commodity markets during the past few weeks. Public holidays in the
UK and the US will give traders a chance for a breather, and the investment
funds whose money has been mainly responsible for the surge in commodity
prices will be given an opportunity to consider where they go from here.
Traders and analysts are split about the immediate prospects for the star
performer, coffee, whose July futures price jumped on the London Commodities
Exchange from Dollars 1,100 a tonne in February to a seven-year peak of
Dollars 2,348 last week, before falling back to close at Dollars 2,004 on
Friday. While most agree that coffee's rise is underpinned by a tightness in
supplies, New York traders seem more confident than those in London that the
price can find renewed strength this week.
One event likely to take some heat out of the metals market is the Metal
Bulletin copper conference, starting on Wednesday in Vancouver, which
usually attracts many of the world's top traders.
Copper has been leading other metals up or down on the London Metal Exchange
but attention this week will also focus on nickel because the present labour
contracts at Inco's metals complex at Sudbury, Ontario, end tomorrow.
Inco is the world's second-biggest nickel producer (after Norilsk in Russia)
and Sudbury produces about 110,000 tonnes of the metal, mainly used in
stainless and special steels production. Inco's management delivered its
proposals on Friday and unions and employees have been discussing them over
the weekend. Some weeks ago a ballot gave union leaders a mandate to call a
strike.
The market last week seemed to sense that there would be no industrial
action as the three-month LME nickel price, which started with a rise of
Dollars 286.50 a tonne on Monday, fell steadily to close on Friday Dollars
45 down compared with the previous week at Dollars 6,427.50.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Syntex falls heavily as drug
patent runs out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Syntex, the US drugs company being bought by Roche of
Switzerland, slid in the latest fiscal quarter, as sales in the US of its
leading product, Naprosyn, slumped to just Dollars 36m, from Dollars 200m a
year ago.
Operating income was Dollars 23.6m, compared with Dollars 158.8m (before a
Dollars 140m restructuring charge) a year before. Net income of Dollars
22.4m, or 10 cents a share, compared with a post-restructuring Dollars
40.8m, 18 cents, in 1993.
The period, to 30 April, was the first full quarter since the US patent on
Naprosyn expired last December. To maintain its market share, the company
sold its own low-margin generic version of the drug and the compound to
other manufacturers.
In addition to the Dollars 36m in the US, sales of Naprosyn, the generic
product and the compound reached Dollars 58m elsewhere in the world,
compared with Dollars 62m a year before.
The falling sales of the high-margin branded product led to a decline in
Syntex's gross margin to 71.5 per cent, from 77.3 per cent the year before.
Total sales for the period dropped be nearly a third to Dollars 402m, from
Dollars 584m.
Sales of its other leading product, Toradol, fell to Dollars 81m, a decline
of 15 per cent from the previous year's Dollars 95m. Analysts had been
predicting a gradual increase in sales of Toradol compared with last year.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Funds for UK arms of metal group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals group, has injected fresh funds into
two UK subsidiaries as part of its policy of strengthening core trading
activities. The move comes in spite of deep financial troubles at the
company.
The paid-up capital of its London Metal Exchange trading business,
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (MGL), has been increased from Pounds 33m to Pounds
47m (Dollars 70.5m). Mr Michael Hutchinson, managing director of MGL,
claimed this made his company the most heavily capitalised ring-dealing
member of the exchange.
In the six months to March 31, MGL - which is 86 per cent-owned by
Metallgesellschaft, 9 per cent by MIM of Australia, and 5 per cent by Nissho
Iwai of Japan - made record pre-tax profits of Pounds 22.3m, compared with
Pounds 10.4m for the whole of the previous 12 months.
Metallgesellschaft has also injected a Dollars 30m long-term subordinated
loan into The Metal and Commodity Company, its physical non-ferrous metal
trading arm in London.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank sees signs of solid
full-year results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank's partial operating profits rose more than 11 per cent in the
first four months of this year, indicating a successful full 12 months, Mr
Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, told shareholders yesterday.
Interest earnings rose 6.9 per cent, due largely to strong demand for
building loans, and commission income from securities trading was up 6 per
cent, helped by a particularly strong month in January.
Own-account trading made a satisfactory contribution, in spite of more
difficult conditions on international financial markets.
On full operating profits for the early part of the year - after allowing
for loan provisions - Mr Kohlhaussen said the group result was higher than
last time.
The need for further provisions would decrease, he said, although economic
volatility still apparent in Germany and elsewhere meant there had been no
easing in the credit risk situation.
The bank expected no losses on its exposure of around DM200m (Dollars
121.9m) to the recently-collapsed Schneider property business. The buildings
involved had been completed, Mr Kohlhaussen said.
Deutsche Bank, Schneider's biggest creditor, recently said it had provided
some DM500m against possible risks.
Mr Kohlhaussen said pre-tax earnings had shown double-digit growth. He
attributed this to the inclusion of extraordinary profits from the sale of
stakes in the Karstadt retailing group and the DBV Holding insurance
business. He agreed with a shareholder who suggested the DBV deal with
Switzerland's Winterthur was worth up to DM500m.
However, the full effect would not show this year, because the sale was to
take effect in several stages.
Shareholders later approved a board proposal to increase the bank's
authorised capital by up to DM400m. They also authorised the issue of up to
DM2bn worth of convertible bonds and other paper.
Earlier this year, the bank raised DM945m through the issue of 3m new shares
in a 1-for-10 rights offering.
Insurance group Aachener und Munchner Versicherung reported a 7 per cent
rise in premium income in the first four months of this year. Combined with
falling claims, this led to a 'very satisfactory' start to the year, the
annual meeting was told.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: FNAC returns to profits growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FNAC, the French music and books retailer, returned to profits growth in the
first half of the financial year with a 20 per cent increase in net profits,
to FFr60.6m (Dollars 10.8m) from FFr50.5m a year earlier.
The group, which faces fierce competition from Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Megastores, said it was on course for recovery after a sharp fall in net
profits, to FFr31.9m, in the year to August 31 from FFr159.5m the previous
year.
FNAC last year was destabilised by the financial pressures of the French
recession, and by uncertainty over its future ownership. GMF, its old parent
company, was forced to cede control to a consortium composed of subsidiaries
of the Credit Lyonnais bank and Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the industrial
group.
Although the economy is still under pressure, it has improved since last
summer. FNAC, which also benefited in the first half from the opening of a
store in Madrid, saw interim sales rise 5.5 per cent to FFr5.31bn from
FFr5.03bn.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: French win German gas deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of eastern Germany's gas sector has been completed with
Gaz de France, the state-owned French monopoly, buying the production and
storage facilities of Erdol-Erdgas Gommern from the Treuhand privatisation
agency.
The sale also ends a long struggle between Vereinigte Elektrizitatswerke
Westfalen (VEW), the Dortmund-based utility company which tried to acquire
EEG, and Gaz de France. The French group earlier this year pipped VEW to the
post by putting in a higher cash bid to the Treuhand.
Mr Michel Bellec, head of Gaz de France in Germany, declined to disclose the
precise size of the cash payment.
'This purchase is part of our programme of internationalising the company,'
said Mr Bellec. Gaz de France is the world's largest gas company, selling an
annual 36bn cubic metres of gas. Last year, it recorded DM350m (Dollars
213.4m) profits on turnover of more than DM15bn.
The purchase contract, which involves the French company investing over
DM720m and guaranteeing 600 jobs in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt,
gives Gaz de France a potential foothold in the region's gas sector. Eastern
Germany's gas sector is run by Verbundnetz Gas (VNG). Ruhrgas, which enjoys
a 70 per cent market share in western Germany, holds the majority of shares
in VNG.
However, Gaz de France may want to use EEG more as a storage facility than
as a production outlet, as the gas produced in eastern Germany is low
quality. Known as Altmark gas, it contains about 70 per cent nitrogen and
needs special burners and changes at a gas turbine before it can be burned.
EEG has contracts to supply gas to VNG until 2005, although experts say Gaz
de France has inherited unfavourable contracts because the delivery price is
too low. VEW made the same point during its negotiations to acquire EEG.
Altmark gas delivery contracts cost about 95 pfennigs per kWh, and are
priced at a 25 per cent discount from H-gas, the natural gas Germany
imports.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Reunion Mining issue raises
Dollars 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reunion Mining, which has copper and diamond exploration interests mainly in
Zimbabwe, has raised USDollars 9m through a placing with European
institutional investors, on terms that give the company a market value of
Dollars 30m. Its shares are expected to start trading on the Luxembourg
stock exchange in mid-June.
Most of the money raised will be used to bring into operation the Sanyati
mine, 190km west of Harare in northern Zimbabwe. This is predicted to
produce 2,500 tonnes of copper annually for the first four years, and then
5,000 tonnes for another six years. Costs will be very low, at about 45 US
cents a lb. Reunion will own 75 per cent of the mine but carry all the
costs. The rest will be owned by the Zimbabwe government.
Reunion is also one of the most active exploration companies in Zimbabwe,
concentrating on diamonds. The company says it had completed regional
exploration of 43,570 sq km, representing 11 per cent of the surface of
Zimbabwe.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Yen's rise hits Japan's
shipbuilders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's shipbuilders and heavy industrial companies, which reported their
first drop in annual profits for three years, are in a double bind.
Their worse-than-expected performance reflects the erosion of their
proportionately high foreign earnings by the yen's rise, plus the continued
decline in capital investment by customers in Japan.
Pre-tax profits declines, ranging from 15.3 per cent at Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to 0.8 per cent at Hitachi Zosen, underline how the shipbuilding
divisions face another round of cost cuts if they are to become competitive
with low-cost South Korean yards.
In most cases, however, shipbuilding margins were last year close to the
previous year's. This was because Japanese yards were working towards the
end of the orders made up to two years ago, before the international plunge
in ship prices and demand. Ishikawa-Harima Heavy, for example, reports that
its order backlog has dwindled from a peak of 2.44m deadweight tonnes in
1991, to 1.27m dwt last year.
Recent orders, taken at prices up to 20 per cent below those two years ago,
will show through in earnings next year and the year after, indicating that
'shipbuilding profits will be terrible', forecast Mr Matthew Ruddock,
transport machinery analyst at James Capel Pacific.
Already, Sasebo, the smallest of the group, has admitted that costs are
higher than the contract price for four of the nine vessels on its order
books. This is likely to be true of other builders. Among these are MHI,
Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which are
working on a joint contract for seven liquefied natural gas carriers for
Qatar, at an estimated Y26bn (Dollars 248.9m) per vessel, well below
break-even at current exchange rates.
All this implies that the most diversified heavy industrial groups will do
best in the coming years. Many of them increased their dependence on
shipbuilding in the late 1980s - to take advantage of a rise in demand  -
but are now having to retrench because of Japanese yards failure to compete.
MHI, for example, has reduced its dependence on shipbuilding and steel
structures to 18 per cent of sales, so that power systems now represents its
biggest sector, at 27.4 per cent.
IHI derived a mere 19 per cent of its Y862.9bn turnover from shipbuilding
last year, even after a 27 per cent jump in shipbuilding and offshore sales
to Y165.4bn. Sasebo, by contrast, looks badly exposed, with 70 per cent of
sales derived from shipbuilding.

Havas, the French media and leisure group, is considering plans to expand
its international interests through a partnership with a US group in the
multimedia field, according to Mr Pierre Dauzier, chairman.
Mr Dauzier, speaking on French radio, said the group's plans were still in
the early stages, but he hoped to start negotiations soon with a potential
US partner.
'If we want to do something coherent and constructive we've got to find a
partner in the States,' he said. 'We're considering the matter at the
moment. Perhaps between now and the end of the year we'll be able to talk
about an agreement with a US company.'
Havas has already expanded aggressively in the media sphere since its
privatisation in the mid-1980s. It is already the largest force in French
advertising, through its Euro-RSCG subsidiary, with extensive interests in
travel and posters.
Mr Dauzier has made no secret of his ambitions of extending the group's
influence in the multimedia field. He scored a coup earlier this year when
he won control of Canal Plus, the dynamic French pay-TV group, after forging
a controversial alliance with other shareholders which triggered the
resignation of the founder and chairman, Mr Andre Rousselet.
The Canal Plus coup followed an agreement which left Havas strengthening its
links with France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group that has
become its partner of choice in multimedia. Mr Dauzier has also been
increasing Havas's international interests with a number of deals in other
European countries. He has long been committed to securing a foothold in the
US.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bredero dissidents seek to block bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of private shareholders accounting for more than 10 per cent of
Bredero Estates are preparing to oppose Slough Estates' bid for the troubled
property developer.
They claim that the offer, pitched at a 50 per cent discount to Bredero's
share price prior to the announcement, is 'unfair and opportunistic.'
At present, their opposition would be sufficient to block Slough's offer,
which is conditional upon 90 per cent acceptances.
However, Slough already owns 50 per cent of Bredero and it stands to gain
significant tax benefits if it can push beyond 75 per cent ownership. It is
therefore likely to lower the minimum acceptance level, if necessary.
The dissident shareholders, so far a group of five holdings, are complaining
about the valuations of the properties, which they feel do not reflect their
potential performance in an improving property market.
Bredero's only significant remaining assets are development sites in
Hammersmith and Glasgow. Its other assets, which at the peak of the market
were valued at more than Pounds 100m, were sold to stave off its bankers.
The company was negotiating the sale of its half interest in the Buchanan
Centre, in Glasgow, to pension fund group AMP Asset Management, before the
Slough offer came in, indicating that there is outside interest.
Bredero has built up substantial tax losses, which Mr Alex Henscher, one of
the dissident shareholders, claims will offer substantial value to Slough,
given more than Pounds 100m of losses in the past three years.
In addition, he says the offer attaches no value to Bredero's property
management expertise.
'We are not looking for a higher offer, but prefer to see Bredfero continue
in business, and hopefully rise from the ashes,' he said.
However, Morgan Grenfell, the adviser to Bredero's independent board
members, has fully supported the offer.
The bank points out that Bredero's standstill agreement with its bankers
will last only until September, and the company would probably be forced to
sell at least one, and possibly both, of its two significant assets.
The valuations for these sites were made independently in December 1993, and
unless these are exceeded, the company would crystalise its current net
asset value.

Scottish &amp; Newcastle is holding discussions to sell the remaining 270 Chef &amp;
Brewer pubs held by Morgan Grenfell, following Thursday's completion of the
sale of 450 C&amp;B pubs to Mr Michael Cannon.
S&amp;N, the brewing and leisure group, acquired Chef &amp; Brewer last November and

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: The moment of truth for Crispian Hotson -
Michael Smith begins a series of profiles on potential bidders for British
Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crispian Hotson was in a hurry when he arrived in the UK 10 years ago after
a spell in the US. He thought the British coal industry was about to be
privatised and saw it as a 'wonderful opportunity'. His timing was way out.
He will find out soon whether he was right about the opportunities.
Mr Hotson's Ryan Group last week notified the government that it was
interested in bidding for three of the five British Coal regions which are
being sold off in the return of the industry to the private sector after 47
years of state control. Ryan faces considerable competition but Mr Hotson
does not intend to be thwarted.
'I have been waiting for this moment for 10 years,' he says. 'It was my
whole raison d'etre for investing in coal.'
A 42-year-old South African, Mr Hotson is a life-long opponent of apartheid
but says that was not his motivation for leaving the country.
'My father told me the best business opportunities were outside South
Africa.' he says.
After taking a degree in natural sciences at Cambridge, stints in the US
copper and coal industries gave him the wherewithall and money to return to
the UK in 1983 to take over at Ryan, a coal recovery company capitalised at
Pounds 4m.
'My merchant bankers said I was crazy to get involved in coal and in Wales.
They told me to keep on taking the pills and take lots of sleep. 'But I saw
the chance of taking the rigid structures out of a nationalised industry and
was convinced the UK government would privatise coal before electricity.'
In spite of his miscalculation, Mr Hotson can look back on some significant
successes. Helped by the acquisition of the Derek Crouch contracting company
in the north-east of England in 1987, Ryan is a significant force in
opencast coal.
In Dalquhandy, Lanarkshire, and Stobswood, Northumberland, it has two of the
largest and longest lasting opencast mining contracts in the country. The UK
opencast operations produce more than 3.5m tonnes of the company's 5m tonnes
a year of coal, most of the rest being mined in the US (1m tonnes) and
Poland (150,000 tonnes).
Operating profits have been generally healthy and Mr Hotson estimates that
Ryan, in which he and other managers have a 25 per cent stake, will make
about Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 110m this year.
Mr Hotson is respected among his mining peers. 'He is bright and sharp,'
says one British potential rival bidder for British Coal. 'He knows the
industry inside out.' But Mr Hotson's 10-year period at Ryan has had some
fraught moments, most of them emanating from an abortive attempt to merge
with Carless, the UK oil independent in 1988, and a subsequent decision to
mount a highly leveraged Pounds 70m management buy-out at Ryan.
With coal companies poorly rated at the time, the buy-out must have seemed a
good idea for a company which had long term plans and thought the stock
market concentrated too much on the short term.
But the high debts incurred in staging the MBO was the main reason why Ryan
made losses of Pounds 4m two years ago. In spite of a financial
restructuring, which involved Electra, the venture capital group, taking a
25 per cent stake in the company, debts remain high at Pounds 60m. The debts
will also reduce pre-tax profits to about Pounds 4m this year from Pounds 9m
at the operating level.
Rivals say the indebtedness puts Ryan at a disadvantage, especially as the
company cannot tap the stock market for funds. Mr Hotson sees no
disadvantage, saying that a private company has as much access to equity
capital, and is confident of being able to bid for all three regions, the
north-east of England, Scotland and south Wales, where he has pre-qualified.
Ryan's negotiating power should be strengthened by its decision to mount two
of the potential bids with partners - Alcan, the Canadian aluminium company,
in Scotland, and Miller, the construction group, in the north-east of
England.
And if they are successful, Mr Hotson has no doubts about Ryan's ability to
make a success of assets which British Coal has struggled to make profitable
for years.
'When the UK coal industry was producing 100m tonnes a year it was never
going to be competitive. But it can certainly make money at half that
level,' he says.
Ryan would consider employing different mining techniques from British Coal
and would try to involve employees more, not least through share ownership
schemes. None of this is particularly unusual. What marks Mr Hotson and Ryan
out from the pack are their staying power. 'He has hung on in there through
thick and thin for a decade,' says one coal executive. 'No-one could call
him an opportunist. He deserves at least something from the British Coal
spoils.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: JW Spear board split over Pounds 47m bid
from Hasbro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of JW Spear, which owns the rights to the board game Scrabble
outside North America, has been split by the unsolicited offer for the UK
company made by Hasbro, the biggest US toys and games group.
At a board meeting on Saturday, all but one of the Spear directors rejected
the Pounds 46.9m cash offer, which was launched late on Friday.
The exception was Mr Francis Spear, the group's chairman, who said he
thought the terms - worth 900p per share - were fair and reasonable.
In its offer, Hasbro said it intended to encourage Mr Spear to continue to
manage Spear's Enfield, London, manufacturing plant.
The rest of the Spear board, and the company's financial adviser, Barings,
said Hasbro's offer was totally inadequate. The board instructed Barings to
solicit higher offers.
Hasbro is in a strong position, since it already owns a 26.7 per cent stake
in Spear and has received undertakings to accept its offer from some Spear
family trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent.
The undertakings become irrevocable on Friday if a higher offer has not
received.
Barings is approaching other international toy companies which might be
interested in Spear, but the tight timetable makes it doubtful that another
buyer would have time to intervene. It seems most likely that the rest of
the board will try to obtain a higher offer from Hasbro, in exchange for
their recommendation.
Spear is also probably of the greatest value to Hasbro, which since 1989 has
owned Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented.
Hasbro said the acquisition would be a logical extension of its strategy to
develop and expand core operations around the world.
It also seems unlikely that Spear could see off Hasbro by just selling the
Scrabble business to the US group.
Scrabble accounts for 40 per cent of the UK group's sales and one source
said 'the rest of the games portfolio hangs on the back of it.'
Hasbro's offer of 900p a share is a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NA Life buys Sun Alliance offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Alliance, the life and general insurance group, has agreed to sell its
Canadian subsidiary to North American Life Assurance Company for CDollars
22m (Pounds 10.6m).
The move follows the sale of its general insurance business in Canada,
announced last October.
Sun Alliance sold that operation to Royal Insurance in Canada, at the same
time as it bought Royal Insurance's non-life business in New Zealand, as the
two British groups rationalised their overseas businesses.
Sun Alliance is no longer actively seeking any new business in Canada,
though a small operation to look after the multi-national interests of
existing clients remains.
Sun Alliance set up its life company in Canada in 1962. It did 'quite well',
but once it became clear that with the disposal of the non-life business
there was no scope for sharing costs or customers, the group decided it
would be sensible to be 'open to offers'.
North American, a mutual life company which is based in Toronto, is the
largest direct marketer of life insurance in Canada.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Car demand still low in land of
rising yen - Nissan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, is expected to paint a bleak
picture of the state of the country's auto industry when it releases its
results on Tuesday.
Domestic demand for vehicles fell for the third successive year during the
12 months to March. It was down by 7 per cent, while production fell 12 per
cent.
Nissan has been one of the hardest hit among Japan's battered carmakers,
says Mr Koji Endo, industry analyst at Lehman Brothers.
While the company has made good efforts in the domestic market with the
launch of new models, overseas business has been hit by the yen's
appreciation against major currencies.
In the first half of the fiscal year, Nissan posted its worst results since
it became a public company - a pre-tax loss of Y28.9bn (Pounds 184m) and net
loss of Y38.6bn. The company was forced to revise down its earnings estimate
for the year and will sell assets, such as properties and securities, to
shore up its results.
Mr Endo believes such asset sales will help the parent company to break even
before tax, but lead to a wider net loss on a consolidated basis due to the
poor performance of overseas subsidiaries. He suggests that the company
needs to reduce its models, rationalise aggressively and further reduce
overcapacity.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Taking fright at hints of bad news: The effect of a London
Stock Exchange rule on trading statements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of London is being accused of overreacting to companies' downbeat
trading statements in the current round of annual meetings.
Following recent new guidelines from the London Stock Exchange these
statements are much more detailed than in the past and some companies
believe analysts are assuming they must contain bad news.
Mr John Duncan, corporate affairs director at Inchcape, the UK motors
marketing and services group, says: 'When anybody puts out a full statement
the market inevitably thinks it is a profit warning.'
For their part, some analysts and investors are unhappy that annual meetings
are now being used to release more detailed trading information, even though
the statements are released through the Stock Exchange at the same time.
Says one analyst: 'If you need any clarification of the statement on the
screen, all the people who can help are at the agm. You either have to trek
out to the meeting or wait in the queue for them to return calls.' Inchcape
saw its shares fall 4 per cent last Tuesday after it gave a detailed trading
update at its annual meeting. Yet Mr Duncan insists that the statement was
not a profit warning and that most of the information was already in the
market.
'When the new guidelines were introduced by the Stock Exchange we were
assured that the market would soon get used to them. But how long is it
going to take?'
Last week also saw a very full agm statement from Ladbroke, after which the
leisure group's shares fell by 16.5p to 182.5p. Ladbroke said the level of
detail in the announcement, which, for example, included sales growth
figures for Texas Homecare for the first four months of the year, reflected
its new policy of openness as well as the new Stock Exchange guidelines.
Yet in this case there was important new information - that group profits
were running below last year because of a downturn in credit betting - and
since the market was hoping for an optimistic statement the price reaction
was only to be expected.
Knowing there would be much interest in the announcement Ladbroke put it out
over the Stock Exchange news service at 9.30am, well before the statement
was made to shareholders at the 11.00am meeting.
The company said this allowed analysts to telephone in with queries before
the meeting and helped them decide whether it was worth their while going.
One fund manager, who is against companies giving important new information
to the annual meeting, believes Ladbroke's approach is at least some help.
'It makes it more likely investors and analysts can get quick answers to any
queries or it may persuade them they are better off jumping in a cab.'
But Inchcape's Mr Duncan argues that releasing the statement early is unfair
to those shareholders who are on their way to the meeting and he believes
that the communications problems are greatly exaggerated. 'Unless you are
holding the agm in the Orkneys and the phone lines go down people are
overreacting.'
One problem is that the response from companies to the new guidelines has
been uneven with many giving no more details on current trading than before,
particularly if the news is good. If group profits are 'showing an
improvement . . despite difficult trading conditions' many companies will
leave it at that.
For those gazing at their City screens the rule of thumb still holds: the
longer the trading statement the worse the news.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Price war cools but doubts remain
over drugs division - Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is expected to complete the
latest round of retailers' results on Thursday with an increase in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 406.7m to about Pounds 460m, before Pounds 35m
exceptional charges for withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug.
Boots' shares have enjoyed an easier ride this year than in 1993, when they
lost their premium to the retail sector amid concerns over increasing price
competition with rival Superdrug, and uncertainty over the future of both
the pharmaceuticals business after Manoplax, and Do It All, the loss-making
DIY joint venture with WH Smith.
The price war with Superdrug has cooled somewhat, and uncertainty over Do It
All ended this month when the venture partners said they had agreed to sell
40 stores and planned to sell 60 more, cutting the chain to 140. They
expected it to return to profit in the financial year 1995-96.
Doubt remains, however, about the pharmaceuticals division. Boots has
confirmed that Credit Suisse First Boston is valuing the business, but
insisted it was keeping all options open. Analysts believe Boots would be
unlikely to be able to sell it without diluting earnings.
For the year to March, Goldman Sachs is forecasting increases in operating
profits at Boots the Chemists from Pounds 285m to Pounds 321m, in Boots
Healthcare International from Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m, and Boots Contract
Manufacturing from Pounds 13m to Pounds 16m. The pharmaceuticals division is
expected to decline from Pounds 91m to Pounds 88m.
Boots Opticians is also expected to fall from Pounds 7m to Pounds 5m, but
Children's World is forecast to break even for the first time. Halfords is
expected to improve from Pounds 5m to Pounds 13m.
Boots' share of Do It All losses is forecast to increase from Pounds 14m to
Pounds 15m.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Austrians set to see off foreign bank bid: Establishment in
position to win large minority stake in Creditanstalt-Bankverein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's Conservative establishment looks set to prevent
Creditanstalt-Bankverein from falling into foreign hands with its Sch7.2bn
(Dollars 622m) bid for a large minority stake in the country's second
largest bank.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister, has promised to decide
'before summer' on completing the privatisation of the venerable bank,
choosing between the consortium's bid and one by CS Holding, the financial
group built around Credit Suisse. The government still holds 49 per cent of
Creditanstalt's capital, 70 per cent of the voting power.
Mr Lacina, a Socialist, has made no secret of his preference for CS Holding,
even after the consortium's bid, saying Creditanstalt needs a strong
strategic partner. But he would put the Socialist-Conservative coalition
that has long shared political and economic power in Austria under severe
strain if he dismissed such a large assembly of leading Conservatives. And
at a time when the country is facing a referendum on joining the European
Union and a national election, neither side has any interest in emphasising
internal tensions.
The consortium is led by EA Generali, an insurance company that is
controlled in Italy but has its roots in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and by
First Austrian, the large Vienna-based savings bank group.
They are backed by 18 blue chip industrial companies, including crystal
makers Swarovski, the motor group Porsche, the dominant brewery group
Brau-Union and the building materials group Radex.
Several prominent families, such as the Mayr-Melnhofs, owners of a large
paper group, have put their personal prestige and money behind the offer.
Moreover, by offering the going market price for half the government's
shares and undertaking to back a secondary offering in the markets for the
rest, the consortium has shown that it is not trying to win the bank on the
cheap by playing the nationalist card. The reasons for this strong rallying
of all the Conservative forces are not just political.
Three years ago, the Conservatives watched helplessly as the Socialists
snatched the banking industry lead from Creditanstalt by having their large
Vienna savings bank group, Zentralsparkasse, take over the troubled
Landerbank to create Bank Austria.
Then, two months ago, Bank Austria lost patience with the Conservatives'
dithering over restructuring the ownership of GiroCredit, the savings banks'
central clearing organisation, and snapped it up with a knock-out bid.
The result is that Bank Austria controls directly or indirectly about 60 per
cent of all banking business done in the country. Meanwhile, Creditanstalt
has been paralysed because of Mr Lacina's hesitation in completing its
privatisation.
Early this month, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS, confirmed that his group
was interested and Mr Lacina made clear that he would welcome a CS bid.
But then Mr Gut gave a remarkably candid outline of his group's thinking to
the leading Austrian news magazine, Wirtschaftswoche.
Initially, CS would take a 20 to 30 per cent stake, but it would insist on
first refusal of the rest of the finance ministry's shares and ultimately
hoped to buy 100 per cent.
Creditanstalt would retain its identity, but would adhere to CS group
strategies. More important, he said CS would 'de-politicise' it. If that
happened, the Conservatives would no longer have a flagship commercial bank
to share the spoils of government and government influenced business. And
that would further weaken the Austrian People's Party, already the minority
partner in the governing coalition.
Mr Lacina and other Socialists might not be disappointed if that happened,
but they can hardly be surprised that the Conservatives are fighting back so
vigorously.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Banks back China power project: Dollars 120m loan paves the
way for further private-sector finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday signed a Dollars 120m (Pounds 80m) loan agreement with a
consortium of international banks for the co-financing with the World Bank
of a Dollars 1.3bn power project in Jiangsu province, west of Shanghai.
It was China's first co-financing deal involving private institutions under
the World Bank's Expanded Co-Financing Operations Programme, and is expected
to become a model for other such arrangements. The deal paves the way for
increased commercial lending to China's infrastructure development
programme.
In the power sector alone, it is estimated that China will require Dollars
10bn-Dollars 12bn a year for the next few years to fund its requirements in
the light of anticipated economic growth of 9 per cent-10 per cent a year to
the end of this decade.
The World Bank is lending Dollars 350m to the project, which will entail
building two 600-megawatt coal-fired generators in Yangzhou city, about
100km north-east of Nanjing, Jiangsu's capital.
JP Morgan of the US, Bank of Tokyo, and Dresdner Bank of Germany are
arranging a Dollars 90m syndicated loan, while Nippon Life Insurance of
Japan will provide a yen facility worth Dollars 30m.
Morgan executives said the loan, in which China's finance ministry
represented the People's Republic, appealed to China because of the long
maturities and the fact that the interest rate was some 40-60 basis points
below market rates.
The Dollars 120m loan carries a 15-year final maturity and a five-year grace
period. Repayments of principal after the 10th year are guaranteed by the
World Bank. The bank's involvement encouraged the commercial banks to lend,
whereas, in the past, many have been wary of repayment difficulties in
infrastructure projects.
Debt financing for the Yangzhou plant is an alternative to Build Operate
Transfer arrangements for the power sector.
Beijing is currently embroiled in a dispute with financiers over what might
be considered adequate returns for such a financing arrangement for a power
project.
The World Bank has made clear that it favours greater private-sector
involvement in the funding of infrastructure projects. Mr Ernest Stern, the
bank's managing director, has said that such participation could 'bring
additional benefits that go beyond finance, including management expertise
and new technology.'
Funding for the Yangzhou power station, one of China's largest energy
projects, will also come from the State Energy Investment Corporation, local
Jiangsu institutions, and the Yangzhou Municipality. Other banks involved in
the syndicated loan include the Korea Development Bank, the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan and Mitsubishi Bank.

FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: National Grid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs' appointment as the National Grid Company's adviser is not
only a mark of how US investment banks are invading British banks' home
territory. It also moves the Grid's flotation one step nearer. The final
decision will be taken by National Grid Holding, the parent company, and the
12 regional electricity companies which own it. But the Grid itself is
straining at the leash and Goldman, which masterminded Vodafone's demerger
from Racal, will presumably furnish clever arguments for demerger this time
too.
The industrial case for demerger looks strong: the Grid would be able to
develop its business better if it was free from the tutelage of 12 bickering
shareholders. There is also something in the financial case: investors would
be able to buy the Grid direct rather than via a Rec where it is submerged
by other businesses.
Still, most estimates of how much shareholder value would be boosted look
optimistic. It is not possible, as some sales patter suggests, to add the
Grid's value of, say, Pounds 4bn to the Recs' collective capitalisation of
Pounds 13bn. Rec shareholders would quickly notice that the Grid's
dividends, which account for nearly 10 per cent of Rec earnings, had
vanished. They would also appreciate that the Grid's dividends provide high
quality income for Recs since they are almost three times covered by the
Grid's earnings. Finally, there could be a tax payment of up to Pounds 1bn.
While ways of avoiding tax could be dreamt up, the Treasury would not be
pleased. And, given its golden share in the Grid, it has the power to demand
a slice of the profit.

FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Water companies stand out among utilities for having operating costs which
have risen since privatisation. The high level of capital investment since
then is part of the explanation, since new plant also has to be serviced.
But the suspicion remains that Ofwat will impose tough efficiency targets
when the results of its regulatory review are announced in July. That would
be a way of keeping water bills down while holding out the promise of
profits acceptable to the City.
Judging which companies will face the toughest targets is tricky. While
companies with large urban populations such as Severn Trent and Thames tend
to have the lowest unit costs, that is largely a matter of geography.
Ofwat's own comparisons between companies have produced differing results.
Capital efficiency - a company's ability to build facilities cheaply -
should also be taken into account. If Ofwat is concerned to hold water bills
down, though, companies which have asked for the highest price increases are
likely to be told to achieve most by way of efficiency.
Whatever the final outcome, the ability of companies to meet their targets
is what matters to shareholders. Companies which can beat their efficiency
targets will be able to raise profits and dividends faster than their peers.
On that logic, the difference between well-run and badly managed companies
will be clearer in the second half of the decade. Water company managers can
expect investors to scrutinise their performance more closely.

FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate Disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Annual meetings have become more exciting in the wake of the stock
exchange's guidelines on corporate disclosure. More companies are using the
occasion to make significant statements on trading, just as the guidelines
require. The market, however, is not quite sure what to make of it all. Both
Ladbroke and Inchcape fell sharply on annual meeting statements that some
saw as profit warnings. The new approach is bound to make share prices more
volatile than one in which information is allowed to seep gradually into the
market. But that is a price worth paying for a fuller disclosure policy.
Besides, the market has yet to learn to expect such statements and get them
in perspective.
This seems to have been a particular problem in the case of Inchcape, which
thought it was simply confirming something the market already knew - that
this year's first half would not look good against the same period of 1993
when the yen was lower. Ladbroke at least divulged something new about the
weakness of its credit betting business. But in neither case was the
statement easy to evaluate. The provision of some extra information
inevitably leads to a demand for more.
Much though companies shy away from the effort involved, it looks
increasingly as though quarterly statements may be the answer. Investors
would have some numbers to go on, which would not need to be audited,
instead of just the chairman's annual meeting text. Moreover, a quarterly
statement would be regarded as routine. If disappointments emerged, it would
not necessarily be dubbed with the title of profits warning.

FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Openness in equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate over whether UK equity trading should be made more transparent
reaches a milestone tomorrow ' the last date for responses to the Securities
and Investments Board discussion document on the topic. But a consensus is
still elusive.
On the side of transparency are derivatives traders and some, but not all,
institutional investors. They would like access to the prices at which
market makers offer to trade shares with each other through inter-dealer
broker screens. The traders feel such prices are nearer to shares' 'true'
prices than the mid-points between bid and offer shown on Seaq, and so are
better for pricing options and futures. Some investors think a glimpse at
the IDB screens would help them negotiate better deals.
Market makers, by contrast, argue that secrecy is necessary for them to
lay-off the risks they incur through quoting continuous two-way prices. More
openness over IDB prices would lead to a squeeze in their margins. Equally,
if they could not hide the prices at which large blocks of shares traded,
others would know if they were long or short and so take advantage of them.
Transparency would force them into defensive trading strategies, and so
reduce market liquidity.
This debate cannot be resolved on theoretical grounds. The respective
advantages of openness and liquidity have to be weighed. Since what is
needed is effectively a cost-benefit analysis, SIB should commission an
economic study to inform the next stage of its deliberations.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Treasury poised to deliver improved growth forecast:
Increasing evidence shows economy gathering strength despite tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is likely to revise upwards its forecast for UK economic growth
this year on the strength of increasing evidence that activity has withstood
the impact of April's tax rises.
Treasury economists are drawing up a new forecast for publication about the
end of next month. It is expected to upgrade last November's Budget
forecasts for 1994 of 2.5 per cent growth of gross domestic product and 2.25
per cent growth for GDP minus oil and gas extraction.
Economic indicators for April, published this month, suggested that the
economic upturn is gathering strength. That trend is likely to be confirmed
by early data for May, due this week.
Economists expect Bank of England figures tomorrow to show that seasonally
adjusted growth of M0, the measure of 'narrow' money - comprising mainly
coins and banknotes in circulation - climbed to about 7.1 per cent in the
year to May from 6.2 per cent in the year to April.
M0 is regarded as a useful guide to the trend of retail sales, which grew
strongly last month in spite of the effect of increased direct and indirect
taxes. At about 7 per cent, M0 is growing at nearly twice the ceiling of the
government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent 'monitoring range' for narrow-money
growth this year.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply publishes its purchasing
managers' index on Wednesday. This indicator is also expected to point to
increases in activity.
The forecasters' consensus of near-term growth prospects has been creeping
upwards this month. A Treasury survey of 32 new independent forecasts in May
found that the average expectation of growth was 2.7 per cent for this year
and 1995 compared with 2.6 per cent for each year in April.
The report earlier this year of the Treasury's panel of economic advisers -
the so-called 'six wise men' - produced average GDP growth forecasts of 2.9
per cent for this year and 2.8 per cent for 1995. With growth projections
ranging from 2.6 per cent to 3.4 per cent, each of the advisers forecast
that growth this year would exceed the November Budget prediction.
Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office last week
showed that first-quarter GDP was 2.6 per cent up on the first quarter of
last year and 0.7 per cent higher than in the final quarter of 1993.
However, after removing buoyant oil and gas extraction from the figures,
economic activity only recovered in the first quarter to the average level
of 1990. First-quarter GDP, excluding oil and gas, was 0.6 per cent higher
than in the final 1993 quarter and just 2 per cent up on the first quarter
of last year.

advisers, human rights lawyers, businessmen, congressmen and senators. All
were drawn by enthusiasm for America's Irish heritage.
The evening underlined Clinton's own interest in Irish affairs. He was
meeting the challenge laid down by Reynolds, that, as 'political leaders, we
must show daring as never before . . . in bringing about the goal of peace'.
Among those attending was a leading Irish American businessman Don Keough,
the former head of Coca-Cola. Commenting on the significance of the evening
for Irish Americans, Keough said: 'It's like the end of a journey. We all
had a feeling of finally arriving.'
There has been Irish razzamatazz in the White House before. John F Kennedy
held some cultural soirees, and Ronald Reagan entertained Tip O'Neill, the
legendary speaker on Capitol Hill. But never had the invitation list been so
long; never had the evening been so political in its scope, drawing in many
of those interested in that most touchy of Irish subjects, Northern Ireland.
As Clinton himself later boasted, the last time the White House had hosted a
comparable party was under 'Old Hickory' Andrew Jackson, the first Irish
American to be voted in as president.
So who has arrived and where? On the basis of blood alone, Clinton is not a
natural player in American ethnic politics. Much as he might have proclaimed
his Irish roots during his presidential campaign, these are not particularly
deep or immediate. One theory is that his maternal ancestors, the Cassidys,
settled in South Carolina in the 17th century, Protestant emigrants from
Ulster.
This is hardly the stuff of Irish nationalism, but it was enough for the
Clinton presidential campaign to set up Irish liaison groups and to garner
as many votes as Kennedy did among Irish-Americans.
In return, Clinton promised the earth - or so it seemed to those Irish
republicans who had long sought to draw the US into playing an active role
in Northern Ireland. The 'earth' was Clinton's promise to send a
presidential envoy to sort out the mess in Belfast.
Since becoming president, Clinton has put the envoy idea on the backburner.
But his decision in February to grant a visa to Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, against the advice of state department officials and UK
government objections, seemed to presage a new activism.
To Irish-Americans such as Niall O'Dowd, editor of New York's Irish Voice, a
newspaper for Irish Americans, Clinton has shown not only that he has a
grasp of Irish issues, but that he can deliver on them. 'Under Clinton,
Irish-Americans have been allowed and encouraged unprecedented access to key
White House officials.'
The visa decision brought to the surface British nervousness about Clinton's
attitudes on Northern Ireland, particularly that the IRA was about to get a
pat on the back.
But the visa was never intended as an endorsement, nor did it turn out that
way. So says Nancy Soderberg, a senior member of the US National Security
Council, who helped persuade Clinton to grant it. Ms Soderberg is a
self-assured, young political operator who, as a former foreign affairs
adviser to Senator Ted Kennedy, spent years listening to the debate over
Northern Ireland. She believes Clinton is committed to conflict resolution,
as a facilitator rather than intervener.
'We wanted to expose Adams to American opinion that is opposed to violence
and try to reach out in favour of moving the peace process forward,' she
says.
Clinton's record in conflict resolution elsewhere is not sparkling. But his
aides believe a helping hand from the White House - drawing on the support
of most of the 44m Irish-Americans - could bolster the Irish peace process,
widely viewed as irreversible.
The man who invited Mr Adams to the US, Bill Flyn, hardly fits the picture
of the republican hard nut depicted by the British tabloid press. He is
president of Mutual of America, one of the biggest insurance companies in
the US, with offices on New York's Fifth Avenue, a prime mid-town location.
Until seven years ago, Flyn, a third-generation Irish-American with a
sentimental attachment to things Irish, steered clear of political
involvement in Northern Ireland. Then one day, a group of IRA sympathisers
from the Northern Aid Committee (Noraid) - the group once described by
British and Irish authorities as the main vehicle in the US for funds and
arms to the IRA - came to his offices and asked him to give to the Irish
republican cause. 'I told them I couldn't do it. So they said: 'Now look
here, Flyn, if you believe in a united Ireland, what the hell are you doing
about it?' They made me feel like a draft dodger,' he recalls.
So Flyn became involved not in Noraid but in the Northern Ireland Peace
Movement, which is opposed to IRA violence. He subsequently joined a number
of business groups which work closely with the British and Irish governments
to promote a stable Northern Ireland through informal mediation and
increased investment. His reaction to the Anglo-Irish joint declaration in
December last year, which seeks to establish a basis for peace in the
province, was enthusiastic.
'It was a fine declaration and I took my hat off to John Major and Reynolds.
It was a breakthrough,' says Flyn.
It was in this spirit that Flyn invited Adams in February to speak at a
conference on the future of Northern Ireland - which sparked off the visa
row. 'I wanted to help the process towards peace,' says Flyn. He believed
then, and still believes, that far from promoting the IRA's armed struggle,
the Adams visit strengthened the hand of moderates in the republic movement
and exposed republican hardliners to the moderation of most Irish-Americans.
He has no regrets about the invitation.
Drawing on his contacts in the Irish republican movement, Flyn says: 'I
think the Adams visit achieved more in 48 hours than 20 years of violence
did. He realised that, if he was to make progress, it would have to be
through dialogue and not through the bullet.'
The majority of senators and congressmen who backed the Adams visa also say
they did so not as a sign of support for IRA violence but to achieve peace.
The group includes congressman Joseph Kennedy, nephew of former President
Kennedy, son of former attorney-general Robert Kennedy, and a rising
political star on Capitol Hill. Six years ago the young Kennedy's tour of
Northern Ireland drew the wrath of the UK tabloid press when he got into an
argument with a British soldier and told him to get out of the six counties.
Kennedy, who represents Boston, which has one of the largest Irish
communities in the US, is now defensive about his reputation as a leading
critic of Britain's military presence in Northern Ireland. 'Whatever
(sectors of the British media) may think, I am not pro-IRA,' he says.
Despite his continuing sympathy with the republican ideal of a united
Ireland, Kennedy says: 'I have never met with the IRA although I have urged
them to lay down their arms. Given my family's history of assassination, how
could I possibly condone the use of a gun to make a political point?'
On the Hill, the one person who speaks out unflinchingly and often in
defence of the IRA is Peter King, a Republican congressman for Nassau, New
York state. The son of a New York policeman of Irish descent, King says he
supports the IRA out of personal conviction, having been converted to the
cause after Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British paratroopers shot dead 13
civilians in Northern Ireland.
While King has few supporters among congressmen or in his constituency, he
personifies a sentimental loyalty to the Irish republican cause as well as
the anglophobia which dates from the 1840s, when the first flood of Irish
immigrants came to America after the Irish famine.
This patriotism - American-style - was once described by James Stephens, the
Fenian leader, as a 'windbag or a phantom, the laughing stock of sensible
men and the El Dorado of fools . . . speeches of bayonets, gala days and
jolly nights, banners and sashes . . . bunkum and fulsome filibustering'.
It sprang from ethnic insecurity and a sense of profound powerlessness as
poor Catholic immigrants tried to forge an identity in a country settled by
Puritan colonists. From the early 1970s, it became a source of funds and
guns for the IRA as Irish-Americans, mindful of the civil liberties
enshrined in the US constitution, protested against what they considered
human rights violations against Northern Ireland's Catholic minority.
One of the Irish-Americans deeply embedded in republican folklore is Michael
Flannery, founder in 1969 of Noraid. Flannery fought in the IRA's North
Tipperary brigade before emigrating to the US after partition in 1921.
There, Flannery and a few friends set out to radicalise some of the social
clubs catering for Irish expatriates.
Today, aged 92, poor, lonely and suffering from arthritis, Flannery
personifies the romance and the limitations of Irish republicanism in the
US. He lives with his memories in Jackson Heights, a New York suburb where
Irish Americans are now outnumbered by Latin Americans, and where drugs
trafficking is more common than Irish republican propaganda.
Flannery chuckles as he recalls how in 1982 he was acquitted of raising
Dollars 16,800 for the purpose of supplying rifles to the IRA. The
prosecution collapsed after defence lawyers uncovered potentially
embarrassing connections between the arms dealers and the CIA. 'They never
proved we were financing the IRA,' Flannery says.
Flannery left Noraid in the late 1980s after the organisation split over
whether Sinn Fein and the IRA should continue abstaining from politics in
the south of Ireland. Those who remained in Noraid supported political
involvement in the south, alongside armed struggle in the north. Flannery
rejected political involvement. But he remains committed to the armed
struggle as the means to achieve one state on the island of Ireland.
Noraid's current chief, the much younger Martin Galvin, works from a
lawyer's cramped office in New York's Bronx area. Galvin insists Flannery
jumped ship unnecessarily. 'He thought we were going away from republican
principles - that the armed struggle would be wound down. The last eight
years have proved that these (fears) were not justified.'
Yet Flannery is not alone in thinking that Noraid, for all its rhetoric, has
gone 'soft'. The FBI and British intelligence believe Noraid's fund-raising
abilities have diminished - down to less than Dollars 200,000 a year from
close to Dollars 1m in the early 1980s. This is the result of splits in the
movement, recession, FBI infiltration, and better information being made
available about Northern Ireland.
There is now evidence that Noraid no longer represents the hardest line
among Irish-Americans. At a ticket-only banquet held by an offshoot of the
organisation, called Friends of Irish Freedom, in South Boston this month, a
keynote speech by Tommy McKearney, a former IRA member who served 15 years
for shooting a British soldier, rejected the joint declaration outright. He
was warmly received by 200 people from the Boston unit of the organisation
when he said Gerry Adams should insist British troops got out of Northern
Ireland before further negotiation, or hand over the Sinn Fein leadership to
somebody else.
Though the Friends represent only a small minority of Irish-Americans, they
might be a source of support for a reconstituted armed struggle if some
militant Irish republicans were to end violence in response to the joint
decla-ration.
Despite divisions among Irish republican supporters, US interest in Northern
Ireland seems certain to increase in coming weeks. Bars in New York, Chicago
and Boston are gearing up with sweat-shirts, stickers, baseball caps and
advance block bookings for matches, as they await the arrival of the Irish
World Cup football team and its supporters. The turn-out will represent the
biggest single instance of Irish immigration, albeit temporary, since the
famine. And some bars will, no doubt, be collecting for the IRA.
The earlier Irish migration sprang from suffering and fostered a romantic
sense of Irish history which militant republicans have been able to
translate into money for guns. While those first Irish immigrants clambered
on to American shores as supplicant refugees, today's festive Irish fans
will find a community of Irish cousins who have themselves 'arrived' and are
now finding their voice around a new US presidency.
It is not the type of community in which the IRA can take for granted
support for its campaign of violence. Numbering about five times as many
Irish men and women as live in Ireland, north and south, the community's
politics is informed by moderation. As Bill Flyn puts it: 'I think the real
power of 44m Irish Americans has been awakened. It's available to anyone who
wants to be a peacemaker.'
Step up, President Clinton.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Bringing China into the Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By ending the link between China's human rights behaviour and its receipt of
most-favoured nation trading status, President Clinton has opened the way
for a more fruitful relationship between Washington and Beijing, as well as
between the west and Asia. With the MFN ritual now apparently abandoned, all
sides must work to make China a full, open and fair player in world affairs.
The framework for this participation will be set by the terms of its entry
into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Mr Clinton's decision was correct. It is not that trade sanctions are
necessarily inappropriate for human rights abuses. On the contrary, it is
reasonable to appraise the use to which countries are putting trade
privileges, as well as considerable flows of foreign money in export
proceeds, loans and investments. But each case is different.
For China, the influx of foreign capital and ideas is a force for good.
Helping to support reforms which have brought greater prosperity and
economic choice to most Chinese, it is their best hope for obtaining wider
freedom by orderly means. Isolation of China through MFN withdrawal would
have been a severe blow to reform.
Those are the principles. But of course pragmatism also played a large role
in Mr Clinton's embarrassing climbdown from the human rights conditions
which he set a year ago for MFN renewal. The threat was too blunt and too
self-damaging a weapon to be effective, imposing as it did a timetable that
was not likely to win the co-operation of those in Beijing who were supposed
to meet it.
Economic dynamism
Had MFN been withdrawn, American companies would have lost out to their
international competitors in terms of investments, markets and broad
strategies in the region. The resulting deterioration of Sino-American
relations would also have weakened US efforts to forge greater trans-Pacific
co-operation, since most of Asia would have sided with China.
Rather than creating friction, the aim must be to build relationships which
recognise the extraordinary economic dynamism of Asia, and to do whatever is
possible to ensure that it develops in partnership with, rather than in
opposition to, the west.
The west needs China to play a full role in international affairs, as a
permanent member of the UN Security Council with an influential role among
developing countries. With its economy and trade growing so fast, China must
also be an open and fair trader.
Fragile relationship
So the initial foundation of China's enhanced role in the world will be the
protocol covering its accession into Gatt or the successor World Trade
Organisation. Gatt entry will serve another important purpose, since China's
participation in the world economy will be based on a contract with all
trading partners. The excessive burden currently placed on an evidently
fragile Sino-American relationship will be reduced.
It will be a tall order to agree China's accession to Gatt this year, before
the WTO takes over. Though investigations have been under way for seven
years, the Gatt working party is still concerned to understand exactly how
the Chinese economy works. Negotiators need to be sure that China's trade
policies are fair and uniform - difficult when there are so many special
zones offering different incentives - and that the operation of state-owned
enterprises is open, particularly the subsidies which they receive. These
issues will form the basis for other countries' ability to compete with
China. China's entry needs to be treated with urgency, but not rushed
through.
Gatt membership leaves countries free to take action against objectionable
practices such as the export of prison-produced goods. In this area in
particular, governments - hitherto excessively relaxed - should stiffen
their efforts to curb China's abuses. Pressure over human rights issues must
form an important part of the full and broad engagement with Beijing which
should follow Mr Clinton's decision. It may be more effective than a threat
which has achieved the release of a few dissidents before each deadline. If
the opportunities afforded by the change of US policy are seized, it will be
to the benefit of the west as well as of the Chinese people as a whole.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The pursuit of the millennium
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of nine millennium commissioners to help the UK celebrate
the year 2000 has not exactly caught the nation's attention. The man or
woman on the Clapham omnibus would have great difficulty in saying what they
were for, let alone naming any one of them. Yet these nine commissioners
will be responsible for spending almost Pounds 2bn of public money over the
next seven years. The manner of their choosing and the way in which they
propose to discharge their task reflect much that is tired about British
public life.
First, their choosing. They have, in the time-honoured way, been appointed
by the crown on the recommendation of the prime minister. Like the
membership of a royal commission, they have been selected to represent as
many interests as possible. The Cabinet Office list of the great and the
good has been raided once again.
There is a Scot whose father is the largest landowner in Britain. Mr Simon
Jenkins, the distinguished journalist of Welsh extraction, will guard the
interests of Wales. From Northern Ireland, there is a businessman who was
Olympic bobsleigh gold medallist in 1964. A property developer represents
the north of England. There are two women (one from an ethnic minority) and
a businessman-cum-quangocrat nominated by the leader of the opposition. The
team is completed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
and Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary who chairs the
commission.
No visionaries
These are not the visionaries who might bring original insights to the
celebration of the millennium. Yet they will spend a fifth of the proceeds
of the new national lottery, predicted to total about Pounds 9bn over seven
years. With more than Pounds 250m a year at their disposal, the commission
will enter the FT Top 40 quangos at around 22nd place. Like thousands of
other government nominees on quangos who dispose of more than a fifth of
public expenditure, the commissioners will be accountable only to Whitehall.
The procedures they are to adopt for deciding how to spend these
considerable sums conveys an uncomfortable sense of ennui. The commission
will consult the wider world through a series of regional meetings with
'opinion-formers'. The composition of those groups can only be guessed at.
But it is unlikely that they will produce the surge of popular enthusiasm
that would generate proposals capable of leaving a mark on history or
inspiring national renewal.
Worthy projects
Already there is a queue of worthy projects building up for a share of the
funds. In London, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the South Bank
Centre and the Tate Gallery are all looking for substantial sums. A South
Kensington consortium including the Royal Albert Hall, the museums and
Imperial College, is competing for money to turn this well-heeled London
district into an arts and education centre. Outside the capital, there are
proposals for a Gallery of Scottish Art, a sports arena in Manchester and an
opera house for Cardiff.
Such projects should be ruled out if only because they are already eligible
for a share of the other four-fifths of the lottery proceeds - to be divided
between the arts, sport, charities and the national heritage. The millennium
fund should be used for something more exciting, to make a mark on the
national consciousness. The money could be used to create a scheme to give
every young person an opportunity to live in another European country for a
month. Or, following Keynes's suggestion, part of it might be buried in the
ground for people to find through hard work.
But the decision should not be made by such a narrow group of individuals.
The commissioners should conduct polls, surveys and other exercises to
search out new ideas. If the nation will be riveted to its sofas for the
weekly national lottery draw on television, the occasion could be used to
present and debate more ambitious ideas. Viewers in their tens of thousands
already use their telephones to vote in TV talent contests and to decide
which celebrity should be dipped in a gunge-tank on prime time variety
shows. No less is needed in celebrating this unique opportunity.

The polluter must pay. And so say all of us. Last week, Petrobras, Brazil's
state oil company and one of the most inefficient in South America, was
blamed for an oil spill which polluted 18 beaches along the Sao Paulo coast.
It was the second worst on record, according to the environmentalists.
Cetesb, an environmental agency, sprang into action and announced that
Petrobras was to pay double the maximum fine, since it was by no means its
first offence. But - and such are the joys of inflation - what was a
daunting sum in 1991 now amounts to just Dollars 2. Less than the cost of a
cup of coffee.

Interest in the OECD secretary-general stakes is hotting up ahead of next

It is unclear whether the winner will be announced at the meeting or whether

Jean-Claude Paye, the current secretary-general, lies well back in the field
while Lord Lawson, the former British chancellor of the exchequer, has been
catching up fast on Don Johnston, the North American favourite.
However, Johnston's trainer, Canada's Foreign Affairs department, desperate
to disprove gossip that Johnston is finding it heavy going, has been
circulating a 14-page collection of Johnston's thoughts. These include

The jockeying for power at Newspaper Publishing, owner of the Independent,
continues apace. Sergio Cellini, 38, who looks after corporate strategy for
L'Espresso, the Indy's Italian shareholder, has been appointed an executive
director of Newspaper Publishing.
Since virtually everybody else on the board is non-executive, Cellini will
be in a powerful position in a company which doesn't have a chief executive.
He will be responsible for managing those activities not contracted out to
the Mirror Group Newspapers, such as printing and marketing.
One school of thought suggests that he has been imported to keep an eye on
Cornel Riklin, 38, the Swiss whiz kid put on the Newspaper Publishing board
by MGN's David Montgomery. Both went to US business schools and are
ex-management consultants. However, a more likely suggestion is that Cellini
has been brought in to keep an eye on Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder,
editor-in-chief and chairman of Newspaper Publishing.

China is on a bit of a roll at the moment. Last week the US abandoned
attempts to link China's trade status with human rights. Now Shanghai wants
to erect a bigger and better version of New York's Statue of Liberty.
It is only five years since some of China's 'huddled masses yearning to
breathe free' were massacred at Tiananmen Square, so it seems a bit rich to
erect a monument celebrating liberty.
However Shanghai, which has soaring ambitions as a financial and trade hub,
wants to mark the turn of the century with an eye-catching sculpture.
Whether it will be on Chongming Island at the mouth of Yangtze, or Wusongkou
island, hasn't been fixed yet.
What's not in dispute is that it will be 118m tall, compared with Miss
Liberty who is 92m tall if she stands on her pedestal.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Through gas and high water: The regulators of the UK's
privatised utilities are feeling besieged. John Willman explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week was one that Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the UK gas regulator with a
disarming giggle, will be anxious to put behind her. From a position of
relative obscurity, she found herself splashed across Britain's tabloid
newspapers as 'the laughing gas regulator'.
This unwelcome exposure was sparked off by spurious allegations - denied
with great seriousness - of an improper relationship with a civil servant
involved in her appointment. But the addition of Ms Spottiswoode to the cast
of regulars in the tabloid soap opera reflects more than the traditional
British obsession with hanky-panky, real or imagined, in public life.
The UK's utility regulators are finding themselves increasingly in the
limelight as they revolutionise the industries they regulate. They are also
attracting growing attention from the politicians as it becomes clear that
their decisions have far-reaching consequences for society.
Yet the UK's utility regulators were created to take complex pricing and
competition judgments away from the meddling of MPs. 'Politicians made such
a hash of running the nationalised industries,' says Sir Christopher Foster,
adviser to the government on privatisation and author of a book on
regulation. 'Detaching them from the day-to-day interference of politicians
has been an incontrovertible good.'
Until recently, the consensus was that the regulators had made a good fist
of their jobs, especially in the two utilities - telecommunications and gas
 -that were privatised first.
In telecoms, prices have fallen by more than 30 per cent in real terms since
1984. BT, the privatised company that formerly enjoyed a monopoly in
telephony, now faces more than 40 competitors in different sectors of its
market.
If there is disquiet, it is among companies in the industry rather than
consumers. BT has complained of over-regulation: Mr Don Cruickshank, the
regulator, is now tackling the smaller obstacles faced by new entrants to
the market, such as access to directory inquiries. Mercury, the second
largest operator, has taken Mr Cruickshank to court over his approach to
regulating the charges BT makes for carrying other operators' calls.
Gas prices have also fallen in real terms, by more than 20 per cent since
the privatisation of British Gas in 1986. The next stage of regulation,
opening up the industry to competition, is proving more controversial,
however. One consequence of liberalisation could be differential pricing, if
charges rose for customers furthest from the North Sea gas fields.
Before last week's events, Ms Spottiswoode had incurred the wrath of
opposition MPs for appearing with Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, at the
launch of the consultative paper on gas competition. 'She has adopted a
Thatcherite interpretation of competition that will lead to higher prices
for consumers furthest from the points where gas comes ashore,' says Mr
Peter Hain, the left-wing Labour MP, who advocates far-reaching changes to
the regulatory system.
In the water industry, prices have risen above the rate of inflation to
finance modernisation and clean up water and beaches. There is also less
scope to introduce competition to keep prices down.
In the south-west of England, Conservative candidates are already blaming
water price increases 50 per cent above the national average for their
expected poor showing in next month's European elections.
Experiments in water metering, encouraged by the regulator to curb demand in
areas of the country where supplies are under strain, have also proved
controversial. The burden of metered charges falls more heavily on families,
pensioners and low-income households.
'It's illusory to believe that politics can be removed from the utilities,'
says Mr Dieter Helm of Oxford Economic Research Associates. 'They are
central to the performance of the economy as a whole, there is a strong
monopoly element and they have a large impact on living standards.'
The impact of utility regulation on the economy can be seen in the
electricity industry. Prof Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, refused to
halt the expansion of gas-fired power stations, a development largely
responsible for the sharp fall in demand for coal that has led to widespread
pit closures. The decision is described by Mr Hain as 'an effective veto on
coal'.
'The idea that regulation is a value-free, technical exercise is nonsense,'
he adds. 'Regulators may hide behind the mantle of competition, but they are
right in the thick of political controversy.'
The view that regulation is too important to be left to the regulators is
increasingly heard in the City. Investors are concerned that the water and
electricity regulators, who are conducting reviews, will crack down on price
rises.
In April, Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the privatised
electricity generator, called for curbs on regulators' power. Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Investment Management and Prudential, the UK's largest
institutional investor, have urged water companies to appeal to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept much tougher price
limits.
One cause of concern is regulators' different approaches.
'The regulation of the water and electricity industries reflects the
personalities of their regulators,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst
at Hoare Govett.
'Mr Ian Byatt (Ofwat regulator) is in favour of intensive regulation. He
demands lots of information from the water companies and has assembled a
massive database. Prof Littlechild takes a free-market approach (to the
electricity industry) and believes in profit. He wants regulation to be
light-handed and therefore asks for relatively little information from the
companies.'
There is also concern that regulators feel they must act tough. 'Mr Byatt's
review of the price caps for water companies will inevitably be judged by
ill-informed commentators on the number of companies that squeal,' says Mr
Robert Miller-Bakewell, water analyst at County NatWest. 'If none of them
appeal to the MMC, he'll be seen as a wimp.'
These differences in approach are an inevitable consequence of the way the
UK's regulatory system hands power to one individual, according to Mr Helm.
'If you give individuals great power, it will become intensely personalised.
Just look at how different the approach of Clare Spottiswoode is compared
with her predecessor, Sir James McKinnon. Yet both were appointed under the
same legislation.
'A future Labour government could appoint someone completely different who
could overturn the system without further legislation.'
Such concerns have led to similar prescriptions from different quarters.
National Power's Mr Baker, for example, has called for a common organisation
of regulators, to raise the quality of support staff and transfer experience
between industries. Labour's Mr Hain makes a similar proposal.
Both also support the idea of defining more precisely the role of the
regulator and the establishment of strategic plans for their industries.
Both want the regulatory process to be more open to scrutiny.
The only comfort for the regulators is that no one appears to want to return
to the bad old days of Whitehall administration of the utilities. It is
perhaps a compliment to their success that even the more radical voices in
the Labour party would preserve the system of independent regulation, albeit
with greater accountability to Parliament.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Integrated approach is the real
innovation on competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DICK EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'A manifesto for business' (May 25), commenting on the
government's white paper on competitiveness, welcomed some of the aspects of
the white paper but in our view did not draw sufficient attention to the
really important innovation contained in it. This is that the white paper
treats UK competitiveness as a systems issue and brings together in one
stream of activity the things which the whole of government and industry
need to do. This contrasts with the tradition that each department of state
should pursue its own departmental view of what the UK economy needs. For
instance, there is, for the first time, an integrated analysis of the impact
of education and training on competitiveness, as your editorial
acknowledged.
Moreover, the white paper does not just dwell on what companies should do -
it makes it clear that government and industry need to work together to
improve our competitiveness just as we see happening in so many other
countries, ranging from the US to the newly industrialised countries.

FT  30 MAY 94 / No sympathy for Eurosceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Americans, the glass is always half full, never half empty. Having
imbibed something of this spirit, I find the negative attitudes of British
Eurosceptics a trifle hard to stomach. To stand sullenly on the sidelines,
rather than fight for the kind of union that will expand individual liberty
and prosperity, would strike the typical American as the worst kind of
defeatism: the Dunkirk spirit in reverse.
I realise that many Eurosceptics are keen supporters of free markets. But
this means they should have little respect for the nation state, which often
acts as an obstacle to the free movement of goods, not to mention people.
Two centuries ago, American states managed to pool sovereignty in a federal
union that expanded economic opportunities, preserved personal freedoms and
deterred aggression from neighbours. Why oppose a similar strategy in
Europe?
The record of Brazil and India reminds us that bigness is not in itself a
virtue. American prosperity is a product of the specific political
philosophy adopted by the US founding fathers. And despite the constraints
they so wisely built into the constitution, Washington eventually seized far
too much power. The centre's dominance explains many of today's frictions:
President Bill Clinton is facing violent opposition to his social reforms
partly because such decisions should be taken by lower levels of government.
There is no reason why the same healthcare rules should be imposed on states
as diverse as Vermont, Louisiana and Oregon.
But European nations have the US example. If they are intelligent, they will
copy the best aspects of US federalism while avoiding the mistakes. The fact
that European countries are long-established nation states (unlike the
original components of the US union) should act as a natural brake on
aggrandisement by the centre. So should the increasing number and diversity
of members as the union prepares to absorb the Nordic countries and,
eventually, eastern European states.
The political landscape is also changing. In the late 1980s the likely
destination for Europe seemed to be an interventionist, monolithic
superstate run by a clone of Jacques Delors. That dark future now looks a
little less plausible. Many countries - not just Britain - are fearful of a
loss of national identity. Germany, at last, is showing signs of impatience
with the bureaucracy endemic to Brussels. And European politicians cannot
ignore entirely a global tide of ideas that strongly favours free markets
and personal liberty. Who would have guessed that Italy, of all countries,
would appoint Antonio Martino as foreign minister, a libertarian fan of
Margaret Thatcher?
Since there is now considerable room to influence debate in continental
Europe, British Eurosceptics should stop being so negative. They could start
by reconsidering their blind opposition to a single European currency.
Nearly all economists agree that this would considerably enhance the
commercial attractions of a single European market.
I can understand that an old-fashioned Keynesian might fear that loss of the
pound sterling would prevent a UK government creating jobs at will by
printing wads of money. But most Eurosceptics are surely sophisticated
enough to realise that an independent monetary policy offers only an
illusionary form of sovereignty. It gives you the freedom to create more
inflation than your neighbours, but not more jobs or a higher standard of
living, because these depend on economic fundamentals such as work effort
and productivity growth.
It is odd, to say the least, that many fierce opponents of a single currency
are sympathetic to rule-based global monetary systems such as the
19th-century gold standard. Yet provided a European central bank were
responsibly run (which seems likely if Germany is to abandon the D-Mark),
the effect on Britain would be much the same as a gold standard - protection
from destabilising changes in the value of money.
There is one crucial caveat. A single currency would be disastrous if, in
the name of social justice, Brussels remained wedded to laws preventing the
flexible adjustment of wages and social benefits in member countries. The US
should serve as a warning here. Some regions will always face special
economic problems: for different reasons Texas, New England and California
have all recently suffered severe local recessions. The hardship is
tolerable only because depressed regions can reduce costs and regain market
shares by allowing their wages and social benefits to fall relative to the
national average.
But rather than opposing a single currency out of fear that regional
recessions would turn into depressions, Eurosceptics should direct their
fire at the root problem. This is the dotty desire in Brussels to harmonise
everything, and thus prevent member countries exploiting comparative
advantages such as low wages and flexible working conditions.
The terms for federal union demanded by Britain's partners could eventually
prove unacceptable, for example if they threatened important liberties of UK
citizens. I am not in the camp that regards Britain's future in Europe as a
metaphysical necessity.
Geography is less important than in the past as Japan showed after the
second world war, when it formed its main commercial (and military) ties
with the US rather than its Asian neighbours. The UK could withdraw and
prosper commercially, say by negotiating entry to the North American Free
Trade Agreement. But such a costly upheaval should be avoidable - especially
if Eurosceptics stop sulking and start working for the right kind of liberal
Europe.

<TEXT>
Sir, While it is encouraging to read of the progress in electronic banking
in Moscow ('Russian banking jumps the queue', May 24), I don't think it is
accurate to suggest that its system is ahead of the west. We have had
real-time banking in Ireland for about 10 years, allowing counter (card +
PIN) and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions to be updated
instantly.
Irish ATMs are fluent in five languages (though not Russian, yet) and many
have colour displays. The banking systems in several other EU member states
are similarly advanced.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ofgas making illogical distinctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From FARHANA YAMIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The cost of saving energy' (May 25), failed to spot the
legally dubious reasons of Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general,
concerning the implications of price rises caused by energy efficiency
expenditures.
Your discussion about who should bear the 'costs' of saving energy makes the
same illogical distinction between the treatment of expenditures on
demand-side options (such as energy efficiency) and supply-side options
(like building transmission lines) that Ms Spottiswoode has made. She has
decided that the former should be seen as 'taxes' or 'levies' which she
cannot pass through to consumers under her existing powers in the Gas Act,
while the latter are long-term investments properly incurred for the benefit
of all customers and thus to be paid for by all customers.
This distinction ignores that supply-side expenditure may also benefit only
a small number of customers, or particular class of customers, such as big
industrial users. Conversely, supplying loft insulation to prevent the need
for transmission lines in the first place may benefit all customers -
whether or not all receive loft insulation. Providing expenditures confer
benefits on all gas customers, there is no justification for your suggestion
that the costs of saving energy should be met by taxpayers rather than gas
customers.
By allowing a 'pass through' element for energy efficiency expenditures, Sir
James McKinnon, Ms Spottiswoode's predecessor, was acting within his powers
to protect the interests of consumers in respect of price. He also fulfilled
his statutory duties to take into account the physical effects on the
environment. Ms Spottiswoode, possibly in violation of her legal
obligations, appears to be unaware she even has such obligations.
In cases of doubt, it is the role of the judiciary, rather than Ms
Spottiswoode, her private advisers or members of the House of Commons
environment select committee, to define conclusively the nature and extent
of her regulatory powers. A judicial review would not only provide her with
the guidance she clearly needs, but also clarify for the benefit of present
and future directors-general of utilities watchdogs - Ofgas, Offer, Oftel
and Ofwat - what their statutory duties are in respect of energy efficiency
and the environment.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Critical question not answered by
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALEXANDER MUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Lloyd's confident on solvency tests' (May 25) of the
Lloyd's AGM referred to protests from the floor about Lloyd's alleged
failure in the early 1980s to disseminate information to Names about
asbestos-related losses.
It did not mention the repeated failure of chairman David Rowland to answer
the most critical question arising from the allegations. There is
documentary evidence which substantiates that it was known to the then
Committee of Lloyd's that enormous losses were in the pipeline. The question
that was not answered was whether Parliament had been informed of these
horrendous impending losses before passing in July 1982 the Lloyd's Act,
which conferred on Lloyd's the special privileges of self-regulation and
immunity from being sued.
It is clear that Parliament was not informed. The facts were concealed from
MPs as well as from Names, and since it is inconceivable that the 1982
Lloyd's Act would ever have reached the statute book had Parliament been
aware of the immense and unquantifiable losses faced by Lloyd's, it is
difficult not to conclude that these unique privileges were acquired by
false pretences.
Furthermore, Mr Rowland refused to make available the minutes of the Lloyd's
Audit Committee and the Asbestos Working Party during the 1980-82 period.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor LUBOMYR Y LUCIUK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re 'On the brink over Crimea' (May 24), Ukraine's borders are
inviolable. But Ukraine does not necessarily covet Crimea. Russia does.
Ukraine has said this territory belongs to its original inhabitants, the
Crimean Tatars. Slaughtered and forcibly relocated during imperial Russian
and, later, Soviet times, the Crimean Tatars have been welcomed back to
their ancestral homeland by the present-day Ukrainian government. They do no
want Crimea to become part of Russia again.
Why does your editorial fail to take into consideration the desires and
aspirations of the native people of Crimea, while scolding Ukraine and,
implicitly, rationalising resurgent Russian imperialism? It is Russia that
is engaged in brinkmanship and the west which appears intent on repeating
the crimes of appeasement at Munich and betrayal at Yalta. That way lies
war.

For bank holiday Monday the people who run television have contrived one of
the most unattractive schedules imaginable. Between 7.30 and 12.50 BBC2 are
showing nothing but programmes about the most boring game on earth; the
'sport' which gave us the professional foul, mouth-to-mouth all male
celebration, and Heysel. If you are one of those inverted snobs who love to
stand on the terraces supping lager wi' t'lads and chanting racist slogans
then presumably you will want to see the whole of Goal TV. Those with a
modicum of intelligence will want to look elsewhere - but where? Radio
appears to be the answer. Between 1.00 pm and 7.00 Radio 1 broadcasts
Listeners' Top 100 Songs, a poll of all-time favourites with the Top 10 at
6.00. The Monday Play on Radio 4 is The Triumph Of The Cunning Man by JR
Jones (7.45). Set in 1945 on the coast of Pembrokeshire, it is about Gwyn's
mission to recall his father and brothers who were killed in the war. That
is followed at 9.00 by Risking Your Neck, an investigation of the true risks
of, say, getting cancer from nuclear power or from x-rays.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Arts: Pleasure lies in mystery and moral ambiguity - The
Lodger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY and ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A landlord asks his prospective lodger for her references. She asks him for
his. Who is to know who is safe with whom? No one. In Simon Burke's play The
Lodger, at the Hampstead Theatre, both landlord and lodger use each other.
He, Wise, comes to think he is in love with her - but only after he has
fetishised with her bedclothes and underwear. She, Lois, comes to regard him
as the nicest man she knows - but she only makes advances to him when she
needs to make up for being unable to pay her rent.
Subsequent developments are more shocking. Lois uses Wise's flat as a
brothel; Wise, on discovering, beats her senseless. The pleasure of
following The Lodger, though, lies not in its plot but in its mystery and
moral ambiguity. Lois has lied to Wise about her work, but then she is a
reluctant whore; she is manipulated by her pimp/lover Pollock. Wise has lied
to her about working in the CID; but then he is pathetically anxious to
attract some woman to relieve his loneliness. His best chum is his police
colleague Reed, with whom he can discuss his needs; Lois's only chum is
Pollock, who uses her repulsively. Which pair is preferable?
Every man in The Lodger uses Lois, and the play sets up quite a range of
misogynies. Most overt and chilling, Reed to Wise, after a few drinks: 'Pity
we're not queer. . . A quick shag after footie. . . I can't see the point in
women.' And yet - nice twist - Lois refuses to see the world as men vs.
women. Though she resists Pollock's control over her, she defends him from
Wise and Reed. They are cops (corrupt and brutal cops - another chilling
element, especially after recent headlines); Pollock and she, she insists,
are just perpetual social victims.
The Lodger, which won Burke the 1992 Mobil Playwriting Competition for
Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre (which performed it earlier this year),
holds the attention easily for just over two hours. At its best, the
dialogue has the menace and suspense of early (pre-1968) Pinter. It includes
several glib jokes that amuse without developing the play. (Lois about Wise:
'He's not that bad. He doesn't go round closing hospitals or anything.') The
play disintegrates, however, as its several mysteries are elucidated. We are
all pc enough to applaud Lois's resilience. But no character has been
explored in depth.
The performance, however, is excellent, apart from two of the most
unconvincing stage slaps I have ever seen. The director, Richard Wilson
(yes, he of One Foot in the Grave and The Weekend), hangs tension in the air
from the very first moment. He and his designer, Julian McGowan, create
several dark scenes, turning limited space to claustrophobic advantage. Body
language and verbal pacing are full of meaning and suggestion. Amid a good
cast, Julia Ford and Philip Jackson, as Lois and Wise, perfectly control the
ambiguous lights by which we see them.
Anyone seeking civilised entertainment in Covent Garden should fall into the
Donmar for the next week or so where Maria Friedman is appearing 'by special
arrangement', writes Antony Thorncroft.
The 'special arrangements' are the settings to her songs. Friedman asked
leading musicians to come up with new ideas to pep up cabaret standards. So
just as you settle back for the soothing familiarity of Bernstein's
'Something's Coming' from West Side Story you get challenged by discords
from Jason Carr's arrangement which suggests, rightly enough for the young
leads, that what is coming is best avoided.
In practice Friedman is such a strong performer - quirky face; blistering
voice; confiding personality - that you hardly notice the new garments. Also
her choice of songs - two yearningly sad Yiddish compositions from the Vilna
Ghetto; lots of fairly rare Michel Legrand - lifts her performance out of
the comfortable rut of most cabaret. The spunky arrangements from Jeremy
Sams, Jason Carr, and more, are a bonus.
Although it is a pleasure to come across such novelties as a lament from a
little girl swallowed by a bear, I could have done with more Broadway and
less Brel. Making something of 'If you go away' is meat and drink to any
half decent late night chanteuse, but discovering the panazz in that most
populist of all Cole Porter songs 'I happen to like New York' is a real
achievement. Of the moderns Sondheim comes out best: his work always seems
sharper delivered up front and solo than from the wide open stage. Perhaps
Friedman's greatest coup was converting Elton John's 'Sorry seems to be the
hardest word' into a sophisticated, heart wrenching, threnody.
So a happy two hours. Excellent band, too. The best is left for the encore:
a wonderfully defiant 'Broadway Baby'. Someone should book Maria Friedman's
ticket now.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Arts: Peace and percentages - Rival bids to hold 25th
anniversary celebrations of the Woodstock Aquarian Exposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an event which defined an entire generation. For three days in New
York State, half a million students, anti-war protesters and all-purpose
hippies congregated in a field for three days of music, mind-altering
substances and muddy mayhem.
The 1969 Woodstock Aquarian Exposition, born of the chaotic, shoe-string
idealism of a small group of friends, became synonymous with the slogan of
late 1960s libertarianism: peace and love. But today, as two rival companies
vie to stage the definitive 25th anniversary celebration of the Woodstock
festival, these two qualities are little in evidence.
Where there was once just a group of friends behind the festival, there are
now corporate backers and slick professional promoters. Where there was a
Dollars 500,000 budget and an entry charge of Dollars 18 (that hardly anyone
paid), there is now a joint budget of Dollars 26.5m and a likely entrance
charge of Dollars 120.
Where there was a modest record and film contract, there are now substantial
record, film, television, and merchandising contracts. Instead of a few
patrolling Hell's Angels, the occasional food vendor and endless traffic
jams, there will be an eight-foot high fence and an army of security guards,
concessions stands, cash machines, portaloos and park-and-ride.
In one camp, Woodstock '94 is being put together by the three men who
organised the original event, Michael Lang, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman.
Although the trio went their different ways after 1969, Lang remained in the
music business, promoting acts like Joe Cocker and Rickie Lee Jones, while
Roberts and Rosenman evolved, like numerous former hippies, into Wall Street
investment bankers.
Through their Woodstock Ventures partnership, the trio are organising a
two-day rock festival on August 13 and 14 in Saugerties, about seven miles
from Woodstock town, and expecting an audience of 250,000. The partnership
is backed by the financial muscle of PolyGram Records (which is supplying
the Dollars 19.5m budget), top rock promoter John Scher, concert promotion
firm Metropolitan Entertainment, and a slick public relations campaign.
The suggested line up of musicians - Aerosmith, Metallica, Soundgarden and
Guns N' Roses - reflected a festival appealing not to the 40-plus
participants at the original Woodstock festival but to the current 17-25
year old generation of pop music fans. While John Scher says the choice of
bands is timely, 'because today's music and culture, energy and excitement
recall the mood of 1969', some veterans of the first Woodstock are not
entirely convinced that inviting the nihilistic - and sometimes downright
nasty - bands of the Nineties to a rock festival is the best way to
celebrate the spirit of the Sixties.
Sid Bernstein's anniversary celebration, however, is an unashamedly
nostalgic attempt to recreate the mood of the first Woodstock for an older,
more affluent generation. His event will occupy the original site of the
festival, Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel (actually 50 miles from Woodstock town
proper). The veteran US music promoter who brought the Beatles to America,
Bernstein ironically has no connection with the Woodstock of 1969.
Although he was in the music business at the time, he was some way removed
from the hippie culture, booking acts like Tony Bennett and Sarah Vaughan at
Carnegie Hall. A likeable, avuncular figure who schmoozes like a Broadway
talent agent in a Woody Allen movie, Bernstein runs the Bethel '94
organisation from his Upper East Side apartment. Eight years ago he had a
Damascene conversion when, as he tells it, he visited the site with his
family and was so moved by the powerful memories of Woodstock shadowing Max
Yasgur's farm that he became determined to put together a show to mark the
event's quarter century anniversary. He describes it as a 'mystical, magical
place - almost like the Holy Grail'.
Bernstein's plan for Bethel '94 (the Woodstock name is owned by the Lang
triumvirate) is to present many of the acts who performed at Woodstock. He
has already booked several surviving Woodstock artists including Richie
Havens, John Sebastian and Melanie (other key players like Jimi Hendrix,
Janis Joplin and Keith Moon subsequently died of drug overdoses). Bernstein
also plans to book non-Woodstock acts like Fleetwood Mac, James Brown and
Ray Charles: all reflecting Sixties nostalgia and appealing to the older
generation of the CD buying public.
Bernstein has yet to receive final permission from the town of Bethel to
hold his concert, and there is some doubt as to whether he has the money to
stage a festival for 80,000 people. The Dollars 7m budget, he says, is being
provided by a 'group of doctors and professional men in the Philadelphia
area' and an anonymous group of Wall Street investors.
Bernstein hopes those attending his event will bring clothes and
non-perishable foods that will be given away to charity. When the concert
ends, he plans to give everyone a seed to plant in their gardens or
neighbourhoods as a symbol of hope and new life. 'This is the tone we're
setting for our concert. The Woodstock generation was about peace and love,
but we haven't had much peace and love in this last generation.'
So far, the sympathies of Woodstock veterans seem, if anything, to be with
Bernstein's less ambitious Bethel '94. 'For people who were at Woodstock,
part of the charm of going again is to see how a lot of the old bands have
fared,' says Mark Newman, a musician with the New York rock band Tao Jones,
who has fond memories of losing all his clothes at the first Woodstock. 'If
they're going to have a lot of new bands and cater to a new audience, it's
not really a 25th anniversary.'
Scott Wein, a hippy-turned-mortgage broker who attended the original
festival, has similar doubts. 'I think if they're going to do it, and call
it Woodstock, I would have liked to have seen more of an attempt at a
recreation of Woodstock. How can you call it Woodstock and have Guns N'
Roses?'
The organisers of Woodstock '94 appear sensitive to these criticisms. Having
originally said that the festival would feature Guns N' Roses - a heavy rock
band whose ethos is about as far removed from 'peace and love' of the
Sixties as is possible - it now seems unlikely that the band will appear.
Perhaps Scott Wein best sums up the frustrations many Woodstock veterans
feel about this summer's celebrations. 'I don't resent people trying to make
money - this is America. But if you're going to exploit Woodstock, I feel it
will only be fair if you try to remember Woodstock for what it was. I don't
want my kid going, then coming back and saying: 'Shit, that was Woodstock?
What was the big deal?''

FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Diplomatic couriers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK diplomatic couriers, who have even eaten dispatches to avoid them
reaching enemy hands, may fall victim to cost-cutting and modern technology.
The Queen's messengers, who travel the world delivering secret documents in
briefcases chained to their wrists, were set up 500 years ago by Richard
III. But their numbers could be trimmed under a Foreign Office budget
review, officials said on Thursday.
The 28 couriers, who travel 250,000 miles (400,000 km) a year between them,
are becoming an anachronism in an age when security-cleared faxes can do the
same job in seconds.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Romania last week started to issue what it claims are the most high-tech
passports in Europe, with sophisticated features to combat forgery.
The new passports should be issued nationwide within about three months.
'They are the very latest technology, more modern than the passports of
other European states,' a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said.
Passport forgery reached epidemic proportions after the fall of the
communist regime in 1989.

The Swiss government has approved increases in departure taxes at the
country's two biggest airports, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
As in so many other things, the old Swiss joke - 'they do it differently in
every canton' - applies. At the moment, departure taxes for international
flights range from SFr10 (Pounds 4.60) in Lugano to SFr12 in Bern, SFr12.50
in Zurich, SFr13 in Geneva and SFr15 in Basle.  From November, the tax at
Geneva will rise to SFr14.50 and that at Zurich to SFr14 - and by July 1
1996 both will reach SFr15.50.

Crimes against foreigners in Moscow have fallen, according to the Russian
capital's police force, largely because foreign residents and visitors are
learning to be more careful.
Viktor Seroshtan, the head of Moscow police's special service department,
said there were 464 registered cases of crimes against foreigners in the
first four months of this year, 208 of them on the city's streets, compared
with 525 incidents in the same period in 1993.

Spain faces the prospect of a two-week series of strikes in its public
transport system. There has already been a strike by railway workers, during
the rush hour last Wednesday, and a subway strike in Madrid and Barcelona on
Thursday.
The rail strikes are in protest at wide-ranging plans to restructure Spanish
railway services. Renfe, the national rail company, is due to be split into
separate operating companies with the loss of 14,500 jobs.

FT  30 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Pettersson's auspicious move on
paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It be may luck, but Bengt Pettersson looks to be timing his leap from one
pillar of the Swedish pulp and paper establishment to another rather well,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes. He will be leaving Stora to take over as
MoDo's chief executive on August 1 with at least two favourable developments
as a background.
First, MoDo's fortunes are on a clear upward trend; last week it announced
its first quarterly profit for three years. Second, and perhaps more
important, MoDo has recently resolved a long-running ownership battle which
froze much decision-making for many months.
It certainly helps that Pettersson does not come from SCA, the Swedish
forestry group which was the losing party in the struggle.
Pettersson is a respected forest industry manager, if little known outside
the sector. He has strong credentials for the job, having been in the pulp
and paper business for 28 years - 'quite a few cycles', as he puts it. For
the past six years he has been managing director of Stora's packaging
division, Billerud, which fared better than most of the company's operations
in the industry downturn.
Observers expect Pettersson's style to be different from that of Bernt Lof,
who steps down after nine years as MoDo's chief executive. Lof's bullish
industry prognoses, again in evidence last week, didn't always go down too
well with analysts.
Pettersson is coy about his immediate priorities. But high on his agenda
will be the fate of Modo's packaging division, effectively earmarked for
sale following the company's decision to concentrate on newsprint, fine
paper and board. He may even question whether MoDo has the resources to
develop as many as three core areas given increasing competitive pressures.
Few would be surprised if he opts for an alliance or disposal in due course.

FT  30 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): de Raad to promote quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Foundation for Quality Management, a non-profit association
created in 1988 by 14 of Europe's leading companies and today backed by more
than 320 corporate members, has a new secretary general, writes Tim Dickson.
He is Geert de Raad, a Dutchman who took over the reins of the
Brussels-based organisation from John King at the beginning of this month.
EFQM's role is to promote the business idea known as total quality
management, a philosophy which puts customers and employees at the centre of
a company's thinking. With the support of the European Commission and the
European Organisation for Quality, EFQM in 1992 launched an annual award
which recognises the best European exponents of TQM.
De Raad, who has an MBA from Northeastern University of Boston, faces the
challenge of trying to spread the TQM 'gospel' to a wider and sometimes
sceptical European audience. He was previously responsible for the plastics
business of Royal Nijverdal-Ten Cate which included 10 companies, employed
2,900 people and boasted Ecu350m of turnover. As corporate director, he was
in charge of all acquisition activities, technology development and the
group-wide implementation of TQM. He joined the executive board in 1990 and
subsequently became a corporate vice-president.

FT  30 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Gilbert to spearhead Biogen's
move into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biogen, one of the biggest of the US biotechnology companies which is based
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is increasing its presence in Europe and
appointing Alain Gilbert (right) as its first European vice-president,
writes Daniel Green.
Gilbert, 46, will be building a European sales organisation to promote two
of the company's drugs: Hirulog, an anti-blood clot drug, and beta
interferon, in late trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
Gilbert, a French citizen, will be based in Paris or Brussels; the company
will decide in the next few days which of these two cities will house its
European headquarters.
Gilbert joins Biogen from Idexx Laboratories, a Portland, Maine,
biotechnology company specialising in veterinary products, where he has been
president of European operations since 1990.
Between 1987 and 1990, he was president of operations in Europe, Africa and
the middle east for Medtronic, the US pacemaker and heart treatment device
supplier. Before that, he worked for US drugs company Abbott Laboratories in
sales and marketing where he became general manager of the Aids and
hepatitis diagnostics division.
The European appointment not only marks Biogen's expansion into Europe, but
also its determination to move beyond licensing out of its products to drugs
companies into sales and marketing on its own behalf.
Gilbert says the structure of the company would be centralised with all main
decisions taken at the headquarters. Sales and marketing people would be
recruited in other countries and he predicts that within nine months the
company would employ 100-150 people in Europe.
Biogen's other investment in Europe, a research centre in Bracknell, west of
London in the UK, would increasingly focus its activities on the European
market, he said.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Gateway to Palestinian contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shaded, walled courtyard of the American Colony Hotel, in Arab East
Jerusalem, is the starting point for foreigners who want to do business with
Palestinians in the West Bank.
It provides a good base, because Palestinians do not like to cross into the
Jewish side of the city. However, if you also plan meetings on the Jewish
side, be warned that many Israelis see the Colony as a hotbed of Palestinian
'terrorism'.
By far the best hotel on the Arab side of the holy city, it serves
traditional Arab and international cuisine throughout the day.
From the Colony you can easily travel to the commercial centres of the West
Bank - Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and now Jericho - all of which are within an
hour's drive of East Jerusalem. Jericho, which is in the process of becoming
the administrative capital of Palestinian self-government, will soon be an
essential place for any foreign businessman to visit.
Travelling in the West Bank can be dangerous. Cars with yellow Israeli
licence plates are often targets of stone-throwing youths, who assume the
drivers are Jewish settlers. The best way to travel is in an Arabic taxi,
which has different coloured licence plates and signs in Arabic.
If you want to rent a car, go to Petra Rent a Car, in Shufat, which will
deliver it to your doorstep and give you a mobile telephone if needed.
Although most of its cars have yellow plates, they have big stickers on
their sides in Arabic to deter potential stone-throwers. Another sensible
precaution is to buy a Palestinian kefiyah - head scarf - and drape if over
your dashboard.
Having an Arabic fixer/translator is essential, although most Palestinian
businessmen speak good English. A fixer can set up meetings, negotiate
around a roadblock, and give a flavour of the political and religious
sensitivities that infuse discussions in the Holy Land. He can also
accompany you on a tour of the Old City, where otherwise you are almost
certain to be fleeced by merchants in the bazaar.
Most places in the West Bank accept dollars, Israeli shekels and Jordanian
dinars. You can get a slightly better rate for foreign currency at money
changers in East Jerusalem. Many foreigners use Nabil Freidy on Sallah'adin
street, East Jerusalem's high street.
Doing business in the Gaza Strip is more difficult. After years of
repression, Gaza has become a deeply conservative and islamicised society.
Travelling with yellow licence plates almost guarantees that you will be
stoned. To get into Gaza, leave your car at the Erez checkpoint and transfer
to a car with white plates. There are several taxis just past the
checkpoint, but most of the drivers do not speak English. It is better to
arrange a car with a translator beforehand.
Many new hotels are being developed in Gaza, especially on the sea front
where a cool breeze blows off the Mediterranean most nights. Many
foreigners, however, prefer to stay at Marna House in central Gaza. Many
important politicians and businessmen show up here in the evenings, and it
is one of the rare places where guests can be served beer.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Planes, trains and tunnels - UK airlines'
response to the new Channel crossing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK airline industry is gearing itself up for increasing competition next
year on short-haul European routes from high-speed rail services through the
Channel tunnel.
British Airways plans to revamp its Club Europe business class services
later this year, and is launching new services from London to Orly, which,
being south of Paris, offers a competitive alternative to high-speed trains.
British Midland also plans services to Orly from September, and to launch
new routes to more distant destinations in Europe which will not compete
directly with the tunnel.
But one airline has decided that, if you cannot beat high-speed trains on
shorter routes, then join them. Mr Richard Branson sees the new network of
high-speed train services linked to the Channel tunnel as a chance for his
Virgin group to expand its travel business in Europe.
'We see high-speed trains as complementing our Virgin Atlantic long-haul
airline operations,' says Mr Branson. 'We have no intention of expanding in
the short-haul European airline business, but trains would give us a big
foothold in the market.'
Mr Branson will join forces with one of the five consortiums bidding to
build the fast rail link from London to Folkestone - Virgin will decide
which one in the next three weeks. The winning consortium will run the UK
end of the joint venture with SNCF, the French railway company, operating
Eurostar trains through the tunnel.
Mr Branson wants to extend his Virgin Atlantic airline formula of 'comfort
and fun' to the proposed rail services. He plans to introduce individual
seat video screens, and equip trains with telephones and faxes.
His recent investment - to manage jointly with Shirayama Shokusan of Japan
the Pounds 150m hotel development on the site of London's old County Hall
building, near Waterloo station - is also linked to his Channel tunnel
ambitions. 'County Hall is next to the new Channel tunnel London rail
terminal, and will make an ideal base for our long-distance air travellers
to connect into the Eurostar rail network,' he said.
Virgin Upper Class air passengers would be driven by limousine from Heathrow
airport to spend the night at County Hall, before travelling to the
continent by high-speed train the next day.
British Airways, however, believes that, while the tunnel will have
short-term impact, in the longer term it will expand the overall travel
market for both airlines and trains.
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the UK airports operator, also
expects only a modest impact. 'Most business travellers start their journeys
from home to the airport. If they live in the home counties, they will still
find it more convenient to go straight to Gatwick or Heathrow rather than
travel to the city centre to catch a Channel tunnel train.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / People: No longer shooting for the moon - Daniel Goldin
tells Guy de Jonquieres how Nasa is taking several steps for America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daniel Goldin, administrator of the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, enters the room rather the worse for wear. The head of the
organisation which sent a man to the moon is nursing multiple fractures
after an accident on his preferred mode of transport - a racing bicycle.
Yet despite refusing to take pain-killers, he is in fighting form. Within
minutes, he is punching away at a favourite theme: the ills of modern
society, in which a search for self-gratification has cramped horizons and
sapped the urge for adventure and discovery.
'Our society demands instant results. We eat instant food. We have instant
entertainment and we demand instant financial results. When you demand
instant financial results, there is no room for risk or failure. That's the
fundamental problem I see today. Where is new wealth going to be generated
if we don't take risks?
'The key thing is not to be afraid of risk. There are so many prophets who
sit in the wings waiting for someone to fail. And you know what they do? If
there's a failure, they come in and say: 'By God, let's punish that
failure'. And guess what happens - you get mediocrity in society.'
That is where Nasa comes in. Its willingness to embrace risk by advancing
the frontiers of technology and backing projects with a long-term economic
pay-off, he says, is one of the few ways in which American society can
invest in its collective future.
Recently, however, this uplifting vision has encountered obstacles. Not only
has enthusiasm for space missions continued to wane in the US, but two years
of fiscal austerity have reduced Nasa's annual budget by 30 per cent in real
terms to Dollars 14.5bn. 'We can't get any closer to the bone,' Goldin says.
Still, a lot of fat needed to be cut. Since the 53-year-old Goldin was
recruited two years ago from TRW, a leading US defence and engineering
company, he has been widely praised for shaking up the management of Nasa's
flabby bureaucracy and controlling costs more tightly.
He is also shifting expenditure from showpiece space missions into projects
promising greater commercial spin-off. That is in tune with President
Clinton's drive to increase government support for industrial
high-technology research and helps explain why Goldin is one of only two
federal agency heads to have survived from the Bush administration.
Though Nasa has generated many valuable spin-offs - such as 'error-free'
computer software - they have until now been largely chance by-products of
its larger space programmes. In future, the agency will focus more on
specific three-to-five-year research projects, often in partnership with
industry. The aim is to develop generic 'break-through' technologies, which
could spawn a string of specific industrial innovations.
They include work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and environmental
technology. One of the most promising is satellite remote sensing - using
satellites to capture vast amounts of data about the earth's surface which
could be used in everything from agriculture to environmental planning. 'The
whole remote-sensing industry is worth about Dollars 1bn a year today. We
think we could activate that to be worth perhaps Dollars 10bn a year,' says
Goldin.
His biggest - and most controversial - move has been to commit substantial
resources to supporting the civil aircraft industry. Such support has not
been an explicit goal of federal policy since Congress vetoed research funds
for a Supersonic Transport aeroplane in 1971, its planned response to
Concorde.
'When that decision was taken, I was despondent about what my country did
and excited by the Europeans' boldness in taking risks on Concorde,' he
says. 'Yes, Concorde cost money, but what a feat] It defined Europe as a
society. I salute the Europeans.'
Getting the US back in the race involved interminable, and often heated,
negotiations with industry and government, and a grass-roots lobbying
campaign which took Goldin to public meetings around the country.
The results are joint research programmes with US manufacturers into a High
Speed Civil Transport (HSCT), a supersonic passenger jet, and an Advanced
Subsonic aircraft, both expected to enter service early next century.
Nasa's contribution of about Dollars 2.5bn over five years will cover a
third of the total cost. The rest will be paid for by industry, much of it
in the form of services to the agency.
The research includes cleaner, less thirsty and quieter engines, more
efficient aerodynamic designs, new materials and improved safety systems.
Goldin hopes that by the end of the decade, the technologies will have been
proved in the laboratory and will be ready for industry to turn into
products.
Building the HSCT will, he says, require an international consortium of
manufacturers because the market is not big enough to support two rival
supersonic aircraft. The issue is how it will be controlled and led. 'Will
it be from Europe or America? Generally, the way the world works is that the
corporation or country with the superior capability and technology can
provide the leadership.'
The recent scale of US efforts to ensure that it calls the shots has
unsettled Europe's aircraft manufacturers, which have launched their own
feasibility study into a supersonic aircraft to succeed Concorde.
They and EU trade negotiators are also pressing, against strong US
opposition, for stricter international curbs on civil aircraft subsidies in
which would be included Nasa support, on the grounds that it threatens to
distort competition.
Goldin rejects the charge. He condemns European subsidies to Airbus, and
insists Nasa funding of the US aircraft industry is different because it
stops short of production. 'This is not ugly, unfair competition. This is
wonderful stuff,' he growls. 'I compete with everyone, including myself.'
Nonetheless, the risks Nasa is taking are paid for with taxpayers' money.
'So what? Look at the mediocrity in the world. Look at the state of industry
. . . if we don't make bold moves, where are the new jobs coming from? You
tell me.'
But would it not be more efficient to pool transatlantic HSCT research by,
for example, inviting European manufacturers to participate in Nasa's
programmes? No chance, says Goldin: 'I am fiercely competitive in defence of
America. It's written in my genetic code.' He recalls that one of the first
questions he asked after moving to Nasa was who its customers were. 'I sat
down with our staff and we did an analysis. Clearly, our customers were the
American people.
'They own this programme, but they had been separated from it for a long
time because Nasa was focusing on beating the Russians. But in the new world
order, after the Berlin wall came down, it was clear that we had to serve
the American public.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Lost luggage leads to Denver delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denver's new airport, topped with white Fibreglass cones in imitation of the
Rocky Mountains in the background, continues to lie empty. It was due to
open on May 16, but was delayed - for the fourth time - by glitches in the
high-technology baggage delivery system.
The new Denver International Airport, with a runway that will be able to
handle 99 aircraft arrivals an hour in bad weather - as many as the city's
64-year-old Stapleton airport can cope with on a clear day - is eight months
behind schedule and Dollars 1bn over budget. It has cost Dollars 3.2bn to
date.
When its opening was postponed again this month, city officials decided not
to set another target, saying only that the airport would open when the
computerised baggage handling system - the most sophisticated and complex of
its kind - had been sufficiently tested and proved operational.
The system, which has cost Dollars 194m, has 21 miles of tracks that snake
through the airport, carrying bags in 4,000 individual containers. Bar codes
on luggage labels tell the system the bags' destinations. But the system
relies on human co-operation: it keeps going awry when luggage is loaded
with the labels face down or otherwise obscured.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Any which way you want to read it - Anthony
Ridder believes there's still a future for traditional newspapers. But just
in case he's hedging his bets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthony Ridder, president of Knight-Ridder, publishers of newspaper such as
the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Miami Herald, is as certain as anyone can
be that the future of the newspaper is secure.
'We have spent a great deal of time studying the issue over the last four
years. We think the traditional printed newspaper, improved and with new
services for advertisers, is going to be a good solid business for as far
out as we can see,'
But at the same time Knight-Ridder, which last year had Newspaper revenues
of Dollars 2bn out of a group total of Dollars 2.45bn, is placing a range of
each-way bets on technologies that could affect the future of the
traditional newspapers.
These projects, backed by spending of around Dollars 10m a year, cover a
wider range of areas than those being pursued by most other newspaper
groups. They range from on-line fax and audio text services, through plans
for expansion in conventional television news, to the more futuristic
portable flat panels that can scroll through newspaper pages and sections
and bring the pictures to life with video news clips.
At the Mercury Center, in San Jose, electronic access to Knight-Ridder's San
Jose Mercury News is available for Dollars 9.95 a month. Described as 'more
of a library service' it is carried on the America Online data base, which
has 34,000 subscribers in the Mercury's circulation area. Knight-Ridder has
6,500 direct subscribers, but every time anyone else accesses Mercury News
information the company gets a fee. The service includes an electronic
version of the Mercury News classified advertisements - an important vehicle
for staff poaching in Silicon Valley. The Mercury Centre also runs fax and
audio services. A subscriber to the audio service can specify a list of
interests, such as company results, give a PIN number and receive what are
personalised broadcasts by car phone.
In Philadelphia the Inquirer is going to launch its own television News Hour
with a local station of dedicated television professionals but calling on
the 610 Knight-Ridder newsroom staff in the area. If it is a success the aim
is to turn out a 24-hour news channel for the 5m people in the area. This is
a service which, like the Mercury Center, could be replicated in other
cities where the company has a major daily newspapers.
'Our feeling is that we need to be involved in the video business,' says
Ridder, 'partly to generate moving pictures for the flat panel being
developed at the Knight-Ridder Information Design Laboratory in Boulder,
Colorado.'
Ridder believes that on-line data bases are fine, but that people like
headlines, and prefer journalists to make judgments on the relative
importance of stories, rather than simply offering relatively
undifferentiated lists of information.
By the end of this year an electronic version of Knight-Ridder's Journal of
Commerce, a daily specialising in transport and trade issues, will be
available to Personal Computers in a newspaper format.
Ridder believes the portable flat panel as a commercial product is still
probably five years away.
He reckons that when the flat panel is fully developed he will be able to
plug it into a hotel telephone socket overnight and take delivery of the
full electronic text of his daily reading - the Miami Herald, the New York
Times and the Wall Street Journal. Customers will be able to click on an
electronic pen and pull up any story they are interested in. They will be
able to display this at whatever size they want, and if they are interested
in a soccer game they will will be able to click on a sports picture and get
a two-minute video of highlights.
Roger Fidler, the Knight-Ridder executive behind the flat panel development,
believes that by the year 2005 in the US such flat panels could overtake PCs
as a method of obtaining information.
Just is case he is wrong, he is pushing ahead with more conventional
newspaper developments, such as home delivery of information for advertisers
to non-newspaper subscribers, producing specialist publications aimed at
particular areas or demographics, and even creating consumer events such as
the recent Women's Show in Philadelphia. This attracted more than 20,000
people.
As he keeps a close watch on all his each-way bets, he emphasises that every
day in America '62 per cent of all adults read a daily newspaper - 69 per
cent on Sunday - and that has not changed during the last five years.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Interactive marriage, Italian style - Andrew
Hill assesses the chances of a new venture between Stet and Bell Atlantic of
the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a country already conducting a passionate love affair with the television
and telephone, any venture which tries to put the two together should have a
fair chance of success.
That at least seems to be the view of Stet, Italy's state-controlled
telecommunications utility, and Bell Atlantic, the US telecoms group, which
last month agreed to develop an interactive multimedia television service
for the Italian market.
By early 1996, the two companies hope to be able to offer Italian consumers
feature films, on demand, via the telephone network operated by Stet's
subsidiary Sip. In due course, the companies will add video shopping,
banking, do-it-yourself, and even emergency first aid, not to mention
exploiting commercial applications such as video conferences and training.
'Italy will probably be the first into the (European) market with this
capability,' says Edgar Brown, president and chief executive of Bell
Atlantic International.
Certainly, Italy looks like a prime target for multimedia services. Not only
are late 20th century Italians, like their ancestors, hooked on
communication, they also seem to take to gadgets very quickly.
'Within Europe it's probably one of the better markets and one of the more
receptive to new ideas and new services,' says Evan Miller, European
telecoms analyst at Lehman Brothers in London.
The classic success story in Italy has been the mobile telephone, or
'telefonino' in the Italian diminutive. Whereas in many other European
countries, ordinary people would hesitate to produce a mobile telephone in
public for fear of being either mugged or sneered at, the Italians
positively flaunt their 'telefonini', and use them not just as tools but as
toys. In big cities, it is quite common to see groups in piazza cafes
passing round the cellular phone to talk to friends out of town.
Linked to this casual technological ease is a sophisticated television
culture, which in some parts of the country feeds viewers as many as 20
national and local channels. One important point for advocates of multimedia
is that the diet already includes several cheap, but unavoidable, home
shopping channels, peopled by enthusiastic presenters with bizarre sales
pitches ('Buy a Persian carpet, win a scooter]').
For Stet, which is likely to be privatised later this year, and Bell
Atlantic, the first step towards realising this potential is technical. Sip
will work with the US group to adapt its traditional copper-wire telephone
network to the transmission of video signals, investing an estimated
L4,000bn (Dollars 2.5bn).
If Italy eventually wants a fully-fledged multimedia service, certain
analysts believe substantially more will need to be invested, but Sip's
modest first ambition is for technical tests to take place by the end of
this year, and commercial trials - on a group of 2,000 users - during 1995.
It is the strange and volatile Italian market, however, which offers the
biggest challenge - and carries the biggest risk - for the two companies
which will develop and market the services through Stream, a Stet subsidiary
in which Bell Atlantic will take a 49 per cent stake.
As Miro Allione, Stream's managing director, put it after last month's
launch: 'The technology, although it's demanding and sophisticated, is
really the smaller problem. The real unknowns are in the marketing, which is
linked to demand and to the capability of operators wanting to back the new
medium.'
To help conquer the unknown, Stream - which is likely to seek an initial
capital injection of L100bn by the end of next month - is already talking to
potential partners who could provide 'information and programming' ahead of
the 1996 commercial launch.
According to Bell Atlantic's Edgar Brown, the two main shareholders are
prepared to accept dilution of their own stakes in Stream, but will retain
joint control.
Stream's first challenge will be to lure subscribers into the system with
movie services, which are described as the 'trigger' for the rest of the
system.
Although simple to understand, movies may also prove the most difficult of
the proposed services to get right in Italy. Broadly speaking, consumers
will be able to choose what to watch from a library of films or programmes,
divided into categories and targeted at particular audiences. More
importantly, they will also be able to choose exactly when to watch.
The question is whether this will be tempting enough to defeat rival
attractions in the sector. Not only is big-screen cinema already quite a
draw for urban Italians, anyone in the country can also watch 8,000 films a
year, for free, on the state-owned Rai television channels and their private
competitors.
As a measure of the difficulties facing Stream, Telepiu, which launched
pay-TV movie and sports channels three years ago, has yet to make money and
has attracted 600,000 subscribers, whereas Stet and Bell Atlantic hope for
well over a million users.
At the same time, Rai and Fininvest (the media empire built by Silvio
Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister) have amassed substantial film
archives and rights, which Stream would be hard-pressed to match unless it
could link up with one of the existing conventional channels.
Stream could argue that a new medium requires new rules, and pay royalties
on the basis of the number of viewers selecting individual films. If that
tactic fails, however, and Stream's film catalogue is not sufficiently broad
by the time it launches, film-lovers could easily switch back to the
conventional channels.
The second service to be introduced is likely to be video shopping, and here
the US-Italian joint venture is on surer ground. Already, home shopping via
television is said to be worth between L600bn and L800bn a year in Italy,
and interactive television would allow customers to complete the whole
transaction, from order to payment, on screen. Industry sources, however,
are still convinced that both consumers and companies will have to be eased
into the new technology. 'I'm not sure that the Italians are prepared to
move suddenly to a new (buying) system, instead of touching products or
smelling perfumes,' says one.
Evan Miller of Lehman Brothers points out that Europe has been generally
more cautious than the US in moving towards multimedia services. Analysts
are in general sceptical about the possibility of a full-scale national
system being in place within the next few years, but they believe there is a
chance of a limited service in the most important cities.
The limited previous experience of Stet and Sip in a similar field means
they are likely to be cautious about pushing their customers too hard to
accept new technology. Over the last few years, Sip has watched its
ambitious Videotel venture - an interactive telephone system similar to
France's Minitel - quietly wither away. Stet's judgment is that Videotel was
too complicated and the range of services too narrow. That is likely to be
the first lesson that Stream learns in setting up a multimedia service.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: PCs to shake off dunce's image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days of the humble television set are numbered. Within a few years, it
will be supplanted in the home and office by the personal computer - albeit
in modified form - which is set to become the principal vehicle for the
multimedia revolution.
Who says so? Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, for one. He predicts that homes
will soon have at least two PCs capable of displaying multimedia programmes.
The first, shorn of its keyboard and boasting a large screen will live in
the lounge. It will combine still and moving images, sound, text and
graphics and the service will be interactive - video on demand or three
dimensional computer games are typical examples.
'Then there will be a device in your den for when you want to browse for
shopping or do your personal finances. You will sit less than a metre from
it and it will have a keyboard and a superior ability to display text,' he
says.
Gates' plan is that Windows, the operating software that has been a
principal key to Microsoft's position as software market leader, will
control both these PCs.
The drawback to date, however, has been that PCs, sharp though they are at
arithmetic, are pretty much dunces where it comes to displaying video
images. They are simply not designed to handle or store the sheer volume of
information contained in a moving picture. Thus, video sequences in
multimedia presentations are limited to a postage stamp sized area of the
screen. Any attempt to enlarge the image causes a sharp loss of quality and
fidelity.
Now, Videologic, of Kings Langley on the outskirts of London, claims to have
an answer to the problem. It has developed a set of silicon chips capable of
taking digitised video images and displaying them on a PC screen - full
size, offering cinema quality motion and fully compatible with Gates'
Windows. And the cost of the chips should be no more than Dollars 25 in
quantity - in other words, chips for a mass market.
The company's claim should be taken seriously for a number of reasons.
First, because it is already the world leader in an earlier form of PC
video. In 1988 it developed chips which overlaid video pictures on a PC
screen, by passing the central processor and memory. The new chips, however,
mix the digits representing video, text and graphics in the computer's
memory, something, Videologic says, no other company has yet accomplished.
It is a cheaper solution and it makes it possible for the computer to
manipulate any part or aspect of the video picture, something that was
impossible with the earlier technology.
Second, because it has some very powerful partners including International
Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, British
Telecom and Motorola, a leading US semiconductor manufacturer. Its agreement
with IBM covers the joint design, development and marketing of multimedia
products. Videologic has, however, retained its intellectual property
rights.
Third, because the company already has a raft of blue chip customers,
including Microsoft, the Bank of England, Deutsche Bank and the John Lewis
Partnership.
According to Derek Maclaren, chairman, the company has a six-month lead on
the competition protected by patents, knowledge and an adherence to industry
standards others have yet to emulate. The concepts are difficult to grasp,
especially for a consumer product. so Videologic is selling its flagship
product, '928Movie' as a way of speeding up Windows graphics with, it says,
'multimedia for free'.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: When Postman Pat goes electronic - Bill
Cockburn talks to Andrew Adonis about the Royal Mail's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even a year ago, an interview with a postal service chief executive on the
subject of 'media futures' might have seemed laughable. However, Bill
Cockburn, chief executive of the UK's Royal Mail, holds forth about the role
of his business in the interactive age with all the verve, and much of the
plausibility, of today's telecommunications barons.
Cockburn concedes that 'no letter is safe in the age of the technological
postman.' But tomorrow's entrepreneurial post office will, he argues, be
offering both the postmen and the technology.
His vision combines the potential of the existing postal service to thrive
on the back of technological innovation in other sectors, plus the ability
of the postal service to innovate on its own account.
Cockburn is sceptical about the pace of the supposed interactive revolution.
In the short and medium term, with interactive systems and cultural
adaptation in their infancy, home shopping and the like could significantly
boost the conventional mail business - through catalogues, extra billing,
and so on.
But even when full interactivity dawns, Cockburn sees a vital role for post
as valet to the new networks. Home shopping, for instance, is potentially a
huge source of new business for those with an efficient home-to-home
delivery capacity. 'We need to be positioned to take that on.'
He sees a similar evolutionary process in utility billing mail. Ultimately,
all accounts may be settled on the screen.
Before that, however, Cockburn sees a lucrative market in the outsourcing of
billing to single operators capable of printing and delivering bills and
handling the payments - whether cash, paper or electronic. 'Who better than
us to do it - we already have the delivery and much of the payments
capacity, and are fast developing electronic mail.'
Part of Royal Mail's case for privatisation is the need to break free of
government investment restrictions to develop new technology. Cockburn also
wants the freedom to contract joint ventures, at home and abroad, to pool
his assets with those of new technological operators.
'We have a lot to offer a partner,' says Cockburn, who proceeds to rattle
off the plums on his balance sheet. 'We have our own telecoms network, the
fourth largest in the country, 16 trains, 70 chartered air services a day,
30,000 vehicles, the biggest residential database in the UK, and 2,000
buildings. Think of the opportunities that gives you.' Not to mention an
army of Postman Pats.

The television pictures transmitted from the decks of heaving yachts during
the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race may not have completely satisfied
the most fastidious engineer. But they were as near broadcast quality as
makes no difference.
The Yacht Video System meant that for the first time broadcasters could
receive news clips of life on board the competing boats, even when they were
far out at sea.
Last week Craig Woolf and David Tilson, the two engineers who put the
operational system
together in British Telecommunications' laboratories, received a Royal
Television Society's Technology award for their achievement.
BT initially planned the Yacht Video System as a demonstration and
promotional exercise. Now it is starting to see the business potential. The
system could be used by broadcasters for transmitting pictures from a moving
vehicles in remote terrain. Cruise lines are also showing interest in using
the system in reverse to deliver television news bulletins by satellite to
ships in the middle of oceans.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Watchdog - Buzz words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST. GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cave canem: beware of the dog. Watchdogs are roaming all around us. Last
week Clare Spottiswoode, the British gas industry watchdog, got in a spot of
trouble with MPs over an outspoken attack upon her predecessor. Another
House of Commons committee called for the sacking of Joe Palmer, chairman of
the Personal Investment Authority, 'the planned watchdog to protect private
investors' (Financial Times).
The watchdog pack is growing the whole time, with everything from Oflot, for
lotteries, and a railway regulator, to the Independent Television
Commission, which bared its teeth last week, and the Securities and
Investment Board for financial services.
The original watchdog was Cerberus, the three-headed dog which kept the
shades in Hades. Now watchdogs are people who keep watch over sectors of
industry, finance or government.
The word developed from the Oxford English Dictionary first usage in
Shakespeare's play The Tempest ('the watch-Dogges barke, bawgh-wawgh'),
through its first modern usage in 1845 in Encyclopedia Metropolitana ('now
we feel the necessity for a set of guardians or watchdogs of the state') to
a fixed meaning in 1910: 'the Chancellor acted as
watch-dog in
front of the
Treasury'.
Americans
dropped the
hyphen to
stop the
tail wagging
the rest of
the word,
although it was new enough to continue to wear inverted commas into the
1950s.
British watchdogs have specific tasks, such as Ofgas and Ofwat for
utilities, the Securities and Investment Board for financial services and
National Audit Office for the public sector. Some are bred from government
stock, others are mongrels from consumers and sectors of industry.
Strangely, the less dogginess the more watchfulness. The problem with the
word centres on who is being guarded from what; this is rarely clear, since
a watchdog both prevents intruders and escapees.
But are all watchdogs necessarily impartial or independent? This from the
Economist (April 30): 'The Mollen commission's key point is likely to be the
establishment of an independent watchdog to monitor New York's police
department.'
Away from the familiar language of barking and biting, a watchdog can 'come
under fire' (Telegraph, April 30) or find itself 'launched to stamp out
abuses' (Daily Mail, April 22). The watchdog metaphor only has a limited
linguistic life: loyal dogs are not put down, but 'de-recognised'. 'Lautro
is due to be de-recognised as a regulator some time after the PIA is to
become operational in July this year' (Financial Times, April 28).

FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: The Chamber - Reading matter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Grisham, the lawyer turned blockbuster thriller writer, made his name
and his millions writing books with titles like The Firm and The Client.
Now we have The Chamber, which at first sight should be called The Formula,
because it starts by conforming to the well-established Grisham pattern.
It takes us swiftly into the main event, in this case a Ku Klux Klan bombing
in the 1960s which kills a Jewish lawyer and his two young sons. Twenty
years later, the man sentenced to death for the crime faces the gas chamber.
A young, talented but independent lawyer from an underprivileged background,
working for big time law firm, volunteers for the apparently hopeless case.
The twist: the old racist prisoner is his long-lost grandfather.
The first hundred pages are dramatic and promising. But thereafter the book
should be retitled The Mess, or more accurately The Long Mess,
because Grisham
wrote it
in long hand and it runs to almost 500 pages. It hints that it might become
a detective story of the young lawyer's hunt for the mystery second bomber,
who masterminded the attack but got away. That storyline peters out.
The Chamber is a sustained attack on the mechanics and politics of the death
penalty. It claims to be a thriller, as the hero desperately attempts to
save his grandfather while the clock ticks away. Yet the story is peculiarly
lacking in drama. It is largely a mechanistic account of ludicrous petitions
being faxed backward and forward between courts.
The book is mainly a portrait of the white, working class south, through a
family which is inevitably and hopelessly wrecked by its history of racism.
This portrait is at times compelling. But Grisham is far better at
explaining events than exploring characters. So the moving story of the
grandfather and the lawyer learning to love and depend upon one another on
death row gets hopelessly confused with the thriller and detective sides of
the story. For those who were gripped by The Firm and The Pelican Brief,
this latest Grisham book may well go down as The Disappointment.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Linen without all the tears - Style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHY PHILLIPS, Beauty Director of Tatler
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether the British like it or not, linen just won't go away where fashion
is concerned. It's a fabric more often accepted for the bed or table. Its
tendency to crease horribly frustrates those who wear it. Yet this summer
there is more of it than ever.
There are linen garments of every sort and all prices in the shops this
summer. Classic good buys are Racing Green's shirt, in a wide choice of
colours and easy to wash and iron, or its Pounds 99 linen jacket (by mail
order or from the Racing Green shop in Regent Street). Marks and Spencer do
a reasonably tailored linen suit for Pounds 100. The three-button
double-breasted style, with matching trousers, is similar in look to the
top-of-the-range Giorgio Armani version, in cream, brown or navy which is a
lifetime investment for Pounds 1,300.
On the continent and in the US, where summers are hotter and longer, linen
is seen as a godsend - cool, comfortable, natural and ecologically sound.
In Italy, where men in pale summer suits have lunch a casa, it only takes a
little persuasion and Mama or the maid will re-press their Armani linen for
the afternoon, a service that's almost inconceivable in Britain.
A label in John Rocha's crisp, pale beige, three-quarter length pure Irish
linen coat, announcing that the look of the fabric might change after
dry-cleaning, is a daunting prospect. But, says David Tothill of London's
speciality dry-cleaners, there is nothing to fear if the job is done
professionally.
'Beware of thinking you can look after linen at home,' he adds, 'since it's
the reshaping and pressing of the garment after washing (this takes three or
four times longer than most fabrics) which completes the process.
'English women don't understand linen like continental women do. It is a
luxury fibre, expensive and difficult to care for. It can come alive if it's
professionally looked after but wash it yourself and you could end up with a
shiny finish which is hard to reverse.'
Tothill has another warning. Linen will eventually end up with permanent
creasing in areas that always crease with regular wear, and no amount of
cleaning or pressing can alter it.
For converts, however, there is nothing like it. Those who appreciate the
natural qualities of linen can ignore the down side. 'There isn't a more
natural fabric,' says Rocha, UK Designer of the Year. 'As the years go by
the fabric gets more mature and both the look and feel get better and
better. It's perfect for summer.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: How to do battle with jet lag - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not for nothing are overnight flights known as 'red-eyes'. But reducing the
negative side-effects of long distance flying is possible. One of the most
important things a traveller can do, says Dr Gill Lea, of travel company
Trailfinders, is to sleep as much as possible on the journey.
Trying to pre-empt jet lag by setting watches to a new time zone in advance,
changing diets or undergoing high-tech light treatments to change the body's
circadian rhythm are really not very helpful, she says.
Dr Lea believes a disrupted personal body clock is an inevitable consequence
of moving through time zones. Sleeping at the other end is still the best
remedy for jet lag and general travel weariness.
As far as time permits, business travellers should adapt their schedules and
book a flight which arrives as close as possible to the flier's bedtime.
Generally, the body needs 24 hours to adjust to a new time zone, and
important business decisions should be postponed as long as possible after
arrival.
Other effects of long-haul flying can be dealt with on the plane. In the
air, the body tends to dehydrate and drinking plenty of liquids is crucial
during a flight. While free cocktails in first class are very tempting,
these have a dehydrating effect and travellers should alternate alcohol with
water or soft drinks.
Sitting for five to 15 hours - even in a roomy business class seat - can
cause the body to stiffen, and the increased pressure of the flight cabin
tends to swell the ankles. Travellers should get up and walk around, and
remove shoes with caution. Remember you need to be able to get them back on
at the end of the flight.
If walking around the cabin every 20 minutes seems excessive, Dr Lea
recommends that passengers lift their knees off the seat and wiggle their
feet up and down at the ankles. Lifting the thighs off the seat allows blood
to flow back up from the ankles and can reduce swelling.
As part of their campaigns to woo business customers, several airlines have
launched programmes and products to relieve passengers of the physical
inconveniences of travel. Japan Air Lines produces a special drink which it
calls 'Sky Time' - a combination of kiwi juice and royal jelly - which
promises to help passengers 'enjoy their flights in a more relaxed mood and
arrive at their destinations full of energy'. JAL also offers a honeycomb
mask for passengers to wear on their noses and mouths, in order to retain
moisture in the nasal passage.
To keep travellers from stiffening up on the flight, JAL shows on the movie
screens exercises that can be performed in the seats.
British Airways' Well-being in the Air package includes light meals,
suggestions for exercises, 'comfort kits', containing moisturisers and
eye-compresses, and an audio programme to create a 'sense of inner calm'.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: School's out at Allied-Lyons - Jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you train a group of busy part-time workers, of varying ages,
literacy and backgrounds? One way is to let them teach themselves with the
help of a computer.
Allied-Lyons Retailing, part of the UK food and drink group, says it is the
first brewer to introduce on-line, interactive, computer-based training as a
tool to improve service in its pubs, which employ a high percentage of
part-time staff.
More than 20 outlets in London already have the open - or distance -
learning system, and it is intended that by the end of the year it will be
available in all Allied's 2,000 retail outlets.
'It is difficult to get part-time workers together to train,' says Mr
Richard Lowe, the group's head of retail marketing. 'So we have designed a
computer-based system into which staff can dip.'
Individuals signing on to the interactive system are informed about their
group and then offered a number of quizzes over how the best service is
provided. A second package, looking in more detail at health and safety
issues, is to be introduced soon.
Open learning has been used for some years but is now being applied to more
diverse needs. A recent survey found the system - used by employers as
diverse as Rover and Rank Xerox - to be one of the fastest growing forms of
training delivery in the UK.
The reasons for this are fairly simple: it is relatively cheap, compared
with conventional training; it is flexible; and it can provide effective
training without the need for employees to take regular time away from their
workplace.
Employees seem to like it too as it can offer courses that are 'tailor-made'
to their needs. Users range from those requiring basic skills, such as bar
staff, to those wanting to learn complex tasks, such as British
Telecommunications explaining the introduction of a new technical system to
every manager in the country.
BT says: 'Normally this would have meant a day off work to attend a training
session, at a cost of at least Pounds 150 a head. By presenting the
information on a videodisc, which managers could view quickly, locally and
at a convenient time, we reduced the cost of the exercise to Pounds 15 per
manager.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It can lay reasonable claim to being the trendiest magazine in the world.
What New Musical Express and Rolling Stone were to the rise of popular
music, a new US magazine called Wired aims to be for the emerging world of
multimedia. In the 1960s Rolling Stone and NME were essential for young rock
fans who each week bought LPs to play on the mono record players in their
bedrooms. Wired aims to be the essential accessory for a generation brought
up with the personal computer, electronic games and e-mail.
Launched in January last year, with 12 full-time staff and only Dollars
250,000 of capital, Wired's circulation has risen from 150,000 to 230,000
copies a month, mainly in the US.
Its success rests on making the cyberspace world of the computer nerd
accessible to the average consumer. It offers an informed
and exciting guide to the new products, services and businesses which are
being created by the convergence of computers, telecommun-ications and
entertainment.
The magazine's trick is that it approaches this often intimi-dating world
from angles which will satisfy novices and specialists alike. Its apparently
chaotic design borrows heavily from style magazines such as The Face. It has
its very own grammar: each article ends not just with the writer's name, but
also their e-mail address on the Internet networking system. Yet it's not
afraid of being mainstream.
It carries meaty articles which would grace a staid business magazine.
Recent issues have included long pieces about the US government anti-trust
case against Microsoft and the battle between MCI and AT&amp;T in long distance
telecommunications, for instance.
Jane Metcalfe, the magazine's 32-year-old president and co-founder explains:
'We wanted to make a magazine for really modern people living in a digital,
electronic world. All these technologies can allow people to take power
themselves.'
She and her co-founder, Louis Rossetto, spent their savings and almost two
years hawking the project around US publishers before they got their launch
finance. Now they employ 52 people and sell in 26 countries. Wired is also
about to go international in a big way, with a recent deal to start a
Japanese language edition and rapid expansion planned in the UK and
continental Europe.
In the UK, Wired is distributed by CoMag Tel: 0895 444055. By Charles

FT  30 MAY 94 / Sport: Brian Lara - the dream machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So Brian Lara failed, last Friday at Lords, to score his sixth consecutive
century and thus equal the achievement of Don Bradman, CB Fry and Mike
Proctor. Perhaps this was just as well. Otherwise crowds might have started
expecting him to give them a multiple hundred every time he played, and to
break a record a week - not that record breaking is difficult in cricket.
Any one of us could have our wicket smashed first ball as we fail to
scrabble a single and be told, by some Wisden-crazed old buffer in the
commentary box, that ours was the fastest run-out at Edgbaston since Bunny
Legge-Braike was stumped by the Nawab of Pataudi in 1898.
A batsman can play a bad stroke at any time and, for Lara, it was perhaps
better played sooner than later.
His development as a cricketer - for clearly he believes he will improve -
should be a natural process, not forced upon him by the ever-greater
expectations of observers.
And yet one could not help imagining how it would have been if he had scored
that sixth century, the happy sense of awe that would have united those
chilly spectators who were scattered around Lords, waiting to be entranced.
People 'want' Lara to do incredible things. His 'sudden' emergence has had a
miraculous aspect: the best batsman of his generation appeared as if from
nowhere, his name scarcely known, his past untrammelled by years of grind,
his future free to be glamorous and great.
To the English, whose own cricketers seem so shambolic, so wildly
unpredictable - if only they'd be bad all the time, one sometimes finds
oneself thinking, instead of merely 80 per cent of it - Brian Lara
represents a glorious and simple certainty.
There might be an inward throb of pique, in the heart concealed behind the
MCC tie, that it is not an English player who is being gloriously and simply
certain. Essentially, though, Lara is the type of sportsman that transcends
nationalism. It was hard to admire the Pakistani bowlers who, for all their
dazzle, seemed full of spite; but Lara smiles politely at each inept ball as
he sweeps it towards the sun, and displays a demeanour as impeccable as his
cricket. No superfluous aggression communicates itself. Winning seems more
like the incidental reward of genius than the supreme intention.
And so it is that, perhaps almost as much as West Indians, English cricket
lovers see themselves in Lara. They see in him an understanding, as
intrinsic as their own, of the game's inexplicable ethos; and they treasure
this for its rarity.
After all, cricket is antithetical to the late 20th century, which is
impatient, restless, egotistical and attuned to the concept of immediate
gratification. In cricket the willingness to wait, to plan, to endure, to
take a wider view, is just as important as the ability to attack; but today
our characters are not formed to win wars of attrition, merely to zap the
enemy as hard and fast as possible. Hence the emergence of the one-day game,
which has infused cricket with a vehemence that should only be part of the
larger scheme.
But Brian Lara is above, or beyond, all this hysterical modernity: for all
his youth and cool, his conduct is of an age when batsman walked and bowlers
did not try to knock your head off. His genius is such that it walks hand in
hand with grace. He is, it would seem, that rare phenomenon: a sportsman who
is totally at ease with his own talent.
With most of them, even the very greatest, one infers the strains, the
sacrifices, the knowledge of the gap that has to be overcome between what
nature has given their bodies and what they want their bodies to do. These
inferences are a large part of what makes sport fascinating to watch: in
them one can read a human drama. Yet occasionally, very occasionally, there
will be a sportsman with what is almost the unconscious facility of a
racehorse. Jesse Owens was probably such a one; perhaps Pele; Don Bradman,
certainly.
This, though, is what Jack Hobbs - another great cricketer, but not in the
racehorse class - said about Bradman: 'The Don was too good. He spoilt the
game because he got hundreds every time he played. . . I don't think we want
to see another one like him.'
Is there then, perhaps, a perfection that annihilates, that almost frightens
because it seems to leave no room for anything more? This is what one
sometimes feels watching Pete Sampras, another racehorse sportsman. Yet at
other times, one exults in the knowledge that the game could be played no
better.
The perfect sportsman negates the competitive element which is essential to
sport; perhaps he also negates the human element. Yet he is a magical figure
in the imaginations of those that watch him. Brian Lara is not, and perhaps
never will be, the 'run-getting machine' that Hobbs called Bradman. But
people have seen in him the image of the perfect sportsman; and, taken
unawares by his smiling genius, by the irruption into the lives of a Boy's
Own hero, the most jaded of observers has begun again to dream.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Where to find the best Chinese meals in London
 -Eating out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Chinese restaurants originated to feed sailors who manned ships
from the Far East. Hence, the first eating houses of this type were along
the Thames.
Today only Chinatown (987 2330), Tai Pan (791 0118), Old Friends (790 5027)
and Young Friends (987 4276) remain in the Limehouse area of London's East
End.
In the interim, Chinese restaurants have spread throughout London. Among the
more expensive are the Oriental in the Dorchester Hotel, W1 (629 8888),
which has a Michelin star, Imperial City in the Royal Exchange, EC3 (626
3437), where Ken Hom the well known American/Chinese chef is consultant,
Poons in the City, EC3 (626 0126) and the Inn of Happiness, St. James's
Court Hotel, SW1 (821 1931).
These are Chinese restaurants at which you can certainly impress business
guests. The service has none of the abruptness that can characterise cheaper
Chinese restaurants but the bill can be the equivalent of that in a top
French or Italian restaurant - Pounds 30 to Pounds 50 per head -
particularly if you are lured into ordering one or more of their
specialities - abalone, shark's fin or a whole Peking duck - or leave the
choice of the menu to the manager. (If you do this, always specify a maximum
price per head.)
The highest concentration of Chinese restaurants is now in London's
Chinatown, an area of the West End delineated by Shaftesbury Avenue to the
north, and Lisle Street to the south, with its borders along Wardour Street
and Charing Cross Road.
The main thoroughfare is the pedestrianised Gerrard Street which boasts a
host of Chinese food shops (including Chinese sweet shops), as well as
several good restaurants, particularly Harbour City (439 7120), London
Chinatown (437 3186) and Lee Ho Fook (439 1829).
The many Chinese restaurants in the area fall into three loose categories.
First, those which offer an extensive lunch and dinner menu. The most
interesting of these are: Fung Shing (437 1539), Mr Kong (437 7341) and
Poons (437 4549) of Lisle Street; Ming in Greek Street (734 2721) and the
Mayflower on Shaftesbury Avenue (734 9207).
Then there are those cavernous restaurants which at lunchtime serve Chinese
dim sum. These tend to be noisy but good value, particularly for
entertaining large groups, as the average price of each dish is low. The New
World in Gerrard Place (734 0396), Cheun Cheng Ku in Wardour Street (437
1398), China Court in the Swiss Centre (424 0108) and Tai Wing Wah in
Newport Place (287 2702) are among the most popular.
Finally, almost all these restaurants offer a 'one dish' meal for the
adventurous but single diner. Try the tiny branch of Lee Ho Fook, in
Macclesfield Street, for a large bowl of duck and noodles or pork and rice
that, with a pot of Chinese tea, will leave change from Pounds 5. Or pay
Pounds 6 at Poons, in Leicester Street (437 1528), for a large earthenware
bowl of steamed rice cooked with eel steaks and black bean sauce. This was
so warm and filling it seemed to dry my very wet feet.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Management: No such thing as a free opera ticket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the weekend they were hobnobbing among the sheep at Glyndebourne. Last
Monday night they were hard at it among the begonias at Chelsea. The season
is upon us when business executives and their contacts get together in
style.
Far from disapproving of all this junketing, I love it. On the - regrettably
few - occasions that I have been on the receiving end of corporate
hospitality, I have had a splendid time. Two weeks ago my husband and I were
taken to Covent Garden by BP. We had good seats and nice champagne and
smoked salmon. It was all most pleasant.
What puzzles me about this hectic entertaining is why companies do it. Why
did Enterprise Oil invite 200 people and their spouses to a private snoop
round Chelsea on Monday, followed by a lavish meal? Why do 300-odd companies
pay up to Pounds 20,000 a year to take a few guests to Glyndebourne? Surely
in this age of sleek and professional management, no one takes decisions
based on Wimbledon tickets or a box at Ascot. Could it be that the season
has become an institutionalised perk for senior directors?
When you ask most companies about their entertaining they will not talk
numbers; in fact they will barely talk at all. Off the record they will
mouth platitudes about building relationships, and point out that the money
from some of these events goes to charity.
Not all companies are so coy. Michael Prideaux, of BAT Industries, provides
the most sensible solution to the puzzle. He says corporate entertaining
works subtly at the margin. There is nothing you can do to persuade an
institutional investor to go on holding your shares. But if you have just
treated them to a nice day out, they may be more willing to hear your side
of the story before flogging them.
I expect he is right. The system works because we are all human. Perhaps I
should think twice before saying anything untoward about BP.
When a woman in a position of power starts making unpopular dec-isions the
chances are that someone will unfairly accuse her of sleeping her way to the
top. Such was the sad fate that last week befell the intelligent and
likeable Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas.
The less said about that incident - or non incident - the better. Yet I
wonder if the sordid story might contain a warning to the business world.
The tabloid press is endlessly fascinated by who is sleeping with whom, and
being fed up with the affairs of MPs it may be shifting its attention
towards commerce. Spottiswoode - who spans the two worlds - could be a first
step.
If businessmen in the past have escaped attention it is not because they are
considered out of bounds - witness Ralph Halpern and his bimbo - but because
they are not well enough known. Now that many of our captains of industry
are becoming increasingly famous (as well as increasingly rich) all the
ingredients for a nice tabloid sex scandal are there. I put it to the editor
of the Sun, who said he couldn't possibly comment. Perhaps that means he'd
love to break a few such stories, but is having a bit of trouble coming up
with any.
While the private lives of executives is a subject for the prurient only,
the same can not be said about their pay. The bad publicity any director can
expect over an immodest rise is doing more to moderate pay rises than any
number of (dubiously independent) committees.
Yet not all those who receive a public flogging deserve it. Take last week's
revelation that Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, has a guaranteed floor
under his basic salary. I can't see anything wrong with that - most of us
assume our base pay will not fall. Of course, bosses' total pay should go up
and down with performance: but the basic salary should be small and fixed
and the bonus generous when the company is doing well; non existent when it
is not.
LIkewise, I can't get too excited about the revelation at Lasmo's AGM last
week that its part-time ex-chairman and deputy chairman were entitled to a
pro-rata payment of Pounds 700 a day if they worked more than a certain
number of days a year. As a part-time worker, I think it is fair to be paid
extra for extra work. I am less sure about whether those gentlemen deserved
such high salaries to start with.
There is something deeply revealing about the way in which people lose,
especially those who are used to winning. Lord Young, chairman of Cable and
Wireless, and Richard Branson of Virgin evidently thought that they were on
to a winner late last year when they smilingly posed with the racehorse
Desert Orchid to launch their bid for the national lottery.
Now that they have lost we are seeing another side of their personalities.
Branson is taking it like a spoilt child, having his picture taken sulking
on the steps of his Holland Park home, and ripping up the fax that bore the
news. Lord Young, in line with his smooth image, has delicately withdrawn
into the background as if nothing had happened.
Full marks, then, to their lobbyist, Des Wilson. According to the inveterate
campaigner, who treats every day as a personal victory, the Branson-Young
bid should not be seen as a failure at all. Their intervention resulted in
other contenders promising to pay more money to charity. And that was the
whole point, right?

FT  30 MAY 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Richard Branson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After losing the competition last week to run the UK's national lottery and
failing to persuade the Radio Authority to create a new FM national
frequency for his pop station, Richard Branson probably needs a spell on a
desert island. He is no stranger to desert island living. Necker in the
Virgin Islands was uninhabitable when he bought it 12 years ago. Now it is
one of the most exclusive retreats in the Caribbean.
What would you need, apart from fax and telephone, to carry on your
business?
'Thoughts of essentials for my occasional weeks of blissful isolation on
Necker would be pretty similar to those I would want as a mythical desert
island manager. I would plead for a global satellite TV system with Sky, CNN
and the BBC World Service. Armed with all that and a stock of trusty black
A4 notebooks, I think I could keep the business under control.
How would you keep your sanity?
'Given that the public relations machine at British Airways wrote me off in
the sanity department at least four years ago, I have long since lost
interest in worrying about the question. As one diversion, I would probably
use my spare notebooks to start a journal and diary of our lives. As another
exercise, I would enforce some sort of physical routine, such as building a
tennis court. It is my favourite sport.'
You can choose one sort of food and one sort of drink, what and why?
'Assuming we have water on the island and that fruit is growing, the two
unmissable essentials would be baked beans and good beer - although it would
be a toss up between beer and champagne.'
And one film?
'It would have to be Borsalino, starring Alain Delon and Jean Paul Belmondo,
it fits the bill. It brings back memories of my teenage years and was a
favourite of both myself and my first partner in business, Nik Powell.'
Which person would choose to accompany you?
'I could not consider life without the family so I have to assume they are
coming. My one other person would be Karl Marx. We both have beards and
moustaches in common and discussions on the merits of capitalism versus
communism would take on a new significance if we both had to work to
survive.'
Which book would you take?
'It would be James Clavell's Tai Pan. I am told it is an interesting novel
and I started it just after Virgin's Hong Kong inaugural flight but have not
had a chance to read it since.
Branson insisted on one final condition for desert island living.
'I would immediately establish a national lottery on our island. It would be
fun, help Karl to understand a bit more about capitalism and, of course,
there would not have to be a competitive tender to win it.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Management: Back to the future - 3M was practising
'empowerment' long before it became fashionable. Martin Dickson on the
company's formidable reputation for innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 3M, the US manufacturing giant, they never tire of telling one another -
and anyone else who will listen - the remarkable story of Richard Drew and
William McKnight.
Drew was an enterprising young 3M laboratory assistant in the early 1920s
who had a great new product idea: a glue-covered paper which would make it
easier for car manufacturers to paint their vehicles without the colours
running.
McKnight, his boss at what was then a humdrum sandpaper manufacturing
business, was unimpressed and suggested he drop the research. Drew persisted
and invented masking tape - the first of the family of Scotch brand sticky
tapes which transformed the fortunes of the business.
A chastened McKnight - who as company president played the crucial role in
forming the company's shape and culture - proclaimed that from now on all 3M
laboratory staff would be free to devote 15 per cent of their time to
research of their own - a guideline that persists to this day.
And in 1941, in a paper spelling out 3M's management philosophy, he declared
that employees must be allowed to perform their work in their own way - a
principle which anticipated by 50 years the current management fashion for
worker 'empowerment'.
People would make mistakes, McKnight declared, but in the long run these
would not be as serious as 'the mistakes management will make if it is
dictatorial and undertakes to tell those under its authority exactly how
they must do their job'.
The tale is of more than historic interest. 3M managers use it frequently
both to explain and reinforce the extraordinarily strong corporate culture
which has made the group one of America's most inventive businesses,
manufacturing more than 60,000 products, ranging from aerosol inhalers to
film, video tape and home cleaning sponges.
'The culture is innovative,' says William Coyne, vice president for research
and development, 'but management has to continue clearly defining that, for
example by revisiting the successes of the past.' It is no accident that a
corporate video sent out this year to subsidiaries around the world opened
by quoting McKnight's 1941 remarks.
3M's inventiveness means that it consistently ranks in surveys of
businessmen as one of the most admired corporations in the US. It was also
prominently featured as one of the country's best-run companies in the early
1980s best seller In Search of Excellence by management guru Tom Peters.
Such accolades, and the pride that accompanies them, can often be the
prelude to a fall - as graphically demonstrated by the management upheaval
over the past two years at struggling IBM, another In Search of Excellence
star.
But over the past decade 3M has quietly kept up its solid growth, without
the fuss, managerial upheaval or vast write-offs common at some big US
corporations, from its headquarters near Minneapolis/St Paul - a land of
freezing winters and hot summers on the edge of the Great Plains which
fosters down-to-earth Mid-western values rather than corporate pretension.
True, its financial results over the past five years have been unexciting,
falling short of its own goal of earnings per share growth averaging at
least 10 per cent a year.
But this is mainly because 3M is a quintessentially cyclical company, whose
earnings rise and fall with the economy of the US - and increasingly that of
the world, since some 50 per cent of its sales are now overseas, up from 37
per cent in the mid-1980s.
As the US economy strengthens, and Europe emerges from recession, analysts
are predicting earnings per share growth of around 8 per cent this year and
16 per cent in 1995.
However, there can be no room for complacency at 3M, which faces two central
management challenges in the 1990s if it is to retain its enviable
reputation.
Intense international competition in most of its markets means that
customers have come to expect excellent service at very low cost, making it
harder for manufacturers to claw back through price increases the impact of
inflation on their manufacturing costs.
This pressure on margins means 3M has to improve constantly its productivity
in manufacturing and distribution, while trying to steal a march on rivals
with the invention of new products which, in the words of R&amp;D chief Coyne,
'change the basis of competition'. As an example, he cites a new kind of
reflective material which 3M says is three times brighter than that
previously used on road signs.
'We have to continue creating,' says Livio DeSimone, the chemical engineer
who has been 3M's chairman and chief executive since November 1991, 'but we
must bring this more efficiently to the hands of the user. This is the hot
topic for us today - and for all those who've got their eyes open and want
to survive.'
Some Wall Street critics argue that 3M has been too slow to cut
manufacturing costs in Europe, where it has been gradually lowering
employment through attrition and early retirement.
But Doug Hanson, who heads the region, points out that forced redundancies
involve particularly heavy severance costs in Europe and drastic cuts in the
workforce are simply not 3M's style.
'We always want to do right by the people that leave, because if you don't,
the rest of your people are going to be concerned.'
Whatever the restructuring record, there can be no doubting 3M's resolve to
keep new ideas coming. For many years it had a target - emulated by several
other large US companies - that at least 25 per cent of its annual sales
must come from products which had been on the market for less than five
years.
But two years ago, in the light of increasing competition, it decided to
raise the bar. Now 30 per cent of sales should come from products less than
four years old. Over 25 per cent did in 1993, and this year 3M hopes to
achieve the new target fully for the first time.
This impressive record is due to several factors. Arguably the most
important is McKnight's cultural legacy. His 15 per cent rule remains an
important company creed (though far from all the group's 8,500 technical
staff spend so much time on their own projects).
One of the group's most celebrated inventions in the 1980s - the Post-it
Notes which people stick to computer screens - was dreamed up by researcher
Art Fry in 15-per-cent time, though he was initially trying to create a hymn
book marker.
Coyne recalls that when he first joined 3M as a junior researcher, 'I became
convinced in less than a day that this was a company which expected me to
make a difference as an individual.'
But the culture also encourages the cross-fertilisation of ideas between
3M's more than 40 business units. Much of this is done through informal
networking, for example through an employee-run technical forum, which runs
a series of lectures by inside and outside speakers.
Technicians are also encouraged to get out and meet customers, on the
grounds that the best ideas - such as Drew's masking tape - come not from
sitting in a laboratory but from identifying unarticulated customer needs.
Cross fertilisation is also reinforced by official bodies, such as 3M's
little-publicised audit teams. Their primary function is to assess the
commercial potential of laboratories' new product programmes. But as they go
round the group they often come across developments in one lab which can be
helpful to another.
There is also a complex system of awards for new ideas, though the company
generally eschews financial bonuses for inventions, on the grounds that
getting them to market involves extremely complex corporate team-work.
The culture is also underpinned by 3M's low turnover among research staff
and the company's insistence on growing top management from within the
company.
3M's R&amp;D effort is hardly flawless. Coyne is concerned about productivity,
noting that R&amp;D spending is 7.3 per cent of group sales, compared with a
target of 6.5 per cent. Other senior officials express concern that
inventiveness could be stifled as the group gets bigger.
But this willingness to engage in self-criticism, and benchmark against
other companies, may be an important reason why 3M is still expanding
healthily, unlike some other corporate superstars of the 1980s.
DeSimone also attributes its lack of complacency to the immense diversity of
its product portfolio, which means it has to compete across an unusually
broad front against top-notch rivals, such as the Japanese in memory media,
Johnson &amp; Johnson in healthcare and Eastman Kodak in film.
'If we have any arrogance we work hard at not retaining that trait,' he
says. 'It's always been a killer in the long run - but it's a very quick
killer these days.'

More than half of employees are bullied at work, usually by one of their
managers, a survey showed yesterday.
Researchers from Staffordshire University, who interviewed more than 1,000
workers, found that 53 per cent said they were victims of bullying.
The survey, carried out for a BBC programme, says the most common forms of
bullying are intimidation and regular public humiliation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rush-hour motorists will this week be urged to leave their cars at home for
at least one journey in five during June.
The move is part of a campaign by the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities.
The campaign, which is backed by the Automobile Association, will be
launched tomorrow by Mr Robert Key, the roads minister.
The association said: 'In the same amount of space used by a car, 45 times
as many people can travel by train, 18 times as many by foot, and
seven-and-a-half times as many by bus.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / GPs see country gripped by stress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is the grip of a 'stress epidemic', with family doctors often taking
over the counselling role of parish priests, according to a report published
yesterday.
A bleak picture of the country's moral and mental well-being is painted in a
survey in the British Medical Association News Review.
A survey of 650 general practitioners shows a nation in which old people are
increasingly left alone, couples are more likely to see divorce as an answer
to marital problems and many young adults find it increasingly difficult to
cope.
More than 80 per cent of doctors said the number of patients looking for
help for stress-related problems had increased significantly over the past
15 years. Nearly half make more psychiatric referrals than in 1979.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Opposition hits at health press office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Health spends enough on public relations to pay for a
small healthcare centre, Labour said yesterday.
Ms Dawn Primarolo, the shadow health minister, said the press office at the
department's Whitehall headquarters employed 14 people at a cost of Pounds
396,108, according to the government's own figures.
She said: 'Despite the fact that the press office is notoriously unhelpful
to journalists it churns out press releases like confetti.'
Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, called on Ms Primarolo to withdraw her
'disgraceful personal attack on the integrity of civil servants.
'This department has one of the smallest press offices of all the major
Whitehall departments, and one of the busiest.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Police call for anti-drugs campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was facing growing pressure yesterday to launch an education
campaign to counter the increasing use of drugs.
But as police chiefs renewed their call for attention to be switched from
supply to demand for drugs, there was a claim of a cabinet split over plans
for a school-based initiative warning of the risks of addiction.
Whitehall moved swiftly to deny any rift between Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, and the education secretary Mr John Patten after a report in The
Mail on Sunday said Mr Patten believed that giving pupils hard-hitting
lessons about the dangers of hard and soft drugs could be
counter-productive.
A joint statement issued by both departments dismissed the report as
'ridiculous and without foundation'.
The denial came as Mr Keith Hellawell, the chief constable of West Yorkshire
and chairman of the chief constables' committee on drugs, stepped up
pressure for government action against the growing demand for drugs.
He told The Sunday Times: 'We've won several battles, but we've lost the
war. The current policy has not stopped young people turning to drugs.'
Mr Hellawell has suggested that cannabis might be legalised at some point as
part of a new approach to drugs.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Tories dismiss prediction on single currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, European Union commissioner, yesterday predicted that the
the EU would back a single European currency and warned that the issue would
not go away.
His comments were immediately contradicted by Conservative Central Office
and Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative MEPs.
Mr John Major's advisers were irritated by the intervention of Sir Leon, the
former Conservative trade and industry secretary, in the middle of the
European elections.
The prime minister said last week he did not believe that a single currency
would come in his lifetime.
In an interview with BBC radio, Sir Leon, external economic affairs
commissioner, said: 'Where people in Britain would make a great mistake is
if they think that it (a single currency) is not going to happen.
'It is going to happen and since the collapse of the exchange rate mechanism
in its old form, the fact is that most of the countries of continental
Europe are keener than ever to go ahead with a single currency.'
Sir Christopher dismissed Sir Leon's predictions, saying the moment for a
single currency had come and gone. He made clear that while the government
was not opposed to the principle of a single currency it was up to the
British parliament to decide if it wanted one. However, he added: 'There
would be difficulty in getting one through parliament because of the
deep-seated opposition to it in the country.'
The Liberal Democrats accused the Tories of being split over the issue,
pointing out that many Conservative MEPs had voted in favour of federalism
in the European parliament.
Sir Christopher pointed out that the Single European Act 1986 had legalised
'super-nationalism' and therefore there was nothing odd that all MEPs had
voted at some stage in favour of federalism 'of one sort or the other'.
Sir Leon said the fact that the rest of the EU was moving towards a single
currency did not mean that Britain had to follow suit. 'But it is important
that we do not think it is going to go away and not happen.'
He denied that there was a need for concern because Britain had the option
of a single currency but not the obligation.
'Britain can decide when it wants whether to join or not join. This is a
genuinely free choice,' he said.
Sir Leon said he was in favour of joining, although this was not a decision
that had to be taken now.
The Conservatives yesterday published a document detailing the support of
Labour MEPs for 'leftwing causes'. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary,
said: 'Socialists in Europe are a threat to British interests, to free
enterprise and to jobs in Britain.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Labour's 1992 campaign 'lost before it was begun'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful challenge to the conventional wisdom that Labour lost the 1992
general election as a result of a last-minute revolt by the electorate
against the party's tax policies has been made by a group of leading
academics.
In the most comprehensive analysis yet produced of the factors which gave
the Conservatives their fourth consecutive election victory, the study casts
serious doubts on the validity of opinion polls taken in the election
campaign.
The analysis concludes instead that Labour had in effect lost the battle
before the election campaign started, and that tactics employed by the main
parties immediately prior to the election had little impact on the outcome.
Turning to Labour's future electoral prospects, the team of academics says
that Labour does not need to be defensive about its tax policies and should
stick firmly to its commitment to preserve and improve the welfare state.
Instead it should focus on its policies for managing the economy. The key to
Labour's success must be to persuade 'a sceptical electorate that it has the
economic as well as the social formula to succeed in office'. The
Conservatives' reputation for economic competence has been seriously eroded
since 1992 but it is not clear how permanent the damage is.
The authors question the traditional judgment that a strong performance by
the Liberal Democrats would damage Labour's chances of forming a government.
Instead a high third party vote would allow Labour to win an overall
majority with no more than 35 per cent of its 1992 vote.
But it warns that an electoral pact would not help Labour because too high a
proportion of Liberal Democrat voters prefer the Conservatives to Labour.
The study was produced by the Centre for Research into Elections and Social
Trends and edited by a team of election specialists including Mr Anthony
Heath, Mr Roger Jowell and Mr John Curtice.
It says the root cause of Labour's electoral failure has been a sharp fall
over the past 20 years in the number of voters who instinctively identify
with the party. In 1970 they constituted 42 per cent of the electorate. In
1992 the proportion was 34 per cent.
The main cause of the erosion was Labour's lurch to the left and the split
with the SDP in the early 1980s. By contrast the proportion of the
electorate which identifies itself as Conservative remained remarkably
constant at 42 per cent.
Basing its conclusions on detailed interviews with a carefully weighted
sample of voters both before and after the 1992 election, the study says
that the Conservatives started the campaign at least six points ahead of
Labour.
Any late swing was therefore much too small to make any significant
difference to the outcome. The study also explodes the myth that the Tory
tabloid newspapers won the election for Mr John Major. Conservative support
among readers of the Tory tabloids fell three points during the election
campaign while it rose one point among readers of the Labour-supporting
Daily Mirror.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Conservatives win few points in opening round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first week of full campaigning has brought no comfort to the
Conservatives. Every poll and every further analysis of its implications
must have lowered any hope of a respectable performance for the government.
The nationwide polls show no response to the better economic news. The
simple 'How will you vote?' questions reveal no trend.
But the bad news for the Conservatives lies in two factors concealed in
these simple nationwide figures.
The swing has been different in different regions: the Conservatives have
slumped most in the south and 28 of the 32 Euro-seats now held by the
Conservatives are below the line from the Severn to the Wash. One MORI
calculation shows the polls pointing to Labour winning 66 seats, leaving the
Tories with 15 and the Liberal Democrats with three. However, when regional
variation in swing is allowed for, the figures change to Labour taking 69
seats and the Conservatives only six - behind the Liberal Democrats' nine.
Even in the residual six Conservative seats, some seem too near the margin
for there to be any certainty about the outcome.
The Guardian interpretation of its poll is no less depressing for the
Conservatives. Allowing for regional variations, Mr John Curtice of
Strathclyde University suggests that the Conservatives will take only six
seats of the 83 shared by the three main parties, to Labour's 65 and the
Liberal Democrats' 12.
Neither of these polls makes much allowance for turnout, which could be
about 40 per cent. A great deal, therefore, depends on who gets to the
polling booths on June 9. Moreover, neither poll takes into account the
impact of last-minute tactical voting.
The local elections showed that an increasing number of Labour voters are
ready to switch to the Liberal Democrats if that will defeat the Tories. A
smaller number of Liberal Democrats will vote Labour where it makes sense
locally.
Polls have, of course, not been confined to voting intentions. They show
that the public, while not nearly as fearful as arch-sceptic Tories Mr
William Cash and Lord Tebbit would have us to believe, still rejects
overwhelmingly the idea of a federal Europe, and more narrowly opposes a
common currency.
The Conservatives naturally are playing on these fears but there is no sign
that they are winning further votes. The main reason is that European issues
are so low in popular importance compared with full employment, law and
order and the health service.
For poll-watchers the most innovative surveys this week involved the Labour
leadership. MORI and ICM have both found Mr Tony Blair well ahead among both
the general public and among those who vote Labour.
But, much more importantly, an ICM telephone survey among levy-paying trade
unionists with votes in the leadership race showed that their preferences
were much the same as those of the rest of the population.
Since inquiries among MPs and constituency activists - admittedly more
dubious as sample surveys - yield very similar findings, a Blair victory for
the leadership looks almost as certain as a Labour victory for Strasbourg.
But perhaps the most interesting poll of the week was the most amateur.
A survey carried out on behalf of a local newspaper in Eastleigh, Hampshire
 -where the by-election takes place simultaneously with the Euro-vote -
found the Liberal Democrats leading Labour by two to one, with the
Conservatives in third place - in a seat which they won with a majority of
17,000 at the 1992 general election.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Noraid defiance fails to move US Justice Department
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noraid, an organisation once stigmatised as the Irish Republican Army's main
fundraising arm in the US, is openly defying a court order to file regular
reports with the US Justice Department in Washington.
However, officials at the department said Noraid is no longer of concern -
they describe it as 'moribund' - and they are prepared to turn a blind eye
to its failure to file.
Under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act, Noraid has been required since
the mid 1970s to give details of its fundraising activities at least twice a
year because it has the IRA as its principal foreign agent.
But Noraid has not filed with the department for three years. The last
recorded file covers the 12 months ending July 1991 and is incomplete.
Mr Martin Galvin, a lawyer and Noraid's spokesman, said the organisation's
leadership has no affiliation or relationship with the IRA. Its sole purpose
is to contribute funds to families of political prisoners and to lobby in
the US in support of a united Ireland.
In an interview in New York, Mr Galvin said: 'We don't believe we are
required to register under law. We are not agents of the IRA. We are
Americans who under the US constitution's First Amendment have the right to
express our views on Ireland.'
A similar assertion by the previous leadership of Noraid led to a long legal
battle in the late 1970s between the organisation and the Justice
Department. In 1981, it resulted in a judicial decree confirming Noraid's
links with the IRA.
Thirteen years later, the Justice Department has no plans to take Noraid to
court over its apparent defiance. Officials argue that to do so would risk
generating renewed support for the organisation when its finances are
dwindling.
Justice Department officials said they had not carried out a formal audit on
Noraid's accounts since the mid 1970s.
But British and Irish officials share the US perception of Noraid's
weakness. Their view stems from the continued monitoring of organisations
and individuals sympathetic to the Irish republican cause by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, working in co-operation with the British security
and intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6. There has also been increasing
co-operation between British and Irish diplomats in the US.
Within that shared pool of information, present estimates say the
fundraising effort has dipped from a high of nearly Dollars 1m a year during
the hunger strikes in the early 1980s to between Dollars 100,000 and Dollars
200,000.
In the last accounts filed at the Justice Department, Noraid claimed it had
raised Dollars 1.8m (Pounds 1.19m) in the 12 months to July 1991. Government
officials said the figure was artificially inflated to mask the financial
weakness of republican groups in the US.
Senior investigators, however, accept that the IRA's US link has not
evaporated. They suspect that some money still continues to find its way to
the IRA by more elaborate means such as money-laundering.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Ashdown sets out sovereignty stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday said he did not
believe in the sovereignty of parliament.
He said the Liberal Democrat party was the only one willing to let the
British people decide their future in the European Union and he offered a
referendum in the event of a further shift of power from Britain to Brussels
at the 1996 inter-governmental conference.
Mr Ashdown said in an interview with GMTV: 'There is this great theory that
sovereignty lies in parliament. I do not believe in the sovereignty of
parliament. I never have. I believe in the sovereignty of the people.'
He said he would have wanted a referendum on a single European currency but
the decision had already been taken that this should be decided by a future
parliament. 'But if (the single currency) were to come I cannot see any
circumstances it would be in British interests to be outside it,' he added.
Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats could well recommend a change in the
balance of power between Westminster and Brussels because 'it gives us more
security and better cost-effectiveness for money spent on defence'.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said: 'Paddy Ashdown keeps letting
the rat out of the bag - and the British people should take note.
'The Liberals are wholly committed to a centralised European superstate.
Only the Conservatives stand for a strong Britain at the heart of a strong
and diverse Europe.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Currie aims for 200 handshakes an hour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to make Mrs Edwina Currie angry, tell her that she will probably
lose to Labour in next week's European election contest for Bedford and
Milton Keynes. 'What?' cried the Tory ex-minister, banging the dashboard of
a battle-bus taking her around dozens of industrial estates in the heart of
the constituency. ' 'Lose' is not a word in my vocabulary, dear. I am here
to win, and win is what I am going to do.'
Mrs Currie, bane of the British egg industry, author of a schlock novel and
one of the most talked-about Tory MPs at Westminster, is running for the
European parliament with the sort of determination normally seen only at
British general elections.
In the run-up to the June 9 poll she is undertaking an exhaustive programme
of 13-hour-a-day whistle-stop tours around Luton, Milton Keynes and rural
Bedfordshire.
Her plan is to meet 200 voters an hour; her means a bus driven by keen but
frazzled helpers in 'Edwina for Europe' sweatshirts. And her goal is to be
one of the few MPs who believe that moving from Westminster to Brussels is a
career move upwards.
The cynics say that Mrs Currie wants to be an MEP just to remain in
political life. The boundaries of her Westminster constituency of Derbyshire
South are being redrawn, making that seat a Labour marginal. She is 47 and
her career at Westminster has probably peaked.
The cynics also say it will be a miracle if she wins this newly created
Euro-seat. The Conservatives would have had a tiny majority here of 3,000 at
the 1989 election. With Mr John Major's government plunging in the opinion
polls, Labour is confident of victory.
Yet there is little doubt that Mrs Currie's ambition is driven by real
passion for Europe. She echoes statements made over the past few years when
she says 'the European parliament is getting to be far more important'. She
plans to quit her Westminster seat at the next election if she gets to
Brussels. 'I get out of bed in the morning to fight Socialism and the real
battle is taking place in Europe,' she told the Sunday Times two years ago.
Unlike many Tory MPs, she is also deeply committed to European integration
and has always claimed to be European. 'The basic idea of Europe was to set
up a level playing field,' she said. 'But, in a number of areas - energy,
transport, telecoms - the single market does not exist yet.'
She has a clear interest in extending Europe's scope to legislate on social
and family issues. Having campaigned for the age of consent for homosexuals
to be lowered to 16 in the UK, she would concentrate on extending the
European pregnancy rights directive.
Mrs Currie, if elected, would devote a large part of her time selling Europe
to the British public. She believes the Tory split over Britain's place in
the EU reflects public uncertainty on the issue. 'I can really use my
position to encourage the British to be more pro-European,' she said.
The media focus on the Tory candidate infuriates Mrs Currie's Labour and
Liberal Democrat rivals, Ms Eryl McNally and Ms Monica Howes. They believe
that her hectic campaigning will come to nought because of the government's
difficulties. But some Labour campaigners fear that their vote could be
split with the Liberal Democrats, allowing the Tories a slim victory.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Call for merger of all Co-op retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for Co-operative retailers to merge into a single national
organisation, which would be one of the UK's largest retailers with annual
turnover of Pounds 7bn, was made at the Co-operative Congress.
Speaking in the 150th year of the co-operative movement and in its
birthplace - Rochdale - Mr Hughie Todner, congress president, backed calls
for co-operative societies to join forces.
He said the 41 remaining societies should come together in a new
Co-operative Consumer Partnership. The Co-op's financial institutions, the
Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative Bank, should also merge.
'The combined resources and enterprise of these organisations could forge
new horizons in co-operation which could reach new heights of excellence,'
he said.
His call is likely to increase the pressure on the movement's two largest
retailers, Co-operative Retail Services and the Co-operative Wholesale
Society, which are in merger negotiations. A merger would form a group with
annual sales of Pounds 3bn, making it the UK's seventh-largest retailer. The
last attempt to merge the two groups failed in 1990 when they could not
agree on the composition of the board. But both groups are hopeful of
success this time.
Analysts say a merger is the only way for co-operative retailers to compete
effectively in a mature grocery market increasingly dominated by large
quoted companies such as J Sainsbury and Tesco.
The CWS has absorbed a number of smaller regional societies in recent years,
and has formed a buying and distribution partnership - the Co-operative
Retail Trading Group - with several others.
Mr Todner said that a national partnership would create greater financial
rewards for members and staff but it was important to safeguard the
movement's system of democratic control.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Doubt cast on efficacy of local pay bargaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubt is being cast on the effectiveness of decentralised pay bargaining in
holding down pay rises, as an employers' organisation warned the government
that workers still expect their pay rises to exceed inflation.
Decentralisation of pay decisions in the 1980s helped employers control
costs during the recession but may increase the danger of pay inflation as
the economy improves, says an article today in the magazine Personnel
Management.
Mr John Stevens, the Institute of Personnel Management's director of
professional policy, and Mr Peter Ingram, a lecturer in economics at Surrey
University, say that increasing numbers of employers regard wage costs as a
small proportion of their total costs, and as a result there is the chance
that all employers will be happy to increase wages by more than the previous
average. 'If that happens the average will rise a lot faster than anyone
thought.'
While they say there are good reasons to suppose that increased competitive
pressures on UK companies will keep pay inflation low, they say:
'Decentralisation of pay determination, which has done so much to improve
cost control in the downturn could, in the upturn, provide fertile ground
for pay escalation.'
A second report, based on a survey of 79 employers' associations, suggests
that relatively centralised, industry-wide pay bargaining helps to limit pay
increases by avoiding 'leap-frogging'. Seventy-four per cent of employer
bodies are of this opinion, according to the survey by independent analysts
Industrial Relations Services, also published today.
In another analysis of recent trends in pay bargaining Mr Robbie Gilbert,
director of employment affairs at the Confederation of British Industry,
took issue with the claim of some government ministers that the
'inflation-plus' pay mentality was dead.
In a speech at Warwick University he said: 'We are not convinced that the
RPI-plus mentality has been defeated, though it has undoubtedly been knocked
a bit by the decentralisation of pay determination and recession.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Managers volunteer surplus expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British managers in the caring '90s like nothing more after a hard day at
work than to start managing again, it seems - but this time for no pay and
to help others.
The image of do-gooding managers has emerged from a survey published today
of 3,000 members of the Institute of Management.
More than half of the 857 managers who replied to the survey say they
undertake some form of voluntary work in the community. Two-thirds of those
who do not carry out community work say they would like to.
The main constraint cited is lack of time, particularly among younger
managers. The typical volunteer, says the report, is a male senior manager
in his fifties.
Their motives appear pure as well. Only one in 10 managers surveyed admits
that he or she is seeking to make social or business contacts. Most say they
volunteer from a sense of social responsibility and a feeling of
satisfaction from helping others.
One in four of the managers who do voluntary work is helping a charity.
Other activities include serving as school and college governors and as
trustees of charities, housing associations and health bodies, and
involvement with youth groups and heritage societies.
A quarter spend more than six hours a week on voluntary work and 80 per cent
receive no payment.
Mr Roger Young, the institute's director-general, said: 'This report shows
there is such a thing as a caring society after all.
'Britain's managers clearly do care about their communities and are prepared
to help by giving freely of their time and skills.'
He suggested that employers could allow managers more time to undertake such
work.
The expansion of the voluntary sector, including the creation of Training
and Enterprise Councils, housing action trusts and grant-maintained schools,
is creating increasing demand for good managers.
The survey says there is untapped potential among younger managers, many of
whom support the principle of giving their time and skills free of charge.
The report, published jointly with the Local Government Management Board -
the employers' body - says there is a need for some kind of brokering
service to match managers with voluntary opportunities.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Church joins backlash over beggars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England yesterday criticised the prime minister's remarks on
beggars being an 'eyesore'.
The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev David Sheppard, said: 'I find it a very
unlovely feature of public life when people in power pick on the most
despised groups in society rather than asking what the causes are.'
Dr Sheppard, chairman of the Church of England's Board for Social
Responsibility, told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: 'Politicians really
have a responsibility not to mix up different issues.'
He accepted that benefit fraud should be tackled and aggressive tramps
reported to the police. 'But that is a tiny handful of cases and it is being
used to justify a most draconian attack on very vulnerable people,' he
added.
Mr Major's comments have already been attacked by the opposition parties and
charity groups dealing with the homeless. A study to be published this week
by the homelessness charity Crisis says that one in four single homeless
people has served in the forces and a high proportion of them are sleeping
rough.
The report, Falling Out, warns that the number of ex-service personnel on
the streets could grow as the government implements large-scale
redundancies.
It says ex-service personnel are more disadvantaged than other homeless
people because of the shock of leaving an ordered life.

school term, according to data released to unions by local education
authorities and schools.
By law, schools have to give notice to staff and unions of the potential
number of redundancies for the following academic year by the end of May. An
analysis of these formal notices in 34 local authorities by the Association
of Teachers and Lecturers shows that 1,732 teachers are under threat of
redundancy. If this pattern is repeated across all 115 local education
authorities, about 5,000 teachers are under threat.
Not all schools which have made an official warning will necessarily cut
jobs but the figures suggest that budgets are coming under strain.
The association suggested that few areas were experiencing falling rolls.
Instead, it believed that this year's pay increase for teachers of 2.9 per
cent, which schools were required to meet from internal efficiency savings,
had led head teachers to consider shedding staff.
Added pressures on funding targeted at schools with high numbers of ethnic
minorities and the growing number of temporary contracts offered to staff
were also held to blame.
Mr Peter Smith, association general secretary, claimed that teachers' jobs
were being threated by inadequate government funding.
More than 100 further education colleges will be hit by strikes next month,
the Natfhe lecturers' union said at its annual conference in Southport,
Merseyside, yesterday.
The union is in dispute with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over new which
were unveiled in May last year. It has abandoned national negotiations and
is discussing contracts with individual colleges.
Natfhe has announced an agree-ment with Manchester College of Art and
Technology to introduce a new contract allowing a six-week holiday each
summer and guaranteeing limits on teaching hours and the working week.
Natfhe said it was confident that the contract would satisfy the criteria
for flexibility laid down by the Further Education Funding Council for
England, the quango which controls funding for the sector.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Overgrazing penalties run into rough pasture: Why farmers
and conservationists are attacking the change in subsidy rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Withdrawing subsidies from farmers who wreak havoc with the countryside
might seem to be a popular measure for a government to adopt when it is
having a rough ride with the electorate.
But the government's plans for the 'greening' of sheep and cattle subsidies
 -reducing or withholding them if land is being grazed too heavily - have
run into difficulties, not just with farmers but also with conservationists.
The proposals, on which a government decision is expected soon, are the
biggest attempt so far to attach environmental conditions to agricultural
payments.
They would apply to Pounds 690m in annual subsidies to livestock farmers for
19m sheep and 3.2m cattle and would take effect between July and January.
Government officials, following a tricky path through the thicket of
objections, insist that subsidies will only be withheld in extreme cases and
that only about 2 per cent of farmers 'causing serious environmental damage'
are likely to be affected.
But in a nod to the environmentalists they say the measures should halt
damage to heather moorland by making it uneconomic for farmers to crowd too
many animals on their land.
The National Farmers' Union opposes the plans on the grounds that farm
businesses will bear the brunt of a potentially open-ended measure to
protect the environment that costs the Treasury nothing.
It argues that farmers will be put at a competitive disadvantage to their
European counterparts who do not face similar restrictions. The regulations,
agreed by EU agriculture ministers in December and January, are optional and
the government admits that other member states are unlikely to adopt them.
A further problem, according to the union, is the imprecise definition of
overgrazing.
Mr Andrew Clark, countryside and forestry policy adviser, said:
'Environmental groups claim that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of heather
moorland is overgrazed, while the government claims overgrazing is very
rare. For farmers this gives great uncertainty for such an important state
aid.'
Previous experience appears to support the government's claim that few
farmers will be affected by the new rules. Restrictions on overgrazing were
attached in 1992 for the first time to special payments of slightly more
than Pounds 100m to livestock farmers in particularly difficult upland
country.
The problem of ascertaining that overgrazing is persistent means that only
15 farmers, mainly in the south-west, have so far had payments withheld.
Nonetheless, the union argues that farmers should not be penalised for a
change in policy in favour of the environment. Mr Clark said: 'Farmers have
been told for years that keeping more sheep is good. Now they're being told
they'll be punished for keeping so many sheep.'
He said that rather than withdrawing subsidies for every excess sheep or
bullock the government should convert the money into payments based on the
size of the farm and make these payments conditional on the farmer 'looking
after the countryside'.
He added: 'We're looking for a more sustainable agricultural system, and
this debate is a small part of how we achieve that. The question is, who
pays and is it possible for farmers to take environmental requirements on
board in a profitable manner?'
The government's move follows its pledge in January to integrate
environmental considerations into agricultural policy.
Environmental groups praise the government for leading the way in the EU but
argue the measures will do little to reverse the damage caused by intensive
farming.
Mr Paul Wynne of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said the
livestock proposals were 'a totally inadequate response to the environmental
problems in the countryside'.
The environmental pressure group wants the Pounds 1.4bn in annual production
subsidies to arable and livestock farmers to be converted into payments for
positive management of the countryside.
The Worldwide Fund for Nature argues that paying subsidies to livestock
farmers according to the size of their land rather than the number of
animals would encourage less intensive farming. It also wants damage to
woodlands to be included in the definition of overgrazing.
Ms Gail Murray, the lobby group's countryside officer, said: 'The
implementation of the regulation should be refocused, with the financial
penalties made far stronger, to ensure environmental protection rather than
to limit environmental damage once it has occurred.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Court reforms could cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of going to court and the time taken to deal with civil cases in
England and Wales could be cut sharply by wide-ranging reforms being
considered under a government review.
The Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday that Lord Justice Woolf, who
is heading the inquiry, has proposed that civil actions should be made
simpler, cost ceilings imposed, and control of civil cases taken from
lawyers so that people can represent themselves more easily.
He has also backed firm timetables for cases to be heard.
The radical changes would allow potential litigants to know in advance what
chances of success their actions would have, what they would cost, and how
long they were likely to last.
The changes were 'long overdue', said Mr Gareth Williams, former chairman of
the Bar. The legal process had shifted from being 'servant to master',
because of 'cost, length and uncertainty'.
Lord Woolf was put in charge of the review by Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the
Lord Chancellor. His report is expected in about two years, but proposals
could be put into effect quickly since in most cases they would not require
changes to the law.
Under Lord Woolf's proposals, if the courts were put in control of the civil
system legal aid could be given to more people as the cost of each case
would be cheaper. Courts would decide which legal route each case would take
and which timetable would apply.
New 'procedural judges' could take charge of High Court and County Court
cases at an early stage. Important and complicated cases would be handled by
these courts; others would be settled by arbitration where possible.
Most cases could be settled in a year under the reforms. One way to save
time would be to cut down on the volume of documents disclosed before
trials.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Overgrazing damages heather moorland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Overgrazing is damaging heather moorland across most of the uplands of
England, says English Nature, the government's statutory adviser on nature
conservation.
Large amounts of heather moorland have been lost since the 1940s because of
sheep grazing, a survey by scientists at English Nature has found. In
Cumbria, about 36 per cent of upland heather had disappeared by the late
1980s. The same percentage of heather moorland was lost in the Northern Peak
District between 1913 and 1979, most of it since the 1940s.
While birds and rare plants are also affected, heather is a good test
because it grows in a noticeably different way when overgrazed. The young
heather plant spreads outwards, like a carpet, instead of growing upwards.
If overgrazing persists in upland areas the whole heather coverage shrinks
up the slopes of the hills. In more undulating country, it thins out and
becomes more sparse.
Ms Jayne Manley, agricultural ecologist with English Nature, said: 'With
overgrazing, you move from a mix of grass, dwarf shrub and sedge to just
grass and sedge. It's pretty boring to look at and doesn't provide many
nutrients, so getting the mix right is good for us as well as the farmers.'
The heaviest concentrations of grazing animals - deer, rabbits and wild
ponies, as well as sheep and cattle - occur in Cumbria, the Pennines and
south-west England.

FT  30 MAY 94 / More data points to stable spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures from Barclaycard seem to confirm the picture of consumers shrugging
off last month's tax and National Insurance increases to resume a stable
pattern of spending.
The statistics reinforce the pattern apparently emerging of a return to
consistent levels of spending following a slight dip immediately after
people received the first monthly pay packets showing the greater
deductions.
On April 26 the amount processed by Barclaycard stood at 120 per cent of the
amount processed on the equivalent day in 1993. The cumulative total for the
period since then, comparing it with the equivalent number of days in 1993,
dropped back to 106 per cent by May 6.
Since then, however, the cumulative total for the period has remained steady
at about 109 per cent as the period covered has extended to cover each of
the past 10 or so days.
The amounts processed by Barclaycard on any given day reflect spending in
the day or so immediately before.
While the percentage increase in turnover of about 9 per cent is greater
than the 6 per cent to 8 per cent increase in weekly turnover which set the
pattern after the tax increases were announced in the November Budget, it is
still somewhat lower than the equivalent figures for last summer.
Those suggested that expenditure using Barclaycard - which has the largest
share of the UK credit-card market - was running at about 12 per cent higher
than during the same months in 1992.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Call to merge co-operative retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Co-operative retailers should merge into a single national organisation,
which would be one of the UK's largest retailers with annual turnover of
Pounds 7bn, the Co-operative Congress was told.
Speaking in the 150th year and in the birthplace of the co-operative
movement - Rochdale, greater Manchester - Mr Hughie Todner, president of the
congress, backed calls for co-operative societies to join forces.
He said the 41 remaining societies should come together in a new
Co-operative Consumer Partnership. The Co-op's financial institutions, the
Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative Bank, should also merge.
'The combined resources and enterprise of these organisations could forge
new horizons in co-operation which could reach new heights of excellence,'
he said.
His call is likely to increase the pressure on the movement's two largest
retailers, Co-operative Retail Services and the Co-operative Wholesale
Society, which are in negotiations after the CRS launched a new proposal for
a merger of the two earlier this month.
That would form a group with annual sales of Pounds 3bn, making it the UK's
seventh-largest retailer, and is seen as a first step towards a single
co-operative organisation.
The latest of three attempts to merge the two groups failed in 1990 when
they could not agree on the composition of the board. But both groups are
hopeful of success this time, and changes in their structure in the past
four years could make agreement easier.
Analysts say a merger is the only way for co-operative retailers to compete
effectively in a mature grocery market increasingly dominated by large
quoted companies such as J Sainsbury and Tesco.
The CWS has absorbed a number of smaller regional societies in recent years,
and has formed a buying and distribution partnership - the Co-operative
Retail Trading Group - with several others.
Mr Todner told the congress that a national partnership would create greater
financial rewards for members and staff, but it was important to safeguard
the movement's system of democratic control.
'A Co-operative Consumer Partnership must ensure that the ordinary
rank-and-file members are given an opportunity of playing a positive role in
the success of their society, and where accountability is in the controlling
hands of its local members,' he said.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Robin Cook possible candidate for Labour leadership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, yesterday refused to
rule himself out as a candidate for the party leadership.
He told the BBC that his document on training and competitiveness, to be
published on Thursday, would contain measures aimed at preventing hostile
takeovers and encouraging companies to reinvest more and pay out less in
dividends to shareholders.
Mr Cook said: 'You need a government that's prepared to intervene to give
those companies protection against takeovers, so they can then do what is
right, which is to invest in the company.
'In the long run if these companies invest, the shares will be worth more.
The return to the owners will be better. That's why despite the lower
dividends in Japan and Germany the shareholders do better.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Unity ticket urged for Labour poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint ticket of Mr Tony Blair and Mrs Margaret Becket was being promoted
within the Labour party yesterday as three potential candidates for the
leadership outlined their vision for a future Labour government.
The latest opinion poll shows overwhelming support for Mr Blair, shadow home
secretary, to become leader and for Mrs Beckett to retain the deputy
leadership.
While colleagues close to Mr Blair say he may decide not to nominate a
running mate, pressure is building within the party for the two
front-runners to join forces in the interests of 'party unity'. One centrist
Labour MP said: 'Mr Blair and Mrs Beckett may not have spoken about the idea
of forming a joint ticket but that does not mean they should not run in
tandem in the interests of the party.'
The poll, compiled by BBC 1's On The Record programme, included all three
elements of the electoral college of MPs and MEPs, levy-paying trade
unionists and constituency party members. It showed Mr Blair with 48 per
cent against 17 per cent for Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.
More than 40 per cent want Ms Beckett to continue as deputy leader. Of those
who do not, only 14 per cent support her nearest rival, Mr John Prescott,
the party's employment spokesman.
Although the contest is not due to start until after the European elections
on June 9, a number of Labour MPs and advisers were privately arguing that
Mr Blair and Mrs Beckett were looking unbeatable.
However, friends of Mr Brown dismissed talk of a Blair/Beckett bandwagon,
pointing out that only last week leadership speculation at Westminster had
linked Mr Brown with Mrs Beckett. They also dismissed reports that Mr Brown
was thinking of withdrawing from the contest.
Mr Brown yesterday used a European election campaign rally to call for 'a
fairness agenda' in his vision for a Labour government. He said: 'It is time
for a new war on poverty, an assault on inequality and an attack on the
unfairness that disfigures our society, in the interests not only of social
cohesion but economic efficiency.' He also called for fair taxes, fair wages
and childcare to prevent women from having to choose between their children
and their jobs.
Labour last night announced a shortlist of three candidates for the
Monklands East seat of John Smith, its late leader. The final choice will be
made at a selection meeting on Thursday.
The three shortlisted candidates are: Ms Helen Liddell, a former secretary
of the Labour party in Scotland; Mr Tom McCabe, leader of Hamilton district
council; and Mr Ian Smart, a former member of Labour's Scottish executive.

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sacked his prime minister yesterday and took

crisis, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
The ruling Revolution Command Council (RCC) said the change was needed
because of the 'unjust (UN) embargo and the need for special effort on
economic issues to protect the living standards of the people'.
Prime Minister Ahmed Hussein Khudayyir was sacked after the Iraqi dinar
plunged to new lows. There were no other big changes in the cabinet, but it
was reported that Mr Saddam would have three deputy prime ministers.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Liberal edges ahead in Colombian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Colombia's presidential elections were set last night to go into a second
round, with preliminary returns suggesting the Liberal party candidate, Mr
Ernesto Samper, had a slight lead over his nearest rival.
With 67 per cent of the vote counted, Mr Samper had 45.6 per cent of the
vote and his leading rival, Mr Andres Pastrana of the Conservatives, 44.3
per cent. Because neither polled 50 per cent, a second round will be held on
June 19.
Election day was relatively calm, following an election campaign that has
not so far been marred by the violence of the previous presidential election
campaign in 1990, when three presidential candidates were killed. However,
abstention was high. In some polling stations fewer than 40 per cent of
those eligible to vote bothered to turn out.
A record 18 candidates stood for the presidency, each for the first time
with a vice-president on the ballot. However, the Liberal and Conservative
parties, which have dominated Colombian politics since the 19th century,
continued to do so.
The former guerrilla movement, M-19 - which blossomed briefly as an
alternative democratic force before being co-opted into the establishment -
looked set for third place. Mr Antonio Navarro, who won more than 12 per
cent of the vote in 1990, had polled 4 per cent of the vote according to the
preliminary returns.
Voter apathy has been blamed in part on the great similarities perceived
between the programmes of both leading candidates. Mr Samper, 43, has
already fought one election to win the Liberal candidacy. He has campaigned
for a softening of the economic modernisation programme. He has emphasised
job creation, raising social investment to 15 per cent of GDP and
subsidising agriculture, much which has been hit by lower tariffs.
Mr Pastrana, 39, a former television presenter, senator and mayor of Bogota,
also stresses social investment and education but gives the private sector a
strong role in his proposals. Mr Pastrana appears to have won support from
younger voters, and from a high proportion of women.

<TEXT>
President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, after less than four months in
office, reorganised his cabinet at the weekend, appointing Mr Carlos
Bernardez to head the country's stalled privatisation programme. Mr
Bernardez worked for many years as president of Banco de Venezuela, one of
the country's largest and strongest banks.
By naming a respected private-sector figure to head the programme, Mr
Caldera hopes to convince private investors it is serious about selling
state-owned assets.
The government suffered a serious setback on May 20 when it failed to obtain
any tenders for the sale of a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, which was its
highly publicised first effort at privatisation.
Aside from Aeropostal, the government has a long list of companies scheduled
for privatisation, including three electric power companies, a group of
hotels and joint ventures in heavy industry.
Of the seven cabinet changes, the only other new face is Mr Alfredo Gruber,
who takes over as state minister in charge of the CVG (Corporacion
Venezolana de Guayana), the government-controlled group that includes steel
and aluminium producers, mining companies and the country's largest
hydroelectric power concern.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Daring vision or time bomb: A huge dam planned for Sarawak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jungle light quickly fades. The rain pounds like a hundred machine guns
on the roof of the Long Murum longhouse. The men, descendants of Borneo's
headhunters, their arms and legs covered in tattoos, sit round a flickering
kerosene lamp. They chew betel nut and drink rice wine. Talk is of change
and development.
Here, in the heart of Sarawak, East Malaysia, plans are under way for
South-East Asia's biggest infrastructure project - a MDollars 15bn (Pounds
3.85bn) dam nearly twice the height of the Aswan dam in Egypt.
The dam, at Bakun a few miles downstream from Long Murum, will flood an area
larger than Singapore. Long Murum and 14 other tribal longhouses will
disappear. More than 8,000 tribespeople whose families have lived and hunted
in the area for generations will be resettled.
To some, Bakun is another example of Malaysia's confidence in the future and
a tribute to the daring vision of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 'It's a
project whose time has come,' said Dr Mahathir earlier this year.
To others Bakun is an ill conceived scheme of doubtful economic merit which
could bring environmental disaster to one of the world's few remaining areas
of tropical rainforest and sound the death knell for a unique tribal
culture. 'It will be an ecological time bomb sitting right in the centre of
Borneo,' says Mr Sim Kwang Yang, a Sarawak-based opposition MP.
Bakun has been discussed for 14 years but only recently given the go-ahead
by the government. Producing 2,400MW of electricity by early next century,
the government says Bakun will not only meet the needs of Malaysia's fast
industrialising economy. It will also turn Malaysia into a regional power
exporter.
Bakun poses considerable technical challenges. It is being built at a site
more than 500km upriver from Sarawak's coast. The journey to Bakun involves
crossing a number of treacherous rapids. New roads will have to be built
through dense jungle to bring in building materials and engineering
equipment.
Taking the power out of Bakun will involve even greater difficulties. Some
of the electricity generated will go to Sarawak itself and to the
neighbouring Malaysian state of Sabah. However, the bulk of the power will
go to peninsular Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak
and then through 650km of cables under the South China Sea.
Experts point out that power transmission through such a lengthy underwater
cable has never been attempted. 'They are either being very daring or very
foolish,' said one Kuala Lumpur based energy company executive. Considerable
power loss seems inevitable.
Bakun will be a private sector project. In January this year the government
signed a memorandum of understanding giving management of Bakun to the
locally based Ekran company. The announcement was greeted with some
surprise. There was no tendering process involved.
Controlled by Mr Ting Pek Khiing, a Sarawak-based Malaysian Chinese, Ekran
was established only in 1991 and has no experience in projects of the size
of Bakun. Mr Ting, a swashbuckling entrepreneur who has made a name for
himself as a tourist resort developer, is supremely confident. 'We can build
anything on earth,' he says.
Mr Ting says between 60 and 70 per cent of financing for Bakun will be
raised from domestic sources and insists the project can be built in six
years, without federal or state funds. Ekran is widely believed to be backed
by Mr Daim Zainnudin, a former federal finance minister and an economic
adviser to the government.
Some tribespeople feel the change the dam will bring is part of an
inevitable process. 'Our ways are altering anyway,' says Mr John Bampa, who
works in the small town of Belaga, close to the Bakun site. 'As children we
were taught to hunt wild pig and fish. But the new generation have been to
school and have not been taught the old ways.'
However, many tribespeople say they have not been consulted about Bakun or
given any project details. Some reports say a series of dams are to be built
in the area. In recent years 17 technical studies have been carried out on
Bakun. A government minister told parliament this year those documents
remain classified under Malaysia's official secrets act.
Gara Jalong, one of a group of longhouse dwellers who two weeks ago tried
but failed to present a petition opposing Bakun to the Sarawak State
Assembly, says a government-appointed committee on Bakun does not represent
the tribespeople. 'Many of its members have been responsible for selling our
lands to the logging companies.'
Logging is very big business in Sarawak. In the past tribespeople who have
interfered with the activities of the logging companies have been
imprisoned. Though Malaysia says it is committed to curtailing logging it is
still by far the world's largest exporter of unprocessed tropical timber -
most of it from Sarawak.
Over the last 12 months prices of many tropical hardwoods have more than
doubled. In a 1991 review of forestry activities in Malaysia the World Bank
said Sarawak's trees were being cut at about four times the sustainable rate
 -a judgment fiercely denied by the government. Mr Abdul Taib Mahmud has
been Sarawak's chief minister since 1981. In exchange for support of Dr
Mahathir's national front coalition government, Sarawak is left largely to
govern itself.
An uncle and political rival of Mr Taib once accused the chief minister and
his political allies of controlling 30 per cent of Sarawak's timber
concessions. Two of Mr Taib's sons are among Ekran's main shareholders. Mr
James Wong, Sarawak's environment minister, also controls one of the state's
biggest timber companies.
Bakun is being built on the upper reaches of the Rejang, Malaysia's longest
river. An area of more than 80,000 hectares (200,000 acres), much of it
virgin rain forest, will be clear cut to accommodate the dam.
Environmentalists allege logging has already caused severe soil erosion.
Locals say ten years ago the Rejang's waters were clear and fish were
abundant. Now the river, nearly a mile wide in places, is a muddy brown
colour and there are few fish. Water levels fluctuate wildly.
The government seems determined that Bakun will go ahead but is waiting for
Ekran to submit an environmental impact study on the project. It has yet to
decide whether that study will be made public.
In the past Dr Mahathir has attacked both local and foreign groups that have
lobbied on behalf of native peoples: he has said such groups would prefer to
see the jungle dwellers living 'like monkeys in trees' instead of sharing in
Malaysia's development.
Lihan Ahang, a native chief at Long Murum, points to a faded black and white
photograph of his grandfather, a warrior who fought against the Brookes, the
White Rajahs of Borneo. 'We are not against development,' he says. 'But I am
sad about this project. It means giving up our lands and leaving the graves
of our ancestors. It means changing our whole way of life.'

FT  30 MAY 94 / Housing shortage at centre stage in Israel: A lack of land
and labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a terraced hillside rising above west Jerusalem's huge new Malha shopping
centre, rows of new housing stand close to completion - outside walls faced
in golden Jerusalem stone, roofing finished, but with windows missing, no
plumbing, and electricity yet to be connected.
Across town, in the Talpiot neighbourhood, Yitzhak, bespectacled building
manager of a deserted site, explains the malaise: 'There are no Palestinians
coming in from the territories to work. And without Palestinians, there's no
building.'
The closure of the occupied territories - which is keeping virtually all
Palestinians workers from their jobs inside sovereign Israel - has
exacerbated a problem that has now become a priority for Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's moderate Labour government: the soaring rise in house
prices.
For the third time in eight days, the Israeli cabinet yesterday devoted a
full meeting to the issue, finally approving measures to free land for
50,000 new housing units this year, setting aside cheaper housing for those
most in need, and introducing incentives for contractors to complete at top
speed.
Even yesterday's measures seem far too limited to achieve a drastic
improvement.
The problem, basically, is a matter of supply and demand. 'In Jerusalem, for
example,' says real estate agent Alex Losky, 'there's huge demand. Everybody
wants to live here. But there's just no land available for building on.'
Supply has been limited by the amount of red tape blocking allocation of new
areas for construction - the innumerable local, regional and national
committees from which approval must be sought. And once land is allocated,
private contractors - well aware of the spiralling prices - are in no hurry
to complete projects. The longer they take, the higher the price they'll be
able to demand.
Even contractors trying to work fast have been hampered by the closure of
the territories. Previously, 65,000 Palestinians worked in construction
inside Israel; yesterday, the cabinet agreed reluctantly to lift the closure
order on just 13,000 of them. Asked why, with a national unemployment rate
of 10 per cent, Israelis were unwilling to fill the vacuum, Mr Yehuda Goren,
deputy director of the Contractors' Association, said: 'The Israeli
unemployment reservoir is generally composed of people who aren't fit to
work in construction. There is potential to recruit only about 3,500.'
Mr Goren thought pay was quite competitive, and stressed Palestinians and
Israelis were offered the same rates, ranging from 2,100 shekels (about
Pounds 460) to 3,500 shekels a month - below, but not far below, average
Israeli wages. Israel has taken to bringing in workers from Thailand,
Romania and other cheap labour countries. Mr Goren said there would be
26,000 foreign construction workers in Israel by the week's end. Their
minimum wage is 1,500 shekels a month.
While land and labour shortages limit supply, demand is booming. Even though
the pre-Gulf war era of 20,000 Russian immigrants a month is now a distant
memory, new arrivals still average a monthly 6,000. Before the autonomy deal
with the Palestinians, many thousands of cash-strapped families could find
cheaper housing in the occupied West Bank, but only the most ideologically
committed are buying homes in settlements today. A further wave of demand
for homes inside sovereign Israel is inevitable when, sooner or later, the
government offers compensation to settlers willing to leave the occupied
territories.
On top of all these factors, demand is also being fuelled by foreign Jewish
investment in Israeli property which, according to Mr Bennie Loval of the
Anglo Saxon real estate agency, accounts for 40 or even 50 per cent of house
purchases in the best areas of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and coastal towns like
Herzliyah and Netanyah.
In the previous Likud government, Mr Ariel Sharon, former general and
defence minister, was housing supremo. He bulldozed through much of the red
tape, and paid tens of millions of dollars in incentives to contractors, to
shake the industry into a period of furious construction. Mr Sharon
concentrated much of his building efforts on the south of Israel, the Negev
desert where jobs are scarce and where even new immigrants were reluctant to
live. As the Rabin government tries to address the housing shortage, many of
Mr Sharon's southern apartments stand empty.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UN to discuss war in Yemen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ADEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations Security Council will tomorrow discuss Yemen's month-old
civil war following a joint appeal from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
Though the outcome of the meeting remains uncertain, the fact it has been
called appears to serve south Yemeni political interests. Indeed, the appeal
from the six nations now suggests implicit recognition for the new southern
government in spite of objections from northern leader General Ali Abdullah
Saleh.
Support from the six Arab nations follows intensive diplomatic efforts by
the south over the past month and is widely viewed as a political coup for
the break-away state.
Shortly after the start of hostilities on April 27, Gen Saleh and other
northern leaders warned the international community against attempts at
mediating, saying it would amount to meddling in Yemen's domestic politics.
Those warnings were repeated last week when Saudi Arabia initiated the
current proposals.
Supported by his political allies in the fundamentalist Islah party, Gen
Saleh claims to represent constitutional legitimacy in the country and has
vowed to crush what he calls rebellion by the southerners. He is unlikely to
heed any international objections, especially if he entertains hopes of a
military victory.
The prospects of such a northern victory, though, appear less likely with
each passing day. To win the war Gen Saleh had to capture Aden and other key
regions of the south. A month ago, he boasted of easy victories. But
northern troops attempting to enter Aden have met with stiff resistance and
advanced only to 60km from the city.
Lacking any air cover, Gen Saleh's troops approaching Aden from the north
have been exposed to relentless bombing and strafing by southern jets while
those approaching from the east and west have come under heavy naval
bombardment from southern ships.
Stalled in efforts to reach the southern capital, Gen Saleh last week opened
a new front to the east, aiming to capture the oil fields of the Wadi
Hadhramaut, some 700km north-east of Aden. But southern leaders were
unruffled by the new northern thrust, saying that Gen Saleh was
over-extending his forces and making them easy prey to counter-attack.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Clinton denies shake-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has denied that he plans imminent changes to his much
criticised foreign policy team.
In a weekend interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr Clinton conceded he
had problems communicating his foreign policy goals to the public at large.
But that deficiency, he said, should not be laid at the door of either Mr
Warren Christopher, secretary of state, or Mr Anthony Lake, the national
security adviser.
The president said he had talked to 'a huge number of people' about foreign
policy in recent weeks, mostly because it had been subject to what he called
'relentless criticism.' He could well imagine that an impression had been
left that he was planning to reshuffle his team but he suggested that his
secretary of state, in particular, was involved in delicate and
indispensable negotiations in the Middle East and over China.
Mr Clinton's decision last week to renew China's most favoured nation
trading status without reference to its human rights record has again
produced a wave of political and media criticism for his lack of foreign
policy constancy.
This, in turn, has given new impetus to the rumours that have periodically
swept over Washington for months about the fate of Mr Christopher and Mr
Lake, old colleagues from the Carter administration. Popular variations have
had both replaced by their deputies, Mr Strobe Talbott and Mr Sandy Berger,
respectively.
An alternative version has had Mr Talbott, a friend of the president dating
back to their Oxford days, move to take over the national security council
from Mr Lake. This post does not require approval by the Senate, where
earlier this year over 30 members voted not to confirm Mr Talbott as deputy
secretary of state.
Another widely canvassed option had Mr Clinton appointing a generally
respected heavy hitter as the new secretary of state. This might be even a
Republican or, in a total coup de theatre, retired General Colin Powell,
until last year head of the joint chiefs of staff.
Matched against all this speculation have been two serious factors. First,
there is no hard evidence that Mr Clinton, having already ditched his first
secretary of defence, Mr Les Aspin, has lost confidence in Mr Christopher or
Mr Lake in the face of the critical battery.
Second, a change at the foreign policy helm now would be freely interpreted
as a sign of weakness and a distraction from domestic policy priorities in
the run-up to mid-term congressional elections that already have the White
House and the Democratic party nervous.
It would seem more appropriate for Mr Clinton to entertain a reshuffle some
time well into next year. Candidates then for the State Department might
include Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader who is retiring at the
end of this year, or a party heavyweight such as Senator Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, whom Mr Clinton approached during the transition about becoming
secretary of state.

FT  30 MAY 94 / N Korea faces renewed threat of sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The North Korean nuclear issue may be referred by the US and South Korea
soon to the United Nations Security Council for punitive action, following
Pyongyang's refusal to allow international inspectors to examine fuel rods
being withdrawn from its nuclear reactor. The International Atomic Energy
Agency reported at the weekend that negotiations with North Korea on the
inspection of fuel rods had broken down, with Pyongyang continuing to remove
them in spite of IAEA protests.
The IAEA wants to analyse the rods to determine whether North Korea has
previously diverted plutonium produced by the 5MW reactor for its suspected
nuclear weapons programme.
But North Korea refused all IAEA proposals to secure some of the 8,000 fuel
rods to verify that the reactor core is the original installed in 1986. The
reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, leading to speculation that
North Korea removed some of the plutonium-rich fuel rods to make nuclear
devices.
The US and South Korea have warned that if inspection is blocked, they would
ask the UN for economic sanctions on North Korea. Pyongyang has said this
would be 'an act of war'.
There is a faint hope the issue could be resolved, since two IAEA inspectors
remain at the North's Yongbyon nuclear complex to supervise the rods'
removal, which is half completed.
North Korea said it would not comply with the IAEA's demand concerning the
fuel rods since it claimed a 'unique status', referring to its move to
withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty a year ago.

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, after less than four months in
office, reorganised his cabinet at the weekend, appointing Mr Carlos
Bernardez to head the country's stalled privatisation programme. Mr
Bernardez worked for many years as president of Banco de Venezuela, one of
the country's largest and strongest banks.
By naming a respected private-sector figure to head the privatisation
programme, Mr Caldera hopes to convince private investors that it is serious
about selling off state-owned assets.
The government suffered a serious setback on May 20 when it failed to obtain
any tenders for the sale of a state-owned airline, Aeropostal, which was its
highly publicised first effort at privatisation. Mr Bernardez replaces Mr
Abdon Vivas Teran, a long-time congressmen and close supporter of President
Caldera, who headed the privatisation programme until now.
Aside from Aeropostal, the government has a long list of companies scheduled
for privatisation, including three electric power companies, a group of
hotels and joint ventures in heavy industry.
Of the seven cabinet changes, the only other new face is Mr Alfredo Gruber,
who takes over as state minister in charge of the CVG (Corporacion
Venezolana de Guayana), the government-controlled group that includes steel
and aluminium producers, mining companies and the country's largest
hydroelectric power concern. Mr Gruber, a veteran executive in Venezuela's
oil industry, was previously president of Palmaven, a subsidiary of PDVSA,
the national oil company.
The government changes come at a time of increasing economic problems and
reflect the president's desire to eliminate public squabbling that has
occurred among cabinet ministers in the past.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Honecker: hardline keeper of the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Erich Honecker, the former East German leader who personified the
intransigence of hardline communists of the 1980s, died yesterday of cancer
in his exile in the Chilean capital, Santiago. He was 81.
Honecker, a miner's son who spent years in a Nazi jail, opposed many of the
liberal reforms in Eastern Europe in the Gorbachev era. But, in 1989, he
could only watch helplessly as the communist state he helped to build since
the second world war was swept away in a popular tide that led to German
reunification.
He flew to exile in Chile early last year after the collapse of a trial in
which he was charged with responsibility for the death of 13 East Germans
killed trying to cross the border to the west.
Hockecker was reviled by many as Politburo member responsible for building
the Berlin Wall in 1961. German television brought almost hourly updates
during his trial and accompanied him on his aircraft to Santiago.
Fascination with the man, by then pale and wizened, faded away only after he
retired to the seclusion of his daughter's house - a world away from his
life's violent political struggles.
Honecker was born into a left-wing family in the mining state of Saarland.
Both his parents were communists and he distributed party pamphlets at the
age of eight. He joined the party, studied in Moscow, was arrested by the
Gestapo - as events and political schooling cast him in a tough and
resilient mould.
Walter Ulbricht brought Honecker into the party's central committee after
the second world war. Long regarded as Ulbricht's 'crown prince,' he took
charge of military and state security. The top job fell to him in 1971 after
Ulbricht resisted Moscow's efforts to reach an accord with Bonn.
Few East Germans expected much from the stern-faced Honecker, who had a
reputation for orthodoxy and was a notoriously bad speaker. But the early
Honecker years, until about 1975, were seen in retrospect by many as East
Germany's most prosperous years. Relations between the two Germanies
improved as Willy Brandt, West Germany's Social Democratic chancellor,
sought to improve ties.
Honecker pursued a twin-track policy of sealing off the East German people
from West Germany while seeking recognition and financial help from West
German politicians and business leaders. This policy, aimed at solidifying
the communist state, was capped by the visit to East Germany in December
1981 by Mr Helmut Schmidt, the then West German chancellor.
Throughout the mid-1980s Honecker longed to crown his political career with
a visit to Bonn. He finally made an official visit in 1987.
But Honecker found himself increasingly isolated as the Soviet Union and
other East European states struggled to adapt to pressures for economic and
political reforms.
After the Berlin Wall came down, Honecker was spirited to Moscow only to
find himself spurned there and eventually extradited back to Germany for his
abortive trial.
'Honecker failed in his political goals,' a German government spokesman
commented yesterday. 'His policies caused pain to countless people in
Germany.'

<TEXT>
Serb and Bosnian government forces at the weekend fought for control of
strategic supply routes, as the UN said a new round of talks aimed at
brokering a ceasefire would convene this week, writes Laura Silber in
Belgrade.
Despite ongoing clashes, Lord Owen, EU negotiator, said: 'I think there's a
fairly good chance of getting a ceasefire in the next few weeks.'
But he appeared uncertain as to whether the warring factions would endorse a
settlement on Bosnia's partition. International mediators last week put
forward a revised version of a settlement giving the new Moslem-Croat
federation 51 per cent of Bosnia and the Bosnian Serbs 49 per cent.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said he would rejoin peace talks,
making clear that his side will back a ceasefire, but stop short of a
political settlement.
The Bosnian government fears a ceasefire would cement Serb gains, about 70
per cent of Bosnian territory. Mr Karadzic said Serbs were ready to
sacrifice land if sanctions are lifted but remain far from accepting
proposals for a 49-51 ratio. 'Maybe we could accept 49 per cent, if they
give us Tuzla and Sarajevo,' he said yesterday, reported Vecernje Novosti,
the Belgrade daily. In remarks likely to raise Bosnian government fears, Mr
Karadzic said: 'It is now certain that we have a state, we just must take
care for it to be as big as possible.'
Meanwhile, both sides claimed civilian losses in fighting in the strategic
Sava River valley, northern Bosnia. Serb forces had appeared to regain
strategic high ground near Tuzla, the Bosnian stronghold in the northeast.

FT  30 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Russia, Ukraine in war of words
 -Crimea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Far from cheering on nashi (our side), Russia's newspapers, like its people,
have been categorical in blaming 'politicians' for the past week's stand-off
between Ukraine and its Russian-dominated peninsula of Crimea.
'Politicians are doing everything so that holidaymakers sunbathe on
barricades,' said the liberal daily Izvestia, just as Kiev, Moscow, and
Crimea, traditionally Russia's summer holiday playground, swapped threats
over the Crimean parliament's decision to restore a secessionist
constitution.
The official military newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), called for
peace with a front page story headlined: 'Will the Politicians Stop at the
Danger Zone?' Admittedly, most of the criticism was aimed at politicians in
Ukraine, with many commentators noting the influence of elections a month
away.
Despite popular resentment at Mr Nikita Khrushchev's decision to donate
Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, Russia's papers refused to give Yuri Meshkov, the
maverick Crimean leader who wants reunification with Russia, total support.
According to Izvestia, he was to be held responsible for crying wolf on
troop movements in Crimea, and undermining its livelihood by scaring away
Russian tourists.
The mass-circulation weekly Argumenty i Fakty argued that the former KGB and
Red Army, with the collapse of the former Soviet Union, had their own
reasons for wanting the crisis to degenerate into war.
'Many officers still think of themselves as belonging to a single, although
temporarily divided, system. They hope that a war in the Crimea will push
Ukraine towards a gradual restoration of common statehood with Russia and
that other ex-Soviet republics will follow suit,' the paper said.
With typical cheekiness, Komsomolskaya Pravda, the former Communist youth
daily, took a more light-hearted approach. Noting the way the dollar
exchange rate in Crimea soared and then fell in a matter of days, it said
the whole crisis had simply made currency speculators rich. It also
speculated that the only reason Kiev had not deployed more armoured vehicles
was that most of the equipment inherited from the Red Army had fallen into
disrepair.
Most regional and local newspapers in the former Soviet Union have yet to
find the confidence to comment forcefully on events: the overwhelming
majority print government statements and versions of events unedited and
unglossed. The Crimean press follows this tradition closely.
A typical edition of the main daily Krymskie Izvestiya (Crimean News) -
published by the Crimean supreme soviet - has press releases and regulations
on the front page, with bland features on the other three.
Last Wednesday's edition had as its main story a transcription of the press
conference given by Mr Sergei Tsekov, the supreme soviet chairman  - under
the headline: 'We are working without fuss' - which, as a response to a
region accused by the Ukrainian government of unlawful secession and
provoking civil war, appears to lack urgency.
Ukraine's press, still largely under state control, devoted much space to
reprinting presidential decrees on asserting authority over Crimea's
militia, and parliamentary resolutions giving Crimea 10 days to change its
mind and rescind its 'illegal' constitution.
As usual, the news was two days old at the time of printing. The singular
anti-establishment paper, Nezavisimost, led a crusade condemning Russian and
Ukrainian television for, respectively, biased and absent coverage. It
attacked Russia's Ostankino Television for highlighting false rumours of
Ukrainian military deployments.
The paper charged Ostankino with 'artistically editing' an interview with Mr
Vitaly Radetsky, the Ukrainian defence minister, which 'gave the impression
that poor little Crimea is choking in the grips of the Ukrainian monster.'
However, the outspoken paper lambasted Ukrainian Television for burying the
story as an 'insignificant matter,' instead of providing full explanation
and commentary.
In Nezavisimost's opinion column, a Ukrainian MP lamented that Crimean
negotiations in Kiev last Wednesday ended without a concrete resolution
confirming Crimea's status as part of Ukraine. Crimea's apparent reason for
not agreeing was that their parliamentary delegation 'lacked authority,'
wrote Mr Yuri Karmazin, a Ukrainian MP.
The mainstream press' condemnation of Russia's widely- perceived role in
stirring up troubles in Crimea was more subtle. Kiev's leading newspaper,
Kievskiye Vedomosti, displayed two carefully chosen quotes side by side. It
quoted Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, noting that the US
'recognises and highly values the responsible and peaceful position of
Ukraine.' The paper then had a Russian MP, Mr Konstantin Zatulin, saying
that 'the tension around Crimea is connected not with the peninsula's
politics, but with who'll be president of Ukraine.'
In a separate story, Kievskiye Vedomosti drew an alarming parallel between
Crimea's developments and the 1992 bloody civil war which took place between
Moldova and its Slavic-oriented, separatist region of Transdneister. It
noted that that 'Tiraspol (Trans - dneister's capital) also began with
establishing its own power ministries.' But this titbit was buried in the
last paragraph of page 13.
For all the grim warnings in the Russian and Ukrainian press, more amusing
than anything else this week, however, was President Boris Yeltsin's
reported response to a barrage of criticism from his Ukrainian counterpart,
Mr Leonid Kravchuk.
Projecting his new-found image as father of the nation, Mr Yeltsin told
Russians that despite all the fuss, it would be perfectly safe to go on
holiday to the Crimea this summer after all.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Germany rejects offer of MiGs to help discharge Russian debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has rejected a Russian offer to discharge more than a billion
dollars' worth of debt in the form of 100 of its most advanced MiG fighter
aircraft, according to German government officials.
The proposal was made by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence
minister, to Mr Jorg Schobohm, state secretary for defence, during the
recent visit to Germany of President Boris Yeltsin.
The offer, whose acceptance would have implied a huge change in Germany's
strategic orientation, was rejected on both political and technical grounds,
the officials said.
They said the German Air Force remained committed to procuring the
four-nation Eurofighter 2000, although its price was higher and it has
aroused political controversy.
The opposition Social Democrats have threatened to withdraw from the
project, which also involves Britain, Spain and Italy, if they win the
German elections this autumn.
United Germany has inherited 30 MiG fighters from the east German forces,
and a report by the National Audit Office last autumn, leaked in part to the
press, suggested that further purchases of the Russian aircraft would be a
better option than procuring Eurofighter.
However, a decision to make MiGs the linchpin of the air force could leave
Germany dependent on Russian spare parts and after-sales service - both of
which are alleged by Western experts to be unreliable - and call in question
Germany's commitment to its western allies.
Other drawbacks with the MiGs included: the need for a massive internal
reorganisation of the air force; the Russian aircraft's incompatibility with
western air traffic control procedures; and the frequency with which they
require servicing.
MiG engines are designed to fly for about 600 hours between overhauls,
compared with up to 4,000 for a similar western aircraft.
This reflects the fact that the cost of engineers' pay was never an
important factor for Soviet military planners.
The German officials insisted that discussions between Mr Schobohm and Gen
Grachev did not get as far as negotiations over price.
Reports in the specialist press have speculated that Russia would be
prepared to sell its MiGs for as little as DM20m (Pounds 8m) apiece,
compared with a basic price for the Eurofighter of three to five times
higher.
This would imply that the proposed MiG deal would have been worth DM2bn,
only a fraction of the DM80bn which Germany is owed by Russia.
A government official said: 'The deal looked cheap, but it would still have
required the air force to transfer funds to the economics ministry or any
other government agencies which are owned money by Russia. The air force
does not have the necessary resources at the moment.'
The air force says the need to renew its air-to-air defence capacity will
not arise until the year 2002, when its fleet of US-built F-4s will become
obsolete.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Italian tax plan aimed at cutting unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi is expected to approve
a package of tax measures at the end of this week. Tax exemption of
reinvested profits and fiscal incentives to encourage new car purchases,
along the lines adopted in France, are among measures being considered
stimulate the economy.
During the campaign for the elections at the end of March, Mr Berlusconi
promised to tackle the problem of unemployment and create a million new
jobs. This week's tax package will reinforce decrees issued last Friday that
seek to boost employment.
Italy's construction industry, badly affected by the recession and the
effects of the tangentopoli (kickback city) corruption scandal, may be
helped by a decree that suspends the Merloni Law until the end of this year.
The Merloni Law, which came into force at the beginning of March,
establishes a new and transparent framework for awarding and overseeing
public works contracts.
The new government believes the law has put a brake on public works, and
intends to introduce modifications. Meanwhile, it hopes the law's suspension
will have a rapid impact on activity and employment in the construction
sector, with around L60,000bn (Pounds 25bn) of contracts being given the
go-ahead.
A second decree eases regulations covering the hiring of staff. Only
businesses with payrolls of less than three had been allowed to hire
directly, all others being required to obtain staff through state employment
exchanges. Now businesses with up to 15 workers may hire directly, though
this relaxation does not apply to farming.
Mr Berlusconi's government has said it wants to reduce rigidity in the
labour market and thereby encourage the creation of new jobs. It is expected
follow Friday's decree by introducing measures covering part-time and fixed
term contracts.
Unemployment is particularly high among young Italians, and Mr Berlusconi's
government seeks to reduce it by stimulating the establishment of businesses
by young people. A decree allocates L500bn for incentives, L100bn this year
and L200bn in each of the next two years. The incentives will be available
in depressed areas throughout the country.
The body managing this programme will be transformed into a joint stock
corporation whose scope will be the provision of services to small and
medium enterprises. It will have share capital of L10bn, held by the
Treasury, and take stakes of up to 10 per cent in the equity of businesses.
The package announced on Friday includes a decree to release funds to
businesses in southern Italy that have been waiting for payment of regional
development grants already approved. Although about L2,000bn will be
released to about 2,700 businesses, a further 13,500 businesses will still
be waiting for payment.
The Bank of Italy on Friday relaxed reserve requirements, reducing the
marginal rate of obligatory reserve from 17.5 to 15 per cent from mid-July.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Tough manager finds himself behind Belgian bars: Brussels is
sensitive, and Paris is dismayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Groupe Schneider,
was asked last year about the protracted dispute between his electrical
engineering group and minority shareholders in two financial subsidiaries in
Belgium, he dismissed the prospect of trouble. 'There should not be any
unpleasant surprises,' he told Les Echos, the financial daily.
After a weekend in Forest prison in Brussels, however, Mr Pineau-Valencienne
may be reflecting on those words. Having travelled to Belgium last Thursday
to make a statement concerning an investigation triggered by complaints
filed by minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, the two
subsidiaries, Mr Pineau-Valencienne found himself charged with fraud and
detained in prison.
The event has prompted shock and dismay in France. 'We are deeply angered,'
said Schneider, which rejected the charges of forgery, use of fraudulent
documents, embezzlement and breach of accounting laws. The company said that
Mr Pineau-Valencienne had travelled voluntarily to Brussels and had
requested a hearing concerning the investigation by Belgian magistrates.
A group of leading French industrialists, including Mr Bertrand Collomb,
chairman of Lafarge Coppee, and Mr Jean Gandois, head of Pechiney, placed an
advertisement in the Journal du Dimanche yesterday pledging support for the
Schneider chairman, while the French ambassador to Brussels, who visited Mr
Pineau-Valencienne in prison, said that concern about the events had been
expressed at the highest level.
The reaction in France is partly a reflection of the importance of the
group, one of France's 25 biggest companies, with annual sales of about
FFr56bn (Pounds 6.5bn). It also reflects the prominence of Mr
Pineau-Valencienne, who has forced his way to the top ranks of French
industry and has been tipped as a possible successor to Mr Francois Perigot,
the head of the Patronat, the French employers' federation.
His journey to the top has not been smooth. Since taking the reins at
Schneider in 1981, Mr Pineau-Valencienne has gained a reputation as a tough
and ambitious manager, and was often at the centre of controversy. Landmarks
include the liquidation in 1984 of Creusot-Loire, the group's steelmaking
subsidiary, following a test of strength with the Socialist government of
the time, from which Mr Pineau-Valencienne was demanding a rescue package.
In 1991, Mr Pineau-Valencienne switched his focus to the US, where he
launched a hostile bid for Square D, the electrical equipment group. The
Dollars 2.23bn (Pounds 1.5bn) bid was the largest launched by a French
company in the US. Mr Pineau-Valencienne's ultimate success in the offer,
after a protracted legal battle, won him the respect of his peers. He was
named businessman of the year by Nouvel Economiste, the French business
magazine.
The result of his efforts has been the reshaping of the disparate industrial
conglomerate he inherited into one of Europe's largest electrical
engineering groups. Sales have increased from FFr40bn in the year of his
arrival to FFr56bn last year. Profits have also been improving, rising by 33
per cent last year to FFr405m.
It is Mr Pineau-Valencienne's strategy of reorganising the group, however,
which lies behind his present plight. In November 1992, Schneider launched
an offer to buy out minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two
financial subsidiaries in Belgium, as part of its reorganisation. 'The
structure of the company in Belgium was an unimagineable imbroglio,' said
the Schneider chairman.
Minority shareholders in the two subsidiaries protested against the terms of
the offer. In April last year, they filed a complaint with the Belgian legal
authorities, claiming that the offer undervalued their shares. They also
accused Schneider of mismanagement of its Belgian subsidiaries, criticising
the entry of a Swiss-registered company called Fimo into the capital of PB
Finance, in which Cofibel had a stake. Reports in the Belgian press claimed
that PB Finance through the Swiss company was involved in money laundering,
an allegation firmly denied by Schneider.
After a protracted dispute, Schneider increased its offer, and an agreement
was reached with minority shareholders at the end of last year. Last
September, however, in response to the complaints filed by minority
shareholders, Belgian investigating magistrates opened the investigation
which resulted in Friday's charges.
Industry observers said the case also reflected Belgian sensitivity about
the power of neighbouring French industry, particularly with respect to
minority shareholders. 'There is a fear of economic imperialism,' said one
analyst in Paris. He said such fears had been demonstrated in previous
cases, citing the 1992 ruling by a Belgian appeal court that Accor, the
French hotels group, should increase its offer for Wagons-Lits, the
Franco-Belgian travel group, following a claim by Belgian investors.
Schneider, however, stressed that the agreement had already been reached
concerning the price. 'It is a paradox that this should happen now, after we
have resolved the dispute,' said Schneider. It said that attempts were being
made to secure the release of Mr Pineau-Valencienne before Wednesday's
hearing and that the Belgian authorities had not clarified the reasons
behind their charges.
What is already clear, however, is that what started as a squabble with
minority shareholders has become a great deal more troubling for Mr
Pineau-Valencienne.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Tapie to challenge bank on debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the French politician and businessman, has promised to
challenge Credit Lyonnais today by launching a legal action to overturn the
bank's decision to terminate his five-year debt repayment agreement.
The court case is an attempt by Mr Tapie, whose Energie Radicale movement is
riding high in the polls on the eve of the European elections, to prevent
Credit Lyonnais from demanding the immediate repayment of a large chunk of
his FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m) loans.
Credit Lyonnais 10 days ago sent a bailiff to Mr Tapie's Paris townhouse to
serve notice that it was revoking an agreement signed in March giving him
five years to repay his debts. The bank last week stepped up the pressure by
demanding that Mr Tapie repay FFr450m by next Thursday, and at the weekend,
it took out a seizure order over FFr100m of cash held by one of his
companies.
Mr Tapie has suggested the Credit Lyonnais demands are part of an
establishment plot against him. He said at the weekend his lawyers would
take out a court order to force the banks to abide by the original five-year
agreement.
Credit Lyonnais is trying to clean up its loan book as part of the FFr44.9bn
government-backed rescue package orchestrated by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, its
new chairman. The bank says the move against Mr Tapie is due to concern
about his financial state and the risk of claims from other creditors,
notably the tax authorities, which are investigating the purchase of the
Phocea, his luxury yacht.
However, associates of Mr Tapie yesterday dismissed the bank's position as
'totally unjustified'.
The confrontation comes during Mr Tapie's campaign for the European
elections, but, so far, the legal and financial threats appear to have have
boosted his popularity.
His populist Energie Radicale movement still commands around 10 per cent
support for the elections and he is now the leading left-wing contender for
next spring's French presidential vote.
An opinion poll in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper puts Mr Tapie
in third place for the presidency with 10 per cent support, ahead of Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Michel Rocard,
the Socialist leader.
The only contenders ahead of Mr Tapie are Mr Edouard Balladur, centre-right
prime minister, with 19 per cent, and Mr Jacques Chirac, conservative mayor
of Paris, with 13 per cent. But Mr Tapie shares first place with Mr Balladur
among 18- to 30-year-old voters, among whom both men have 16 per cent
support.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Paris, Bonn discuss EU strategy: Plans for two presidencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Germany and France will meet today to move their traditional
European partnership into even higher gear to co-ordinate their successive
presidencies of the European Union over the next year.
At their two-day meeting in the Alsatian border town of Mulhouse, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur of France will plan their joint approach to next month's EU summit
in Corfu and to Germany's presidency in the second half of this year and
France's in the following six months.
Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand were reported over the weekend by the Suddeutsche
Zeitung newspaper to have already decided that at Corfu they will back Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, to succeed Mr Jacques Delors
as European Commission president.
In Paris an official would only comment that 'from our praise of Belgium's
performance in the presidency' in the second half of last year 'you can see
where our heart lies'. In Bonn, rumours that the Delors succession might be
deliberately kept open for Mr Kohl to fill if he lost his October election
were discounted, partly because this would leave the European Parliament
insufficient time to use its Maastricht rights to endorse the new
commissioners.
According to the Elysee spokesman, the two countries are to set up a
high-level working party to ensure 'perfect co-ordination' of EU business
between July 1 this year and June 30 next year. Among other things, this
will involve:
France falling in with Germany's desire for the EU to open more to the east,
in return for Germany's backing for French initiatives towards North Africa,
and particularly Algeria, whose official debt is expected to be rescheduled
in Paris next week.
Germany would like Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk to come to
Corfu to sign EU co-operation treaties with Russia and Ukraine, a wish that
French complaints about Russia 'dumping' enriched uranium on its market had
looked like thwarting. But Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, used
his recent trip to Russia to get a restraint agreement that still needs
endorsement by his EU partners. France and Germany have also been
negotiating with Mr Kravchuk a plan for western aid to stop further work,
and radiation leaks, at Chernobyl nuclear plant and to fund completion of
less dangerous Ukraine reactors.
An attempted compromise on economic growth and trade issues. Both
governments seem agreed that the eastward expansion of high-speed rail
should figure in the list of EU-backed infrastructure projects being
prepared for Corfu, though Germany remains more sceptical than France of the
Commission 'behaving like a bank' in financing these. In advance of the G7
summit in July, France wants German support for the new World Trade
Organisation to debate minimum labour standards.
Improvements to the EU post-Maastricht. To France, this chiefly means better
foreign policy co-ordination, and possibly a Western European Union arms
agency; progress on an initial, bilateral Franco-German weapons procurement
agency will be reviewed at Mulhouse. Germany, currently president of the
Schengen organisation to reduce border controls, is keener on faster
progress on common immigration and crime policies.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Employers protest at EU subsidies for trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a move which points to a growing divergence between business and
organised labour, Unice, the European employers' federation, has called into
question the principle of subsidising the European trade union movement
through the EU budget.
Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary general, raised the issue of union
funding during a weekend speech in which he also called for a shake-up of
the European Commission to correct alleged pro-union bias in preparing EU
legislation.
He told a Brussels conference on the future of European social policy on
Saturday that business was concerned about the level of subsidies for trade
union activities, much of which was earmarked by a sympathetic European
Parliament. 'Employers don't believe that balanced support exists,' he said.
Unice has identified Ecu26.49m (Pounds 20.3m) in direct subsidies for the
European trade union confederation (Etuc) and closely related bodies in the
1994 EU budget. Though the money represents only a fraction of the annual
Ecu70bn budget, Unice is pressing for greater transparency in the allocation
and use of funds.
The employers' federation is focusing on the Ecu17m set aside for unions
ahead of the Brussels directive on works councils expected to pass into law
this year. The money is to help trade unions to put in place new systems of
information and consultation at company level.
Etuc officials dismissed the Unice criticism as unwarranted, noting that
large European companies get far bigger subsidies through funding of
research and development and other areas of the EU budget.
Unice's challenge marks a new line of attack in its campaign against the
works council directive, which it regards as unnecessary Brussels-led
interference in the management of individual companies, threatening to set
back efforts to improve competitiveness.
The directive requires companies to comply with minimum requirements on
consultation with elected works councils, but only if the companies fail to
agree a voluntary pact sought by 100 employees or their representatives in
at least two member states. It is expected to pass into law later this year
under the German presidency.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Telecoms ministers in deregulation talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Europe's domestic telephone users could soon have access to an alternative
universal telephone service if ambitious European Commission proposals to
liberalise mobile telecommunications and cable infrastructure networks
succeed.
The plans amount to the creeping deregulation of voice telephony for
households well ahead of 1998, the date set by the EU for the break-up of
monopoly control over the continent's public telephone services.
These and other issues will be discussed at a meeting of telecoms ministers
in Brussels today, amid growing impatience from Europe's leading electronics
companies that liberalisation is not proceeding quickly enough.
Last month the commission published a green paper on mobile communications
intended to open the development of the mobile sector towards the personal
communications mass market.
Europe has only about 8m subscribers to mobile cellular telephones, but this
figure could rise sharply if the opening up of the mobiles sector is
accompanied by liberalisation of other telecommunications infrastructures,
such as cable TV networks.
In a deregulated market there would be nothing to stop mobile and cable
operators joining forces to offer - particularly in highly cabled countries
such as Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands - an alternative to the
existing universal domestic telephone service.
Although senior commission officials privately acknowledge that
telecommunications markets are overtaking the agreed EU timetable for
dismantling barriers in European telecoms markets, they are not prepared to
expend the political capital that would be required to dismantle the 1998
deadline.
But in a report to be presented to telecoms minsters at today's council
meeting, heads of Europe's leading electronics companies are expected to
argue that the EU should set precise targets for speeding liberalisation.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, has publicly thrown his weight
behind a full and speedy liberalisation of Europe's cable television
infrastructure. However, his plans may be scuppered by those member states
wary of the political impact of early deregulation.
The companies behind the report - Siemens, ICL, Philips Electronics, IBM
Europe and Cie des Machines Bull - are part of an EU advisory group on
information highways. They have been charged with proposing a strategy for
developing pan-European computer and telecommunications networks as part of
the EU's broader effort to boost economic growth.
The report is likely to intensify debate before the summit in Corfu next
month, when Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, is due to present it
to heads of state.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Brussels to reformulate social policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is looking for 'a new balance between what is
economically necessary and socially desirable' in formulating a social
policy for the next decade, according to Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs
commissioner.
There is likely to be less Euro-legislation, and less focus on labour law,
the main area of controversy between the UK and its partners and between
employers and trade unions.
The emphasis will be on 'the quality, not the quantity of our legislative
action', and on improving labour conditions through higher productivity, the
commissioner forecast, as Brussels finalises its preparation of a new White
Paper on social policy for July.
'We are looking for new ways to reconcile the twin objectives of economic
growth and social progress - a new European model,' Mr Flynn said.
Winding up a three-day seminar on Saturday in preparation for the White
Paper, he rebuked those who saw competitiveness purely in terms of lower
labour costs.
'We need to recognise that, yes, wealth creation is essential to pay for
social progress, but also that the social environment is an integral part of
the competitive formula,' Mr Flynn said.
'The fixation of some with the labour cost side of the equation is
one-dimensional,' he added. 'What counts is productivity, and the social
environment. . . is a key factor in determining that.'
He said he hoped that the Commission's revamped directive for elected works
councils in large trans-European companies - opposed by the UK and
criticised by Unice, the Euro-employers' lobby - would be adopted by EU
social affairs and labour ministers on June 22. The directive would not in
theory affect companies in the UK, by virtue of Britain's opt-out from the
Maastricht treaty's social chapter. But Mr Flynn nevertheless looked forward
to a period of consolidation to follow the already flagging activist phase
of EU social policy, to cover the jobless as well as those in work.
The top priority would be job creation, and Mr Flynn called for the pursuit
of higher labour standards through a new commitment by both sides of
industry to 'high productivity, high quality, and high value added'.
But he underlined that the European Union remained committed to 'a level
playing field of agreed minimum standards' for workers, as the corollary to
the Single Market and fair competition within it.
Attempts by the UK to dilute that would be resisted, he warned. 'If we
cannot progress as 12, then we will be obliged to progress as 11 rather than
stand still or move backwards,' he said, citing as an example the works
council directive - the first measure under the Maastricht social chapter.

chairman

<TEXT>
French business leaders yesterday rallied behind Mr Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the French electrical
engineering group, imprisoned in Brussels since Friday on charges of fraud.
The arrest of the Schneider chairman also prompted high-level exchanges
between the French and Belgian governments, although both sides declined to
confirm Belgian television reports that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French
prime minister, had telephoned Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart,
concerning the issue.
In an advertisement placed in the Journal du Dimanche, the French Sunday
paper, 35 prominent French businessmen pledged their support for Mr
Pineau-Valencienne, testifying to his 'moral rigour, ethics and competence'.
In Brussels, however, there seemed little sign of an early release for the
Schneider chairman. The Belgian Justice Ministry said it would respect the
decision of the investigating judge, Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, who detained
Mr Pineau-Valencienne on charges of fraud, embezzlement, falsification of
annual accounts and abuse of confidence.
Under Belgian law, Mr Pineau-Valencienne must remain in prison until the
judge decides whether the charges should be confirmed. His court appearance
has been set for Wednesday.
The charges against Mr Pineau-Valencienne relate to a complaint by minority
shareholders in two Belgian Schneider subsidiaries - Cofimines and Cofibel.
They claimed that Schneider's 1992 bid to buy them out had undervalued their
shares. An agreement between the minority shareholders and Schneider was
reached earlier this year after the French group raised its offer price, but
an investigation by the Belgian authorities into the management of the two
subsidiaries, which was launched last September, has continued.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former communists returned to power in Hungary yesterday after winning an
absolute majority in the second and decisive round of parliamentary
elections.
The Hungarian Socialist party - the revamped communists - won 209 of the 386
seats in the new parliament. That enables the party to govern alone, if it
chooses, without the moderating influence of the coalition partner that the
diplomatic and business community had hoped for.
Hungary joins Poland and other east European countries where hardship has
pushed voters back into the embrace of revamped communists.
In yesterday's vote, the Socialists relegated the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, at present the largest party in the parliament, to a humiliating
third place with an estimated 37 seats, down from 165 in 1990.
The Socialists said earlier they would invite the Alliance of Free
Democrats, the liberals placed second with a 70 seats, to join a coalition
government.
However, the Free Democrats have said that an absolute Socialist majority
would all but preclude their participation in a coalition government in
which they would be dispensable. Nor, liberal leaders said, would they take
ministerial positions under Mr Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old Socialist leader,
a former foreign minister and long-time communist.
One-party government carries connotations of the monopoly of power exercised
by the communist regime and few even in the Socialist party favour the
option.
Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialists' free-marketeer economic spokesman and a
possible compromise prime minister, said last week that only a broad and
solid coalition could implement the austerity programme necessary to contain
twin current account and budget deficits.

<TEXT>
There were more red faces than white knuckles in Blackpool when the world's
'tallest, fastest and steepest' roller-coaster came to a halt during its
public debut.
Some 30 members of the roller-coaster's fan club were stranded two-thirds of
the way up the 235-ft-high ride when it was stopped by an oversensitive
computer controlling the trains.
'We don't know exactly why the computer stopped the ride,' said Ms Helen
O'Neill, public relations director for Blackpool Pleasure Beach, the
amusement park that features the 85 mph roller-coaster. 'It's so good that
it's over-efficient.'
Most of the 30 passengers stranded by the stoppageon Saturday remained
unconcerned. They were brought down the ride's 65-degree drop after 10
minutes and given glasses of champagne.
But the thousands of people who had been queueing for 1 1/2 hours had to be
turned away while engineers checked for possible faults.
'We investigated for two hours to see if there was anything at all to make
it stop,' said Ms O'Neill. 'We haven't discovered anything untoward.' The
roller-coaster, put back in service later, was operating normally yesterday.
The roller-coaster, built with 2,600 tonnes of galvanised steel, is named
Pepsi Max Big One under a Pounds 1m, five-year sponsorship deal with
Pepsi-Cola International's sugar-free cola drink.
The roller-coaster ride was designed by Arrow Dynamics of Clearfield, Utah.
Mr Ron Toomer, the company's president, suffers from motion sickness and
sticks to designing roller-coasters by computer rather than riding on them.
The Thompson family, which owns the 42-acre amusement park in Blackpool and
paid Pounds 12m for the Big One, will keep its fingers crossed that there
will be no repeat of the stoppage when the holiday crowds arrive in force
today.
Tomorrow they will be calling on their Utah consultants to investigate more
fully.
'We'll be asking them if there's any way of toning the computer down,' said
Ms O'Neill.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Opel lawyer seeks arrest of VW's Lopez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German prosecutors have been asked to issue a warrant for the arrest of Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, second-in-command on the Volkswagen board
and the production chief of the automotive group.
The latest twist in the VW-General Motors saga came in a request from Mr
Volke Hoffmann, a lawyer representing Adam Opel, who claimed at the weekend
there was a danger Mr Lopez might leave Germany.
Opel, the local subsidiary of GM, whose suspicions of industrial espionage
by Mr Lopez and associates prompted the start of criminal investigations in
Germany and the US last year, believes Mr Lopez may be bound for Spain.
It is believed that there are no extradition arrangements between Spain and
Germany or the US relevant to the Lopez affair.
According to Mr Hoffmann, suspicions have hardened after continuing
discoveries of evidence from data seized in a raid last summer on VW's
Wolfsburg headquarters and the homes of former GM employees who joined the
German group last March.
Opel is expected to issue details of some of the latest findings in a
statement due today - in advance of a key VW meeting to discuss the
continuing crisis at the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat.
VW retorted that Opel was trying to influence public opinion and said an
independent inquiry last year had shown no secret Opel documents had reached
the company or were used by VW. 'Representatives of Opel interests are again
trying to influence public opinion with insubstantial accusations,' VW said.
'False reports or one-sided speculation about alleged arrest warrants are
unfortunately nothing new. That has happened repeatedly in the past and then
it was always just a rumour which evaporated in thin air.'
Speculation has re-emerged recently that Mr Lopez, currently production
director for the Volkswagen group, might be sent in to rescue the
loss-making Spanish concern.
Leaders of the supervisory board, which will review the Spanish situation
tomorrow, are known to have discussed the possibility of sending Mr Lopez to
Seat late last year.
The idea was rejected on the ground that, apart from the unfavourable
impression a move might have made at that time, 'if a bad appointment
decision has been made at Volkswagen there is no point in making another,'
reliable sources suggested.
Mr Jorge Alvarez, who joined VW from Opel immediately after Mr Lopez, was
earlier this month appointed head of purchasing at Seat in a partial
management shake-up.
Mr Alvarez, 27, was one of the people involved in the shredding of Opel data
in Wolfsburg last March. VW has said documents were shredded to avoid any
danger of their coming into the group's possession. It is also known that
some documents were photocopied but their fate has not yet, apparently, been
cleared up. Mr Alvarez was also a former occupant of a house in Wiesbaden
where Opel and GM secrets were discovered last June, shortly after he left.
Today's statement from Opel, VW's main rival in the European car market, is
expected to include information on that find and more recent discoveries.
Opel's latest initiative follows a recent attack from VW featuring
allegations of dirty tricks by private detectives hired by Mr Hoffmann, and
bias on the part of the German prosecutor in charge of the investigation.
Mr Jurgen Taschke, Mr Lopez's lawyer, told German media at the weekend that
issuing an arrest warrant made no legal sense. Mr Hoffman's request was
intended only as a media diversion, he added.
The Opel move appeared to be timed to have the maximum effect at VW's annual
meeting in Hamburg on Wednesday, as there are already signs that the board
will be challenged by shareholders.
At least one shareholder has formally proposed that the obligatory approval
of the management board's behaviour in the past year should be postponed
pending clarification of the Lopez affair, the Seat crisis and the group's
failure to break even last year in spite of repeated pledges from Mr
Ferdinand Piech, group chairman.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Further German rate cuts forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German interest rates should continue to fall 'for many months to come' in
spite of the recent strong growth in German money supply, a new study from
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, argues today.
After a week in which Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, added to
the gloom in financial markets by damping expectations of step-by-step cuts
in German interest rates, economists from Lehman Brothers' London office
said that 'in the near term' they 'expect continued reductions in German
interest rates'.
Although M3, the broad measure of money supply, grew at an annualised rate
of 15.8 per cent in April, well outside the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent
target growth range, the Lehman Brothers paper argued that Germany's credit
boom 'is over'.
Lehman's team of international economists is headed by Mr Gerry Holtham,
formerly a senior economist at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development in Paris.
They said Mr Tietmeyer had been right to claim that M3 has been swollen by
exceptional factors. Outside the property sector, where lending has been
boosted by changes in the tax treatment of mortgage interest payments, the
annualised growth of lending has slowed sharply to about 5 per cent.
Lehman Brothers said the Bundesbank should only worry 'in the unlikely event
that M3 does not decelerate in the coming three to six months'. Only if
broad money continued to grow by 15 per cent until the year-end, should the
Bundesbank react and raise interest rates, because that would be a sign that
bank credit was growing quickly.
Late last week, Mr Tietmeyer clarified his bearish comments by explaining
that he had been referring only to the Bundesbank's official discount and
Lombard rates and not to the 'repo' rate which it steers in its money market
operations.
Some economists still expect official German rates to fall further. Mr
Ulrich Ramm, chief economist of Commerzbank, one of Germany's big banks,
said the Bundesbank was likely to lower its discount rate by a further half
percentage point to 4 per cent by the end of 1994.
Writing in Borsen-Zeitung, a Frankfurt financial daily, Mr Ramm forecast
that the Bundesbank would 'continue its policy of cautious interest rate
cuts' until some time in 1995.

FT  30 MAY 94 / UK airlines win access to Orly from June 13: Paris places
limits on flight frequency and aircraft size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France has agreed to open Orly airport in Paris to UK airlines from June 13,
but is seeking to limit any single airline to four return trips a day
between London and Orly.
The French government is also proposing to ban smaller aircraft from serving
Orly - a move expected to be challenged by the UK government.
The decision to open Orly on June 13, which will be announced today, was
taken after a meeting between Mr John MacGregor, Britain's transport
secretary, and Mr Bernard Bosson, his French counterpart, at Annecy in
France on Saturday.
UK carriers have been keen to start services to Orly to link up with the
extensive French domestic network operating from the airport on the southern
side of Paris.
Although the European Commission had told the French government to open
Orly, France had resisted the move.
This nearly provoked a confrontation between France and the UK, with British
Airways and Air UK both threatening to defy the French ban on flights from
London to Orly.
The two countries reached a compromise two weeks ago with France agreeing to
open the airport to UK carriers by the end of the June at the latest. That
has now been brought forward to June 13.
France had argued that technical and environmental problems forced it to
delay opening the airport to UK flights and it also claimed that French
airlines were not getting adequate access into London's Heathrow Airport.
The Heathrow slot co-ordinating committee, which allocates landing slots,
will meet on Thursday to consider applications from two French carriers, Air
Liberte and AOM, to start services to Heathrow.
The proposed four round trip flights a day limit would fit exactly with BA's
plans, but Air UK has been seeking five return flights a day. British
Midland has also indicated it plans to start services to Orly in September
but has not yet said how many daily flights it intends to operate.
Under the latest proposals, Air France will be limited to four return daily
flights between London and Orly.
TAT, BA's French affiliate, is also seeking to operate flights from Orly to
London but its plans were not discussed at Saturday's ministerial meeting.
The UK is believed to be unhappy about the proposed flight limit and is
expected to seek greater liberalisation. But Mr MacGregor has stressed that
his priority was to get UK flights into Orly as soon as possible.
The French proposal to limit the size of aircraft is also expected to be
challenged by the UK. Paris is considering limiting services to Orly only to
larger aircraft to ease congestion problems at the Parisian airport.
Should France go ahead with this proposal, Mr MacGregor is expected to raise
the issue with the European Commission.
Mr MacGregor is expected to continue opposing French government plans to
inject FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) into Air France. He said he welcomed last
week's decision by the Commission to investigate the proposed Air France
aid. 'As a matter of principle, the UK is opposed to state aids that distort
competition in the single market,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the French
electrical and engineering group, was yesterday detained in a Brussels
prison on charges which include embezzlement and the falsification of annual
accounts, the company said yesterday.
Schneider said it rejected the charges, which were brought by a Belgian
prosecuting magistrate and relate to complaints filed by minority
shareholders in Cofimines and Cofibel, two Belgian financial subsidiaries of
the French group.
Schneider launched an offer to take full control of the companies in
November 1992 as part of the restructuring of its Belgian activities. The
terms of the offer were strongly contested by minority shareholders in the
two companies, who took legal action to secure a higher price and claimed
irregularities in documents relating to the offer.
Schneider agreed an out-of-court settlement on the price with the minority
shareholders at the beginning of this year. The complaints of the minority
shareholders, however, had prompted the Brussels judicial authorities to
open an investigation last autumn.
Schneider said its chairman had been charged with 'forgery and use of
fraudulent documents, embezzlement, falsifying annual accounts, breach of
trust and breach of accounting laws'. According to Schneider, the Belgian
state investigator is accusing the French group of having managed its
Belgian subsidiaries in a way that was detrimental to minority shareholders.
Schneider said its management and employees were 'deeply angered and shocked
by the action taken against their chairman'. The company rejected the
charges against Mr Pineau-Valencienne and said it had always acted in the
interest of all of its shareholders.
Shares in Schneider fell sharply following the announcement of charges,
losing almost 6 per cent of their value to close at FFr390. The company,
which is one of the CAC-40 leading industrial shares on the Paris bourse,
has annual sales of about FFr56.4bn.
According to Schneider, Mr Pineau-Valencienne had travelled voluntarily to
Brussels on Thursday to make a statement before the legal authorities and
had requested a hearing on the issue.
Schneider said it was unclear how long Mr Pineau-Valencienne would be
detained. But he said it was possible the detention could last until
Wednesday, when he is due to appear in court for a hearing.
The company said it was staggered by yesterday's events, particularly
because it had resolved the dispute concerning the terms of the acquisition
of Cofibel and Cofimines.
To reach the agreement, Schneider increased its offer for the acquisition of
Cofibel and its subsidiary, Cofimines, by FFr60m to take the total cost of
the deal to FFr1.4bn (Pounds 163m).

Six Birmingham-based businessmen were yesterday found guilty of operating a
Pounds 1.5m fraud by representing adult clothes as children's garments to
avoid value added tax. They are to be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on
June 17.
Customs and Excise said the men had also 'systematically supressed a high
percentage of sales between themselves and to other customers'.
The men operated a number of businesses involved in clothes manufacturing,
the biggest of which had annual sales of Pounds 3m. The fraud took place
over five years from 1985. Customs said: 'All the businesses received
regular visits fom Customs and Excise but the books and records had been
carefully constructed and completed in a fraudulent manner.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Red Star looks again for a buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Red Star, British Rail's express parcels company, was put up for sale for a
second time yesterday after a reorganisation intended to make it more
attractive to bidders.
The company was first offered for sale almost a year ago, but no
satisfactory buyer was found and it was taken off the market in December. It
has since shed 350 staff, all by voluntary redundancy, and is dropping two
of its slower services.
Red Star failed to find a buyer because of its large losses - Pounds 9m on
turnover of Pounds 43m in 1993. The streamlining of its operations will not
entirely eliminate the loss, it said yesterday.
'The objective is to show a business capable of being developed,' Red Star
said. 'Now we know where we are going. The non-premium services were a
millstone around Red Star's neck.'
Red Star is the only UK parcels carrier to use the British Rail network and
has more than 200 outlets, mostly located in or near railway stations.
Final bids must be made by July 31, with the aim of completing a sale by the
end of September.
Red Star is to concentrate on its same-day service and its 9am and 10.30am
next day-services. It will drop from today its noon and 5.30pm next-day
services.
Red Star is trying to retain its small-volume customers by increasing from
Pounds 5 to Pounds 10 the discount for bringing a parcel to the depot. This
will apply over the summer. Large-volume customers negotiate individual
contracts.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Support for workplace healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large minority of Britons would be prepared to pay for medical centres in
the workplace, receive drugs by mail order and pay for advice and services
from pharmaceuticals companies, a survey says.
A MORI poll of 2,017 adults indicated widespread sympathy for alternative
ways of delivering healthcare.
Ms Joanne Shaw, a healthcare specialist at Boston Consulting, the management
consultancy, said: 'The survey results imply that in spite of commonly
perceived public mistrust of pharmaceuticals companies, a significant number
of people would be prepared to buy care from them directly.
'It also implies that people are prepared to have the kind of care that has
been shown to dramatically cut costs. There are examples where
computer-aided education for asthmatics dramatically cut hospital
admissions.'
Respondents were asked about a healthcare practice that is gaining
acceptance in the US, in which a pharmaceuticals company offers a range of
services such as telephone help lines, free consultations with doctors and
free supplies in return for an annual fee. Forty per cent said they would be
interested in such a service and 51 per cent not interested.
Forty-five per cent said they would rather stay, undergo operations or
receive medical assistance at an employer-based centre than at a hospital.
Forty-one per cent said they would not.
If both the workplace centre and the local hospital were offered, 71 per
cent would choose to be treated at work.
Asked what they would choose if the employer-based centre asked for a Pounds
30 payment for a visit, 29 per cent said they would still prefer it and 65
per cent said they would not.
Mail order of drugs, rather than collection from a pharmacy, was also
popular with 41 per cent, who said they would rather have supplies
delivered; 38 per cent said they would not. Mail-order drug delivery is a
fast-growing part of the US healthcare system.
Previous polls have shown a high level of satisfaction with the National
Health Service but had not offered alternatives, said Ms Shaw.
She added that if allowed, direct communication between drugs companies and
patients could lead to 'a demand-led doctor-patient relationship'.

In London, the FT-SE 100 fell 53.3 to 2,966.4, its first close below 3,000
since September. The index has fallen by 5 per cent in the course of this
week.
Long-dated UK government bonds closed almost a point lower, with the yield
on benchmark 10-year gilts rising to 8.39 per cent from 8.26 per cent.
Equity and bond markets in France, Italy and Spain also lost ground. In
Paris, selling orders from the US pushed the CAC-40 index down 41.22 to
2050.67. French 10-year bonds fell  3/4 of a point and Italian 10-year bond
lost more than a full point.
In Germany, the Dax index ended the official session well below the day's
high, closing up 10.74 at 2,140.99. Selling continued after the official
close, taking the index down 28.19 to 2,112.80. Long-dated bonds fell back

FT  28 MAY 94 / Major additions and omissions: Dominic Lawson on a prime
minister who has invented himself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being
old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was
Being There. I entirely concur with their choice.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the
plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises
without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the
US presidency.
Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a
halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers
that he is a sure-fire winner. In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear
what they want to believe. He has a deadly innocence. No wonder the Majors
liked this film.
John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his
own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's. If he did not see
the similarity, that is still more revealing.
Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an
unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy
with agriculture'. (Well, it was obvious to Farmers Weekly, anyway.) And
Major replied: 'It's simple. My father was a farmer. He lived on a small
farm somewhere in Shropshire.'
Francis Wheen of The Guardian, a keen student of Major's mysterious past,
immediately rang 10 Downing Street, which claimed that Major's father farmed
near Bromsgrove in 1910.
As Wheen pointed out, Major was an unresponsive minus 33 years old at that
time, and - a minor point this - Bromsgrove is not in Shropshire. This, of
course, does not mean that Major made everything up. Family folklore is a
peculiar thing.
Yet when I heard about this, my mind immediately went back to an incident a
few months ago, when Major visited Pittsburgh, centre of the US steel
industry, as part of his American tour. I recall that he made a great hit by
recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city. A farmer for
Farmers Weekly, a Pittsburgh steelworker for the American audience . . . a
pattern emerges. Major's father, and therefore by extension John Major
himself, can be all things to all people.
If John Major were a different sort of politician, this would be a point
barely worth making. But it does seem all of a piece with Major's approach
to wider political issues.
On the one hand he will appeal to the pro-Europeans in his own party by
claiming to want Britain to be at the heart of Europe. On the other he is
free with insulting references to the European Commission, whenever it is
necessary to appeal to an audience of Euro-sceptics.
There are those who will argue that this merely means that Major is a
typical democratic politician, that one who wants to become prime minister
in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest, not just one.
But that has not been true of Major's most recent Conservative predecessors.
Margaret Thatcher was notoriously dogmatic, even in public, and so too was
Edward Heath, even though he always pretended to be a 'consensus
politician'. No, Major's technique is very much his own invention, very much
a reflection of his own particular character, itself a product of his
unsettled family background.
His father, Tom Major-Ball, was an itinerant figure, moving from place to
place, trying his hand at any number of occupations, including the circus.
No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with
prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
The only problem is the old one: you cannot fool all of the people all of
the time. Except in the movies.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Bypassing the system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No wonder I am stressed. It is the price I am paying for going interactive,
as part of an experiment being conducted by MIT. I thought it would be fun,
and that interactivity would push Hawks &amp; Handsaws towards the cutting edge
of mediaworld - utilising, as it does, advances in computers and telephony.
And so it has. My screen glows day and night. Readers are talking back in
growing numbers. They appear on my screen with not a moment's warning. I'll
be typing away quietly when the screen suddenly fizzes and there, right in
front of me, is somebody talking back. Hectoring me in real time. Berating
and abusing me.
I can't just run away, or pretend that I'm invisible. I have to stand my
ground. But it is all so indiscriminate. Anyone can get through, any Tom,
Dick or Heidi.
Last Monday was a nightmare of interactivity - a constant stream of
tele-callers angered by H &amp; H's protest at the wickedness of a bypass scheme
near Bath which is desecrating a famous beauty spot, Solsbury Hill. This is
a place of water-meadows, badger setts, tranquility and history.
H &amp; H, last Saturday, jettisoned balance and objectivity. Stuff them, it
thought. It called a spade a spade. It talked of road-building mania on a
completely crazy scale, as well as madness among ministers and decadence in
the government.
As a result, my screen glowed phosphorescently as callers got through to me
interactively. Their faces were scarlet, their language intemperate. If they
could have reached through the screen I am sure they would have killed me.
The first face to appear was that of the chairman - he did not give his name
 -of an outfit which he described as a big-league construction company,
though not, as it happened, one of those involved in the rape of Solsbury
Hill. He wore a brown suit and a carnation, which wilted as he spoke.
'What are you?' he demanded. 'A communist? A hippie? One of those media
nancy-boys? Have you any idea, you self-satisfied twerp, what damage you can
cause with your sentimental gibbering? A bypass scheme like Solsbury Hill
stands for progress and jobs, for growth and prosperity. For getting Britain
ready for the 21st century. Taking our place in Europe. It stands for our
children's future. Our children's children's future. You're a malcontent and
a sniveller. You don't stand for anything. Don't believe in anything. You're
an aesthete. A worm. A completely negative person. God, you are rotten.'
No sooner had he disappeared from my screen than he was replaced by a
mandarin from the highest level imaginable of the Ministry of Transport. Sir
Robin something something. Droll, yet extremely dangerous.
He said: 'Rather impressionistic, your piece on Solsbury Hill. Of course you
have an agenda. I acknowledge that entirely. But I wonder if you realise how
wounding your stance can be. You may not have seen, Michael, a statement
from the secretary of state which we promulgated two months ago, covering
many of the points of such concern to you. John MacGregor - I quote - today
announced a radical prioritisation of the roads programme. It will get
essential schemes built faster and remove schemes no longer environmentally
acceptable or not needed at present.
'This review, said MacGregor, will speed up delivery of the key improvements
needed to make journeys run more smoothly. And it will minimise blight,
damage and disruption for local communities and the environment. As you
know, Michael, 90 per cent of all journeys in Britain are by road. A
substantial bypass programme of 91 schemes, 16 of which are designated
Priority 1, is designed, fundamentally, to get heavy traffic out of villages
and towns, thus improving the quality of life for residents and visitors
alike. We are also keen not to encourage commuting by road into urban
centres.
'I realise that at 720 words Hawks &amp; Handsaws can only skim across the
surface of things, like an intoxicated whippoorwill. That is its attraction.
I myself am a fan, steadfast in devotion. All I am keen to do is to fill in,
as it were, a few of the substantive issues that impinge upon Solsbury Hill
and this unfortunate but vital bypass.
'I've enjoyed our chat enormously. Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
as Virgil used to say. Arrivederci, dear.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Vilified defender of the faith: Yoram Sheftel proved John
Demjanjuk was not Ivan the Terrible. He tells Chrystia Freeland why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yoram Sheftel is Hollywood's dream of a defence lawyer. He is tough, he is
pugnacious, he always fights for the underdog, and he is never happier than
when he has a chance to take on the establishment.
Sheftel's skills were displayed on the world stage when he defended John
Demjanjuk, the Ukrainian-American auto-worker accused of being a sadistic
Nazi camp guard.
For Sheftel, the trial ended in a spectacular - and unexpected - success,
but also created a social catastrophe which has dogged him in the six months
since his victory.
In the ageing, inarticulate figure of Demjanjuk, the state of Israel thought
it had found a man who could represent the inhuman face of the Holocaust for
a new generation of Israelis - and to drive the lesson home tried him in a
theatre hall and broadcast the courtroom proceedings live on television.
Sheftel argued that the wrong man was on trial and - even more unforgivably
 -he won.
The legal battle, which ended in September, resulted in Demjanjuk being
released by the Israeli Supreme Court after a series of appeals.
But the passions associated with the Holocaust could not be calmed by a dry,
judicial decision. As the international success of Steven Spielberg's film,
Schindler's List, attests, the Nazi genocide retains the power to squeeze
tears out of the most sitcom-saturated US audience.
For Sheftel, who many still fault for being on the wrong side, the Demjanjuk
trial can never really end. In spite of the evidence which convinced a
hostile court, there are still articulate, educated observers who refuse to
believe that his client was innocent.
So, why, on this issue, do passions still outpace reason?
'I have no doubt that some people still despise me,' Sheftel says serenely.
'Some people saw this case as being about the Holocaust, the biggest issue
in Jewish history. They feel that to admit that Demjanjuk is innocent is to
say that the Jewish state is guilty.'
Hostility towards Sheftel reached an apex in 1988 with an acid attack which
very nearly blinded him. Even today, Sheftel says that some Israelis
continue to regard him as 'public enemy number one'. But he wears the mass
censure as a badge of honour and says that during the trial it served as a
goad to putting up a more spirited defence.
'Once I decided to take on this case, nothing whatsoever could deter me,' he
said. His loquacious manner and cosy, bearded appearance disguise the
pugnacious attorney beneath. 'The acid attack, the daily intimidation in
court, they all just made me more stubborn to succeed. It became my personal
quest to show everyone that there was nothing whatsoever that would make me
break down.'
A few weeks ago Sheftel spoke at the Oxford Union - after the initial plan
to hold a debate was scrapped because no one could be persuaded to share a
podium with the defender of accused war criminals. Before his speech
Oxford's L'Chaim Society hosted a dinner in his honour.
Shmuel Boteach, Oxford's rabbi, began the meal with a speech meant to pour
oil on the troubled waters. The rabbi described how the case had torn Israel
apart, first by stirring up the passions connected with the Holocaust, then
by denying that rage its release when the Israeli Supreme Court acquitted
Demjanjuk. Even so, the rabbi appeasingly concluded, perhaps all Israelis,
and all Jews, could take solace from the fact that the trial had reaffirmed
the commitment of the Jewish state to one of the principal covenants between
Jews and their God: adherence to the law.
A stirring and comforting moral for a divisive experience, but Sheftel would
have none of it. 'With all due respect,' he said, 'to commend our legal
system because it found Demjanjuk innocent is absurd. This affair is a shame
and its entire conduct was a gross miscarriage of justice. In the end,
Demjanjuk was acquitted not because Israeli courts are so just, but because
they had no choice.'
With that, the L'Chaim Society settled down to an uneasy meal, punctuated by
broadsides from Sheftel about the injustice of Israeli courts and, for good
measure, occasional attacks on the US Department of Justice and the KGB.
'I think I am very much an anti-establishment personality,' Sheftel said
cheerfully afterwards. 'The Demjanjuk case was a wonderful opportunity to
expose the weakness of our legal system, and, in a way, of all legal
systems.'
That, it certainly was. Being forced, after a highly publicised, seven-year
show trial, during which at one point Demjanjuk was sentenced to death, to
release the accused American was a public humiliation for the Israeli legal
establishment and, in the eyes of many Israelis, a debasement of the memory
of the Holocaust.
The US Department of Justice came out of the whole affair even more
dishonourably. It stands accused by an American court of acting 'with a
reckless disregard for the truth' and failing to turn over key evidence to
the defence. To add insult to injury, the US has been compelled to accept on
its territory the man it deported as a war criminal.
The hubris of the Israeli and US legal establishments, which was eventually
so painfully exposed by Sheftel, led them to behave as if the specific
horror of the Holocaust gave courts a right to ride rough-shod over legal
niceties. After Demjanjuk had been identified as Ivan the Terrible, a
sadistic camp guard at Treblinka, the Ukrainian-American was seen as no
longer deserving the benefit of the doubt.
Sheftel, rightly as it turned out, criticised the photo-spread on which the
initial identifications were based as biased, but the Israeli lower court
dismissed his argument as a quibble. As an earnest American student,
troubled by Sheftel's detailed explanation of his defence at the Oxford
Union, put it: 'But, Mr Sheftel, surely the Holocaust is above legal
technicalities.'
To Sheftel's fury, this attitude was shared by most of Israel's legal
community. 'It was apparent from December 1990 that Demjanjuk was the wrong
man and that he was the victim of a show trial, but not one professor of
law, not one lawyer, dared to open his mouth.
'This is a disgrace to our entire legal establishment. They all looked at
this case as a case about the Holocaust, about Ukrainian collaboration with
the Nazis and they felt that legal points were irrelevant, ridiculous as
this may sound for professors of law.'
They came to regret that judgment after the collapse of the Soviet Union
gave the defence access to KGB archives which made it possible to prove that
Ivan the Terrible was someone other than John Demjanjuk. But by the time the
KGB and other evidence exonerating Demjanjuk became available to the
defence, both the Israeli legal system and the US Justice Department were so
committed to the case that 'returning were as tedious as to go o'er'.
Israelis and Americans tried first to ignore, and then to conceal, the
evidence. But Sheftel, an adroit spin-doctor, made that impossible by
sharing his defence with the media.
Ultimately, the Demjanjuk case was really two cases. For Sheftel and his
client it was a question of mistaken identity and seeking justice for one
elderly blue-collar worker from Cleveland. For the state of Israel and the
prosecution, the Holocaust was on trial.
In the end, the first case was the one which Sheftel fought and won. It is
because he was convinced that he was representing a single, falsely accused
man, that Sheftel, as an Israeli, a Jew, and a member of a family decimated
by the Holocaust, felt no qualms about defending Demjanjuk.
'I felt no conflict at all. I wasn't defending Ivan the Terrible, I was
defending a person wrongly accused of being Ivan the Terrible. If you are
convinced as a criminal lawyer that your client is innocent - whoever he is
 -even if your country chooses to make his case into a show trial that
should not deter you.'
Indeed, Sheftel reserves a special voltage of his ample righteous rage for
those Israelis who felt otherwise. He believes that the low point of the
trial was when a lower court judge pointed out that Ukrainians, with their
history of anti-Semitism, were particularly inclined to collaborate with the
Germans.
An accurate generalisation in Sheftel's view, but insufficient grounds to
incriminate his individual client. 'The Jews were treated horribly in
Ukraine, from the 16th century to the 20th century,' he says. 'But I think
it is absurd to suggest that you can make some sort of historical balance by
hanging the wrong man.'
Sheftel's ability to focus on a single man, against the background of a
mind-numbing atrocity, remains rare. Even now, even after Israeli and US
courts have acquitted Demjanjuk and excoriated his accusers, many are unable
to accept that after all the hoopla, Demjanjuk is merely an obscure mechanic
who had the misfortune of being born in a troubled part of the world.
After it had been conclusively demonstrated that Demjanjuk was not Ivan the
Terrible of Treblinka notoriety, some lobby groups, and eventually the
prosecution, insisted that he was guilty of war crimes at a different camp.
'If not Ivan the Terrible, then a Terrible Ivan,' in the catchy phrase
coined by US defence lawyer extraordinaire, Alan Dershowitz.
The case was so flimsy - after all, for seven years the prosecution had
tried to prove that Demjanjuk was a guard at an entirely different camp -
that after two weeks the Israeli Supreme Court concluded that there were
insufficient grounds to hold a new trial.
But the audience at the Oxford Union was unconvinced. 'Demjanjuk had to be
guilty of something,' a bewildered student told me as we filed out into the
drizzle. 'Otherwise, why would the Israeli courts have tried him for so
long. You have to believe in something.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Shades dance on - Nureyev's version of La Bayadere in
Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fascinating survival, or an elaborate fake? A profound drama, or an
extended piece of re-heated and curried tosh? La Bayadere can be seen - and
performed - as all and any of these. It is certainly a very odd ballet, its
oddity compounded by excision, revision, misinterpretation. As created in
Petersburg by Petipa in 1877, it was a by no means untypical spectacular,
obeying all the dance-formulae evolved by Petipa himself. Here were strong
drama - temple dancer loved by faithless hero; exotic locale - India , with
a vision scene in the Himalayas; splendid roles for ballerinas, and a
dazzling ballet blanc show-piece for the corps.
Its history over the past century has been no less typical: edited and
re-choreographed mercilessly in Russia; brought to the West, with further
editing, by emigre stars - Makarova and Nureyev. Treasured in Russia as a
classic, it has been adopted in the West on the same terms, its Shades scene
recognised as a pinnacle of the old academic dance.
It is, as we now know from several stagings (Makarova's version given in New
York, London, Stockholm, Milan, Rio; Nureyev's, his last gift to the Paris
Opera; the Kirov production in its home theatre, and now taken on tour; the
Bolshoi also with a new presentation) a splendid, if suspect, affair. To
make sense, it must have the resources of a great company, rich in stars and
no less rich in a sense of style, with classic brilliance matched by
dramatic conviction. These demands were not fully met when Nureyev, in his
last months, mounted it at the Palais Garnier: the staging was grandiose,
the performances were more about costume than drama.
Returned to the repertory 18 months later, it now looks very well on the
Opera's dancers. I saw it on Thursday with Elisabeth Platel (the original
Paris Gamzatti) as Nikiya, and with Nicholas Le Riche making his house debut
as Solor (he had earlier danced the role with Platel in Moscow). Visually
the staging is on the far side of opulent: Ezio Frigerio's sets are
tremendous caprices on Indian themes; Franca Squarciapino's clothes boast a
rajah's ransom in gold thread alone. The generality of the dancing and
playing is admirable - not least in the performances of the two stars.
Elisabeth Platel is the purest and most aristocratic of the Opera's etoiles.
Thus the Shade Nikiya passes with divine authority through the white motions
of the fourth act, the dance luminous, the image poetic. But, as her
Gamzatti (and her Giselle) have shown us, she is an actress in whom passion
is both real and refined in expression. This Nikiya's confrontation with
Gamzatti in the celebrated dialogue when the two women challenge each other
over Solor's love, was a marvellously sustained phrase of feeling, well
matched by Carole Arbo's proud Gamzatti. To everything Platel brought
distinction of means - the shape of her dancing exquisite in proportion,
truly classical - and sincerity of feeling.
Nicholas Le Riche is the latest marvel among the Opera's men. Just 22 years
old, his dancing has a quality of innocence, of sincere pleasure in prowess,
of emotional directness, which wins the public wholly. Huge jumps, a
luscious physicality - something Roland Petit used well in the recent Camera
Obscura - mark his roles. The rectitude of Opera training also means that
his dancing is noble. For Solor, the innocence and the power of his handsome
presence are well found. The role is understood, the playing is honest. The
character will never be much more than a variation on Giselle's Albrecht; Le
Riche gives it a youthful credibility, and his dancing takes the breath away
by its grand scale.
Of the other performances, I found Carole Arbo more convincing - because
more expansive - in the dramatic scenes than in the fireworks of the second
act, and I deplore the way the staging still shows the Chief Brahman (who
must be a dominating figure) as a cross between the last Manchu Empress and
Julian Clary. In everything else, the company looked at its best.
The production, it is good to report, has lately been recorded for
television, with Nureyev's first cast: Elizabeth Guerin as Nikiya, Platel as
Gamzatti, Laurent Hilaire as Solor.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Live from Prague - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's expeditionary force of Radio 3 programmes for a Prague Weekend
looked like another foolhardy chapter in the traditionally ambivalent
Anglo-Czech history.
Previous weekends of live R3 broadcasts have come from Berlin and
Minneapolis-St Paul - the twin cities that are home to American public
broadcasting. The main presenter, John Tusa, explains there is no set
formula, but the choice of the Czech capital at the height of the Prague
Spring was inspired.
Any reference to the city must turn into a drooling travelogue. Gothic,
medieval, baroque, shameless peacock Art Nouveau - the views ambush you down
every cobbled street. A blind soprano in the Old Town busks Mozart arias to
an orchestra on cassette. The accordionist on Charles Bridge plays a
selection from Figaro. Besides the almost excessive musicality that the
historian Dr Burney noted two centuries ago, this is the city of Kafka and
Schweik, black humour and the unexpected hopefulness that results from the
Czech funambulistic mastery of the narrow line between cheerful scepticism
and mere cynicism.
The balance is delicate, especially in the current economic climate. In a
familiar scenario the arts are subjected to cuts, but even here reaction is
calm. It is accepted that generous subsidy was for too long not matched by
scrutiny. 'The attitude is 'It was nice while we had it but it couldn't
last',' says John Tusa.
Every inch the BBC man, Tusa is actually Czech-born, transplanted to Britain
at the age of three. He is sceptical about the claim that the city is the
equivalent of Paris in the 1920s. At midnight the medieval cobbles of
Charles Bridge are crowded with young people singing, playing guitars,
necking. Nepal in the 1960s might be a better analogy.
The Radio 3 schedule goes joyously to town in all senses: music, literature,
plays, architecture, politics, late night jazz, even food (well, the
ubiquitous dumpling) mean co-operation between different departments: drama,
features, talks. Their host is Radio Vltava, a name originally given to a
hated East German station that supported the Communist regime. 'Each
sentence they broadcast was lies,' beams Boris Kobrle, the bulky, boyish
editor in chief of Radio 3's Czech equivalent. But the title is so resonant
of national pride, the name of the great river on which the capital stands,
immortalised by Smetana's best-loved tone poem, that it easily shakes off
the slur.
Vltava's output is 65 per cent music, with three or four radio dramas per
week, and 15 to 20 minutes of poetry daily (more at weekends) with an
average of two serialised readings and a short story a day. They are
impressed by the BBC's features, a genre they decide to take up. It seems to
be taken for granted that as a cultural station Vltava is economically safe,
though a tiny proportion of advertising is now taken by Czech Radio.
On Saturday morning nearly 20 people crowd into the control room to share
the count-down with presenters John Tusa and Francine Stock through the
glass panel. For the next 40 hours, the visiting shift workers sail through
without technical mishaps. The back-up tapes in London, intended to plug the
gap should the line go down, are never needed. Smetana's opera Dalibor comes
live from the National Theatre where a group of British tourists recognise
the amiable Controller of Radio 3 and grumble loudly among themselves about
recent changes. Chamber concerts have been recorded in some of the noble
palaces that bespeak Prague's imperial past, and coming up is the
Havel-Prince Charles concert with Solti and Dame Kiri on June 4, to be
broadcast live on both BBC2 and Radio 3.
At one in the morning on Monday, the last programme starts, a live
Anglo-Czech discussion which Radio Vltava takes whole and untranslated.
Mercifully, perhaps, not many locals can have heard the conductor Libor
Pesek assert that Liverpool and Prague were quite similar really. Half an
hour later Radio 3 closes down. Relief, exhaustion and triumph are to be
expected, but there's something else. 'We broke every rule in the book,'
says one producer, proceeding with a catchphrase I've heard before: 'We're
business units, meant to compete against one another but we've brought it
off.' The reference to the new philosophy prompts some sardonic mirth
amongst the assembled business units. There's a whiff of velvet revolution
in the air.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: An Irishwoman in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Easter, now in its premiere performances with the RSC at Stratford's
Other Place, is about Northern Ireland, religion, family, mourning and a
disturbed female psyche. Written by Anne Devlin, it is an interesting,
entertaining, serious, ambitious mess. In particular, it is about Greta, a
former Catholic from Northern Ireland. Married, with children, to an Oxford
academic, she has entered a crisis that is not merely marital but also
psychological, spiritual, religious. 'He thought he was marrying a radical
emancipated woman,' she remarks. 'Instead he gets a Catholic mystic.'
The play overdoses on wrily comic remarks, and some of its characters are
all too inclined to Irish cuteness. Why, since it begins and ends with
Greta's spiritual quest, does Devlin drag in so much gratuitous material? In
several scenes she allows Greta to become a supporting character without
fully focusing on anyone else. Both Catholicism and Northern Ireland become
large and arresting subjects (as when Greta sees Pentecostal visions, or
when three British soldiers threaten her brother Manus at gunpoint) but then
slide out of view.
And why on earth - towards the play's close, and when all the family is
hiding under the table in case a bomb falls - does Devlin suddenly have
Manus tell his mother that he is gay? It's not as if we ever see him again.
This kind of extraneous detail feels like sheer nervousness on Devlin's
part, and so does some of the comedy, cracking jokes rather than holding to
serious subjects.
Stella Gonet, far from The House of Elliott, is Greta. People who only know
her on screen will not know what extraordinary charm she has in a theatre.
The light in her eyes, the bloom on her cheeks, the breadth of her smile,
the musicality of her utterance - these make an effect in live performance
that captivates. She makes me want to say, like an American tourist, 'Oh,
just go on talking.' But this very charm, though often invaluable, is
probably what holds her back from real distinction as an actress. Greta's
pain and trauma fail to grip.
Devlin must take part of the blame for this. So must Michael Attenborough,
who directs. He allows Ann Hasson to play Greta's sister Aoife ('I don't
have affairs, I have phone numbers') as a cute comic stereotype of Irish
domesticity far too long. When finally she has to break out into a certain
dark aggression, we cannot believe the change. Katharine Rogers, as their
sister Helen ('I don't have visions, I have sex'), muddles effectively
through a complex but under-written role.
The play falls apart into a series of individually good moments. When Greta,
distracted, has sat down alone in the road in front of an English bus, she
observes that her action would have been accepted as a gesture of protest,
not of mental disturbance, if performed by a whole group. 'It confirms what
I've always suspected - that the difference between politics and insanity is
one of numbers.' Later, still psychologically erratic, she distributes
communion to an Irish bus-queue, and the police hold her until persuaded she
is not politically motivated. 'In England they'd keep her if she's mad and
let her go if she's political,' remarks Helen. 'In Ireland they keep her if
she's political and let her go if she's mad.'
In repertory at the The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Creative stimulus of war - The Imperial War Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easily forgotten that the Imperial War Museum holds the largest
collection of modern British art outside the Tate. The loss of the old
exhibition galleries when the museum was remodelled some years ago meant the
effective disappearance of that collection as such, for while temporary
exhibitions continued to be mounted, its regular rotation on semi-permanent
display ceased. The presentation of two fresh thematic displays, set up in
the old way in the new upper galleries, is therefore especially welcome.
Artists have always responded creatively to the stimulus of war, but
commissioning them officially to do so only became established in the later
years of the first world war. Such was the variety and strength of the work
that the practice was resumed at the outset of the second. A display is here
accorded to each of them.
With only The Slade School 1914-1918 to go on, it was too easy to jump to
the wrong conclusion. In the event, the very artists whom one would expect
to celebrate under such a head, the radical and modernist young - Lewis,
Bomberg, Nevinson, Nash and the rest of them, and all from the Slade - are
missing, consigned to another show that opens shortly at the Altes Museum in
Berlin and comes to the Barbican in the autumn. In their place are those of
their contemporaries who represent the older and more conventional tradition
of the Slade, with its emphasis on fine drawing and accurate observation.
Slade professor Henry Tonks is represented by impressive studies of a
casualty clearing station on the Western Front and of village scenes from
the Russian campaign of 1919. As with others in the show, notably Colin
Gill, the larger composition drawn upon such material is more worthy than
exciting. The drawings, or at least the smaller studies, whether on paper or
canvas, are the thing, taken directly from the subject, caught on the wing -
land girls in smocks and breeches by Randolph Schwabe; soldier portraits by
Augustus John and Ambrose McEvoy; Stanley Spencer's tiny wash studies of
travois and stretcher-bearers in Macedonia; William Orpen's oil sketches of
deserted trenches, of an inn behind the lines, of himself in tin hat 'Ready
to Start'.
The star of the show is Eric Kennington with his extraordinary large
painting on glass, of 'The Kensingtons at Laventie', a group of soldiers in
the snow, wounded or simply exhausted, just out of the line. The frustration
is to see so little of the sculptor, Charles Jagger, he of the Artillery
Memorial at Hyde Park Corner, the Soldier reading a letter at Paddington
Station and many other remarkable memorials, and here shown by a single
soldier maquette.
Europe Regained 1943-1945 takes the later campaigns of the second war, in
Italy, France and Germany, seen mainly through the eyes of three artists,
Anthony Gross, Edward Ardizzone and Edward Bawden - though there are other
significant contributions, notably Henry Carr's close-toned Monte Cassino;
Richard Eurich's mulberry harbour in preparation; and Barnet Freedman's
large panoramic view of the foreshore at Arromanches, crowded with equipment
and supplies, on D Day + 20.
Gross follows the allied advance through Holland and into Germany, images of
refugees, devastated villages and the wrecked Rhine bridges. Ardizzone, in
Italy and Germany, as always takes a more intimate view of the military
life, with troops sight-seeing in the Sistine Chapel, sleeping on the floor,
or looking intently out from an observation post in the Castel S. Angelo.
Eric Taylor's Belsen studies are obviously distressing and moving, yet the
two most poignant images in the entire double show are Ardizzone's, of
German village women waving white flags and, even more so, of one of them
desperate to save her pig.
Bawden's war was in Italy, shown here by a group of characteristically large
water-colours, of Italian partisans in their headquarters, of wreckage near
the Ponte Vecchio and a quite remarkable view from the rooftops down into
the square at Ravenna, where a parade to honour a partisan hero is taking
place. If Bawden had only painted as much on canvas as he did on paper, he
would be seen as one of the major artists of his time.
The Slade School 1914-1918; Europe Regained 1943-1945. Imperial War Museum,
Lambeth Road SE1, until late 1995.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Orchestras strung out - Off the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are miserable times for members of London's four great orchestras.
Audiences still seem to be in modified free fall; the Arts Council is still
looking at ways to cut their dwindling subsidies; freelance work is hard to
find.
The LPO has turned to the Musician's Union for a loan and the Philharmonia
towards its rich French patron, Vincent Meyer. The RPO has cut the salary of
its chief executive Paul Findlay and the performance fees of its musicians
by 10 per cent. Back desk musicians with fifteen years experience now find
themselves looking at incomes of just Pounds 17,000 a year. Only the LSO,
bolstered by its double subsidy, from the Arts Council and the City of
London, can be confident about the future.
The RPO, which saw its Arts Council grant cut by 25 per cent for 1994-95,
has embarked on a delicate strategy of trying to raise its critical profile
while appealing to a wider market.
It has signed a deal with Tring Records which guarantees 177 recording
sessions over the next 15 months. In addition to the recording fees,
royalties from the 125 CDs to be released, priced at Pounds 3.99 and sold
everywhere from Little Chef restaurants to garage forecourts, could bring
the RPO an extra Pounds 500,000 a year. Sales by the end of May for the
first ten releases totalled 100,000, ahead of target.
The RPO is also benefitting from a deal with Classic FM, which is worth
Pounds 500,000 a year, mainly in kind, such as 250 advertising slots for the
orchestra and its sponsors, plus fees for jingles and some sponsorship. A
recent Festival Hall concert saw bookings rise from 25 per cent to 60 per
cent in 24 hours, thanks to radio promotion.
The RPO is now happier with its role as a sometime regional orchestra based
in Nottingham, and hopes that extra Arts Council money will enable it to
play more concerts there. At Nottingham it can experiment by abandoning the
fussy orchestral attire of white tie and tails and by introducing to the
concert hall a giant screen, so that listeners at the back can be brought
into the heart of the performance. But London is where reputations are made
and where the orchestra must premiere its best programmes. It is an
expensive process: Pounds 200,000 of the RPO's Arts Council grant of Pounds
300,000 for showcase London promotions goes straight in rental to the
Festival Hall. A recent concert there was enjoyed by a packed audience but
actually lost the orchestra Pounds 18,000.
Mrs Janet Holmes a Court was in London this week checking up on her chain of
London theatres. One, the Royalty, will be sold in the next few months,
probably to neighbouring LSE.
She confirmed that in October the Globe in Shaftesbury Avenue will become
the Gielgud, in honour of the 90th birthday of the nation's greatest living
actor. The name change will coincide with a new production, by Peter Hall,
of Hamlet, a play Sir John knows well. It providentially contains a part
that is well within the range of a nonagenerian actor, the Ghost of Hamlet's
Father. It would be a wonderful start to 'his' theatre if he could be heard,
if not seen, every night during the run.
One attraction for Stoll-Moss in re-naming the Globe is that London will
soon have another theatre of that name - the Globe at Bankside, Sam
Wanamaker's, now posthumous, dream of a re-created Jacobean theatre on
virtually the same site as Shakespeare's Globe.
Mrs Holmes a Court seems prepared to bless the 'old' Globe with practical
help and perhaps some of the cash still needed to complete the project:
Pounds 8m has been raised and another Pounds 1m is required. The planned
opening date is April, 1995. It could slip two months, but the Globe will
certainly open.
The competition between Sotheby's and Christie's to secure masterpieces for
sale has never been more cut-throat. Both auction houses desperately need
million dollar lots to lift their convalescent balance sheets. So when four
important collections of Impressionist and modern paintings came into view
in New York, the struggle to secure them sorely tested the judgment of both
salerooms.
Christie's blandishments were the more effective and it scooped three of the
four. Sotheby's had to make do with the collection of former CIA deputy
director Gates Lloyd, which sold very nicely earlier this month. Christie's
disposed of Zurich industrialist Jacques Koerfer's collection equally
satisfactorily, but the paintings of financially straitened retail magnate
Mershulam Riklis bombed spectacularly.
The real setback for Christie's came from four paintings of the late Neil
McConnell. Works by Monet, Gauguin and Sisley sold, but poorly, bringing in
a disappointing Dollars 6.7m Unfortunately a Cezanne still life attracted
bids of only Dollars 2.6m, well below the Dollars 4m-Dollars 5m estimate,
and was bought in. This could be shrugged off but for the fact that
Christie's had given the McConnell estate a non-refundable advance, probably
in the region of Dollars 11m, to secure the pictures.
This is a guarantee in all but name. When the art market was boiling over in
the 1980s Sotheby's and Christie's tried several lures like loans to
prospective buyers and guarantees for sellers. When Alan Bond could not pay
back the money he borrowed from Sotheby's to enable him to acquire Van
Gogh's 'Irises', loans fell out of favour.
The business of guaranteeing sellers a certain sum for their works of art
before they reached the podium also acquired a dubious reputation. As well
as being potentially disastrous for an auction house if the market suddenly
collapsed, it was reckoned to be unfair on bidders, who, perhaps naively,
expect auctioneers to be impartial between buyer and seller.
A compromise was reached: any lot that carried a guarantee would be marked
in the catalogue. To avoid showing their hand in this way both Sotheby's and
Christie's have invented the 'non-returnable advance', cash up front for
important owners in return for disposing of their collections.
It has turned out to be equally risky, given the current nervousness of
buyers. Christie's now has in its vaults a Cezanne still life which it must
sell, presumably privately, for at least Dollars 4m if it is to break even
on the McConnell deal. It is just the kind of extra headache it does not
need in the current fragile market.
Madonna's career may be waning but she is quickly becoming an object of
saleroom nostalgia. One of her conical bodices, designed by Gaultier and
discarded after a Barcelona concert in 1990, sold for Pounds 12,100 at
Christie's South Kensington on Thursday, a record for any Madonna garment at
auction. The last time a similar contraption appeared in the saleroom it
made Pounds 9,000.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Danish opera tunes up for the future - Richard Fairman
reports from the the Kongelige Teater, Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If one crop fails, the enterprising farmer tries another. Faced with milk
quota problems Danish farmer Vincens Steensen-Leth sold his cattle and
applied for European Community funds to help him convert to a new growth
product: he wants to plant a new opera company at his farm on the island of
Langeland. If he is successful, Denmark could soon have its own
Glyndebourne.
This is just one example of a new international outlook to opera in the
country. In Copenhagen the venerable Kongelige Teater (Royal Theatre; its
archives go back as far as 1756) has given most of its operatic performances
since the war in Danish, taking its casts from a resident ensemble. But
since the arrival of a new chairman and his appointee as artistic director,
Elaine Padmore from Wexford, that has started to change.
The opera house had already undergone substantial modernisation in 1985 and
Padmore's task is to effect a comparable re-building of the company  - even
if that means a difficult wrench with the past. Some of what she intends to
do is obvious. The standard repertory has been allowed to ossify and should
be brought up-to-date, and the finance found to do so. At the moment the
company receives most of its income from the state; if it is to move beyond
the customary four new productions a year, sponsorship will have to rise.
The repertoire must also be more varied. Formerly, if there was no soprano
who could sing Donizetti's Lucia, the opera simply did not get done. Padmore
wants to give her loyal audiences operas they have never seen and has
scheduled the Kongelige Teater's first ever productions of Puccini's
Turandot and Mozart's Idomeneo. These will be sung in the original
languages, a policy that has slowly become standard over the last 15 years.
That suits the increasing band of young Vikings, such as Randi Stene and
Inger Dam-Jensen, who sing opera on the world's stages.
Among the last of the Danish-language productions is the new Cos fan tutte,
originally intended for Ib Hansen, a favourite Danish singer who sadly fell
ill before he could appear in it. This has been produced and designed by
Mikael Melbye, a company member from his days as a treble to his career as
international baritone. As designer, he has given Cos a clean and stylish
Scandinavian feel. As producer, he keeps strictly to the text, no updatings,
no concepts.
By mid-run the performances were being conducted by Andrew Greenwood in a
swift and taut fashion (the company's orchestra is a good one and unusually
prominent, as the pit extends right out into the auditorium). Among the
singers, Randi Stene's Dorabella inevitably caught the interest, although
all four of the lovers were decently taken. A good, ensemble performance
without striking insights or personalities.
A Fidelio in repertory at the same time showed the company's international
links. Sung in German, the two lead roles featured Danish singers who have
notable careers overseas: Tina Kiberg, a rather feminine Leonore; and Poul
Elming, a Florestan strained by the higher parts of the role, though one
looks forward to hearing him in the heroic Wagner roles he has conquered at
Bayreuth. The secondary roles were strongly taken and the orchestra again
played to a high standard under the baton of Paavo Berglund.
Unfortunately, the production by Bruno Schwengl (producer) and Dieter Kaegi
(designer) had self-consciously arty ideas. Fidelio is an opera that asks
for eye-to-eye honesty and it does not help to have the prisoners forming a
Last Supper scene, in which a chosen 12 gather at a long table so that
Leonore can feed them bread and wine (why were the rest not invited?). But
that is perhaps a risk worth taking, if the company is to open its doors to
outside producers.
For the future there are ambitious plans. The Kongelige Teater may well
appear from time to time at the projected summer festival on Langeland. An
endowment has been set up to cover the cost of the annual seasons there
(Mark Wigglesworth and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra have been invited to
be musicians-in-residence) and it looks possible that the European Union may
find half the Pounds 14m cost of building works. If construction goes ahead,
the first performances should be in 1997.
As for the company's home plans, Padmore is working towards 1996, when
Copenhagen will be Cultural Capital of Europe. The programme is expected to
showcase Danish achievements on an international scale. Singers like Boje
Skovhus and Lisbeth Balslev will return home. Both Nielsen's operas will be
performed and Padmore is keen to put on what Danish singers do best, namely
Wagner, so there will be a new production of Die Meistersinger. This is,
after all, the land of Lauritz Melchior. Denmark seems to grow Wagnerians.
It must be something in the soil.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Berlioz in Brighton - A look at the musical highlights
of the festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a decade and more Gavin Henderson has guided the Brighton Festival with
a wise and generous hand. In this, his last, there is a nod towards the
'International year of the Family' with its 'Kindred Spirits' theme 'to
accentuate the tensions of family conflict as much as the power of love'.
The most notable musical event was the Romeo and Juliet dramatic symphony of
Berlioz given in its still rarely heard complete form in a performance of
high quality from the Festival and Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields
choruses and the visiting National Orchestra de Lille, under Mark Elder.
Shakespeare's tragedy does indeed illustrate the coming together of two
bitterly opposed families. The concert, appropriately sponsored by
Eurotunnel, was an unmistakable gesture towards recent events further up the
Channel; the Brighton chorus will pay a return visit to Lille.
The platform lay-out was unfamiliar. The brass occupied the Dome's apology
for an inner stage and there were several rows of empty seats in front of
the strings. From the circle the sound was clearer and brighter than usual.
The 'open' timbre of the French brass lent a splendid ring to Berlioz's
grand rhetorical phrases, the woodwind did not so much draw their lines as
etch them, the strings were nimble and finely-shaded, the percussion made
the most of the virtuoso writing.
The chorus, sparingly used in the first two parts, comes into its own
towards the end, after the death of the lovers, and is capped by the
sermonising of Friar Laurence. Some visual interest is desirable: in the
Dome the slow, processional entry of the full chorus, dark-robed, provided
this. For the Friar's solemn address one simply needs the best available
bass singer. The American David Pittsinger has a fine voice and the right
manner (authoritative but not portentous) without quite the power of French
declamation at its grandest. The other soloists, Martine Mahe (mezzo) and
Leonard Pezzino (tenor) performed their lesser duties stylishly.
Elder's direction showed an impressive grasp of the whole as well as
penetrating insight into detail. One has heard more passionately sensual
accounts of the love scene but few so clear, so probing. Queen Mab, in her
first, fleeting appearance as in the famous scherzo, was fantastically
brittle, light-footed, evanescent, uncaring, venomous.
Notoriously, Brighton lacks an opera house and a satisfactory concert hall -
the Dome does not deserve that description. There is, however, a wonderful
assortment of smaller venues, including the unique Music Room in the Royal
Pavilion. The usual series of recitals included a debut recital by the
Elmhirst Ensemble, whose aim is to rescue neglected works by British
composers of the present century. Pride of place on last Monday was given to
Constant Lambert's Concerto for piano and an instrumental ensemble written
in the early 1930s.
That work's sunny indolence can be recognised at the opening of the
Concerto's first movement ('Overture') but the mood soon darkens. The period
of composition was marred for Lambert by the deaths of his father and of two
close friends, the painter Cristopher Wood and the composer 'Peter Warlock'.
The jazz Lambert sound is soured. The last movement, a loving elegy, almost
suggests that Duke Ellington's Mood Indigo has been transformed into a
funeral march. Ian Munro was the persuasive soloist. He and his colleagues
must see to it that the Concerto is restored to the repertory, where it
rightly belongs.
Walton's Facade in the original version with speakers - Linda Hirst and
Thomas Hemsley - was, I understand, the group's first attempt at this
popular extravaganza. well It cannot, I fear, be called a total success. The
amplification too often distorted the speakers voices (they deserved a
kinder fate), balance favoured the instruments. The conductor, Stephen
Dummer, will surely persuade the players that in Facade at least they are
accompanists, not competing soloists. Dynamics throughout were ferocious.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: A theatrical windfall - A look at the drama of a
legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peggy Ramsay was the leading theatrical agent of her generation. Most major
playwrights of the past 30 years - Ayckbourn, Hare, Willie Russell, Brenton,
Orton - were her clients. Like many people who pretend to despise money she
left a fortune, well over Pounds 1m, when she died in 1991. And since the
theatre was her life, she has ensured that her legacy is being poured back
posthumously into drama.
'Celestial re-distribution' was how David Hare described it. He is one of
the trustees of the Peggy Ramsay Foundation and on Monday will announce the
winner of the biggest annual prize in British theatre, Pounds 50,000, to
help give a decent production to a promising new play.
Thanks to a deal with Ramsay's successor company, Cassarotto-Ramsay, the
foundation will also receive half the royalties from the plays that Ramsay
helped to create, which will be available as hand outs to indigent writers,
but the bulk of her money will go towards the Peggy Ramsay Play Award.
Six theatres, from London fringe to the National Theatre, from provincial
studio to the Royal Exchange, Manchester, will be asked to apply each year
for the money by submitting the script of a new play they are planning to
produce. The most exciting project will get the Pounds 50,000. It could be
written by Ayckbourn or Hare, though that is unlikely. The aim is to
encourage playwrights where it matters: in the quality of the production.
The following year six different theatres will be asked to tender and so it
goes on.
Introducing the prize, David Hare was droll about Ramsay; about the chaos of
her office, about her even handed toughness towards her writers. The
reputation of the playwright did not weigh with her at all; the play was
everything. Hare said that finishing a play had a special excitement then
that can never be recaptured: the knowledge that Peggy would now see it. Her
impartial judgment was unquestionable.
Hare told of Peggy Ramsay's reaction when, for the first time, one of his
plays was to be presented in New York. She reckoned this to be the highlight
of any writer's career and insisted that he should go over to see it, and
enjoy the experience. She hunted around her desk for some money, and came up
with a wallet which, on later examination, contained Dollars 2,000, enough,
she said, to buy a girl as partner for the first night party. 'If I'd taken
her advice I might have written Pretty Woman', said Hare, ruefully.
The unusual thing about this new prize is that the trustees seem anxious
that the winners should have some fun. If a fringe theatre (where new
productions rarely cost more than Pounds 20,000) wins, then it can spend the
rest of the money on other ventures. There are few restraints; few provisos.
This is spare cash, a windfall from the dead, that will help to fructify the
theatre of the future.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Poet emerges from a Celtic twilight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLECTED LETTERS OF WB YEATS: VOL. III 1901-1904 edited by John Kelly
and Ronald Scuchard Oxford Pounds 35, 760 pages
If Yeats is anyone to go by, great poets are not always great spellers:
'Dear Lady Gregory: A great many thanks for the wine &amp; the other things  -
all things I am very glad of. I am eating one of the biskets, now while I am
writing, eating it with my coffey. I send you a new press cutting which
belongs I suppose to the theatre book. I cannot find the slip of paper on
which I wrote Sharps referance for Deirdre Children so I have asked him to
give me the referance again.'
That was in December 1901 when Yeats, a bachelor aged 36, lived in London
where he was a tireless worker on behalf of the Irish Literary Theatre
(which became the Abbey Theatre), having earlier published his book on The
Celtic Twilight. Here he is suggesting to Lady Gregory that in her
compilation of Irish folk legends she recounts what happened to Deirdre's
children after their mother's death.
Deirdre - torn between two ferocious men - became in the writings of Lady
Gregory, Yeats, Synge and Russell an emblem of Ireland's destiny. Deirdre
was also re-worked by William Sharp, a Scot who had jumped onto the Celtic
Twilight bandwaggon as the female poet 'Fiona Macleod'. In this guise he
sent Yeats a copy of From the Hills of Dream. Yeats, fully aware of the
author's real identity, replied: 'My dear Miss Macleod, I have been a long
while about thanking you for your book of poems, but have been shifting from
Dublin to London and very busy about various things - too busy for any quiet
reading.'
Sharp is but one of dozens of now forgotten figures who crowd in on Yeats's
early letters. Yeats wrote to anyone whom he thought might further the cause
of Irish Renaissance, especially people prominent in the theatre -
actor-managers like Frank Benson and Mrs Patrick Campbell, who toyed with
the idea of performing the Countess Cathleen but nothing came of it.
Maybe she was put off by Yeats's insistence at this period that his poetry
should be enhanced by chanting and accompanied by the twanging of a
psaltery. Letters to Arnold Dolmetsch, the early music expert, contain
arrangements for tuition in this instrument. Yeats also undergoes
instruction as a member of the Golden Dawn, an occult society, whose members
had to submit to strenuous examination and were graded according to their
mystical attainments.
Other correspondents who have stood the test of time better are Bernard
Shaw, whom the Irish theatre originally rejected but then tried to rope in
with a performance of The Devil's Disciple; and the Fay brothers, who took
over the administration of the theatre when it became established. There
were constant squabbles over policy. Letters to the young Joyce show Yeats
offering advice and practical help when Joyce came to London, although Joyce
had poured scorn on the theatre when he was still in Dublin. George Moore
also appears as an early supporter and then a dissenter.
Not all of Yeats's heroines at this time came out of Celtic mythology. There
was the flesh and blood Maud Gonne who fiercely espoused the cause of Irish
independence though she was not by origin Irish, being the daughter of a
London-born captain in the British army. Yeats had met her in 1899 and fell
under the spell of this strong, beautiful woman who was a confirmed
militant; 'the troubling of my life began', he said of her impact on him. In
this volume she goes on stage and acts the role of Cathleen ni Houlihan in
Yeats's play of that name in 1902; and in the following year she marries
Major John MacBride, who had led the Irish brigade in South Africa on the
side of the Boers.
By then she had already had two children by a French lover. Yeats was
ignorant of them, but was devastated by her marriage. 'I feal (sic) somehow'
Yeats writes to Lady Gregory in 1903 'that the Maud Gonne I have known so
long has passed away.' It was true; but after her legal separation from her
husband in 1905, Yeats resumed relations with her. There is good reason to
believe they did later become lovers. By the end they were at odds again
when Yeats became a Senator and she became a member of the IRA. In 1922 her
house in Dublin was raided by the Black and Tans. All her papers were
destroyed including her letters from Yeats.
Those letters are missing links in this otherwise wonderfully complete
edition. The volume traces Yeats's emergence from the melancholy Celtic mist
to his belief in the power of will, leading to those attitudes to literature
and modern Irish history that were to flower so splendidly in his later
poems. The editors have fulfilled the task of providing a footnote for every
recipient and obscure reference superbly which renders the volume slow
reading, but it should delight all Yeats admirers.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Failed hero of the Risorgimento
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MAZZINI by Denis Mack Smith YUP Pounds 19.95, 302 pages
Looked at from this distance Italy's Risorgimento - its struggle for liberty
and nationhood in the 19th century - has epic proportions. It has heroes
too: the consummate statesman Count Camillo Cavour; the swashbuckling
warrior Giuseppe Garibaldi; and the exiled theorist of revolution, Giuseppe
Mazzini. Denis Mack Smith has already written biographies of the two former.
In this account of the life and work of Mazzini he completes a triad of
studies of modern Italy's founding fathers.
This is not, however, so much a biography as an apologia for Mazzini. Mack
Smith's aim is to improve Mazzini's reputation. For Mazzini both preached
and practised armed revolution, to which some of his followers added
assassination, yet in all his endeavours, including his ultimate aim of an
Italian republic, he failed. Cavour and Garibaldi were far more
consequential actors in Italy's drama. As the tumult of the Risorgimento
recedes, their stature has grown while Mazzini's has diminished.
Mack Smith attempts to adjust this balance by giving us a laudatory account
of Mazzini as man and politician. He shows how Mazzini's writings inspired
patriots within Italy and their sympathisers elsewhere in Europe, and how
this contributed to the liberation movement's eventual success. He describes
how Mazzini's personal example of austere dedication commanded admiration,
especially during his long years of exile in London.
Mazzini was born in Genoa in 1805. While studying law he joined the
Carbonari, a secret society dedicated to overthrowing Austrian domination in
northern Italy. He was betrayed, imprisoned, and exiled. Disliking the
Carbonari's practice of rituals and initiations, he joined other exiles in
founding the Young Italy movement, and made himself instantly famous by
sending an open letter to King Charles Albert of Piedmont calling for the
liberation and unification of all Italy. The King promptly threatened to
imprison him if he ever returned.
Young Italy activists unsuccessfully ventured a number of armed uprisings in
the following years. Mazzini had to vary his place of exile from France to
Switzerland and then London. He was repudiated by Cavour because of his
commitment to revolution and his unwilling association with such events as
Felice Orsini's assassination attempt upon Napoleon III, in which a bomb
missed the Emperor but killed eight bystanders instead.
For a brief moment in 1849 Mazzini tasted power. The Pope fled Rome, and for
some months the eternal city was ruled by a triumvirate with Mazzini at its
head. But French troops restored the Pope and Mazzini had again to flee. It
was not quite his only appearance on the legitimate political scene: in his
absence Messina voters twice elected him Parliamentary deputy, but the vote
was each time disallowed.
When Cavour and Garibaldi at length liberated and unified Italy Mazzini was
a mere spectator. His labours had helped to fertilise the fruits they
reaped, but there was still no place for him in the new Italy. He swallowed
his republican sentiments and accepted the monarchy of Victor Emmanuel II,
returned secretly to his native country to die in 1872.
Mack Smith is right to claim that Mazzini's writings and personality are his
chief legacy. People as various as John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and
Friedrich Nietsche greatly admired him, and the foreign dynasties which
ruled in divided Italy feared his influence. His book The Duties of Man
confirms all testimonies to the potency of his mind and bearing.
But Mack Smith's portrait is too much a eulogy. It lacks discussion of the
shadows and doubts that put a human being into three dimensions. One cannot
admire Mazzini, as Mack Smith would have us do, on the basis of mere
sketches of his character given in the one-liners of contemporaries. The
strength of this book lies elsewhere, in its telling of the complicated
story of the Risorgimento and its diaspora of exile. Mazzini's central part
in that story, his outer life, is here in full; but the passionate and
lonely exile himself seems strangely absent.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Diplomatic diary dodges the issues - Malcolm
Rutherford awaits conclusions from an ambassador dogged by late development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANDARIN by Nicholas Henderson Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 517 pages
Sir Nicholas Henderson has written a curiously old-fashioned diary about his
life and times as a British Ambassador, all of them spent in relatively
mainstream places - Warsaw, Bonn, Paris and Washington, in that order.
The final entry, after his departure from Washington in 1982, notes
suggestions from friends that he ought to have reached some conclusions: for
example, on 'the conduct of diplomacy in the modern age'. He rejected the
advice and ends with a French postcard featuring an ageing lion next to what
looks like a shaggy dog. The caption is La retraite a 60 ans.
Possibly the conclusions will come in another volume, for Henderson is a
prolific writer and also a late developer. Mandarin drops a lot of names and
a few clangers - like listening to jazz at the Reservation (sic) Hall in New
Orleans.
The book tells some good stories, several of them about Edward Heath. When
the former prime minister arrived at the Gare du Nord in Paris on his way to
collect an honorary degree at the Sorbonne, the porter recognised him: 'Je
vous connais, n'est-ce pas? Vous etes Mr Harold Wilson.' And when Henderson
told Harold Macmillan that what Heath lacked was the influence of a good
woman, Macmillan replied thoughtfully that a bad woman would be even better.
Social details are carefully observed. The ambassador was not surprised to
read that one of the few frivolous activities Margaret Thatcher had
undertaken at Oxford was to learn ballroom dancing because he had already
danced with her in Washington when Ronald Reagan failed to ask her.
Some of the entries are more serious: for instance, a visit to Francois
Michelin in Clermont-Ferrand. Probably no foreign diplomat had met the old
tyre-maker before. Michelin told Henderson that the French problem was that
the people were not inventive; the education system did not encourage it.
Yet here there is a problem of a different kind. What was the ambassador
doing in Clermont-Ferrand in the first place? Apparently he went out of his
own admirable curiousity. Michelin had recently given an unprecedented
interview to Paris Match about labour troubles at the plant: Henderson read
it only afterwards.
This late development dogged, possibly made, his career. When Henderson
arrived as ambassador to Bonn in 1972, he reported to London that the German
government 'now regarded the British government as the ally with whom they
spoke first and whose views they expected to be closest to their own'. Some
of us who were there at the time pointed out that he might be pushing it a
bit. Yet it took several years - and a promotion to Paris - for him to
realise that the Franco-German relationship (Brandt-Pompidou, then
Schmidt-Giscard) would go on maturing. Like most of the British diplomats of
his generation, he fails to address why they were none too keen on European
union at the start.
There are other lacunae. Henderson noted with surprise that some of the
French regions have similarities with the German Lander. Doesn't the Foreign
Office teach anybody anything, or don't young diplomats travel? He was also
taken aback by the fact that Britain's integration with the European
Community could be held up by exchange rates and the weakness of sterling -
see his account of Heath's visit to Bonn in 1973.
Later he learned from the experience. In his valedictory letter to the
foreign office from Paris he wrote of how Britain's relative economic and
industrial decline was bound to hamper the country's diplomacy. The report
was published in The Economist, yet must have been perfectly obvious to
anyone who had read the magazine (let alone the Financial Times) over the
years. Still, it was greeted as a revelation and Henderson went on to
Washington.
Possibly he spent too long abroad. His remarks about the home country are
frequently disparaging, if true. 'London,' he noted in 1982, 'with holes in
the roads and piles of bricks and corrugated iron on many abandoned building
sites, the warning lights half fused, has a third world look about it'. A
decade earlier he had been scarcely aware of the three day week.
His most illuminating comment on his role as an ambassador is that while he
was in Paris nobody in London suggested he should do anything in particular.
So he made up the job as he went along. He was a great success with people
and one should not underestimate the ambassador's role as host, especially
in Paris and Washington. But a final chapter on what it was all about and
how to do better in future might help.

THE WATERWORKS by E L Doctorow Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 246 pages
THE ALIENIST by Caleb Carr Little, Brown Pounds 16.99, 534 pages
NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG by Barbara Vine Viking Pounds 15, 326 pages
It is good to be reminded of the joy, the fun, the satisfaction of a good
novel which sweeps you along, engrosses, persuades you to ignore The Nine
O'Clock News and forget about walking the dog. EL Doctorow is an old master
of this art - remember Ragtime, The Book of Daniel, Billy Bathgate and the
rest? - and now, with The Waterworks, he repeats the trick.
The scene is New York in 1871, when the city was controlled by the notorious
Boss Tweed. The narrator, crusty City Editor of the Telegram, worries about
the disappearance of one of his young reporters, Martin Pemberton; he
discovers that Pemberton has seen his dead father, Augustus, dealer in
slaves and shoddy war supplies, who had mysteriously died without his
criminal fortune.
Martin, followed by his editor and by the only uncorrupt captain in New
York's Municipal Police, sets off in pursuit of the conspiracy and comes
upon a surgeon of evil genius, Dr Sartorius, and the orphanage where the
wretched street urchins of the city are used in order to provide a promise
of eternal life for rich old men who are reluctant to die.
This is not a ghost story, as at first seems possible ('ghosts don't come in
crowds'), but it certainly has a rich strain of the Gothic. It is a vivid
tale, told with a pace and a relish to suspend our disbelief most willingly.
Doctorow's central character is not so much Dr Sartorius as the New York of
those post-bellum years ('the soul of the city was always my subject . .
.'), and it is for this, not the plot, that this novel will be remembered.
My only objection is to Doctorow's excessive use of a caesura of
triple-dots, which stud every paragraph in a stylistic device which becomes
irritating rather than illuminative of a particular narrative rhythm . . .
By an odd coincidence, Caleb Carr's first novel, The Alienist, shares many
of Doctorow's subjects. A clumsy mix of psychological drama and historical
thiller, it recreates early New York (1896 this time) in extreme detail,
with a journalist-narrator, a corrupt police force, and abused children.
Even the Croton Reservoir water supply features again.
Theodore Roosevelt is Police Commissioner at the time, Dr Kreisler is an
'alienist', as the early psychiatrists apparently were called. With the aid
of New York's first woman cop and the narrator from the Times, they pursue a
serial killer who is hideously mutilating the children.
Unfortunately Carr, like many first-time novelists, feels obliged to throw
in everything he knows or has researched. The Alienist, absurdly over-long
and written in a style which has too little distinction, serves mainly to
prove how much he could learn from Doctorow.
The point of Ruth Rendell taking the alter ego pen name of Barbara Vine, as
I understood it, was that she would thereby cease to be confined by the
limits of the 'crime novel'.
Her latest, No Night Is Too Long, is a study - an unravelling - of a
bisexual love story with a heavy twist in the plot. Handsome young Tim
Cornish, frail in his sexuality, falls in love with palaeontologist Ivo
Steadman. Ivo only slowly returns the emotion, but narrator Tim thereupon
reverses - 'he loved me, therefore I loved him no longer'. And then, in
Alaska, Tim meets Isabel and, yes, falls in love with her. But wait - who is
Isabel?
That takes us to the halfway mark and Ms Vine has a long way to go. Either
you like this sort of thing or you don't. Her prose, as always, is cool,
elegant, entirely under control, a touch flat. The sex, both gay and
straight, will offend only the older great aunts. Suffolk is well done and
Alaska has been researched.
To me, it goes on too long, rather like the previous bestseller, Asta's Book
(just reissued by Penguin). I could not help feeling that this was a
spinning of words, cleverly and professionally done, but essentially unreal,
diverting us for a few hours but saying nothing to address our own
unfictitious lives. Many novels do.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Balancing act - Children's books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BROWNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A good children's picture book is not an illustrated story, and it is not,
as some adults think, just a handful of sentences with a few dazzling
pictures. Sendak describes the perfect picture book as a visual poem and
some are just that, while others are nearer to the art of film making. The
very best author-illustrators instinctively understand the subtle balance
between words and pictures.
John Burningham is one such author-illustrator and Courtney (Cape Pounds
8.99, 32 pages) is a truly interactive book - one that interacts with the
child's imagination. Courtney is a simple story about a mongrel who plays
the violin, cooks wonderful dinners and juggles to entertain the baby. It
sometimes seems that Burningham is seeing just how far he can go in
artlessness - his scratchy penlines, childlike crayoning and sketchy pencil
marks could easily appear crass, but it all works magnificently. His choice
of words demonstrates that, as well as an illustrator, he is one of the best
writers in the business. Truly a visual poem.
Posy Simmonds has produced another superb picture book with Bouncing Buffalo
(Cape Pounds 8.99, 24 pages). This tale of how two children save their
parents' ailing antique shop from the horrible Mr. Fowler is told in a
mixture of comic-strip and more conventional picture book style. The story
has an Ealing comedy feel and is told cinematically, with the rhythmical
balance of long shots and close ups, light and dark, and a stunning use of
contrasting emotional colours. The comic-strip form for children's books can
be tiresome, but Posy Simmonds understands just how to carry the flow of the
story with the text, the speech bubbles, and the illustrations all working
together. Most importantly, she leaves the vital gap between pictures and
words - the gap that is filled by the child's imagination.
Captain Abdul's Pirate School by Colin McNaughton (Walker Books Pounds 9.99,
32 pages), is a hilarious yarn from the diary of Maisy Pickles, whose
stinking dad sends her to stinking Pirate School to toughen her up. The
interest here lies not in the plot (pupils mutiny and sail for the West
Indies), but in the Bash Street humour and incidental details. I was
particularly pleased to meet Beryl Flynn sailing on The Golden Behind, and
to find out from the pirate teachers that six plus three equals about eight.
Colin McNaughton's bold line and wash style is perfect for the light story,
and deceptively well drawn.
Ted Dewan, who re-tells and illustrates Three Billy Goats Gruff (Scholastic
Pounds 8.99, 32 pages), is better known for his non-fiction but makes the
difficult leap from one genre to the other with ease. The book's subtitle is
'Three Strikes Year Out' and Dewan links the story tenuously with baseball.
The artwork has echoes of American comics rather than the Beano style that
influences so many British illustrators, and the tale comes across with a
real freshness due to the dramatic illustrations, the brash hand-written
lettering, and a funny lively text.
A Letter to Granny (The Bodley Head Pounds 8.99, 24 pages), written by Paul
Rogers, is the story of a girl's everyday world transformed by her
imagination. Lucy dreams of tomorrow when Granny will come, and that her
house is surrounded by sea. Inevitably, her parents do not notice. This
rather familiar tale is transformed, like Lucy's world, by John Prater's
stunning artwork. He uses soft pencil and bold, brilliant watercolour washes
to reflect the watery feel of the story perfectly.
One of the strengths of Walker Books is the design and My Cat Jack by
Patricia Casey (Walker Books, Pounds 7.99, 24 pages) is no exception. This
beautiful book is simply a celebration of the animal yawning, stretching,
scratching, purring and washing, with some of the best drawings of a cat I
have ever seen.
Anthony Browne's next book, King Kong, will be published by Julia MacRae
Books in October.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Travel: Island's subtle thrills - Alan Ponsford flies from
New York to Block Island for an uncrowded, unspoilt gentle holiday weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PONSFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We did not have to rent an aircraft. We had been going to pop down Madison
Avenue, nip over to Penn Station, take a train to New London and hop on a
ferry.
But our friend Jonathan is like that. By the time he drew up at the Mark
Hotel, squeezing through Manhattan's get-out-of-town Friday evening traffic,
he had switched to plan B. It had been a tough week; we would do it the easy
way - by air.
As we were swept across the Hudson in his chauffeur-driven car to New
Jersey's Teterboro airport, suspicions stirred: perhaps we had needlessly
wallowed the day away amid the Mark's elegant luxuries, especially its
renowned marble bathrooms, in anticipation of deprivations ahead.
But Jonathan's invitation for the Columbus Day weekend had, after all, been
to his wooden hide-away on Block Island. And Block Island, it seemed, was a
no-socks spot - more natural, basic, casual and unsophisticated than the
fashionable retreats of southern Long Island and off-shore Massachu-setts.
The whole New York metropolitan area was switching its lights on as our
little Piper Cherokee buzzed over the George Washington bridge, pointed at
Montauk on the eastern tip of Long Island. Fifteen miles farther north east,
Block Island was catching the day's final, faint glow as we landed.
In the terminal hut, Jonathan stretched across a rough counter, fished in a
hidden cigar box and extracted the keys of a car. A few bumpy minutes in the
old Subaru exposed the hide-away as an impressive, ample residence, with
huge sun-catching windows and multiple bathrooms. But his synopsis of the
island had been less sardonic.
These 11 square miles of the state of Rhode Island are a weekend and summer
playground for discerning escapists, a base and haven for east coast
yachtspeople and a second home for a few hundred mainlanders prepared to
expend more time, trouble and money than it takes to reach the more
conventional refuges.
Block Island does not flaunt the fruits of old money like the mansions of
Southampton, or indulge the extravagances of East Hampton's smart set. It
lacks the gay community of the more recently affluent and famous of Fire
Island. Strollers on Main Street do not nudge the shoulders of the sort of
celebrities who grace Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. But then they would
not want to. The thrills they seek are more subtle.
The island's unspoilt character is nurtured by a small, caring community.
They defend its beauty and character, not least for - and against - the
multitudes by whom they are mobbed for nine or 10 summer weeks. They are
proud that nature conservancy organisations own a fifth of the land,
including a wildlife sanctuary.
Typically, a public subscription has enabled them to move the long-disused
southern lighthouse back from the eroding Mohegan Bluffs. At the other end
of the island, North Light has been restored as a maritime museum complete
with working light.
The invading torrent had slowed to a trickle well before out arrival in
early October. After Labour Day, as in spring, the island is a gentle place,
its natural attractions better appreciated. Migrating birds drop in for a
rest, raising their population to 100 species. Monarch butterflies stop by
en route to Brazil. Fishermen can cast into the surf in peace after striped
bass and bluefish. The miles of excellent beaches see few swimmers.
Walking is a delight over the bluffs and dunes and along the narrow roads,
defined by low stone walls, nearly bereft of seasonal flocks of mopeds and
bikes. Save for a few Japanese black pines, most of Block Island's once
prolific trees long ago lost the battle with tearing Atlantic winds. The
remaining low scrub and pasture glow with honeysuckle, wild roses, viburnum
and Queen Anne's lace at their appointed times.
Many impressions of a colourful history survive. Names recall the early
settlement of Manissee Indians and the invading Mohegans; that of the island
itself was taken from Adriaen Block, a Dutch fur trader and navigator, who
landed in 1614.
Rocky coast, tall cliffs and old lighthouses suggest the piracy, smuggling
and shipwrecks of the 18th and 19th centuries. And the handsome legacy of
Victorian days, when the island became a fashionable resort for the wealthy,
are the imposing, prim hotels and inns that boarded them. Still thriving
around Old Harbor, they display the distinctive architecture of that era,
touched with the flavour of New England in wrap-around porches for
rocking-chair views of the passing scene.
At the poshest of them, a room with bath costs at least Dollars 150 (Pounds
100) a night in high season. But there are plenty of much cheaper boarding
houses and B &amp; Bs.
On Saturday morning's excursion into New Shoreham, the only town, trade was
slack in the crafts and souvenir shops and boutiques, but among hammocks,
brass lamps and sailbags in The Boat Works store we found honey mustard and
wildflower honey to take home.
We watched the car ferry from Point Judith, Rhode Island, tie up at State
Pier. It comes all year in about an hour (passengers: Dollars 6.60 one way).
The ferries from New London, Connecticut, and Newport and Providence, RI,
take longer and do not operate in winter.
The summer ferry from Montauk berths at New Harbor, within the
nearly-land-locked Great Salt Pond, so named by early settlers, which
provides anchorage for up to 2,000 sailboats at peak weekends. Alone among
deserted moorings, Jonathan's cat-boat bobbed, forlorn, awaiting his guests.
Alas, lunch with his Saturday cronies proved too convivial. Anchored on
barstools at The Beachead, a jostling yet laid-back establishment across the
road from a sandy shoreline, we indulged excessively in the luscious local
seafood, which is the mainstay of the varied, all low-key, restaurants.
The Americans drank near-frozen Bass, the Brits martinis. Among the former,
extolling the simple life, Joe from deepest Connecticut struck me as an
artist - until he identified himself as a dealer in coffee futures and in
search of someone to buy a half share in his private aircraft. Even Block
Island must defer to the real world.
The train fare from New York to New London is Dollars 64 return. A chartered
aircraft from Teterboro costs Dollars 400; from the nearest mainland points:
Dollars 40 per person, minimum Dollars 80.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Travel: Unprepared for the shock of the mighty Parana - Tom
Fort explores a thundering river in the Brazilian rainforest and hears tales
of things curious and inexplicable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seen from above, the great river wound in easy curves through the dull green
of the forest - like an anaconda, I thought, wishing vainly that a more
startling metaphor would come to mind.
It was terracotta in colour, thick with the red earth washed down by the
rains 1,000 miles to the east. The aircraft wheeled, and the river burst
into foam over the fabled Falls of Iguacu. Several Germans, bristling with
cameras, rushed to the windows to obtain views. My own was blotted out by a
backside in green stretch pants.
Alas, poor Niagara, Mrs Roosevelt sighed when she saw the Iguacu falls. And
they are an astounding sight, curving in a tumultuous bow from the Brazilian
to the Argentine banks of the River Iguacu. The cataracts - nearly 300 of
them - extend over two miles, broken by islands and outcrops. The grandest,
part-obscured by the plume of spray drifting skywards to form an
ever-present cloud, is tight against Brazilian soil.
As if resentful of this, the Argentines have built a squat, modernistic
intruder of a hotel below the falls. Brazil's elegant answer is the Hotel
das Cataratas, a splendid confection in pink and white, like a wedding cake
deposited in the sombre green of the forest. It is a comfortable place,
thronged by a stream of tourists as constant as the thunder of the
waterfalls.
We were there for five days, which almost qualified us as residents. Our
purpose was to explore another river, into which the Iguacu debouches 15
miles downstream. This is the mighty Parana, which rises in central Brazil
and flows 2,000 miles until it joins the Uruguay in the estuary of the River
Plate, in Argentina.
This information I had from books. But nothing could have prepared me for
the shock as I stood beside the Parana for the first time. I was silent as I
looked across to Paraguay on the far side, half a mile or so away. Between
me and a country about which I knew little beyond the reputation of General
Stroessner, extended a brown, surging flood, marbled with competing
currents, boiling with terrifying whirlpools.
Had someone told me that its volume exceeded that of all the rivers of
Britain put together - or of Europe - I should not have been surprised, for
in places the Parana plunges to a depth of 600ft, and the water travels at a
terrific speed - the pace of a galloping horse would be near the mark.
The base for our operations was the whimsically-named Iate (Yacht) Club das
Cataratas. In idle periods when the fish were not biting - yes, I was there
to fish, and yes, there were many such periods - we would discuss with our
host, Edward, how he might stage the inaugural Iate Club regatta, a prospect
complicated by the certainty that any iate launched into the Parana would be
washed up in Argentina before a jib had been raised above a bowsprit.
The Iate Club is one of the more prestigious amenities of a town called Foz
do Iguacu. In times past, Foz was no more than a sun-drenched, slumbrous
frontier post. In those days, the Parana was rendered impassable a few miles
upstream by the Falls of Guayru. Now the biggest dam in the world stands
there, Itiapu, which supplies much of Paraguay and a sizeable slab of Brazil
with power.
Fifty thousand men came to build the dam, and turned Foz into a boom town.
Across the water is the Paraguayan town of Cuidad Presidente Stroessner,
whose tax-free shops and casinos keep the soaring bridge over the Parana
clogged with traffic. Visitors pour in to see the falls and the dam, and to
enjoy the attractions of Foz itself.
Among these, the chief appears to be sex at a modest price. The place is
studded with clubs - with subtle names such as Sex Appeal - which comprise
dance-floors infested with meagrely-dressed young girls, and knocking-shop
facilities through a side door. 'They'd be most offended if you thought they
were whores,' Edward explained. 'They call themselves programme girls. Lots
of men marry them. They make very good wives.'
More congenial by far were the restaurants with glistening, barbecued meats
carved from skewers on to your plate, and others where you dipped into an
earthenware pot bubbling with prawns, squid and mussels cooked in coconut
milk; and with everything that superb drink of Brazil, caiparinha: cane
spirit poured over crushed ice, sliced lemon and sugar.
On the river, we were whisked about in a high-powered speedboat with
cushioned seats and a box filled with ice and beer, piloted by Jorge, a
dark-skinned humorist with a gleaming set of teeth sent through the post by
a grateful client, and a bullet somewhere in his head, a legacy of a lawless
youth. With him, I gradually lost my nervousness of the Parana, though never
my awe.
Opposite Foz, on the Paraguayan shore, extended a succession of extravagant
villas, refuges - so we were told - of drug barons, arms dealers, and crooks
of every shade. Once downstream, the sub-tropical rainforest closed in on
the water, stretching away on either side into immeasurable distances. It
was a forbidding sight, this rearing barrier of bamboo and palm and tangled
trees with pale trunks, like bones.
One afternoon, we beached on the Paraguayan bank. We followed a path through
the trees, led by Edward brandishing a metal hook with which he said he
would fend off any of the numerous venomous snakes with which the forest
abounds. We saw none, nor any of the jaguars, pumas, tapirs or wild boar
reputed to lurk in the shadows. But we did come upon a strange institute of
learning, mouldering quietly in a clearing above the Parana.
It had been the home of Moyses Santiago Bertoni, a one-time Swiss anarchist
who had fled to South America and devoted the greater part of a lifetime of
awesome industry to studying the people, the customs, the creatures and the
plants of Paraguay. Here, stuffed on sagging shelves, was the residue of his
colossal library, 7,000 left out of 40,000 volumes.
A goodly portion he wrote himself - more than 500 hefty volumes:
dictionaries of the language of the Guarani Indians, studies of anthropology
and flora and fauna, all typed on a primitive machine given to him by
Theodore Roosevelt, and printed on his own press.
There were other relics of the wise man of Paraguay, as Bertoni's adopted
country knows him: his top hat, false teeth and visiting cards; and,
outside, the trees he planted, and his grave in a little plot to one side of
the pale blue and brown wooden house, together with those of three of his 13
children, and a great grand-daughter, only recently buried.
The sun was dying when we returned to the boat. As we made out way upriver
to Foz, Jorge related his own tales of things curious and inexplicable.
He told us of the woman who gave birth to a monkey; and another who
conceived a creature half-human, half-toad; and of a foreman at the dam who
had resigned because his wife had an affair with their mastiff, and produced
puppies.
He spoke without his usual smile, and it was not until we had left the
black, silent forest behind, and the lights of the town appeared, that we
were able to laugh again.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Outdoors: A ruthless way for a reign to end - Beekeeping /
Why the workers overthrow the queen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERRY NORTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lesson one for managing a colony of bees is that they are in charge and you
had better not forget it.
Lesson two is that you begin at the top of the hive and work downwards,
otherwise you disturb all the bees at once which may annoy them.
Lesson three is that you are entering a political economy of considerable
sophistication and a copy of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan might come in handy.
Inside the hive, communal life is hectic with the sap now coursing through
the Pennines and bright yellow or purple flowers are suddenly abundant.
Aubretia tumbles out of stone walls and each patch of spare ground offers a
welcome mat of dandelions and daisies. There is pollen to be had in sackfuls
and nectar flowing in even the least prized of flowers. After long months of
icy standstill, the hive's economy is booming so vigorously that it can
support 60,000 workers, which is 10 times its winter population.
As you look down on them at work, the wide image is of a bewildering mass
seething with bustle and muddle, like maggots in a fisherman's tin. But each
close-up reveals a skilled worker carefully side-stepping her neighbours as
she goes about her task with calm efficiency, and the pattern soon appears
of a densely-staffed Fordist workplace in which the ceaseless activity of
individual cell-polishers, guards, foragers and brood nurses contributes
precisely to the survival and welfare of the whole.
If you lift out the frames of comb one at a time and search long enough, you
may find one bee whose task never changes throughout her life. She is the
queen, the supreme economic decision-maker, the sole egg-layer, the absolute
ruler with power to ordain success or failure for the communal effort. It
can be difficult to spot her because, apart from her extra length, she looks
identical to the workers around her and tends to move in a cluster of
attendants who keep her hidden from view. But once you find her and follow
her apparently random progress, you can observe the policy of the hive
being, literally, laid down.
She glides over the face of the brood-comb, occasionally stopping to shimmy
her long abdomen backwards into an empty cell and lay a tiny white egg at
the bottom. She can, at will, lay up to 3,000 in a day. Or she can lay none.
It is a critical judgment and if she gets it right, then the changing size
of the workforce through the season will match the needs of the hive. There
are dangers on either side - if she lays too few eggs, she will leave the
hive understaffed during the honey-flow and unable to build up its stores;
while if she lays too many eggs, she will produce a surplus of mouths to
feed. It is a difficult balance to strike and in Buxton, Derbyshire, at the
very margin of survival, there is almost no room for error.
So while the hive is looking fine economically, there must be doubts about
the resilience of its political constitution which places all responsibility
on one pair of shoulders. Are the checks and balances in order? To put it
bluntly, what happens if the old girl loses her touch?
The answer is reassuring, except for the old girl in question. The social
contract among bees provides for absolute monarchy during a queen's reign
but permits her no part at all in the succession.
Exactly as set out in Leviathan, the sovereign's enjoyment of total power
may be brought to an abrupt end at any time by a deadly uprising of the mob.
It does not require a tumbril, merely the levelling stings of a dozen worker
bees and, once the deed is done, the mob turns from regicide to the
immediate production of a new queen of its choice.
It is a triumph of constitutional ruthlessness which rids the hive of
ineffective monarchs and spares it the embarrassment of useless heirs to the
throne. You do not need a microscope to see that honey bees are born without
forelocks.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Outdoors: Beetles on the menu - Country View
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was sitting in the kitchen reading the paper one evening last week. Almost
unnoticed it had become dark outside and I had the light on although the
curtains were still open.
Suddenly there was a loud clonk on the glass.
For a moment I was taken by surprise but then I realised that it must have
been a May bug or cockchafer beetle. These are scarab beetles, relatives of
the dung beetles, but are plant eaters.
While the May bug does a good job in keeping the countryside clean, chafers
can be harmful. The cockchafer grub is that white plump larva sometimes dug
up in the soil when gardening. These grubs feed on the roots of grasses,
cereals and soft fruit and, as they live underground for three years, they
can eat many roots in that time.
A good summer for cockchafers, when the female successfully lays many eggs,
can mean problems for farmers and market gardeners for several years.
Rooks are very fond of the grubs and do a good job of finding them in the
soil. In fact the cockchafer grub's nickname is 'rookworm' and rooks
probably do a great deal more good than harm in the fields.
The larvae finally turn into new chafers in the autumn but the beetles
remain underground until the following spring when, in May or early June,
they emerge from the soil and can be seen flying around the countryside.
They are large and heavy insects with thick brown wing cases which are held
open and clear of the wings when the beetle is in flight. Although they make
a loud and alarming buzzing sound and frequently crash noisily into objects
when flying around, these beetles are harmless to humans. As adults they eat
only a small amount of vegetable food, the foliage of deciduous trees, and
do far less harm than their offspring.
In fact cockchafers are a very important food source for several mammals.
Badgers eat large numbers of the larvae and, if they find an area where
these are prolific, they will turn over the grass and bore down through the
turf in their efforts to obtain them.
The damage to the grassland looks dreadful but they are doing a great deal
of good in the long term. It is rarely possible, however, to convince green
keepers and lawn lovers of this at the time of the damage.
Greater horseshoe bats specialise in eating cockchafers in the spring. And,
for a bat needing to eat half its own bodyweight every day, they must be a
valuable source of nutrition. The bats probably capture cockchafers on the
ground as they do beetles.
Both species make a loud buzz immediately before take-off and this will
attract the bat which then pounces, picking the beetle up and carrying it
off.
The bat only eats the soft parts and even a bat as large as the greater
horseshoe will often have to hang up to deal with an insect as big as the
cockchafer so that remains of wing cases and other hard bits collect
underneath a favourite perch.
Without bats to control cockchafer numbers, there could be many more grubs
feeding on many more roots. Consider for a moment, when you next eat
strawberries in the summer sunshine, that you may have bats to thank for
them.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Gardening: Chelsea blossoms in London's gloom - Robin Lane
Fox enjoys its variety and spectacle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
How can one Chelsea flower show be different from another? After 30 years,
surely we middling gardeners have seen it all before?
In fact, if you were there this week you probably saw more of it than usual
because the tickets, although limited, did not sell out in advance. If you
were not, you missed the usual acts of extravagance outside the main tent,
the perpetual threat of mud, and a marvellous range of exhibits inside which
would keep anyone going for the next few months.
Outside, horticultural bookseller Wells and Winter, of Mereworth, Maidstone,
Kent (tel: 0622-813627), was distributing lists of rabbit-proof plants, and
a diving girl in white marble had been sculpted with a trendy pair of
bathing shorts, while the theme gardens continued the new focus on
sufferers, whether blind, allergic or prison inmates.
The press proved to have pulled itself together and the Daily Express staged
a rather charming impression of a railway cottage's garden with eroding
rails, no timetable and a glimpse of what rail privatisation could mean for
a rural track.
Much the best garden, though, was the Daily Telegraph's abbey garden which
Julian Bannerman mounted with unusual flair on the difficult corner site.
For once, a theme garden was more than promotional hot air.
Bannerman assembled genuine fragments of medieval walling, pinnacles and
windows. Salisbury cathedral chipped in with lengths of superfluous
stonework, on offer to potential buyers, and I began to see a future for the
fabric of my Oxford college if the funds become much tighter. But it all
seemed like an abbey garden and, where the planting had come right on the
day, it maintained a style around 1900.
One of its best touches was the tall, white tobacco plants, but they had
come over at short notice from the Prison Service garden on the site
opposite.
HM's glasshouse director described how he and his staff grow fresh
vegetables for the major sites behind bars. When tempers rise in hot
weather, they can send in a fresh salad on demand to divert the inmates. In
the recent downpour, they could also lend bedding plants to the best of this
year's newspaper gardens.
Inside the tent, the scale and the spectacle still amaze me. I know that it
is the world's largest tent and that the aisles go on forever, from the
lupins on one side to hints for the disabled on the other. Just before
judging, it looks like a miracle as wave upon wave of flowers, stretching
further than the eye can see, await their prizes and a royal visit.
This year's stars were well commemorated. Woodfield Brothers, of Tiddington,
near Stratford-upon-Avon (0789-205618), crowned their superb display of new
lupins with a pale pinkish number called Gloria Hunniford. Peter Smith, of
Chanctonbury Nurseries, Ashington, West Sussex (0903-8 92870), is making
real progress with the size and colour of his hardy alstroemiras, and every
gardener now needs to consider them for new borders as they rise up the
social scale to the names of yet more princesses (including Elizabeth, a
superb, low-growing innovation).
The corner-piece of the S &amp; N Brackley (Wingrave, Aylesbury, Bucks
0296-681384) sweet pea exhibit was a big bowl of the latest pale pink
variety, named Kiri Te Kanawa for the 50th anniversary of the singer's birth
in New Zealand. Opera-going gardeners ought to go for this heavenly cut
flower with such an excellent scent.
Among the big set pieces, I need hardly say that the best was Notcutts
Nurseries of Woodbridge, Suffolk (0394-383344). Notcutts is master of the
huge exhibit, and this year it excelled among some strong competition
because it seemed to know how to arrange colours, keep out horrors and avoid
kitsch.
It staged a series of separate, adjacent colour schemes in a sequence that
developed as we walked round the ropes of the stand. It took us from pale
pinks to dark purples and reds and round again to fresh whites and a final
flourish of scented philadelphus to remind us of the summer ahead.
Notcutts placed colours to such advantage that it could even get away with
two of my personal hates, the pink cherry Kanzan and yellow-variegated Acer
drummondii. In context, even these brutes acquired a certain charm; but I
wish they had never appealed to so many of our town planners.
Since the mid-1980s, the smaller exhibitors are the people who have lifted
the show to a new quality and elegance. Gone are dreary old pans of alpines
and the seasonal clematis, shown on canes against canvas.
Exhibitors are marvellously clever at moving large climbers in full flower
and re-arranging them naturally: valley clematis managed tall, white arches
of the fragile vitichella forms, while Peter Beales Roses, of Attleborough,
Norfolk (0953-454707), even contrived to show a life-like arch of the
little, pink-flowered Himalayan musk roses which will not be climbing up my
beastly old conifers, or showing any colour, until mid-July.
At the lowest level, the Alpine Garden Society put on another of those
exhibits which emphasises its standing among our specialist groups. Its
president had contributed a plant of a heavenly white oxalis, collected
personally in the Falklands; and its Himalayan poppies were the best in the
show, including the rare red as well as the huge blues and the pale lavender
form.
These poppies are a heartache to me because they hate my dry soil. But I can
grow the encrusted saxifrages; their sprays of white flowers are so
obliging, yet used so rarely by keen gardeners who want to enliven the next
two weeks.
Perhaps it was a dark, rain-laden sky but my lasting impression from this
year lay with the many shade and damp-loving plants which the smaller stands
show to such perfection. The Paradise Centre, of Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk
(0787-269449) had even brought a perfect example of the white-flowered
Japanese glaucidium, which prefers woodland and is hardly ever a visitor to
Chelsea.
The many new and large-leaved hostas at Goldbrook Plants have totally
revived my interest and fondness in the family: Londoners in shade or with
large pots should pay special attention to the list from Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk
(037975-770).
Glebe Cottage Plants, of Warkleigh, North Devon (0769-540554) had caught the
dampness of the exterior with a splendid country planting of pale flowers,
unusual polemoniums, a wide carpet of moss, a half-open little gate, and a
pair of gardening boots.
I have concentrated on the showing because Chelsea is above all a show.
Anyone who thinks that many of its exhibits are somehow being bought in from
the market at short notice is very far off the mark.
There have always been some question marks and they have had their publicity
this year. But the fact remains that the majority of the exhibitors plan
their display for months, even years, in advance and try to excel in
everything for this one occasion, even though the Royal Horticultural
Society pays them nothing and they are not allowed to sell stock during the
main duration of the display.
The exhibitors this year were requested to display notices assuring the
public that everything shown had been grown or raised in the nursery itself.
To my eye, the fact has never been in doubt, because we are all being
transported briefly to heaven by the focused efforts of the most
whole-hearted growers in this country.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Outdoors: It rained and the salmon sulked - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since returning from a brief sortie to Scotland, I have been chewing over
weighty matters. Chief among them is a question with momentous implications:
should I take salmon fishing seriously?
The obstacles and objections are several and considerable. One is my
economic base, which is quite rocky enough under existing burdens; (and
serious salmon fishing tends to cost serious money). For another, it is an
austere and taxing business, and I am not at all sure that I am up to it.
The odd thing is that I should be entertaining the notion at all, in the
light of my experiences during 2 1/2 days on the Beauly, the famous Highland
river which runs into an extension of the Moray Firth just round the corner
from Inverness.
For, in the course of a good many hours of pretty single-minded fishing, I
caught precisely nothing. And - before you jump to unflattering conclusions
about my competence - no one else did much better. There were just four fish
for the week on the whole river.
I am happy to admit that factors only distantly related to fishing did
contribute to my enjoyment: the trip was free; the hospitality was
bountiful; the food in the lodge first rate, and the drink offered without
stint; the music of the rushing water outside my window soothed me into
deep, reviving sleep; the snow on the mountains, the sunlight on the green
valley and the sparkling water were lovely to behold.
Pleasant though all these were, what sticks in the mind is the river and
promise - alas unrealised - of that most thrilling of quarries, the spring
salmon. The beginnings, however, were unpromising. It was a three-jersey
morning, and I had on just one, plus a waxed jacket which was no longer
waxed and let the rain through. As a result of the weather, and standing in
waders up to my waist, I was reduced within hours to a state of shuddering
desolation. If this be salmon fishing, I remonstrated as I thrashed my 15ft
rod at the steely, freezing stream, you can keep it. Take me back to
England, fast.
Thereafter matters looked up. I borrowed another jacket, put on more
jerseys, and the sun came out. Faint memories of how to propel a salmon fly
a reasonable distance returned to me. I began to see the river, not as an
enemy, but as a great, vital force. And the idea of the salmon within it
took hold of my imagination.
It is a super river, the Beauly - big but not too big, blessed with
magnificent, sweeping pools and racing shallows. The bottom three miles,
down to Lovat Bridge at Beauly, is the best of it. The Middle and Upper
river are visually impaired by hydroelectric dams (which do, however, have
the benefit of ensuring constant flows even at times of severe drought).
More to the point, the Beauly is extremely productive, with around 1,100
fish last year.
That impressive tally reflects the profound changes which have overtaken the
river in the past four years. For centuries it had been the chief glory of
the great estates of the Frasers, until the late Simon Fraser sold it to a
property company for in excess of Pounds 10m. The subsequent revolution has
been inspired by the appetite of investors to see a return for their money.
Now, we all know that timeshare has become a dirty word. William Midwood -
the genial driving force behind the Beauly Fishings Company - winces at it,
and courteously insists that I call his customers syndicate rod holders. But
the essence is the same: salmon fishers with cash to match their passion are
wooed to part with big piles of the stuff, to obtain the right to fish one
of Scotland's great rivers.
A flat payment of roughly between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 70,000 secures a
particular week in perpetuity. Thus far, only the Lower River has been
syndicated (the Middle and Upper are available at rents of anything up to
Pounds 5,000 a week for five rods). Fifteen rods can fish the Lower River at
any one time, and almost all the rods in the prime time - which is July -
have been disposed of.
I do not propose to go into the controversial aspects of river syndication.
Many object to the hard-headed commercial exploitation which is essential to
it, and to the attitudes which the customers bring with them. In the case of
the Beauly, the company paid a huge sum and it needs to get a return on its
investment. There has been a massive investment in the river itself which
would have been inconceivable under the old system.
If William Midwood is able to restore the spring runs, he will be able to
sell more of his rods (by the way, if you are interested in any of this,
ring him on 0498-85393). But there is, too, a genuine longing - both in
Midwood and his ghillies and everyone else involved in the crusade - to do
improve things for the river itself.
I suppose I was infected by this enthusiasm, as I fished down the great pool
below the dam at Kilmorack; and down another beneath the frowning walls of
Beaufort Castle. There were few fish about but it was tremendous to be in
the water, powering out the line, seeing in the mind the swirl of the take,
hearing the protest of the reel. And I thought: if I had the money, I could
do worse than spend it here.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: Two hard Tests - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEON VILJOEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For England there is no respite. On Wednesday they were run close by Western
Transvaal, a provincial union so isolated and backward in the larger scheme
of things that its supporters proudly display giant flags of the old South
Africa.
England's tour of South Africa has so far proved a nasty shock to European
sensibilities. Which flag is which? And what to make of the 11 official
languages and the smell of cordite that follows them on to the rugby field.
England are supposedly testing the water ahead of next year's World Cup in
South Africa but they have hardly performed like potential world champions.
Thrown off balance by the aggression of their South African opponents, they
look vulnerable on the bone-hard playing surfaces of the high veld. Nor do
the rarefied air and the awkward bounce of the ball make survival any
easier.
They lost their first two games, to Free State and Natal. On Wednesday,
England looked no less tentative in their 26-24 victory over Western
Transvaal.
The one disruptive factor to which the English seem oblivious is the South
African ploy of speaking Afrikaans, to obscure lineout and other signals.
The language barrier may benefit Will Carling's charges. At least Victor
Ubogu, having not yet mastered Afrikaans swear words, has been unfazed when
singled out for verbal abuse. Physical abuse is another matter.
England's expanding casualty list, caused chiefly by the hard ground, as
much as their indifferent form, has convinced aficionados that their
two-Test challenge has already collapsed. If Free State and Natal can
dethorn the rose which such ease, surely South Africa will atomise them in
the internationals.
Two factors militate against this. Since its return to the world stage in
1992, South African rugby has been undermined by the very devices which
ensured survival through two decades of isolation.
The domestic Currie Cup competition has entrenched regional divisions to
such an extent that forging a new national entity may take years. Hard
evidence of the strength of provincial unions was provided by Transvaal's
win in the inaugural southern hemisphere Super 10 title last year, crushing
Auckland, from New Zealand, hitherto considered the best provincial team.
Two weeks ago Natal contested the second Super 10 final (albeit
unsuccessfully) against Queensland.
The South African captain, Francois Pienaar, was quoted in Australia as
saying that his provincial side, Transvaal, was a stronger unit than the
Springboks. This triggered a public outcry. Pienaar claimed he had been
misquoted, but whoever laid the words in his mouth was not far off the mark.
Had Pienaar not hurt his ankle the quote would almost certainly have
contributed to his losing the captaincy against England to fellow back row
forward, Tiaan Strauss.
The worst effect of the isolation era on the South African game has been an
erosion of refereeing standards. The comfy cocoon of so-called South African
invincibility was kept intact by officials badly out of step with world
standards.
This anomaly was exposed during the French tour to South Africa last season.
Like England, the Tricolores were no great shakes in the build-up to the
Tests, yet won the series 1-0, with a win and a draw.
South Africa could not adapt to the sudden return to an international
standard, applied by overseas referees in the Tests. I suspect England are
awaiting the arrival of the New Zealand referee Colin Hawke with
anticipation.
But poor refereeing does not explain why England have been so lacklustre.
Without the silky Jeremy Guscott, the backline appears wooden. Free State
played an attacking game to good effect by running first phase ball wide.
South Africa will also probe on the periphery, in part because they lack the
lineout forwards to match England.
South Africa's coach Ian Mclntosh, preoccupied with ball retention drills,
has been criticised for neglecting running rugby and the natural flair of
the South African three-quarters.
England might be looking increasingly dilapidated but South Africa's final
training session, with a bloated squad of 57 players, many of them injured,
sought refuge at a 'secret' venue; a sure sign of panic.
The Tests may turn on whether England can summon a heroic display from their
overworked pack. If England win another tryless victory, their fans can find
solace in the words of the late Boy Louw. Louw, one of South Africa's most
versatile forwards in the 1920s and 30s, was a national team manager with a
gift for the gab, if not for the English language.
Berated by the media after his team won by kicking all its points, Louw shot
back: 'Never mind. Just you looks at the scoreboard]'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: Mystery of the vanishing amateurs - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt the keen golf followers among you will be able to work out the
common thread that binds together the names of Duncan Evans, Martin
Thompson, Philip Parkin, David Curry, Paul Mayo, Stephen Dodd, Stephen
Dundas, and lain Pyman.
Equally, there is no shame in not having the faintest idea who half of them
are, let alone what fate has brought them together. Perhaps the cynical have
made a stab at the fact that, apart from Pyman who has only just joined the
paid ranks, they are all struggling professionals, in which case award
yourself one mark out of two.
The correct answer is that these are the British players who have won the
Amateur Championship since 1980 and, full of ambition and with dreams in
their heads, have gone on to turn professional.
A good point to start is 1980, because it was about then that the amateur
game had ceased to be any such thing and had evolved into a nursery for
budding professionals.
This year's Amateur Championship begins on Monday at the beautiful Nairn
golf club on the east coast of Scotland, and the average age of the 288
players from 19 countries who will try to win it will certainly be no more
than 25. It will be a surprise if the winner is over 21.
Next Saturday afternoon, he will come into the interview room and he will
say that it has always been his ambition to play in the US Masters; winning
the amateur gains an invitation to Augusta next April. Shortly thereafter he
will be faced with the tricky decision of either turning professional or
waiting until the completion of the Walker Cup the following September.
Great things will be predicted for him and maybe he will allow himself to be
carried away by some of them. So let me introduce a note of caution: just
study that list of winners again. They are not exactly household names.
Indeed, only Mayo is currently playing regularly on the European tour, and
no one would consider him anything other than a journeyman.
Some of the failures have been spectacular. Evans, after a particularly
unhappy time as a pro, was reinstated to the amateur ranks, and for a while
was working in a fish and chip shop. Parkin is perhaps the biggest mystery
of all. In his first event as a professional he finished in a tie for 81st
in the Open at St Andrews.
Two years later, at Turnberry, he was lying 10th with three holes to play,
before finishing bogey, double bogey, par to drop back to 21st. Who would
have thought that eight years on, as the Open returns this July to the Ailsa
course in Ayrshire, that Parkin would have no tour card, and would be
reduced to lining up in the Open regional qualifying stages?
Dodd and Dundas are assistant professionals, their aspirations of playing
the tour having regressed to the point where no one calls them 'promising'
any more.
Going slightly further back, there is the case of Trevor Homer, who won the
Amateur not once but twice in three years in the early 1970s. But his
professional career was a failure. He applied for reinstatement, and was so
disillusioned with the game that he did not pick up a club for almost 15
years.
Of the three overseas players who have won the Amateur since 1980, and have
tried their hand at the professional game, Christian Hardin from Sweden, and
Rolf Muntz from the Netherlands can only be said to have added their names
to this mysterious litany of failure.
Why does it all go wrong? Most often, and certainly in the cases of Evans,
Homer and Dodd, they make a bad start and when what little sponsorship
revenue they have managed to cobble together runs out, they become trapped
in a vicious cycle where the pressure to make money strangles their golf.
All the same it is baffling, at a time when a distinguished amateur career
is accepted as a landmark towards professional success, that winning the
biggest amateur event can mean so little.
There is, however, one glorious exception. In 1984 at Formby Jose-Maria
Olazabal, having defeated David Gilford in the semi-finals, beat Colin
Montgomerie in the final.
Still, it is sobering to reflect that he is the first winner of amateur
golf's premier event to go on to achieve a major championship victory since
Lawson Little, Amateur Champion in 1934 and 1935, won the US Masters in
1940.
