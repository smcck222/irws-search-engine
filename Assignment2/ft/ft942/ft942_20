FT  28 MAY 94 / Motoring: A safe ride in the ultimate boy racer

The sad thing about Ford's Escort RS Cosworth is that most of the young who
lust after it cannot afford to buy one. Even if they could fund its purchase
 -Pounds 25,175, or less than half the price of an equally unattainable
Porsche 911 - it is unlikely they could insure it.
Picture the scene. A 21-year-old, with a couple of expensive accident claims
under his belt, walks into an insurance company.
As soon as he mentions he is seeking cover on a fat-tyred vehicle of 227
horsepower, with a monstrous rear spoiler and a top speed of 140mph
(225kph), what happens? The motor policies manager either gives a hollow
laugh, tries to hide under the desk, or runs screaming from the office.
Thus, very few examples of the Escort RS Cosworth are likely to end up in
the hands of those who would relish most the thought of driving them.
Does this mean, then, that it is an inherently difficult, even dangerous,
car? The answer is: absolutely not. Used responsibly, there can be few safer
for all kinds of journeys on motorways, main and minor roads.
The Escort RS Cosworth is the latest version of a vehicle that was created
to win motor sport honours for Ford. In essence, it consists of the
mechanicals of a Sierra RS Cosworth 4 x 4 tucked away in an Escort body
shell. Like all previous Escorts, it has done well in international
rallying; it won this year's Monte Carlo.
The road-going model I drove in Luxembourg and Germany last week, although
much tamer than the rally car, is a formidable performer. It will catapault
from 0-60mph (96kph) in 5.7 seconds and, more meaningfully, accelerate in
fourth gear from 30-60mph (48-96kph) in 9.4 seconds. In practice, this
spells safe, swift overtaking on wet or dry roads.
It also spells temptation. I really disapprove of people who drive fast and
grippy cars on country roads at speeds more appropriate to a rally special
stage. And what did I do in the almost traffic-free lanes criss-crossing
Luxembourg's woods and fields? You have guessed. I yielded to temptation,
although only where sight lines on bends made it safe to do so.
I discovered that the Escort RS Cosworth 4x4, on its specially developed
Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres, has extraordinary cornering powers. It is easier
to drive fast on slippery roads than any other car I can think of. And,
however much you exploit its turbo-charged muscle, the sophisticated
transmission defeats wheel spin.
What is it like to drive at more sensible speeds? The ultra-low profile
tyres are less than half as high in cross-section as they are wide.
Inevitably, they tend to 'tram-line' - that is, follow ridges in the road -
and rough surfaces are heard as well as felt.
Both the engine and power-assisted steering respond instantly; the anti-lock
brakes are powerful; and the five-speed transmission smooth without being
exactly silky. Conversation became difficult on the autobahn at close to
maximum speed, but at 80-85 mph (128-137kph) the engine sang sweetly and not
at all noisily.
Changes to the power plant include using a smaller turbo-charger. Peak power
and maximum torque (pulling power at a given speed) are the same as before,
but are developed at lower revolutions. This makes the Escort RS Cosworth as
driveable as a family car in town traffic.
The luxury-trim version I tried sets you back Pounds 24,775. With optional
extra leather seats, air-conditioning and passenger air-bag, it would cost
Pounds 27,005 - still very reasonable. The spoiler might come in useful as a
table for plates of food at race meetings but, otherwise, seems pointless.
It is part of the package, but Ford makes no charge for leaving it off.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Sport: The captain plays a straight bat - Cricket / Teresa
McLean meets Mike Atherton and finds a tired, careful young man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cold morning, an almost empty Lancashire ground, a cup of grey coffee  - I
was not surprised Mike Atherton looked tired. After all that Test match
excitement, an interview in this setting was likely to feel a bit flat.
Nevertheless, he smiled, wearily, and said: 'Fire away.'
I asked him, first, what he thought of the press. He considered the
question. Atherton talks cricket like he plays it, keeping quiet while he
thinks and when he has no more to offer. His answer was careful.
'Generally, I think when you start a new job that they give you a bit of a
honeymoon period. At the end of last summer and for most of the winter, I
think they've been pretty fair with me. A little bit of 'amateur at
bed-time' about some of the players at one point: I thought some of the
criticism was a bit unfair and I said so after the (Test) in Barbados. But,
on the whole, not too bad.'
Atherton is obviously a man with battle plans for all occasions, including
publicity. He does not talk with any suggestion of confidentiality or
intimacy: he simply gives his views. To know more about what lies behind
them, you would have to know him better which, I suspect, would not be easy.
'Do you like being captain of England?' I asked.
'It's been an enjoyable experience so far (although) I'm sure there'll be
tougher times ahead. I'm not going into it thinking, you know, I must be
captain of England at all costs. I'll give it my best shot and if I get
slapped down or get the sack, then so be it.'
Whether Atherton really is so resigned to his fate, whatever that might be,
is hard to tell. At present, he is captain of England and his batting seems
to thrive on all the pressure that brings. The harder the going, the harder
it is to get him out. His defiant 144 in the second Test at Georgetown,
Guyana, is just one among many examples of this on the recent West Indian
tour.
Then, too, only time will show if his leadership also thrives on a struggle
as did that of Ray Illingworth, England's clever captain in the late 1960s
and early 1970s and now the chairman of selectors - Atherton's overseer. Or
whether it will wilt under the strain, as did the plain leadership of his
predecessor as captain, Graham Gooch.
Both Illingworth and Atherton - who looks younger than his 26 years - are
strong characters, and an element of disagreement over the teams they choose
is inevitable. It might even be a good thing so long as it does not make
either of them resentful when they fail. I think Atherton would enjoy
proving himself with a team not entirely of his choosing; fighting against
the odds within the system. Also, it would give the team more freedom, not
feeling they belonged to a one-man band.
Atherton had no doubt that Gooch was an asset in the team, not a rival, but
agreed it had been an advantage in taking over when things were in a bad
way. 'Yes, I think so . . . Graham had had some successful years, but we'd
just been beaten by Australia and India so we were at a fairly low point.
Hopefully, the only way you can go is up and I think, hopefully, people will
give me a little bit of time.'
Time for what?
'The most important thing that has come out of my time as captain so far is
learning about the players, about their character, whether they're up to it
. . . you know, when the going gets tough, who comes through and who
doesn't'
Preferring not to name anyone specifically, Atherton declared himself keen
to get the best out of all his players this summer. 'We should do well in
the early part of this summer. We've got the ability to beat New Zealand if
we play well.'
He was more guarded, but also more enthusiastic, about South Africa. 'That
series should be a very enjoyable and competitive one . . . I think it'll
capture the public's imagination. They've already sold out the tickets for
all the matches.'
At this point I dropped my handbag, which spilled its bits and pieces all
over the floor. Atherton picked up one or two of them for me, a bit
uncertainly. Somehow, it was almost a relief to see him for a moment with
his composure slightly ruffled. It would be sad to think that he has learnt
to defend himself completely against all spontaneity. I have no doubt,
though, that he does well to guard his natural privacy.
He was non-committal about the personal pressures of top-level cricket,
mentioning only the large number of meetings as something he found
particularly annoying. But he did say that a short sabbatical every so often
might be a good idea.
'The programme over the next two or three years is a very tiring one. People
who are involved in international cricket, after three or four years, might
find themselves in need of a couple of months off. But that's not the case
yet.'
Not a bad plan, but one which the cricket authorities would probably find a
nightmare to put into practice. At least they can rest easy that Atherton is
happy so far and continues to be dedicated to Test cricket - which he
describes as 'the real test of a top-class player'.
He did not just smile, he beamed, without pausing for thought, when he told
me that while the short, highly-strung character of one-day cricket can
sometimes make it more fun, 'the real number one is Test cricket. All the
players prefer Test cricket'.
A set of good, hard fights this summer, brightened with some victories,
should bring out the best in Atherton, with hopes of more, tougher and
better things to come.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (Great British Eating): A tight grip on a
growing market - In a new series, Nicholas Lander samples oysters and is
told they are good for the diner and the restaurateur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Nature gave us the best shellfish in the world and my objective is to
supply it and serve it as nature intended.'
With these words Johnny Noble, a partner in the Loch Fyne Oyster Company, 50
miles north of Glasgow on the west coast of Scotland, tucked into a plate of
nine gigas oysters.
Viewed from the low, white-washed restaurant that today constitutes the Loch
Fyne Oyster Bar, but 15 years ago was a run-down farm building, nature could
not be improved on. In early May the sky was as blue as the loch, in which
2m oysters nestled. The lamb-covered hills rose sharply to the Highlands
beyond which still revealed snow.
Oyster bars, in which you can enjoy half a dozen molluscs and a half of
porter, are considered archetypically British but the figures do not bear
this out.
In 19th century Britain, oysters were cheap and plentiful. In Charles
Dickens' Pickwick Papers, written in 1836, Sam Weller talks of 'poverty and
oysters' and, as a nation, we then consumed 1,800m a year. Then pollution
and a nasty disease, binomia, which hit the native oyster beds that
flourished in the River Helford, Cornwall, off Colchester, Essex and
Whitstable, Kent, decimated stocks. As Noble says: 'Oysters became scarce,
then expensive and so became toffs' food.' Today, the French consume 2,000m
oysters a year while British consumption is up from 4m, 10 years ago, to 20m
today.
Loch Fyne now breeds and sells more oysters than anyone else in Britain but
it dates back only to 1978 when a chance meeting between Noble and Andrew
Lane, a marine fish farmer, led to the purchase of 10,000 seed oysters from
Guernsey.
A series of disasters then ensued. The seed oysters did not survive the year
and strong tides washed away the wooden poles supporting the oysters.
These problems were solved after Lane's visits to oyster beds at Arcachon
and Brittany in France. Lane switched to the gigas oyster and to a method of
rearing which involved metal trestles laid on the loch, retrieved at low
tide by tractor. To survive financially they realised they would have to
ship their oysters to London but were hampered by British Rail's insistence
on classifying their oysters as 'cattle and livestock'.
Today, Loch Fyne's annual turnover is more than Pounds 4m. Every afternoon
three refrigerated lorries leave for their two other oyster bars in
Nottingham and Elton, Peterborough, and for top London hotels and
restaurants. In the morning a van is loaded with oysters and smoked salmon
for Glasgow Airport and on to stores, hotels and private customers in
Germany, Hong Kong, France, Spain, South Africa and, recently, Argentina. In
1993, exports exceeded 1m, a landmark recognised by a Queen's Award for
Export.
The revival of oyster eating in Britain today may be because they are good
for you - they are low in cholesterol and rich in minerals - but they are
attractive to the restaurateur, too. As restaurants become bigger it is a
big advantage for a busy kitchen if some first and main courses, such as
oysters, langoustines and seafood platters, require no cooking or can be
prepared in advance.
Noble has years of serious oyster eating under his belt and, just before the
last oyster of our meal disappeared he told me how to spot a good gigas.
There should be no blistering on the shell, which would mean uneven growth,
nor should the shell be too frilly, which would mean too much sediment in
the oyster beds. Most of all, they should be nice and plump, which would
mean that they had fed on plenty of plankton. 'A good mouthful,' he added.
And with that another tray of British oysters was finished.

<TEXT>
Before British Rail was created after the second world war, each of the
independent railway companies had its own palatial hotel tucked behind its
main terminal. In the majority of cases, the impressive shells of these
buildings have survived although, in the intervening years, something of the
spirit of British Rail crept into their corridors and public rooms, so that
only the unwitting ever stayed in them.
But one superb old station hotel has come in from the cold. The Regent Hotel
in Marylebone Road, London, used to be called the Great Central, one of the
last railway hotels to be built and one of the first to close its doors when
it was requisitioned for troops in the second world war and turned into
offices for the newly-founded British Rail immediately after.
Fortunately, neither the soldiers nor the bureaucrats did much harm to the
hotel's interior and, after a 3 1/2 -year restoration, it opened as an hotel
in spring last year. The present owner, Four Seasons Hotels, has taken the
bold step of establishing an Italian restaurant there.
The chef is Paolo Simioni, who had a Michelin star at the Ristorante
Concorde di Villa Poma in Mantua. It is for Simioni's north Italian cooking
that the Regent is of interest: this is certainly one of the best Italian
restaurants in London.
Simioni is a stickler for quality ingredients. He shows off his collection
of olive oils with pride, many of which he flavours with herbs and spices.
Most things he can get in London, but a few special ingredients have to be
flown from Italy, such as the buffalo-milk ricotta cheese which arrives on
Tuesday every week and is used up by Thursday. He has a passion for vinegars
including a 15-year-old vin santo from Badia a Coltibuono and numerous
ancient balsamic products.
Pasta is made on the premises; not just the very trendy squid-ink pasta but
a deep-purple variety coloured with beetroot juice; fresh herb paste; and
the more usual green, spinach pasta.
The beetroot tortellini with ricotta were so good they were delicious raw
(but even better cooked). He even makes a speciality of a rare style of
pasta called garganelli where little squares are rolled round a stick and
pinched together.
Naturally, risotto is a strong suit. With crab and leeks, it was a notable
success. Sea bass is stuffed into ravioli and served with big chunks of
lobster. And the garganelle are presented with a spring sauce flavoured with
saffron. One dish which was sadly out of season was a cup made from
parmigiano reggiano cheese filled with cappelletti and a cheese and white
truffle paste.
From June, the Regent is offering readers the chance to learn to cook some
of Simioni's dishes from the master himself. Courses take place on one
Saturday a month and last for an hour. For Pounds 38, students also get a
wine tasting, practical experience, a three-course lunch in the dining room,
and half a bottle of wine - which sounds a generous package. Inquiries to
Charlotte Lawson at the Regent Hotel (tel: 071-631 8000, fax 631 8080).
Apply well in advance: for reasons of insurance in the kitchen, those taking
part are limited to four a session.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Why wine can cost so much - The price of a
bottle explained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial Times readers have probably long suspected that the relationship
between a wine's retail price and its production cost is as variable as a
winemaker's ego. Even some of the most enthusiastic wine drinkers, however,
may not realise how varied are the factors which currently influence wine
costs and prices.
Although duties are minimal in much of Europe and the Americas, regular UK
excise duty on a bottle of still table wine is Pounds 1.01 a bottle,
regardless of quality. An additional customs duty of about 10p a bottle is
levied on all still wines produced outside the EU (21p on sparkling wines).
Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania have negotiated exemptions from this
additional duty.
Grapes, the raw material of wine, often cost very little indeed, especially
workhorse grape varieties of which there is a surplus (La Mancha's Airen,
for example) and the produce of heavily irrigated regions with high yields
such as South America and the Australian Riverland: a few hundred US dollars
a ton, or the equivalent of only 10p to 20p per bottle. Europe's mass market
products, Liebfraumilch and Lambrusco, are traded even more cheaply, as
commodities. At this bottom end of the market, the exchange rate can have as
big an impact on cost as grape price.
The costs of growing, picking, and processing grapes can be extremely low,
either in those increasingly rare regions with low labour costs (South
Africa and Portugal have been examples) or where most vineyard operations
have been completely mechanised. (Australia, with a sparse rural population
and sophisticated technology is the prime example.)
Vines in damp climates are usually more expensive to keep healthy than those
in hot, dry ones where the need for fungicides is minimal.
Only when it comes to winemaking do costs vary considerably, according to
wine style. Early drinking wines that need no expensive oak and can be
bottled and sold young - 95 per cent of whites and 90 per cent of reds - are
many times cheaper to make than wine of any colour matured in small oak
barrels which are expensive to buy and maintain. A top quality new French
oak barrel, amortised over three years' harvest, can today add between 30p
and 60p to the production costs of a bottle of wine. (Oak chips are a much
cheaper alternative.)
Apart from the cellar techniques, white and pink wines should cost less to
produce than reds since heavy irrigation and high yields are generally less
obvious, or at least more bearable, than in red wines of which we demand a
certain weight and colour intensity. (Energy costs are likely to be higher
for white wines, however, as refrigeration is a more significant part of the
production.)
Packaging costs - generally bottling - tend to vary according to country.
They are particularly high in Australia, thanks to the ACI glass monopoly.
It would probably be cheaper to ship all Australian wine to Europe to be
bottled before selling it - even in Australia, and more British retailers
are having their cheaper Australian wines bottled using surplus bottling
capacity in northern Europe.
Bottling lines are often the most expensive long-term plant investment for a
winery, justified only by high volume or extremely high quality and prices.
Contract bottlers are more common in the new world; mobile bottling lines in
the old. Increasingly squeezed on margins, producers have been trying to cut
costs by using thinner glass and shorter corks.
The cost of buying and running cooling equipment can be high in hotter wine
regions far from manufacturing centres, notably Italy in the case of wine
technology. However, many Italian manufacturers have been offering keen
prices to producers in the emerging wine regions of eastern Europe and South
America as orders have slowed from the developed markets of Europe and North
America. In 1993, for example, Italy shipped Dollars 44m (Pounds 29.3m)
worth of equipment to Chile, most of it to wineries.
European wineries, particularly co-operatives, have benefited from
interest-free loans and sometimes grants for equipment, leading to new world
charges that the European wine industry is state subsidised. The wine
industries of Spain and Portugal have been heavy beneficiaries of EU
funding, which continues until 1996, and Portugal has been targeted by the
World Bank for economic development. There are also price support mechanisms
throughout the EU, including compulsory distillation of surplus wine, which
is forcing up the price of basic Spanish table wine, Europe's wine bargain.
EU producers of better quality wine are restricted, however, by limits on
yields and all have to pay relatively high social costs.
Transport costs are remarkably similar regardless of distance. Ocean freight
costs are much lower than land transport costs and have been falling. The
cost of shipping a container (1,100 cases of a dozen bottles) from
Valparaiso to Hong Kong, for example, has fallen from Dollars 5,000 to
Dollars 2,000. The Chileans claim they can ship a case of wine to New York
cheaper than their California counterparts.
Marketing costs for most wines are relatively minimal, with the exception of
a handful of heavily promoted brands. There may be as much as Pounds 1m
worth of marketing built in to a bottle of branded Liebfraumilch, for
example.
Retailers' margins are generally between 18 and 33 per cent, depending on
turnover and market position. Supermarkets have become so powerful in the UK
that they have often been able to demand that wine producers take the strain
of small duty increases to maintain precious price points.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Sunshine treats - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hope springs eternal. The bank holiday weekend at the beginning of May
boasted glorious sunshine, a summery promise dashed severely since - but not
forgotten. Now, as though to force the gods into giving us another blaze of
fine weather this bank holiday, barbecues have been reassembled and fresh
supplies of charcoal bought.
If, perish the thought, the weather forces a retreat indoors, the recipes
that follow can be cooked just as well under the grill of a conventional
cooker, or on a ridged grill pan, as over glowing embers. Some may call it
sexist but, whichever grilling method is used, I reckon the cooking is done
best by a man.
SARDINES AGRODOLCE (serves 4)
A few very obliging fishmongers will, if given advance warning, scale, gut
and fillet sardines. More often, these chores fall to the cook - a fiddly
but not difficult task.
Chop off the heads and fins, slit the bellies and clean out the insides.
Rinse well and pat dry. Lay the fish open side down on the work surface and
press down gently on the backbone. Turn the fish over, cut the backbone
close to the tail, and pull the bone away.
Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb sardines weighing about 1 1/2 oz each;  1/2 lb main
crop carrots; 4 shallots; 1oz toasted pine nuts;  1/2 oz currants; 1 lemon;
a very large pinch of sugar; a little olive oil; 2 bay leaves; the leaves
stripped from a sprig or two of thyme,  1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds; 1 heaped
tablespoon chopped parsley.
Method: Toast the pine nuts in a fat-less frying pan, shaking it frequently
and watching the nuts like a hawk. Snatch them from the heat when golden
brown all over.
Chop the shallots finely and soften them gently in a little olive oil while
you peel the carrots and cut them into batons.
Stir the carrots, fennel, thyme, bay and sugar into the shallots. Pour on 4
fl oz water, bring to the boil, cover and simmer for five minutes.
Sprinkle on the currants and simmer for one minute more. Then add 1
tablespoon lemon juice, turn up the heat and drive off most of the liquid,
stirring frequently and adding salt and pepper towards the end. Set aside
while you grill the sardines.
Brush the silvery skins of the sardines with a fine film of oil and grill
them briefly over hot coals until cooked through. (Or, if forced indoors,
cook the fish skin side up under a conventional grill or skin side down in a
ridged grill pan: two to three minutes should be enough.) In all cases, be
sure the grill is pre-heated.
Quickly add the pinenuts and a little parsley to the carrots and toss to
mix. Spread the vegetables on a shallow dish. Lay the sardines on top,
grinding pepper and sea salt over them. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil
and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, scatter with parsley, and serve with wedges
of lemon and bread.
WARM SALAD OF GRILLED AUBERGINES (serves 4)
Dutch aubergines grown under glass, the sort available most widely in
Britain, do not need salting before cooking. Garlic, lemon, olives and
capers are just right for perking up their blandness.
Ingredients: 1 1/2 -2lb aubergines; a little olive oil for grilling; 1 fat
garlic clove, finely chopped; 2 tablespoons rinsed and chopped capers; 2
tablespoons chopped coriander leaves; 2 tablespoons whole small black
Nicoise olives (or stoned and chopped Kalamata olives); 3 tablespoons olive
oil; 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice.
Method: Put the garlic, capers, coriander, olives, olive oil and lemon juice
into a shallow earthenware dish and slip it into a low oven to warm through.
Cut the aubergines into  1/2 in-thick slices. Brush lightly with oil on both
sides and grill in batches on a barbecue, or in a ridged grill pan, or under
the grill of a conventional cooker. Turn the slices once and allow six to
seven minutes for the vegetable to become hot, tender and burnished with
gold. Keep the grilled slices warm while cooking the rest.
When all the aubergine is done, toss the slices in the warmed dressing,
adding sea salt and black pepper to taste. Serve with hot bread to mop up
the fragrant juices.

Gianni Versace, 47-years-old, Italian couturier to the rock and film star
set, is used to brick-bats. Where Giorgio Armani, that other icon of Italian
fashion, gets the fashion editors' plaudits - 'so refined, so restrained, so
elegant' - Versace often leaves them gasping.
'Scarlet O'Horror' shrieked a recent headline. 'Tartwear' another one calls
it, while 'vulgar', 'pornographic', and 'tatty' are epithets he has become
inured to.
He should care. On the day I visited him in his ravishing Milan palazzo,
once the home of the Rizzoli family and now his home and office, his brother
Santo (in charge of the counting house) interrupts to wave some figures at
us.
'Last Saturday,' he tells me, 'we did the most business we have ever done in
a single day in our shop on the Monte Napoleone.' Some L734.73m (Pounds
305,000) was taken at the tills. This is probably not unconnected with the
fact that Elton John and Eric Clapton, two of Versace's most ardent
groupies, famously given to rock-star style shopping extravaganzas, were in
town. Nevertheless, it is impressive evidence that, in spite of the fashion
editors' sneers, someone out there likes Versace.
It is not just the rock and film-stars who keep Versace in palazzos. The
small boy from Reggio Calabria who fell in love with designing ('Designing
came to me,' he tells me. 'I didn't have to move.') while watching his
mother stitching a little black dress in Reggio Calabria more than 40 years
ago, these days commands an empire that turns over Pounds 400m a year.
In spite of the recession, sales in 1993 were up 8 per cent over the year
before and now there is talk of floating the company. Currently it is
family-owned, shared between himself, his brother, Santo, and sister,
Donatella. He has bought back his own perfume from the Yves St Laurent
corporation. His Versus range, although started only four years ago, turns
over L70bn a year and even as we speak sales expansion is planned in Russia
and China.
Santo seems confident that turnover can be doubled in the next three to four
years and, in spite of the immense expense of launching a splendidly
baroque-style marble palace shop two years ago, a new Versace outlet (this
time for Versus, the younger range, and Istante, the . . . um . . . classic
range) opens at 92 Brompton Road, London SW1 on June 16.
His high-profile and international fame have all been achieved in an
extraordinarily short time. For years he used to show just in Italy and at
the ready-to-wear shows, and he did not embark on an haute couture
collection until 1989. It was not a quiet debut. Rhine-stone studded
dungarees and jeans were not what Paris had in mind when thinking of haute
couture. Paris was shocked 'But it isn't couture,' they said as one.
Gianni Versace was unfazed. Chanel, he reminds me, was equally denigrated
when she first took to the catwalk and look where her reputation is today.
Today he is generally credited with having generated new excitement, of
having given couture a much-needed shot-in-the-arm just when it seemed to
have run out of steam.
Versace himself believes in the importance of haute couture. 'Couture has to
update itself. It must be modern. If you do couture as I do it (modesty, you
will have observed, is not a Versace trait) and as Lagerfeld and Lacroix do
it, then most certainly it has a place today. But that Balmain approach to
couture - the huge hat, the stiff woman, that is so demode.
'I use haute couture as a laboratory to experiment with new ideas. Because I
am forced to do another collection I have to experiment and to change, to
produce new ideas. There is a difference between a dressmaker and a designer
who pushes forward into new areas.
'Couture is also very important for the craft - if we had no couture we
would lose all those wonderful skills.'
And indeed even his most ardent critics never deny the skills that go into
the Versace collections - the cut, the exquisite embroideries and beading,
the finish, the beautiful fabrics.
Diana Vreeland, the great editor of American Vogue, was one of the first to
recognise his talent. For years she said she used to go to Italy expecting
to find someone to take the international stage but it wasn't until she came
upon the work of Versace that she thought she had found it. 'I have never
seen anyone,' she told him as she hugged him, 'drape a dress so well and in
such little time.'
He sees his clothes as vehicles which allow a woman to express herself and
he cites Diana Vreeland as a marvellous example of a woman who made Versace
clothes her own. 'She was 80 years old,' he said, 'and she used to wear a
black sweater by Azeddine Alaia and black leather pants of mine and she wore
them like no 20-year-old could wear them.
'I want to go back to cut,' he says. 'Diana Vreeland introduced me to the
work of a wonderful English designer called Charles James - 'You know him?
No? Oh, you must learn about him' - the inside of his dresses are as
beautiful as the outside. I have never seen a French or American produce
such beautifully made dresses. They are all about pure line and pure cut and
this is what interests me now.'
He is very respectful of the past: 'When you are born in a place such as
Calabria and there is beauty all around - a Roman bath, a Greek remain - you
cannot help but be influenced by the classical past.'
Almost all his collections are filled with visual references to history  -
Grecian motifs, baroque images, Etruscan symbols, Medusa's head. He loves to
mix fabrics, juxtaposing leather with silk, cashmere with tweed, teaming
jeans with brocade jackets, putting rhinestones on dungarees. Looking back
over his collections there are bewildering sources of inspiration - part
happy hooker, part hippie, part punk, part Grecian goddess, part sweet
virgin - the references are endless and varied.
Each collection tends to explore a theme which is not always immediately
understood by the frock-fanciers in the audience. The bondage collection was
about more than just trying to shock. Says Versace: 'It was my contribution
to the debate about the freedom of women to appear as they want.' As always
with Versace it was part theatre, part serious and part just sheer high
spirits.
New ideas seem to bubble up endlessly. 'Seven years ago,' he tells me, 'I
was in Venice in a shop selling things for scuba diving and it so appealed
to me that I sent my people to explore how to stitch without stitching,
using a laser.'
Before that he had discovered how to use metallic mesh by borrowing from
techniques from aeroplane makers. Out of that he produced one of the most
sensually draped evening dresses ever to grace a catwalk.
But Versace never stands still. A few seasons ago he did something truly
shocking - he went simple. Down the catwalk came exquisite exercises in
flowing little columns, beautifully cut, unadorned, elongated vests and
T-shirts. The press was overwhelmed. But it proved to be just another
playful episode in the Versace story. This season it was back to vintage
Versace, bib-fronted mini-dresses in PVC, references to punk and rock 'n'
roll.
At their best they are beautifully made. No one who saw the actress
Elizabeth Hurley in the sculpted column of wool crepe erotically held
together by safety pins could deny the precision of the cutting, the craft
behind the form or doubt his ability to cut with skill and contour a dress
exquisitely to the body.
'People,' says Gianni Versace, 'are very smart. The shoppers are the best
judge. If you put the right dress in the window and they like it they buy
it. Otherwise they don't. I have learned to trust the ordinary shopper.' He
could also have added that these smart people must also be very rich, for a
jacket can easily cost Pounds 1,500, a whisp of a mini-dress Pounds 2,000
and a full-blown evening stunner anything between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds
10,000.
He may be teaming silk brocade with denim jeans, decking them out with
spangles, using safety pins on everything from handbags to slithers of wool
crepe, beads on brassieres, jewels on teeteringly high-heeled shoes. In
Versace's world nothing is ever very simple (though, confusingly, he claims
to be so classic 'as to be almost boring') - he loves ambiguity, fantasy,
complexity, combinations of apparently opposite elements.
For good taste he cares not a jot and to judge Versace by the standards of
so-called 'good taste' is entirely to miss the point. 'I don't believe in
good taste,' he tells me, 'I don't believe in bad taste. I believe in
quality and in fun, in things that make our life better or happier. What you
like,' he believes, 'is good taste. A woman who is very sexy and fun is
infinitely more appealing to me than one who is formally chic.'
John Miles, Professor of Fashion and Textiles at the Royal College of Art,
is in no doubt about his importance. 'He has such verve and vim. Take his
new book Designs (published June 9 by Abbeywell, Pounds 42). It is filled
with wonderful vitality and will probably become a classic for students.'
Ultimately it is the element of risk that gives a Versace show its peculiar
edge, its unique sense of danger. There is always the chance that he might
come a tremendous cropper, that he might cross from the playfully erotic
into the irretrievably trashy. In the risk, evidently, is the challenge, the
excitement that is behind the Versace drive.
As for Gianni himself, it is abundantly evident he is a happy man. He is
laughing all the way to his opulent new house in Miami. Others may keep the
good reviews, he will make do with the cheques.

<TEXT>
Pearls are the great classic of the jewellery chest. They never date and
they are the easiest, quickest way of adding instant glamour. Almost
everyone has a string or two somewhere.
It was Coco Chanel who showed us how to wear them: with great panache in
long, long strings (when fake), or demurely round the neck under a sweetly
innocent, pure white collar in three strings (when real). She it was who
decreed: 'When you make it fake, you always make it bigger.'
Buying real pearls, however, is difficult - telling cultured from real often
needs an X-ray. And while real pearls are beyond the reach of all except the
super-rich, the quality (and price) of cultured pearls can vary enormously.
Knowing what you are paying for is not always easy.
For anyone fascinated by pearls who wants to learn more about them, a tiny
but magical London jewellery shop, Manguette, is having a festival of pearls
(faux and real) for two weeks during June (the pearl is the birth-stone for
those born in that month).
One of the designers featured will be Esmiralda who, while not a big name in
Britain, has a splendid reputation in America and Thailand.
She does amazing things with pearls. She uses them for great big cuffs,
turning them into long strings or woven cloches (for which she won a
Japanese Cultured Pearl Association design prize); teams them with cabochon
stones to make a necklace; or just turns out stunning earrings.
The festival will also show the work of other contemporary designers
including Gatto Bianco, a husband and wife design team from Florence, which
specialises in large and luscious pearls set in silver rings.
For those not within reach of Manguette, try a sumptuous book called Pearls
(Ornament and Obsession), by Kristin Joyce and Shellei Addison (Thames and
Hudson, Pounds 38).
Manguette is at 20a Kensington Church Walk, London W8, tel: 071-937 2897.
The exhibition runs from June 1 to 15.

FT  28 MAY 94 / The Nature of Things: Superbug scenario
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Media hysteria about the flesh-eating superbug, Streptococcus A, has
surpassed all previous medical scare stories. Legionnaire's disease,
meningitis, salmonella and listeria could not produce headlines like this
week's 'Killer bug ate my face' and 'Eaten alive'.
Beneath the hype, however, there is scientific concern that acute infections
 -almost conquered by antibiotics and other medical advances earlier this
century - are re-emerging as a serious threat to public health.
Streptococcus is one of the most common bacteria. Microbiologists estimate
that about one person in 10 is infected at any given time. Usually there are
no symptoms; sometimes it produces a sore throat ('strep throat').
But streps can also cause a terrifying variety of diseases, depending on
which toxins they release. They were responsible for two of the great
killers of the pre-industrial world: pueperal (childbed) fever and scarlet
fever. Streps can also bring meningitis or serious blood poisoning.
The streps that newspapers have called flesh eaters cause a disease known
officially as necrotising fasciitis - though this week's best description of
it was 'galloping gangrene'. The bacteria release a toxic cocktail of
enzymes which destroy muscles and the fibrous tissues around them.
In the most severe cases, flesh can turn black and die at a rate of an inch
per hour. The only hope of saving the patient is to carry out emergency
surgery - cutting out the infected tissues - and give heavy doses of
antibiotics.
Microbiologists have recognised necrotising fasciitis for many years as an
extremely rare complication of Strep A. According to the Public Health
Laboratory Service there are about 10 cases a year but these normally occur
in isolation, with no evidence of the infection passing from one patient to
another.
So the medical alarm bells started to ring when doctors noticed an apparent
cluster of cases in the Gloucester area. Seven people there have suffered
from necrotising fasciitis this year, three of whom died. Did this show that
Strep A was becoming more contagious?
Tests have shown that all the Gloucester cases were caused by genetically
different sub-types of Strep A. The conclusion is that the cluster was a
tragic coincidence.
Meanwhile all the publicity, combined with an alert from the PHLS, has
brought to light more than a dozen recent cases of necrotising fasciitis
elsewhere in Britain; altogether 11 deaths have been attributed to the
disease in the UK this year.
During the week the media shock waves spread to other countries, which began
to examine their own Strep A statistics. Australia, for example, reported 10
to 15 cases a year of necrotising fasciitis, and Germany 30 to 40 a year -
about half of whom died.
But the disease is not officially 'notifiable' anywhere, so the figures are
not reliable. The consensus is that lethal streps are slowly becoming more
common worldwide.
Scientists believe that specialised bacteria-infecting viruses called phages
play an important role in bacterial evolution, carrying genes for virulence
and toxin production between different strains and even different species.
The forces driving the process remain a mystery, however.
This week newspapers have almost certainly cried 'plague' about the wrong
bug. Staphylococcus bacteria already kill far more people than the streps
and they have developed more resistance to antibiotics.
No one knows what real superbugs, if any, are going to emerge. Streps are a
remote possibility. A virulent staphylococcus resistant to all antibiotics
is rather more likely. But perhaps the microbiologists' worst nightmare is a
highly contagious new influenza virus causing a pandemic of pneumonia; it
would not eat flesh but could drown millions in their own body fluids.
Imagine the headlines then.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Looking for trouble on the Yangtze - Despatches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The police at the Wuhan ferry terminal were distracted by their boredom.
Confronted each day by a swirl of humanity struggling through a small
turnstile, they had conceded long ago that they were hardly able to make a
difference. They herded passengers into a kind of line, only to see it
dissolve moments later.
They looked out at a crowd of scruffy peasant boys, of young provincial
women with hairstyles that went out of fashion in Beijing last year, and of
old men who remained faithful to the Mao tunic. For the police, chaos was
commonplace.
From Wuhan, on the Yangtze, the ferries head downriver as far as Shanghai
and upriver to Chongqing. Beyond the turnstile, it was a sprint down the
gangway for the best berth on an overcrowded boat. About half the rushing
passengers were bouncing white, rainproof sacks that once held fertiliser,
but had a second life as a travel bag. These were farm folk on the way home,
probably a long bus ride from the port that was their destination aboard the
Jiangyu No 4.
The boat had three classes, starting at second class and working down. In
between each class, on the stairways and the decks, were clusters of
passengers, cracking sunflower seeds with teeth and tongue, and preparing
for discomfort that, by Chinese standards, was no great test of endurance or
patience. For those with tickets through to Chongqing, it was four days of
struggle against the currents, and a deckside seat to an unscheduled, tragic
entertainment.
After a few hours of gliding through the water, the first of the public
announcements came. It was the urging voice of public announcements in China
of the past, but was offering something different. None of the harsh
rhetoric, just hard sell - tickets for a 'Hong Kong action film with
romance'. They showed a few different films but the spiel was much the same:
a film made in Hong Kong, with action and romance.
There was enough violence off-screen in central China for the taste of most
passengers. Urban Chinese worry aloud about their safety outside the
security of the big cities. In their afternoon tabloids, they read about
marauding gangs and random violence. They talk about the aimless young who
have no values and will do anything for a price.
To keep the peace on the boat, there are Marine Police. Their green uniform
looks a little like that of the Gong An, the real police, but the shoulder
patch and the manner are that of an aspiring policeman rejected by a more
discerning force.
At around midnight, the ferry berthed at Shashi, literally Sand City, once a
Japanese treaty port that the other foreign powers did not bother to
contest. There was a crowd of young porters, with bamboo poles in hand,
hustling for a commission.
A few porters apparently tried to jump aboard the boat, and the sounds of a
brawl echoed through the cabins. A marine policeman, who claimed that lives
were in danger, opened fire. He shot one man in the leg and another in the
hand. The shouting stopped for a moment and the recriminations began.
A mob gathered on the wharf, and the passengers peered over the guard rails.
The rumours multiplied fast. A few men had been killed. The labourers'
friends were on their way to ransack the boat. Like so much that happens in
China, even for those a few metres from the event, the reality was quickly
retranslated and distorted by a dozen dialects.
The outcome became obvious when the front lounge-room of the boat was
unlocked. In the best Chinese traditions, there was to be a meeting. The
boat's crew, the real police, and local port officials were given cups of
tea and began attempting to apportion blame in a way that would leave them
all blameless.
They talked for nine hours, and apparently happy that their duty had been
done, there were no arrests. Two police joined the boat, taking a second
class cabin for themselves, in the interests of law and order.
For the crew, the fear was that word would spread upriver, and there would
be trouble at another of the river stops. Each time the boat slid against a
wharf, the two real police would stroll off, with hands in pockets, waiting
edgily for more violence.
At each stop, the passengers in white jogging shoes, increasingly the
preferred footwear of rural Chinese, walked off into the day or the night.
At one small port, hundreds of grubbied labourers were hauling coal from a
heap to a barge, with each of the two baskets on a bamboo pole weighed by a
supervisor. It stirred images of the mobilised masses who built Mao's dams
and bridges in the 1950s and the Great Wall a few dynasties earlier.
Those scenes of toil held nothing for the passengers, who were still being
offered Hong Kong films with action and romance. Then, in the final hours of
the journey, the loudspeakers turned to pop versions of Cultural Revolution
hits about Mao, the Great Helmsman. The revival of these songs, which tell
of Mao as the 'Big Red Sun warming us all', is part kitsch and part
necessity. They were the songs that people sang, willingly or not, during
the 1960s and 1970s, and stuck in the collective memory. Now, they are in
karaoke collections.
At Chongqing, the private minibus operators were waiting with loudspeakers
and tunes of their own. The city, the wartime capital, is still a refuge
from some of the wilder parts of the south-west. It is also a place where
the rumours gather. One taxi driver told a story about the increasingly
potent blend of wealth and violence. On a Chongqing bus, a young woman and
man started a typical argument. It could have begun with him stepping on her
foot, but the origins are not important, as it quickly became a matter of
face.
In the usual Chinese way, the insults became cruder and cruder, and neither
would give way to the other. The woman dared the man to get off at the next
stop, and he did, presuming that their argument would continue. She then
walked over to a couple of out-of-town youths, and offered them money to
rough up her opponent. They accepted and the argument was ended.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Skiing round the world: Guiltless in Seattle - Arnie Wilson
is searched for drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They skied in America and Europe before moving
to the Himalayas and Japan. This week they returned to the US.
We have been body-searched - with disturbing thoroughness - for drugs. When
we arrived in Seattle on a section of our expedition that has taken us round
the world in 23 days (Geneva-Delhi-Tokyo-Seattle-Chicago-Los Angeles)
sniffer dogs took too much interest in us for comfort and we were 'selected
for a search'.
The only irregular item in our luggage was a sealed Japanese legume which we
had purchased in a box aboard a bullet train thinking it was some exotic
version of sushi.
But the dogs had apparently picked up a whiff of narcotics.
Having failed to find anything incriminating in our luggage, immigration
officers marched Lucy and me into separate cubicles and carried out an
intimate search.
They found nothing, of course. We can only put it down to Manali, our
Himalayan base, where growing and smoking of cannabis is rife.
In Japan, the violent rain storms at the summer ski area of Gassan in the
Yamagata Prefecture blew themselves out, to be replaced by bright sunshine.
At last we could see where we were skiing: quite a substantial mountain with
a vertical drop in summer of 1,500ft (much more in winter, but then there is
too much snow for the resort to open).
Four of the five lifts were rope tows, two of which involved clipping on
detachable steel grips: a tricky business. The fifth, to our relief, was a
conventional chairlift, enabling us to ski more than 20 miles in six hours -
more than we had managed in the previous six days.
Our hosts at the Pension Yu-Yu-Sha in Goryu Toomi (close to Happo One, where
part of the 1998 Winter Olympics will be held) and at the Gassan Resort Inn,
were a delight, and served us such delicious food that we did not want to
leave our chopsticks when we flew to the Californian ski resort of Mammoth
in the spectacular High Sierras. As it turned out, a Japanese dinner was on
the American Airlines menu.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Lunch with the FT: The safest bet for the Derby - Michael
Thompson-Noel meets Peter George, Ladbroke's chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Wednesday, a group of valuable racehorses will careen round Epsom
racecourse, near London, in that blaze of colour, sweat and pageantry known
as the English Derby. The owner of the winning horse will puff with pride,
while the owners of the also-rans sag with disappointment. But the real
winner will be Peter George - the World's Biggest Bookmaker.
In most countries, racehorse betting is handled via government-run
pari-mutuels, and commercial bookmaking is heavily restricted or illegal.
But not in Britain, where off-track bookmakers run thousands of betting
shops.
The leader is Ladbroke, which calls itself the world's largest commercial
off-track betting organisation. It has operations in Belgium, Ireland, the
US and Argentina, as well as in Britain. As a result, Peter George,
Ladbroke's chief executive since the start of the year, must be the world's
biggest bookie. He could even be the tallest (he is 6ft 5in).
If you met him, as I did, in the Windows on the World restaurant on the 28th
floor of the Hilton Hotel in London's Park Lane, you would guess he was a
businessman.
In part, he is an hotelier - Ladbroke owns Hilton International (159 hotels
in 47 countries, bought for Dollars 1bn in 1987). It also owns the troubled
Texas Homecare, Britain's second-largest DIY and home-care retailer, and has
a property division. All up, it operates in nearly 50 countries and employs
78,000 people.
Not in 400 years, though, would you guess that George was also a bookmaker.
He is not fat. He is not shifty. His jollity is calmly measured. His suits
and ties are boring. He is erect and frank-talking.
Yet a bookie he is. His father was a bookmaker and George, now 50, had
worked for Ladbroke for more than 30 years, mainly on the racing side,
before gliding through on the inside rail to take the chief executiveship
when Cyril Stein, Ladbroke's charismatic and controversial guiding spirit,
retired early.
Some bookmakers do not know a horse's head from its fundament. They are
accountants, after all: experts at setting odds that lighten the punters'
pockets of millions in the course of a working month. But George knows his
way round a racetrack.
'Do you like racehorses?' I asked.
'Sure,' said George.
'Ever owned any?'
'Not so far.'
'Because of the exhorbitant cost?'
'No, not the cost. I've sometimes talked about it, but there has never been
the right sort of opportunity.'
'Do you like a bet yourself?'
'Yes, but not often. I was at Aintree for the Grand National and had three
bets, but they all went down.'
'What's your average stake?'
'Pounds 100, I guess.'
'And what is your maximum?'
'Still Pounds 100.'
I rolled my eyes.
The world's biggest bookie said: 'Oh, very well - call it Pounds 200.'
'Tax in advance?' (A betting ploy that denotes confidence).
'Yes, tax in advance.'
Originally, Peter George wanted to join the Royal Air Force, but was too
tall to fly. So he started with the family bookmaking firm, founded by his
grandfather. Later, to gain experience, he went to Ladbroke and has been
there ever since. At 26, he was Ladbroke's chief racecourse representative -
a period of 'great fun'. The biggest bet he remembers handling was a
businessman who lost Pounds 100,000.
He joined the main Ladbroke board in 1980 and became joint chief executive
three years ago. He is a workaholic, with no side to him, and is described
by colleagues as solid, shrewd and far-seeing.
The world's biggest bookie will watch next Wednesday's English Derby as
closely as anyone.
'At Ladbroke, we are paying close attention to developments in international
gambling,' says George, 'especially gaming - which means, primarily, casinos
and gaming machines. In the US, above all, there is an explosion in new
forms of gaming, especially towards casino gaming: on Mississippi-style
riverboats and on Indian reservations.
'We operate four casinos in Hilton hotels, three in Puerto Rico and one in
Aruba, and would like to have more.' Ladbroke used to operate 14 UK casinos,
which yielded fat profits, but, to its embarrassment, was stripped of its
licences in 1979 for breaches of the rules deemed 'disgraceful'.
'It seems likely that classic off-track betting, such as betting on horses,
is going to find it more difficult to compete with all this new gaming,'
says George. 'It has been seen in Australia already, and also in France.
This would require a major re-think of Ladbroke's strategy.
'In addition, for the first time in many years, the British government will
soon have a direct and vested interest in promoting gambling, via the UK
national lottery.' (Ladbroke was a member of a consortium that applied to
operate the lottery, but lost out this week when the licence was allocated).
'In a way, the lottery will probably have a far smaller effect on general
betting than if UK betting were based on a pari-mutuel. Many pari-mutuel
bettors go strictly on numbers. It is the same with lotteries. And, in
Ireland, they launched an extremely successful national lottery which didn't
have a big impact on betting shop business.
'But there will be some impact on retail spending behaviour in Britain -
perhaps on confectionery sales, maybe on tobacco sales, and undoubtedly on
the football pools.' Ladbroke owns Vernons, Britain's No 2 pools operator.
Since Cyril Stein's exit and Peter George's promotion, Ladbroke has raised
its cruising speed. It has changed virtually all its top management and
thrown open its doors, abandoning the secrecy and cloak-and-dagger stuff
that used to infuriate the City.
As the millennium approaches, the international gambling business is likely
to mutate as speedily and as unpredictably - and possibly as profitably - as
any branch of the leisure trade. With a lifetime's experience of betting to
call upon, lofty Peter George will survey developments cagily. At 6ft 5in,
he is used to spotting the action.

FT  28 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Why Britain needs Britosceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to those in Britain known as 'Eurosceptics' there is, all over the
European Union, some kind of nationalistic undercurrent which needs only to
be aroused from its present slumber to recognise the threat posed by
Brussels imperialism.
The trouble is that there is no single rallying call that could unite
Eurosceptics of the world. In France an article by Maurice Allais, the
French Nobel prize winner for economics, in Le Figaro a couple of weeks ago,
made it clear where his country's anxieties lay. 'France should not have
accepted a laisser faire Europe,' he wrote. There should be a Europe that
could protect the Union's social achievements. The poorest in the land could
not be deprived of work by a bunch of Asiatics.
There was a shortage of evidence to back the argument. So here is some:
France's imports from developing countries in Asia accounted for 7 per cent
of its imports in 1992. The trade deficit with Asia was one third of 1 per
cent of gross national product. Amazing how that can destroy whole sectors
of French industry and wipe out 2m jobs.
Allais' Euroscepticism is hard to reconcile with that of those on Britain's
Conservative nationalistic right who see a commitment to anything beyond a
free trade area as treason. (The paradox is odd: Conservative nationalism
historically has not been associated with free trade. Nationalism itself is
the antithesis of market liberalism which should include the free movement
of labour.)
Each country has its European agenda. And each has its anti-Europeans who
disagree with anti-Europeans elsewhere. In Austria, which is about to join
the Union, Der Standard asked the public what areas needed most protection.
'Sovereignty' was not mentioned. The only thing that mattered to more than
half those polled was the need to keep freight off the road and put it on to
rail.
The British, and occasionally the French, define the European challenge in
abstract terms such as 'sovereignty'. For the rest, European questions
centre on practical arrangements for tariffs, lorries and workplace
problems. The British would say that Brussels overrides national sovereignty
in these areas, but for continental Europeans, the concept is meaningless.
It melts in your hand the moment you grasp it. In theory Austria could
exercise its sovereignty in the matter of transit freight, in practice that
is scarcely credible. The British alone believe that separate choices can be
made, that untrammelled independence is obtainable.
So why, then, the fuss in Germany about its choice of president this week?
If a national government has so little power, how can voting for a powerless
president matter? The election of Roman Herzog as president of Germany
generated even more soul-searching than is normal at this epicentre of world
soul-searching.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung ruminated at length. 'Is it really true that the
united German people are content, after the uniform-and-murder fetishist A.
H, to welcome a fresh, new bourgeois-democratic president every five years?
Is there not a craving for a bit of Konig, Kaiser, Gloriavictoria?'
The answer was revealing: 'Looking back we must sigh with relief: we were
lucky. The German people, Hitler-less thanks to others, were never asked.' A
constitution was imposed and so: 'Now our crowned heads can be stolen from
us - we remain experienced and knowledgeable and on balance comfortable with
our presidents.'
Since the Germans have such a cosy concept of their state and its leaders,
it is not surprising that they do not fear for its existence. It is much
easier to undermine a palace than a suburban villa. The British possess so
much 'Queen, Parliament, Gloriavictoria' that the power of Brussels is seen
as subversive. One would think from some of this week's pronouncements that
the freedom to install seat belts in busses was part of Magna Carta.
The concept of Britishness is concentrated on the structure of the state.
The nation's great traditions are not to be found in simple, popular matters
such as food, drink, dress and useful manufactured goods. Even so-called
common law is impenetrable to the common man. So it is that any infringement
of the rights of political institutions seems to destroy the very heart of
nationhood. Remove the Crown and the power of Westminster and out goes
everything from the state opening of parliament to Royal Ascot. Remove its
equivalents in Germany, France or Italy, little is lost and much might be
gained. Britain needs some Britosceptics rather than Eurosceptics.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (12): A retirement village on
the British model - Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new idea for the Algarve is a sheltered retirement village modelled on
retirement homes in Britain - but rarely found elsewhere. This is Monte da
Palhagueira, near Loule, a little inland and surrounded by open country.
The village will comprise 30 one- and two-bedroom single-storey cottages.
But the ground slopes and some buyers might like further accommodation built
below.
The properties, with their pretty glazed-tile decoration and occasional
pepperpot barbecue chimneys, have large sitting rooms with open fireplaces.
There is a dining area off the kitchen and some have internal patios. They
will all have a terrace and parking space, but all will be different.
Three have been built, and one furnished as a show house, by Mary
Cornelius-Reid and her husband, who are responsible for the project. The
village, with its cottages in small groups and walkways threading between
them, will later have a community hall and perhaps a small
interdenominational church.
It is being built in the 22-acre grounds of the Cornelius-Reid's nursing
home. They have three nursing homes in the south of England, two with
similar sheltered housing. The properties will sell for between Pounds
90,000 and Pounds 150,000 through John D Wood &amp; Co (Winchester, tel:
0962-863131).
Buyers have a life lease and if they become frail, they can transfer to the
nursing home and have their money refunded, then paying normal nursing home
fees. Service charges in the cottages will be about Pounds 100 a week. This
includes lunch in the nursing home restaurant, with the option of an evening
meal. It also includes maintenance to the properties, domestic help and
24-hour warden service.
There is a swimming pool in the nursing home gardens, which cottage
residents can use.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (11): A master plan to halt
the cowboy builders - Portugal / At the sign of the golf club you know you
are in the Algarve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost apart from the rest of the country the much-visited Algarve has a
life of its own, writes Audrey Powell. Today's 'real' Algarve is the golf
course development. A figure swinging a golf club must now typify the
province in the way that a pavement orange seller may have done in another
era.
Further expansion of most of the main projects has been mothballed until the
leisure market revives, but construction continues on the Alto Golf and Alto
Club development, near Portimao in western Algarve, financed and managed by
the British construction company Mowlem.
This two-part development, an hour's drive from Faro airport, has an 18-hole
golf course designed by golfer Henry Cotton, who lived in the province for
25 years. On one hole, the 660-yard 16th, if you make a birdie, you get a
certificate and have your name engraved on a roll of honour in the
clubhouse.
Alto Club, about a mile from Alto Golf, is set in gardens on the site of an
old farm. The farmhouse has been restored, with its well and ancient wheel.
This resort has views over the fishing village of Alvor and the bay of
Lagos. It has swimming pools, a floodlit tennis court and a restaurant. A
short walk takes you down to one of the Algarve's vast beaches.
Both Altos offer quite spacious villas and flats with a high ratio of
bathrooms to bedrooms, and many broad terraces. The villas are of varied
design, with two to four bedrooms; they cost from Pounds 175,000 to more
than Pounds 300,000, depending on type and plot size.
Flats cost Pounds 115,000 in Alto Golf and Pounds 107,000 to Pounds 110,000
in Alto Club. There is also an arrangement by which four people can buy
together, each owning a share in a freehold flat. This costs from Pounds
26,000.
A word of warning. One of the attractions of the Algarve is that you can
play golf throughout the year, with warm, sunny days even during the winter.
What you are less likely to be told is that the Algarve also has some
extremely cold days, which can be chillier than the UK at the same time of
year.
If you plan to spend a lot of off-season time there, make sure you have an
adequate central heating system in your property.
Three Alto resorts are planned. The third, Alto Beach, has yet to be built,
and remains an 18-acre clifftop site, close to the existing Altos.
Eventually, Alto Beach will have 70 apartments, a restaurant, tennis court,
swimming pool and a mini-golf course.
If residents of the three Altos want a change of scene, they can drive to
the Algarve's westernmost point, Cape St Vincent, a wilder version of
England's Land's End, and watch the Atlantic swirling below the cliffs. They
may soon feel inclined to return to the more tranquil challenge of the 16th
hole.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (10): A master plan to halt
the cowboy builders - Portugal / Audrey Powell studies the new rules
governing land for building plots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Algarve property market is going through more change, says Graham Fone,
director of Portogoa, a Lagos-based company which builds individual houses
in this southern region of Portugal.
'During the boom, speculators came to the Algarve to make money,' recalls
Fone, an English civil engineer. 'Large plots of land were bought cheaply
and permission was obtained to develop them. With this consent they went
back on the market for a greatly increased sum. During the late 1980s, 60
per cent of what had been approved had never been built. The whole planning
process went totally out of control.'
The government brought in legislation, called Protal, to rectify this. Under
the new law, there can be no more construction on individual plots of land;
approved urbanisations which have not been started risk losing consent;
every municipal authority must prepare a master plan.
'Today we have reached the stage where the master plans have been prepared
and are on public display in the town halls,' says Fone. Many approved
urbanisations that have not been started have been cancelled.'
To exist alongside the big developers building for the mass holiday-home
market, companies such as Portogoa relied on families wanting their own
special houses on plots that kept them at a distance from neighbours and
tour parties.
'New construction on individual plots of land has now been stopped, and only
plots with an old ruin or with permission granted before Protal was
introduced can be built on,' says Fone. 'We foresee that within two years
all new construction will be confined to the existing urbanised
developments.'
This is a complete reversal of the days of the cowboys, when uncontrolled
building was allowed to ruin much of central Algarve.
So what does a small company such as Portogoa do? Undismayed, Fone points
out that customers' demands have changed, and a small builder is able to
respond quickly to their new requirements.
'Five to 10 years ago the villa in the Algarve was a holiday home. Today
most of our clients are looking to settle permanently in Portugal. With the
freedom of movement now within the common market, we foresee a migration
from the north.'
He thinks Portugal will benefit. But the requirements of a client wanting to
live there permanently would be different from those wanting a holiday home.
For people wanting a permanent home, it was of paramount importance that the
villa should be dry and centrally heated. People also needed storage space
for possessions collected over the years.
There is a further reason that is causing Portogoa to swerve from its
original course. In the search for sites that are not on a new development,
but where the company might build a new property, it is always looking out
for ruined farmhouses that could be demolished, so that the plot could be
re-used. But clients who are taken to see such plots often ask if the
company could renovate the farm property instead of building anew.
'This is the buyer's dream. In practice, due to the laws that require a
concrete frame for the building, it is easier to knock it down and rebuild.'
So that is what the company does. 'We have reconstructed a number, keeping
as many original features as possible.'
The company has just finished work on such a property, east of Silves, for a
client, and has another plot in the same area. This, including the ruin, is
priced at Pounds 102,000, and renovation would probably cost a further
Pounds 110,000.
For that, a buyer would get his farmhouse - which would look old, but comply
with today's requirements - with the interior as he wanted it. This seems to
be a growing market, says Fone.
In general, prices for building plots along the coastal strip are between
Pounds 40,000 and Pounds 100,000. Inland, prices range between Pounds 20,000
and Pounds 60,000.
The company's villa prices go from Pounds 50,000, for a two-bedroom
property, up to Pounds 150,000 for a villa with four bedrooms and four
bathrooms, excluding land. Construction takes eight to 10 months.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Horticold creditors told of fresh
start
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Horticold, which supplies specialist cooling equipment for fruit and
vegetables and was featured in a Minding Your Own Business article by David
Spark in October, was put into administrative receivership by the Bank of
Scotland in February, owing creditors Pounds 350,000.
The receiver, Nick O'Reilly of Rothman Pantall, says he expects to recover
Pounds 150,000. Ian White and Barry Cooper of Horticold are working to
restore the business. White says they have a full order book to July and
plan to make further repayments. They attribute the problems to mistaken
estimates and an Pounds 80,000 bad debt in Spain.
O'Reilly says he found the business's main asset was Pounds 190,000 worth of
work in progress. To recover as much as possible of this, he sold the
tangible assets to Cooper and White for Pounds 40,000 and received a
guarantee that Pounds 80,000 from the Pounds 190,000 would be paid to him by
May 31. He has received Pounds 55,000 and expects this to rise to Pounds
110,000, leaving only the Spanish debt unrecovered.
The Insolvency Act allows directors to make a fresh start if they acquire
their company's assets and inform the creditors. Cooper says: 'We have
contacted all the creditors and are continuing to trade with most of them.'

<TEXT>
Paul Bridgland recruited the fifth, and latest, member of his staff in a
computer shop in Guildford, Surrey on a Saturday morning. Bridgland was
looking at games software with his nine-year-old son when he was struck by
the manner and the knowledge of the young man who served them.
He took Andrew Scott into a corner and offered the 18-year-old a job in his
business presentation company.
'It may seem a rather bizarre way of recruiting staff but the three others
arrived in similarly unusual ways,' said Bridgland, 35, managing director of
Guildford-based Creation Station. 'I am not a gambler but I certainly would
call myself an opportunist.'
Bridgland and his right-hand man Guy Taylor were the people behind the
worldwide presentation that preceded the recent successful flotation of the
Dollars 440m Ghana-based Ashanti Goldfields share offer. James Capel, which
acted as 'global bookrunners' for the launch, and Morgan Grenfell, financial
adviser to Ashanti, chose Creation Station for the job.
'I like to think it was our record over 5 1/2 years that gained us the
contract, but I'm sure it was also the highly individual talents of our
small team,' said Bridgland.
The team has no graduates among its ranks. But at its head is a man who,
after an involuntary exit from public school, joined and quit the army,
travelled all over Europe, worked as a steward for Laker Airways for three
years, became a painter and decorator, sold audio-visual equipment for six
months, then retrained (he loathed his TOPS course) in computer programming.
After this Bridgland decided his fate lay in selling. First he sold
insurance, then video presentations for another company before founding
Creation Station at the age of 29.
Taylor's cv is not as exotic, but it is nevertheless interesting. In his 33
years he has trained at art college, been a ship's photographer, a deckhand
in Australia, a photoprocessing salesman and worked on the production side
in an advertising agency.
The Ashanti Goldfields launch was worth Pounds 50,000 to Creation Station.
Of that, Pounds 20,000 went on hiring teams of sub-contractors to handle the
European presentation, but the company still managed to make a 20 per cent
profit on the worldwide roadshow. Bridgland and Taylor each spent three
weeks on the wing 'leap frogging' each other on the tour of 16 locations
from Sydney to Denver. In each city one of the two supervised the technical
side of the presentation. The roadshow went without a hitch, earning
Creation Station valuable kudos in a business which relies on reputation.
'We certainly had not handled a job approaching that size before, and it
will probably be quite a long time before we gain another one quite as big,'
said Bridgland. 'Nevertheless we are optimistic about more business from
some big names such as Rank Xerox, Rowenta Domestic Appliances, and a major
pharmaceutical company.
'We have sold and installed two of our complete VideoShow systems for two
major companies. They now use the equipment for presentations to their
clients and retain us as advisers.'
Business was not always so good. Two years ago Bridgland - who is the first
to admit he has no financial skills - was in a crisis. He was paying off a
Pounds 10,000 start-up loan he had negotiated with Midland Bank when he
started Creation Station in November 1988, and wanted to update their
VideoShow presentation equipment to keep ahead of the competition.
The problem, as ever, was cashflow. 'Things were not desperate but they were
certainly uncomfortably tight,' Bridgland said. 'We had resorted to
factoring to try and bring the money in and that was another expense we
could have done without.'
Bridgland resolved the crisis in typical fashion: grasping at an
opportunity. At a family gathering he bumped into a cousin he had not seen
for eight years - Richard Samson, who runs two garages in the south of
England. He became company secretary and spends one day a fortnight at
Creation Station, controls the books, chases creditors, and deals with the
bank.
'Richard is brilliant,' Bridgland said. 'His arrival marked a turning point
in the company.'
Since then expansion has been constant, with new staff being added at
strategic intervals. While Bridgland and Taylor were away on the Ashanti
Goldfields exercise creative director Andy Morrison was away on a job in
America and for more than three weeks Sharon Griffin, 23, who had been with
the company only nine months, kept it running with the help of Richard
Samson.
'Overall our policy is one of specialisation, not diversification,' said
Bridgland. 'Creation Station has a small menu of seductive items rather than
a huge selection of mediocre dishes.'
Turnover peaked at Pounds 300,000 last year, though net profit, at just over
Pounds 25,000, was down, due to purchasing of equipment. Constant updating
of both hardware and software has been absolutely vital, says Bridgland. The
latest purchases are the four Pentium 90 pcs with 17 inch monitors Bridgland
has just bought at a total cost of Pounds 14,000.
'They are extremely fast,' Bridgland said. 'They mean we can show a whole
range of major designs rapidly to the client who is visiting us and may have
an hour before moving on to see what the competition has to offer.'
At Creation Station, Morrison tries to put as much effort into these
demonstrations to potential clients as the team does into the presentations
that are their products. The emphasis is on the adaptability and
cost-effectiveness of the VideoShow graphics.
'Clients are always impressed by the speed and cheapness with which our
system will take printed material and scan it into a presentation,'
Bridgland said. 'We also have a wealth of royalty-free stock origination
material immediately available on CD-Rom.
'The ability to update fast at the last minute is often vital for
presentations in the financial field such as the Ashanti Goldfields
exercise, where figures are changing all the time.
'By going for presentations for city-based companies and institu- tions I
think we have uncovered a rich market. Two years ago this electronics
graphics approach would have been far too modern for many city gents. But
things are changing. We are talking to several more City-based clients such
as NatWest Investments and Merrill Lynch and are very optimistic that we now
have credibility in the financial community.
'There are just two potential hurdles. One is being too specialist, so we
have taken on the distributorship of EasyShow software, which should earn
the company about Pounds 75,000 a year. The other is avoiding the temptation
to move to a plush suite in town after a good performance like the Ashanti
Goldfields operation. You can easily do that, then hit a quiet spell and
suddenly face huge problems. The other fear is of a big presentation going
wrong. We haven't had one yet but there is always the possibility.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (9): The shining light that's
an artist's holy grail - Studio living / A look at properties with space,
shelter and light which may appeal to art and crafts people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Studios are rarities in the property market. I mean real studios, not
shoe-box studio flats which are little more than a tiny kitchen area and
bathroom with a small living/sleeping/eating area dominated by a futon that
is both sofa and bed. They resemble studios only in their open-plan design.
The job of true studios (or ateliers) is to provide space - lots of it  -
plus light and shelter for artists and craftspeople to work in. Often, they
are so roomy that the artist also lives there - or cannot afford anywhere
else to live. But room for art is their prime purpose.
Large windows are essential, whether skylights or in the wall.
Traditionally, they should face north to provide a steady, subdued light
which the sun's daily cycle will not affect - a need that probably began
with portraiture. But not everyone wants a steady light, says artist Jeff
Clarke. For painting objects, a bright variable light is challenging - as it
is for painting landscapes at different times.
If you are a sculptor with shrieking electric drills, or a potter, or the
work is smelly, Clarke advises moving away from a house. Old farm buildings
are ideal if they have water and electricity. Barns have the space, and a
cow shed (which will have drainage) makes a good potter's workshop with room
to house the kiln.
The ACME Housing Association, a registered charity founded in 1972, takes
old industrial buildings for artists to use as work space. The buildings are
in London - Brixton, Camden, Hackney and Stratford - apart from an old
fishermen's net loft in Porthleven, Cornwall. Artists pay about Pounds
3.80-Pounds 4 per sq ft all in, or about Pounds 40 a week for 500 sq ft.
This imaginative scheme has helped artists such as Helen Chadwick and Rachel
Whiteread, the recent Turner Prize-winner. Now, ACME is looking for a large
industrial building where it could offer both living and working space.
Few studios keep their original proportions after conversion to bourgeois
residential use. But artists and others continue to use those where Turner's
students worked in Glebe Place, Chelsea SW3, off the King's Road in west
London. Two are on offer from De Groot Collis. Above the front door of No 69
(price Pounds 795,000), Turner's name can be seen in relief red brick. No 54
costs Pounds 895,000.
The same agent is selling 1 Mallord Street, SW3, where classical pianist
Louis Kentner lived and played for 45 years. It has three double bedrooms
and a 30ft-long studio. At Pounds 1.25m (down from Pounds 1.4m), this is a
far cry from impoverished artists.
No 28 Yeoman's Row, SW3, off Brompton Road and placed ideally to look after
all spiritual, cultural and material needs - the Brompton Oratory, Victoria
&amp; Albert museum and Harrods are nearby - is a double-fronted house with
three splendid studios. The agent is Egerton, and the price for a 53-year
lease (from Smith's Charity and, perhaps, enfranchiseable) is Pounds
775,000.
No 6 Stratford Studios, W8, is an elegantly restored, late-19th century
studio in a group off Stratford Road. It has three double bedrooms and costs
Pounds 850,000 (from Strutt &amp; Parker). The wooden floor of the studio room
is in such good condition that you could never dare to drip paint on it. But
it makes a superb house.
No 404b Fulham Road, SW6 remains in use as an artist's studio with
unpretentious, semi-open plan living space for one or two people and room
for a possible extension. The glory of the garden is a fig tree, 300 years
old and said to be the oldest and largest in England. A Tree Preservation
Order protects it. The price for the Fig Tree Studio is Pounds 240,000 (from
Aylesford).
Farther out from central London is a studio at Eyot Green, W4, a side road
off Chiswick Mall opposite Chiswick Eyot in the river Thames. (Walk along
the mall and you have a fine view of the annual Oxford and Cambridge boat
race.)
Although it has two bedrooms and a bathroom on the ground floor, this is
another proper studio with a huge space on the first floor where all of life
can happen. Foxtons is selling it for Pounds 175,000.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: New insurer, same cover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I live in a leasehold flat. Up to now, the landlord has insured the building
with Commercial Union. Now, presumably because it is cheaper, he has
suggested cover with the IGI Insurance Company Ltd, of which I have never
heard. Is it a reputable concern?
The Association of British Insurers says IGI is part of the ACI UK Holdings
insurance group and is an authorised British insurance company. You and your
fellow lease-holders are, therefore, getting the same protection as you had
with Commercial Union. As you say, no doubt the policy was transferred
because of cost. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).
CGT indexation factors
The example accompanying the April CGT indexation factors on page IX of the
Weekend FT last week may have confused some readers.
It should have read: 'Suppose you bought some shares for Pounds 6,000 in
September 1985 and sold them in April 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying
the original cost by the September 1985 figure of 1.511 gives a total of
Pounds 9,066.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax treatment of dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My stepmother died on April 30 last year and my brother and I are her
principal beneficiaries.
A probate valuation, prepared by stockbrokers, showed income due to her on
stocks which had gone ex-dividend before April 30. This income was
capitalised as part of her estate and inheritance tax was paid on the total,
including this income.
Since the income was not received until after April 30, though, as executor
I included it in the income tax return I prepared for her for the period
April 6-30 1993. But the Inland Revenue refused to take account of it in
calculating a tax refund for that period on the ground that it had not been
received by the time of her death. I accepted this ruling and assume that it
is correct.
I am concerned about the tax treatment of this income now. The dividends
have come to my brother and me, although as part of the capital of the
estate.
It seems to me, therefore, that we should not include it in our tax returns
as part of our income for the year just ending. Am I right?
Ask your stepmother's tax office for the free pamphlet IR45 (What happens
when someone dies).
We are surprised that the officer who (correctly) deleted the post-death
dividends from the pre-death claim did not even bother to tell you that this
helpful leaflet existed.
You might wish to send a formal protest on this point to the district
inspector (whose name should be printed on the tax office's letterhead).
You will see from the IR45 that, broadly speaking:
1. Half of each dividend paid after your stepmother's death forms part of
your own income of 1993-94, and the other half forms part of your brother's
income.
2. A measure of relief from higher-rate tax will be due to each of you in
respect of the inheritance tax that is attributable to those dividends
(according to an arbitrary formula).
3. As executor, you should issue tax certificates R185E to your brother and
to yourself (as beneficiaries) in respect of the dividends paid between your
stepmother's death and the winding-up of her estate.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Expatriates must pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have lived in Greece for 15 years and have no intention of returning in
the foreseeable future.
My savings (in sterling) are in a bank deposit account but I am looking for
more attractive returns on this money. Investment trusts seem an attractive
long-term proposition.
As an expatriate, I am not liable for UK income and capital gains tax.
Should I opt for UK-based or offshore trusts?
In other words, is there any disadvantage (as far as United Kingdom taxes
are concerned) in investing in UK trusts as opposed to offshore trusts?
You are wrong in saying: 'As an expatriate, I am not liable for UK income
tax.' Non-residents are basically liable to UK tax on income derived from
the UK although they are exempt from UK capital gains tax. And your UK bank
interest is exempt from UK tax by virtue of article VI(1) of the Greece-UK
double taxation convention.
As a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, you are entitled to a personal
allowance against your UK income tax liability each year. For 1994-95 (as
for 1992-93 and 1993-94), the basic personal allowance is Pounds 3,445.
Since, clearly, that will exceed 125 per cent of your prospective UK
dividends, on an investment of up to Pounds 8,000, you would, effectively,
be exempt from tax on your UK dividends and would be able to claim payment
of the 25 per cent tax credit carried by each dividend.
Therefore, the residual disadvantage of investing in the UK (so far as tax
is concerned) would simply be that you would have to wait for your tax
credits to be paid to you - although you probably could make instalment
claims during each tax year (depending upon the timing of the dividends,
etc).
We cannot, however, give investment advice (in view of the Financial
Services Act 1986).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where Federal Reserve-backed zero coupon bonds are bought in the US bond
market by a UK investor, is the original capital cost in sterling indexed up
from the date of purchase to the date of disposal, using the usual UK
indexing factors?
Assuming the answer to be yes, is the remaining gain regarded for tax
purposes as a capital gain (eligible to be mitigated to the extent of the
unused annual CGT exemption) or is it regarded as income and taxed
accordingly in its entirety?
First, you will really have to spend some time in a reference library.
There, you should look at the income tax rules for deep-discount securities
(as set out in paragraph 4 of schedule 4 to the Income and Corporation Taxes
Act 1988) in order to calculate the accrued income assessable under case IV
of schedule D.
You will find this information in one of the multi-volume, loose-leaf tax
works such as the British Tax Encyclopaedia or Simon's Taxes. It is rather a
pity, though, that you (apparently) decided to make this type of investment
without investigating the income tax consequences beforehand.
Once you have calculated the case IV figure, the capital gains calculation
is relatively straightforward, as you will see from section 118 of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
You simply deduct the case IV figure from the sale proceeds and then
calculate the chargeable gain (or allowable loss) in the usual way.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have inherited a piece of freehold land from an aunt. She inherited this
from her husband but died before a vesting assent could be made in her
favour.
An assent is now being made in order to vest the land in my aunt before, in
turn, it can be vested in me, but I am querying the wording. It says: 'The
executors hereby assent to the freehold land (described) having been vested
in Mary Smith who died on January 5th 1994 . . .'
But the land was not vested in her, was it? Should the wording be changed in
order to give good title?
As, of course, it is not possible for a dead person to have property vested
in them, the correct procedure, in our opinion, would be for the executors
of your uncle to assent to the land being vested in yourself. Your aunt need
not be mentioned in any vesting document. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As I cannot attend the annual general meetings of companies in which I have
an investment, I have always completed and returned the proxy voting forms
authorising the 'chairman of the meeting' to vote according to the wishes I
express.
In view of the article by David Wighton, 'Power of the shareholder' (FT,
April 9), it would appear that a proxy vote will be used only when those
present at the meeting demand a poll.
If this is correct, it would seem that such a vote would be of little use
except where matters of contention arise.
You are correct to say that proxy votes are used only when a show of hands
proves indecisive or goes against the resolution.
But you could always authorise a proxy, other than the chairman of the
meeting, to vote according to your wishes. (Answer by Murray Johnstone
Personal Asset Management).

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed - for a fortnight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-rate investment accounts are not as common as fixed-rate mortgages but
they give investors the certainty of knowing what their income will be,
writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Yet, few investors would feel happy fixing
their income, only to find interest rates moving up.
A few weeks ago, Halifax announced it was increasing the rates on Stepped
Income Reserve. Launched in February, this five-year, fixed-term investment
pays a guaranteed return (on a Pounds 2,000 minimum) which increases each
year. The new rates start at 6.5 per cent gross in year one and rise to 10.5
per cent in year five.
Pushing up these rates might seem like good news - but not for investors who
decided to fix at 'new' rates offered only two weeks earlier. And those
rates - issued at the end of April - replaced ones issued only nine days
before.
The recent turbulence in the bond markets accounts for all the activity, but
the message must be that this is not a good time to fix returns on
investments. As Graham Bowley explains on page VI, the markets expect
inflation and interest rates to rise. If that happens, investors will not
want to be locked into relatively low investment rates.
By the same token, it is still a good idea to fix mortgage payments,
although only if you get a good rate. The number of offers is dwindling fast
and many are decidedly unappealing. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester yesterday
withdrew its 8.49 per cent, five-year fixed-rate mortgage but Lloyds and TSB
have one at 8.39 per cent, putting Halifax's 9.25 in the shade.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (8): People in glasshouses .
. . - Conservatories / If you are thinking of building a conservatory,
Gerald Cadogan has some advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you missed Chelsea Flower Show, you have not lost your chance to see one
of the show's best houses in glass. Alitex is giving its glasshouse to the
Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, in Surrey, for the national
collection of carnations which the society and the National Carnation
Society maintain. It is now being reassembled and will reopen early next
month.
We think of conservatories as a wholeheartedly Victorian comfort. In fact,
they go back to the 17th century, as greenhouses for rearing tender plants.
Conservatories were for rearing orphans and foundlings. (The use of the word
conservatoire - conservatory in the US - for a music school has the same
origin: the Italians started music conservatories in Naples in 1537,
teaching the orphans to sing and play.)
In the 19th century in late Georgian times, conservatories caught on. In
1824 Walter Scott wrote in Redgauntlet of rendering 'the parlour more
cheerful by opening one end into a small conservatory I have never before
seen this'. They stayed popular in Victoria's reign, when the advances in
glass and iron technology led to such free-standing glories as Joseph
Paxton's Crystal Palace and the Palm House at Kew Gardens, or the
conservatory at Mentmore, Mayer Rothschild's grand stately home, which
linked the morning room and the smoking room.
The development of central heating meant that, regardless of the weather,
these house-annexes could be used to rear the exotic plants that poured into
Britain from the rest of the world.
No wonder Charlotte M. Yonge gushed in The Daisy Chain: 'A real bower for a
maiden of romance, with its rich green fragrance in the midst of winter A
picture in a dream A fairy land, where no care, or grief, or weariness could
come.'
Such attitudes explain a traditional function of conservatories. Lush and
warm, and full of hopeful light even in winter, they are ideal places to
propose in.
If you are adding a conservatory to your home, make sure you have the
technology which allows automatic control of light and ventilation. If
possible, have a look at several companies and ask what is included in the
price: preparation of site, delivery, erection, etc. Prices below are rough
guides, and do not include VAT. Check also if planning permission and / or
conservation area consent are needed. If the host-house is listed, you
probably need listed building consent for altering the character of the
house. This brings a bonus. The work should be free from VAT.
Most important of all, especially if you choose the more personal and
expensive companies, think about what you will use the new room for.
'One must make sure the layout works,' say Peter Marston, of Marston &amp;
Langinger, author of the useful The Book of the Conservatory (Weidenfeld &amp;
Nicolson 1992, Pounds 18.99).
'Conservatories usually go at the back, which is often a jumble of pipes. So
one has to think out the arrangement of the house, such as access to the
kitchen, and the plumbing. For Pounds 40,000, you do not buy just a
conservatory. In London it may be a dining room. And for Victorian houses in
the country, which usually have plenty of space, you are buying a different
type of room.'
Alitex (Alton: 0420-82860) is primarily a maker of glasshouses, which
includes a Victorian-style range with outside cold frames as an extra.
Besides its new glasshouse for Wisley, it has rebuilt the Victorian
glasshouses at Sir George Staunton Country Park at Havant in Hampshire,
using old photographs and paintings.
Prices for glasshouses start at around Pounds 7,000. The Wisley building
would cost around Pounds 11,000. Some private customers spend Pounds
20,000-Pounds 40,000.
Amdega (Darlington: 0325-468522, or US: 800-9220110) is the largest maker,
offering standard designs that can be adapted. Typical prices run from
Pounds 2,947 for a porch to Pounds 19,183 for a Gothic design with a
clerestory lantern, and do not include installation or building work.
Glass Houses (London: 071-607 6071) is unusual. It is basically an
architectural practice designing every conservatory individually for its
host-house. It takes about three months from order to completion. The
company also specialises in orangeries (which differ from conservatories as
they have some stone in them), roof lanterns and summer houses and garden
pavilions. Their cheapest conservatory is about Pounds 10,000. Some cost
Pounds 100,000. A typical price is Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 30,000.
Marston &amp; Langinger (London: 071-823 6829) finds that all its host-houses
are pre-first world war and 30 per cent of them are listed buildings. Prices
range from Pounds 10,000 to over Pounds 300,000. An excellent handbook
covers a full variety of smart architectural designs and details, and
furnishings.
Oak Leaf (York: 0904-690 401 or US: 800-226 1248) also designs individually,
in a modern style as well as Victorian, using Canadian western red cedar.
Oak Leaf recently rebuilt much of the 19th century conservatory of Broughton
Hall in Yorkshire. Typical price for a 20 x 25 ft conservatory: Pounds
22,000 (including erection and leadwork).
Portland Conservatories (Salford: 061-745 7920) is another maker of
individually designed conservatories. Prices start at Pounds 8,000.
Room Outside (Goodwood: 0243-776563) emphasises the durability of its
individually-designed conservatories, which cost from Pounds 4,000 to, say,
Pounds 30,000. A typical price is Pounds 15,000. The company also has a
cheaper range called Highlife, from around Pounds 3,500.
Two important fitted accessories are blinds and tiles. Here are some
stockists:
Blinds. Appeal Blinds (Bristol: 0272-637734) makes blinds to keep the heat
in or out, according to the season. It uses several artificial fabrics and
pinoleum - reeded pine wood which has been made in France for 100 years, and
costs from Pounds 95 a square metre (including fitting). A thermostatic
motor is available from Pounds 680.
Tiles. Sussex Terracotta (Burgess Hill: 0444-241236) produces hand-made
tiles in orange, yellow and brown Wealden clays dug from a pit at an old
brickworks. As the tiles dry for several weeks before firing, they are all
slightly different but mix well and wear well. To design your own floor
costs from about Pounds 44 a square metre. Paris Ceramics (071-371 7778)
sells tiles from all over the world, and old tiles that have been salvaged.
Finally, those looking for a house in London with a large conservatory could
consider 8 Monmouth Road, W2, on offer from Winkworth (071-727 3227) for
Pounds 485,000.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Buying shares can save you money -
Third in a series on the true costs of investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fledgling investor might find some stockbrokers' charges a bit on the
high side. In practice, though, direct investment in shares can be cheaper
than putting your money into a pension plan or endowment policy. The bad
news, however, is that changes in the way the stock exchange does business
could push up those costs.
Rolling settlement starts in July, after which all deals must be settled
within 10 working days. This is due to be followed next year by a five-day
settlement timetable. And, at some indeterminate date, comes the new Crest
electronic settlement system. But City brains are still trying to work out
how these changes can be brought in without scaring off that hero of the
1980s, the popular capitalist.
Dealing costs
The first thing for which you should look out when using a share-dealing
service is a joining fee. This could be Pounds 5 or Pounds 10 or more and is
generally a one-off charge.
The next, and more significant, charge is the actual cost of buying and
selling. In most cases, this is based on a percentage of the value of the
deal, usually on a sliding scale - for example, 1.5 per cent on the first
Pounds 2,500, 0.75 per cent on the next Pounds 2,500, and 0.1 per cent on
anything else.
These percentage rates can vary significantly from one broker to another and
the best-value broker for a Pounds 2,000 deal might not be so competitive on
Pounds 10,000. A recent survey among readers of Investors Chronicle magazine
revealed that they were likely to use several different brokers, depending
on the size of the transaction.
But there is a snag with very small deals: the minimum charge. This can make
selling small parcels of, say, privatisation shares very expensive: a
minimum charge of Pounds 40 on a deal of Pounds 1,000 works out at a hefty 4
per cent. Fortunately, there are services which have a minimum as low as
Pounds 9.
As a general rule, cheaper dealing costs can be found from the new
generation of dealing-only (or execution-only) brokers. With these, however,
you get no advice on which shares to buy and sell. That is left to you.
Extra charges
There are two costs which cannot be avoided wherever you go. First is stamp
duty of 0.5 per cent on purchases. Second, there is the PTM (Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers) levy, a flat Pounds 2 on deals of Pounds 10,000 or
more.
Assume brokerage is 1.5 per cent on both purchases and sales, and the spread
(see below) is around 1 per cent. The total cost of your investment,
including the stamp duty, is around 4.5 per cent - without any extras.
(Note, though, that there is no stamp duty or buying commission on
newly-issued shares.)
Some brokers add extra fees for each deal, ranging from Pounds 1 to Pounds
20 or more. No matter what they are called - whether compliance charges,
contract charges or administration charges - it is money you must pay.
The spread
If there is one vaguely hidden cost of share dealing, it is the spread - the
difference between the buying and selling price of shares. Basically, this
is the charge you pay to the market-maker through whom your broker buys or
sells your shares.
If the price quoted in the FT when you sell shares is the same as when you
bought them, you would actually make a loss. This figure is the mid-market
price: buyers pay more, sellers get less.
The key point to remember is that some shares are more expensive than
others. The highly-traded shares of big FT-SE companies have much narrower
spreads than their smaller brethren.
The best way to measure the spread is to look at the 'touch' - the
difference between the lowest buying price and highest selling price from
different market-makers. Last Monday, British Telecommunications was trading
at 385p-387p - a difference of a little over 0.5 per cent. Marks and
Spencer, on 425p-427p, was a shade under 0.5 per cent. But Who's Who
publisher A. &amp; S. Black, on 320p-340p, had a difference of 6 per cent. And
convenience food store Cullens traded at 12p-13.5p, a difference of 12 per
cent.
Some brokers point out that they negotiate prices with the market-maker,
whereas cheaper execution brokers may simply deal at the prices they see on
their computer screens.
Management costs
People who want their broker to act as investment manager will, inevitably,
have to pay for the service. Typically, there will be an annual fee, based
on the value of your portfolio, in the region of 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per
cent. There might be a sliding percentage scale, with the rate falling on
the top tiers of the portfolio. There could also be minimum and maximum
charges. Alternatively, there may be fixed fees.
The broker might have two fee scales, depending on whether he has total
discretion to buy and sell or whether you must be consulted first. Anyone
considering a portfolio management service should get a breakdown of all the
fees and find out if these are in addition to normal dealing charges.
The future
Rolling settlement and Crest are the main developments aimed at streamlining
the way the stock exchange does business. But what could make the system
more efficient for institutional investors might be less attractive to
private ones.
Crest is likely to eliminate most share certificates, although private
investors can have these if they want. Even before Crest, though, five-day
rolling settlement could make it difficult for certificate holders to settle
in time, so investors will be offered the chance of a longer settlement
period. Thus, a two-tier market is likely to develop. If you want share
certificates and a longer settlement time, you are likely to pay more for
the privilege.
There is a fear, though, that even those who join fully in the new system
could be faced with a higher bill. This is because investors are, almost
certainly, going to have to hold shares in a nominee account.
The nominee system is well established and cuts down delays in settling.
There is no need to send certificates and stock transfer forms through the
post. Some brokers make no charge for a nominee account; others may levy
Pounds 10 or Pounds 20 a year for each holding, or perhaps a flat annual fee
of Pounds 100.
Nominee costs will become a new factor in deciding which broker's charges
are most suited to how you invest in shares. Another will be the increased
use of deposit accounts, to which a broker has access, to pay for deals. But
investors will need to make sure such an account pays a competitive rate of
interest. An uncompetitive rate would, effectively, be a hidden cost of
using the broker.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Bad advice victims get a lifeline -
But do pension audit services offer real help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former company pension scheme members who transferred their benefits to
personal plans after getting bad advice may be tempted to pre-empt the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB) guidelines on how those responsible
should assess the financial damage and award compensation.
Even when the guidelines are published in July, SIB thinks that if all
500,000 potential cases of bad advice are investigated, it could be a year
or more before the last one is settled
In the meantime, several firms of financial advisers are offering a 'pension
transfer audit' service. This claims to provide tangible evidence to help
transfer victims pursue a case for compensation.
Clearly, though, those who have lost money through pension transfers should
not part with any more unless their case looks certain and the adviser can
demonstrate independence and pensions expertise.
One pension consultant, Lexis*, offers a free fact sheet to help individuals
assess if they should investigate past advice. Should the answer be yes, the
firm's pension audit costs Pounds 50.
If the case then goes to court, Ringrose Wharton, a financial services
litigation specialist, will act on a no-win no-fee basis. Ringrose Wharton
proved its mettle by making successful compensation claims for more than
1,000 victims of home income plans.
Tempting though it is for victims to seek a speedy resolution, SIB points
out that pension audits may prove simply to be another bandwagon for
advisers. It says its own investigations should lead to maximum compensation
in deserving cases - and the service will be free.
The timetable
Earlier this month, SIB published details of the priority transfer cases and
urged advisers and providers of personal plans to negotiate full
reinstatement in occupational schemes for all opt-outs - those who belonged
to them at the time of transfer.
In addition, where the transfer related to deferred benefits - those pension
entitlements left behind when an individual changes jobs - SIB identified
these priority cases:
Those who have died.
Those who have started to draw their benefits.
Women 50 or over and men 55 or over at the time of transfer.
SIB stressed, however, that if you were in one of these categories, you
would be on the priority list already and a transfer audit service would not
speed up the negotiations.
A spokesman said: 'If you do not fall into these categories, then using a
pension audit service will not make you a priority case and will only cost
you more money.'
He added that non-priority cases should write to the adviser or provider
concerned and register a complaint. These cases would be picked up in the
second wave of investigations due to start after the July statement.
'What the regulators will do is make a co-ordinated approach to schemes and
providers to facilitate reinstatement and compensation,' the spokesman said.
'This will be more cost-effective and successful than a series of individual
claims from different advisers.'
A victim's check-list
To help construct an appropriate letter to the adviser or provider, Robert
Ivey - head of financial services at actuarial consultant Watsons -
suggested that non-priority cases should ask themselves certain questions to
assess if they had made a prudent and informed decision at the time of
transfer:
Did your adviser conduct a full fact-find covering your personal, financial
and family circumstances and your attitude to risk?
Did the pension provider's illustration show benefits on the same basis as
those provided under your previous pension scheme - for example, the same
level of spouse's pension, retirement age, and level of increases to
pensions in payment?
Do you understand the guaranteed nature of the benefits you have given up,
and the uncertain level of benefits which could be provided to you under
your personal pension plan?
Did the person who advised you to transfer examine the history of increases
to pensions in payment within the previous scheme?
Are you aware of the level of death benefits which you gave up, compared
with those available under your personal pension?
Did your adviser give you details of how much commission or fees he would be
earning for arranging the transfer?
If you joined a new employer's pension scheme, did you or your adviser
consider transferring your pension benefits into that scheme?
Do you understand fully the reasons why you were advised to transfer?
If the answer to any of the above questions is no, then you would be well
advised to take up the matter with your adviser or provider.
In addition, those who were members of a public sector scheme (such as local
government, the National Health Service, civil service or police), or who
belonged to a good final-salary scheme providing pensions linked to the
retail price index (RPI), should certainly query the advice. This is because
a personal pension or buy-out bond is unlikely to be able to match these
benefits.
Reinstatement problems
Between now and July, SIB has to negotiate with personal pension providers
and occupational schemes to determine the cost of full reinstatement. In
most cases, this will be far higher than the surrender value of the personal
pension plan.
The shortfall arises mainly because the provider will have deducted charges
to cover its own administration and the commission payments to salesmen. But
pension scheme transfer calculations also are at fault.
Two plus two
equals three
Even if the life office concerned offered a full return of the transfer
value, the scheme actuary would still identify a shortfall for complete
reinstatement.
Under a typical final-salary scheme, where the pension is linked to the
level of salary at retirement, the real value of a member's pension rights
at transfer - known as 'past service reserve' - takes into account full
earnings' inflation up to retirement date.
Most schemes in the private sector pay out transfer values that are
significantly lower than the past service reserve. In theory, this means
that if you took a transfer cheque on Monday morning and handed it back on
Monday afternoon, it would not pay for full reinstatement. Life offices are
not the only ones to make a turn on your pension transfer.
Who will pay?
Brian Gibb, principal with consulting actuaries William M. Mercer, explains:
'The transfer value is the cash equivalent of the leaving service benefit,
which has only limited inflation protection. The difference between this and
the past service reserve, which takes account of full earnings' inflation,
falls back into the scheme. Therefore, the transfer in must be bigger than
the transfer out - and who is going to pay for the difference?'
Who indeed? Life offices may well compensate for the charges they have
deducted from the transfer values but, understandably, will be unwilling to
pay for the vagaries of the company scheme transfer value system.
Hard cases
SIB has yet to comment on compensation for cases where reinstatement is not
possible.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Micro-state with a mind
of its own - Andorra and Switzerland / A look at the advantages of living in
the heart of the Pyrenees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 700 years of feudal rule the 180-square mile Pyrenean micro-state of
Andorra decided last year that enough was enough. Slotted between France and
Spain it had always been ruled by its French and Spanish co-princes.
Following a referendum, the approval of a constitution and elections,
Andorra is now free to decide its own destiny, with the power of veto held
by the co-princes eliminated. Since the beginning of the year it has been
studying the constitution and planning its future, while its population
waits to see what changes are in store.
That population of 58,500 includes only 13,320 Andorrans. The principality
is also home to 28,000 Spaniards, 7,000 Portuguese, 5,000 French, 1,300
registered Britons, plus a mix of other nationalities.
Its attraction is its lack of taxes. 'No income tax, no VAT, no capital
gains tax, no wealth tax . . . ' chorus estate agents' advertisements for
its properties. It has almost no direct taxation but imposes a small levy on
imported goods.
Its prices are low and 10m tourists pour in each year and buy from its
shops. Its splendid mountain scenery and long winter sports season bring
their own following.
But what now? It seems almost certain that Andorra's freedom from most forms
of direct taxation will not be affected, say local people.
'One of the most exciting proposals is that the principality may establish
itself as an offshore financial centre and allow non-Andorran financial
institutions to operate here,' says an estate agent.
'The possibility of offering multinational companies licences to base their
European operations within Andorra, free from corporation and other business
taxes, is said to be under consideration.'
A conference held by the Collegi d'Economistes had come out strongly in
favour of radical changes to the allowable capital structure of companies.
The finance minister and many political leaders were calling for selective
changes to the legislation which would allow foreign-owned companies a
proper framework for activities in the country.
'If either or both of these proposals is implemented, the benefits to
residents and investors will be considerable and we would anticipate rises
in property values, both residential and commercial, throughout Andorra.'
Some 80 per cent of Andorran property is sold to foreigners and, in the last
two years prices, which had been rising, have stabilised.
British agency G A K Williamson &amp; Associates, based in Hampshire, handles
property in Andorra. It says studio flats on its books start around Pounds
37,000; two-bedroom apartments are Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 80,000 and three
to four bedrooms, Pounds 100,000-plus.
Rental returns could be 7 per cent to 8 per cent net on the smaller
apartments. There are no restrictions on foreigners buying or letting a
property in Andorra. To take full advantage of its tax benefits you would
have to live there. This would mean becoming a permanent resident. Many
people simply stay there as 'permanent tourists'. For skiing enthusiasts,
the Massana valley offers opportunities to buy studios and apartments 10 to
15 minutes' drive from the slopes, from Pounds 40,000. Or you could pay
Pounds 1m for a large chalet.
Andorra has five principal ski stations, within an hour of each other and at
varying heights. There are 140 pistes, testing different capabilities.
Another British-based agency with Andorran property is L &amp; D Goss, in
Shropshire. This offers homes built by just one developer, La Pleta -
because it likes the company's style.
Leslie Goss is not alone in being critical of some modern Andorran building:
'Row upon row of multi-storey rectangular blocks, in which the size and
layout of each apartment is identical.' Such blocks are cheap to build but
their units have a low resale value because there are so many from which to
choose, he says.
La Pleta has a different approach. It has been building three villages, with
properties no more than three storeys high. They are of natural stone,
timber and slate, in the Catalan style, hugging the landscape, or around
squares, with seating or a fountain.
One such village, in Ordino, is complete and sold, but resales are
available. The second, El Tarter, near ski slopes, offers new property, as
does the third, near Ordino, which is in its early stages. The last two will
each have 150 two to five-bedroom apartments, priced from Pounds 100,000 to
Pounds 250,000.
The official language is Catalan and Spanish and French are spoken. The
principality is not a member of the EU. 'Nor likely to be, due to the
Andorrans' natural loathing of bureaucracy and antipathy to taxation,' says
one foreign resident.
Construccio Immobiliaria 5A in La Massana, Andorra, offers home buyers a
complete package.
Properties are designed by its architectural company, constructed by its
building company and can be furnished from its furniture shop. An
administrative section takes care of rental, maintenance, car hire and other
services.
Viviane Girault, executive director, says its cheapest new property is a
one-bedroom flat with garage space, at Pounds 63,000; its most expensive, is
a large apartment at Pounds 136,500. Among resales she can offer an almost
new chalet at Pounds 350,000, being sold by a British owner.
Andorra has no currency of its own so a purchaser can pay in any currency.
Girault says that people planning to let have three choices. With so few
Andorrans, foreigners come to work in banks, shops, ski resorts and there is
a big demand for long-term rentals. The short-term market is also buoyant
particularly for properties in skiing areas.
The third choice is aparthotels. These, furnished and run as four-star
hotels are usually sited near a sports or shopping centre. Units are sold to
buyers who put them back into a letting pool. Income from renting goes into
the pool and expenses are taken out. Owners can use the properties for
designated periods themselves, receiving an annual payment.
Guy Griffiths, director of Roc Propietats, in La Massana, provides services
such as valuations, organising powers of attorney, arrangement of mortgages,
account opening and general liaison with an Andorran bank. His co-director
Su Downham, is also British but married to an Andorran. 'Our aim is to offer
the widest cross-section of properties in the principality,' he says. Roc's
typical prices are: small studio/one-bedroom investment flats, from Pounds
30,000; two-bedrooms, from Pounds 60,000; three-bedrooms, from Pounds
85,000. Large apartments with gardens, up to Pounds 560,000, chalets from
Pounds 199,000 to Pounds 860,000.
At present the majority of properties changing hands are resales, but new
developments are continually coming on stream.
During the recession in Europe, Andorran property continued to sell because
of the principality's appeal to a worldwide market.
Griffiths says his agency receives inquiries from residents of Switzerland
and Monaco, who see Andorra as an alternative to their current base at
significantly lower entry fees.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (7): Debate over home curbs -
Andorra and Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss parliamentarians will begin debating a series of government proposals
next month to loosen the country's severe restrictions on the acquisition of
property by foreigners.
The main elements in the proposed liberalisation are enlarged and more
flexible quotas for foreigners to buy holiday homes and the elimination of
restrictions on foreign residents in Switzerland buying property for their
own use.
If accepted by both houses of parliaments, and provided that no one insists
that it be put to a referendum, the package could become law late this year
or early next. However, it is always difficult to judge the mood of
parliament or the Swiss electorate on this issue.
The current restrictions, built around the so-called Lex Friedrich, were put
in place in 1985 when the Swiss were anxious that every available Alp would
be taken over for holiday homes by rich Germans and Italians.
Since, the property boom in the country has collapsed and in some mountain
holiday areas, especially in French Switzerland, hard-pressed local
developers are pleading to be allowed to sell more holiday homes to
foreigners.
Moreover, the political environment surrounding Switzerland has changed
since the mid-1980s. Harmonisation of many laws and regulations in EU
countries has increased the pressure on Switzerland to fall into step.
Lex Friedrich also infringes the spirit of Switzerland's commitments under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
Substantial liberalisation in many areas, including property ownership,
would have been forced on the country if it had joined the European Economic
Area (EEA), an enlarged free trade area. However, a slim majority of the
Swiss people rejected the EEA in a referendum in December, 1992.
Undaunted, the government then undertook a liberalisation programme of its
own, and so far it is going well, although the issues treated to date, such
as cartel control, do not rouse public sentiments in the way property can.
The timing of the parliamentary debate may be propitious. The angry reaction
of neighbouring countries to the referendum vote in February to outlaw
transit lorries on Alpine passes from 2004 has startled the Swiss. Perhaps
they will be more inclined to mollify their neighbours on property rights
than they might have been a few months ago.
The legal pillar of the liberalisation plan is the replacement of the
criterion of nationality with that of residence. A foreigner who is resident
in Switzerland or who lived in the country in the past for at least five
years would no longer face any restrictions on property purchases. People
who live outside but who normally work in the country would no longer have
to obtain authorisation to buy a secondary home.
For those who do not meet these conditions, the existing holiday home quota
scheme would be substantially loosened. The principle of a continually
declining national quota would be abolished. The quota would rise from the
present 1,420 per year to the maximum 2,000 allowed by Lex Friedrich.
If a foreigner who owns a home sells it to another foreigner, that
transaction would no longer be counted from the quota. Some foreigners had
difficulties getting permission to sell their holiday properties because the
local authorities preferred to allot quota to new properties. Similarly,
distress sales would be removed from the quota.

a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With a bank holiday Monday approaching, I will be tempted to do some further
investment research. Last bank holiday Monday, the sun surprised everyone by
appearing. People on the beach sat or lay in little groups. I glanced at
them from my beach hut before continuing with one of my favourite holiday
activities: looking at company groupings on the share price pages of the FT.
It seemed to me that spending an hour or so seeking anomalies in the various
sectors of the market was likely to be more rewarding than lying around in
the sun risking premature ageing and skin cancer. I hoped that the fresh sea
breeze would blow cobwebs from my mind and that potential bargains would
dance before my eyes.
From experience, I have found that comparing the price/earnings ratios of
various companies within the same sector can be a useful pointer to further
research. P/e ratios, published in the FT, are based on a company's share
price divided by its last published earnings.
Suppose a company has 100m issued shares and made a profit after tax of
Pounds 10m: the profit attributable to each share is 10p. If the share price
is 150p, the p/e is 15. If the profits remain the same, but the share price
rises to 250p, the p/e is 25. If the average p/e for a particular sector is,
say, 18 and an individual company stands out because its p/e is only 10,
does this mean the company is a bargain?
Not necessarily. It could well be that the low p/e is due to investors
believing the company will announce reduced profits. Or, perhaps, its
medium-term future might not be as rosy as other companies in the sector
with higher ratios. This is why I use the p/e only as the starting point for
further research.
Have the company's shares been marked down too harshly by the market? Is the
low rating merely temporary? Does the company have solid - perhaps
under-valued - assets, so giving it considerable long-term potential? Will
the low p/e attract a take-over bid? I try always to find an answer to
these, and many other questions, before I invest.
My first major source of reference is the annual report. With luck, the
company will use the FT's annual reports service (details on the share price
pages). If so, a 'phone call will be all it takes to obtain what I require.
Sometimes, I will monitor the company's share price movements for a few
months or more, just to see if the market marks down the share price even
further on rumours of bad news. Quite often, though, not all my questions
can be answered with 100 per cent certainty; thus, my eventual investment
decision might be partly the result of a gut feeling or hunch.
Perhaps my quickest success with this method was in April 1986 following
another bank holiday p/e exercise. I noticed that NSS Newsagents had a p/e
of about 14 whereas WH Smith and Menzies had ratios of more than 20.
Looking in more depth at NSS, I discovered that UK Provident owned 17 per
cent of it. At the time, there were press reports about various 'problems'
with UKP and, indeed, it entered an operational merger that month with
another insurance company, Friends Provident.
I thought UKP's stake in NSS might be a useful springboard from which a
predator could launch a take-over bid, so my wife wasted no time in buying
NSS shares for 150p each. In June 1986, Gallaher duly made a bid and my wife
accepted the 210p cash offer, so clearing a profit (before tax) of 60p a
share in about two months.
If low p/e ratios can point the way to possible profits, can very high ones
indicate shares to avoid? Again, not necessarily. The high p/e might result
from the market anticipating a substantial increase in the company's profits
which might then produce a lower p/e. Or perhaps the share price has been
marked up due to take-over rumours.
Further investigations are needed before dismissing a company just because
its p/e is very high by comparison with other companies in its sector.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Investing for income - A look at a
sector that can prove confusing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A whole variety of funds is bubbling away within the cauldron of the UK
equity income sector. But the resulting brew can be a confusing mix of
flavours.
The Association of Unit and Investment Funds defines UK equity income funds
as providing an income at least 10 per cent higher than that on the FT-SE-A
All Share index. But fewer than 40 per cent of the funds in the sector
conform to this definition.
At the beginning of the month, the yield on the All-Share was about 3.7 per
cent, but some funds were yielding as little as 2 per cent and others more
than 6 per cent. The difference was due to the varying investment aims of
the trusts. Some try to give investors a high yield, others concentrate on
'total return' by providing a cocktail of income and capital growth.
Yet another ingredient has been tossed into the pot recently by the
Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator of the financial
services industry. It has allowed unit trusts to charge their management
expenses out of capital rather than income. By doing so, income funds can
boost their yields overnight.
Investors may find that the new charging structure masks a greater erosion
of their capital. Optimists argue, however, that some trusts may charge
their expenses to capital, maintain the same yield and use the 'extra'
revenue to buy better-quality stock for more rapid capital growth.
For a long time, it appeared that you could not go wrong by investing in the
sector. It was the natural place for income-seekers. A look at the figures
also showed that if you were after capital growth and chose to re-invest
your income, you would get greater returns here than in the UK equity growth
sector.
According to Micropal, the average UK equity income fund delivered returns
(offer to bid, with net income re-invested) of 303 per cent in the 10 years
to April 1, while equity growth mustered a return of 255 per cent; the
figures over five and three years are growth of 45 and 32 per cent for
equity income, and 40 and 36 per cent for equity growth funds.
Michael Lenhoff, strategist at Capel Cure Myers, says the outperformance is
due mainly to the re-rating of shares on a high yield. Income funds select
companies with a high yield - where their dividend represents a relatively
high proportion of the share price. A company might be on a high yield
because its prospects were not thought to be good.
The shares may be re-rated, however, if the market decides the company has
been undervalued or it becomes the subject of a merger or acquisition. As an
economy comes out of recession, cyclical stocks - such as smaller companies
or recovery stock bought for their high yield  - will give higher returns
than stock of a similar, but lower-yielding, type.
More consistent performance can be found in the funds in our table. It lists
trusts which are in the top decile (25 per cent) in the three and five years
to May 1; some also have top decile performance over 10 years. Funds without
a five-year track record are excluded. The effect of re-investing income is
marked.
High-yielding shares are not the only way of providing an income. William
Mott, fund manager of Credit Suisse Income, moved about 5 per cent of the
fund into permanent interest-bearing shares, which are issued by building
societies and offer a yield of between 9 and 11 per cent.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Where you should look

<TEXT>
The choice of investment trusts specialising in UK equity income is much
smaller than that of unit trusts. They are to be found in two sectors:
income growth, and high income.
Income growth trusts, which aim to provide a yield 10 to 50 per cent above
the FT-SE-A All Share index as well as capital growth, have been around for
a long time but the high-income sector is a more recent development. Very
few high-income trusts have a five-year record.
The best-performing income growth trust over both three and five years is
Value &amp; Income, which used to be the Stewart Enterprise investment trust
before it was taken over by Olim in August 1986.
V&amp;I's consistently high performance is the result of an investment strategy
untypical of the sector: up to half its portfolio consists of direct
holdings of commercial property, mainly small shops in Scotland. 'A typical
property for us would be Woolworths in Campbeltown,' says manager Matthew
Oakeshott.
Perhaps surprisingly, the fund made a profit on commercial property all the
way through the recession. The remainder of the fund is in high-yielding
equities.
Murray Income's portfolio is probably more typical of income growth funds.
About 80 per cent is invested in the UK with the largest proportion in top
100 stocks, backed up by medium-sized companies.
After weathering the recession by monitoring companies very closely for
indications of dividend cuts, manager Susan Boyd is now dropping her
defensive stance and moving into manufacturing stocks such as engineering,
chemicals and building materials.
A serious drawback for investors is that heavy demand for high-yielding
trusts means almost all the UK income growth investment trusts are at
premiums of 2 to 9 per cent. This leaves holders open to losses if premiums
dwindle or disappear.
Nigel Sidebottom, an investment trust specialist at stockbroker Gerrard
Vivian Gray, says he would be happy buying several of the trusts in this
sector at around net asset value, as they are unlikely to fall much below
that level, but he would not buy them at their present premiums.
As an alternative he would look at other sectors, such as international
general, where yields were slightly lower. But many trusts are trading at
discounts of around 10 per cent, thus boosting the effective yield of the
underlying assets.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (5): Are all top schools in
top-class areas? - School catchment areas / Can you put a value on the extra
price you must pay for a house in a good school's catchment area?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
The Financial Times' studies of state education over the last two years have
discovered a new phenomenon - 'education by mortgage'. Put simply, when the
FT attempted to assess schools' academic strength, it found that the good
schools tended to be in areas where house prices were highest.
In 1992, our survey of A-level results found that the two top performing
counties in the state sector - Hertfordshire and Berkshire - had house
prices respectively 45 and 51 per cent above the national average.
A look at the top achieving comprehensive schools again suggested a strong
link with wealthy localities, and high house prices. The highest placed was
Hasmonean High, serving the Jewish community in Hendon, north London,
followed by Cherwell, which includes north Oxford - home of many university
lecturers - in its catchment area.
An initial reaction is that this is a social phenomenon - wealthy parents
tend to live near to each other and lavish extra support on their children.
They then tend to perform better than the average regardless of the quality
of the schools' teaching staff. Hence the 'best' schools are in the most
expensive areas.
But there is evidence that this also works in reverse. Anxious parents try
to find out where the best schools are and then pay whatever is necessary to
live within the right catchment area. Recent government education measures
have allowed more choice, and the so-called 'Greenwich judgment' established
that parents could send their children to school across borough or county
boundaries, but it is still best for them to live within easy reach of a
preferred school.
League tables, which neither newspapers nor the government can resist
publishing, and spiralling independent school fees have also encouraged
parents to shop around for state schools. That means moving to the 'right'
area.
Buckinghamshire provides a strong example. It has retained a traditional
'grammar school' system, and pupils are selected on the basis of competitive
examinations. Multi-national companies now tend to steer executives
relocating in Britain towards the county because of its schools' strong
reputation.
This then becomes a virtuous circle. Head teachers at grammar schools in
High Wycombe - including the Royal Grammar School, which was the country's
top state boys' school last year, according to the FT's survey - all report
that parents move to the area just to give their children what they hope
will be a better education.
David Levin, the school's headmaster, reports that parents frequently move
to the area just to get a chance of the good, cheap education. Estate agents
routinely entice potential buyers with the town's schools, and expect to
extract extra value for it. But quantifying it is more of a problem.
Similar trends are at work in Greater London, where the quality of schools
is reputedly more variable. The effect on values is also variable.
Paul Webb, of the estate agent Barnard Marcus's Richmond office, in
south-west London, says the borough's popular schools have a big impact on
buying intentions. Neighbouring Hounslow's schools do not have as strong a
reputation, and many parents 'simply will not look at schools in Hounslow'.
But he adds: 'There will just as easily be young couples or single
professionals who won't be phased by a poor catchment areas at all. It's not
great enough to influence the value of someone's home.'
Bexley, in south-east London, has, like Buckinghamshire, held on to grammar
schools. That, according to David Blake, director of corporate affairs for
the Woolwich building society, means that 'a lot of people choose to move
into Bexley and it has an effect on certain localities within the borough.
It's not as important a factor as it used to be since the Greenwich
judgment, but there was a time when estate agents would actually list
schools on their particulars and identify them.'
But Blake's final judgment is unequivocal: 'There's a very definite
connection between where people choose to live which obviously has an effect
on values and where state schools are placed. I'm sure parents are prepared
to pay extra to live in a good school's catchment area.'
In north London, schools can be even more variable, and Barnard Marcus's
Barnet office reports that parents frequently lay down a catchment area as a
pre-condition when first starting their property searches. Junior schools,
as well as the area's numerous well-known secondaries, can exert this
pressure.
But again, putting a price on a school is tough. According to Paul Grover,
of Barnard Marcus: 'There is definitely an effect in north London. But when
it comes down to the price it's very difficult to fix the difference.'
He thinks that catchment areas impact on demand, but not directly on prices.
When the market dips, this can be a big advantage.
It remains very questionable whether catchment areas have such an impact on
property values that house-hunters should take them into account if they do
not have school-age children themselves.
According to Gary Marsh, who researches the residential property market for
Halifax building society: 'Quality of schools varies through time as well.
Anecdotally there's a lot of evidence for this from estate agents, but it's
not an easy effect to pick up on any data-base.'
So catchment area effects, when they occur, are difficult to quantify, and
might prove transitory - it only takes the retirement of a head, or the
opening of a new city technology college a mile away, to destroy a school's
local pull. Marsh thinks it would be 'misleading' to put any value on the
extra price you must pay for a house in a good school's catchment area.
The effect exists. Parents who shudder at independent school fees would be
crazy not to take it into account. But do not imagine that by buying a house
in a sought-after catchment area you are acquiring a guaranteed saleable
asset.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Should investors steer clear of
gilts? - With prices still falling, Graham Bowley examines the risks of
buying government bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wise investor, it seems, would do well to stay clear of the UK
government bond - or gilt - market. After another battering this week, the
risk that gilts will fall still lower looks just too great. But others
believe differently: for them, the only way is up. Who is right will depend
on what happens to inflation and interest rates.
Bond markets have been in a tizzy ever since February when the Federal
Reserve, the US central bank, raised short-term interest rates in a
pre-emptive strike on inflation. Investors took fright, sensing a turning
point in world rates, and bond prices plummeted. The UK market has been one
of the worst affected: gilt prices have fallen by nearly 15 per cent since
the beginning of the year. Yields have climbed 2 1/4 percentage points;
long-term interest rates now stand at more than 8 per cent.
The implication is clear: the markets expect inflation and interest rates to
rise soon. All the signs are that the economic recovery is continuing apace
and is managing to ride out the April tax increases that some thought would
stop it dead. There is, however, scant evidence that inflation is beginning
to rise - underlying inflation is at its lowest level since 1967. There is
also little reason to believe short-term interest rates are about to
increase.
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was even seen to argue for
a cut in interest rates in the last published minutes of his monthly meeting
with Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. His panel of independent
advisers, the so-called six wise men, have said there is no need for
interest rates to go up.
The Bank has hardened its stance on interest rates - and indeed it would
need to be brave, if not foolhardy, to try to cut them short-term in the
face of rising long-term rates. The consensus now seems to be that while
interest rates have gone down as far as they are going to go, they are not
going to go up just yet, either.
So why the nervousness in the gilt market?
Calm and common sense seemed to have been restored after the Bundesbank,
Germany's central bank, lowered its discount rate on May 11 and the Federal
Reserve raised US short-term interest rates again on May 17. The bond
markets seemed satisfied that the central banks' monetary policy reflected
the different stages of economic recovery in each country - the US already
well into its comeback, followed closely by the UK, with the rest of Europe
still growing only slowly.
Investors, however, began to doubt that the US had done enough to shift
interest rates to a more 'neutral' stance - one that neither stimulates nor
stunts the recovery. Then, comments by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer,
and concern about continued explosive growth in the German money supply,
combined to challenge the assumption that German interest rates would
continue to fall.
The final straw for the markets came this week when lack of demand forced
the Bundesbank to call off an auction of German government bonds. Germany's
bond market took a dive - and gilts followed suit.
So, is now a good time to buy bonds? 'Gilts definitely look cheap at the
moment,' says Ruth Lea, chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers. 'Long yields
could easily fall from their present high levels and, with a corresponding
rise in price, that means a substantial capital gain. But whether now is the
right time to buy depends on whether you think interest rates are about to
turn, and that is very difficult to judge with current market volatility.'
Over to James Higgins, of financial adviser Chamberlain De Broe. 'It's
almost the time to buy,' he says. 'Gilts are oversold at the moment but we
are advising people to sit tight, at least for a few months, until all this
uncertainty has been shaken out.'
Richard Boyton, another adviser, adds: 'A yield of, say, 7 1/2 per cent and
inflation of 2 per cent gives a real return of 5 1/2 per cent. There may be
some capital loss but the return is not bad at all.'
More nervous investors may want some sort of protection, such as that
provided by an index-linked gilt, the value of which is adjusted for
inflation. Alternatively, the new convertible bond issued by the Bank of
England this week, the first since 1987, could provide the protection the
personal investor needs when faced with such volatility.
The Bank auctioned Pounds 2bn of 7 per cent convertible gilts which will
mature in August 1997 - but which investors have the option of converting
into a 9 per cent 2012 bond for the first time on August 6.
A convertible gilt is a short-dated bond which can be exchanged for a
specified long-dated gilt at a fixed price some time in the future. Its
appeal is that it allows investors to take part in more than one area of the
gilt market. So, it provides useful insurance or a hedge when yields,
particularly at the long end, are volatile.
If yields fall, then investors may exercise their option of converting to
the longer bond; thus, they benefit from the rising market. But if yields
rise, they will be protected by being exposed only to the fall in value of
the short-dated bond. 'You get the best of both worlds,' as one analyst puts
it.
The last convertible gilt, which expired in 1990, was only a partial
success: out of a total of Pounds 1bn, only Pounds 50m of the bonds were
reported to have been converted. But analysts are much more optimistic about
the prospects for the new convertible. They say that the auction was a
success despite the general sell-off that occurred in the gilt market on
Wednesday.
'You usually have to pay for the flexibility that this gilt offers but, on
our estimations, the convertible was good value,' says David Boal, of the
American investment bank JP Morgan.
'There was a lot of interest, mainly from long-term holders such as
international mutual funds, domestic insurance companies and some bank
portfolios. And we think people are going to hold on to them. The Bank has
been quite clever in bringing it to the market at this time. It's the sort
of thing people want in uncertain circumstances,' Boal adds.
Other analysts are less convinced of the attractions of a convertible gilt.
They say it is far too complicated for the personal investor to understand,
which makes it risky. Nevertheless, it could be the safest place for the
wise investor to put his money if he wishes to invest in a gilt market that
probably has still further to fall.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: A new world of margins - With
rolling share settlement near, Norma Cohen looks at possible credit changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the Wall Street crash of 1929, stockbrokers have been just a
little anxious about lending their clients money to buy shares. At that
time, clients were extended cash for large stock purchases after providing
collateral sometimes worth as little as 10 per cent of the value of the
investment.
Needless to say, when share prices began to plummet, brokers asked for
additional collateral which the clients could not provide. The rest is
history - and not for nothing has the US had stringent regulations ever
since on what is known as margin trading. The rules, enshrined in the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (section 7), spell out how much
collateral brokers need from their clients in order to buy shares for them
on credit.
Some 60 years on, margin trading is an indelible part of the private
investor's landscape, accepted as simply another ordinary feature in the
course of doing business. Now, with the advent of 10-day and five-day
rolling settlement, UK stockbrokers are for the first time having to
consider if they, too, will need special arrangements for extending credit
to clients.
The first phase starts on July 18. Ten business days later, payment will be
due for any shares bought on that date - a much speedier settlement rate
than the gap of two to three weeks with which investors have become
comfortable. If, after July 18, a client's cheque does not clear on time,
the broker will have two choices: extending his own credit to settle the
agreed share purchase or 'failing' to complete the trade.
Since that costs money and leaves investors without the shares they wanted,
a credit extension by the broker on the client's behalf makes sense. That is
the gist of margin trading.
Geoffrey Turner, chief executive of the Association of Private Client
Stockbrokers and Investment Managers, says the organisation has set up a
committee to study the implications of margin trading.
Securities regulators are, however, being more cautious. At present, the
Securities and Futures Authority - the self-regulatory body for stockbrokers
and futures dealers - requires clients to provide collateral equal to 100
per cent of any credit extended.
Recently, the SFA altered its rules slightly; now, stockbrokers must ensure
that any collateral held can be liquidated if necessary. They must also take
care they have greater certainty of their rights to title if a client does
not repay the loan.
John Dolan, a securities lawyer with Merrill Lynch International in London,
says: 'Margin trading is widely accepted in the US by sophisticated private
investors.' Merrill operates what it calls an Investor CreditLine Service
for investments outside the UK which complies with the regulations of the US
Securities and Exchange Act.
While different brokerage companies will offer different terms for various
aspects of the business, they are all the same in two respects: the
percentage of the purchase price which can be borrowed, and the value of the
collateral provided against the loan.
Merrill's product, like most others in the US, allows the investor to open
an account. While that is in surplus, the investor can earn a rate of
interest. While it is in deficit, the investor is charged interest. These
accounts allow investors to make larger purchases of shares in a bull market
than they might otherwise be able to.
Investors also can sell shares short - that is, to dispose of shares they do
not own - and buy them back later at a lower price in a falling market using
their margin account.
Although this strategy is fraught with dangers if the market goes the wrong
way, sophisticated private investors in the US may be able to utilise
techniques such as stop loss orders to limit the damage.
To understand how margin works, it is helpful to examine Merrill's product.
Let us say you buy Dollars 10,000 worth of shares and leave them on your
account. For shares worth Dollars 10 each or more, Merrill will allow you to
borrow a sum equal to half their market value if you use those shares as
collateral. Shares worth from Dollars 3 to Dollars 10 each allow you to
borrow up to 50 per cent of the market value of an additional purchase, but
those under Dollars 3 give no borrowing power.
Merrill's client agreement spells out the amounts of interest to be charged
on the credit extended. But if the value of the shares Merrill is holding as
collateral falls, the firm will make a 'maintenance call'.
For higher value shares, the market price must always be at least 30 per
cent of the value of credit extended, while lower value shares must not fall
below Dollars 3 each. Should these levels be breached, you will have to
provide additional collateral - either that or Merrill has the right to sell
the existing collateral in your account.
Clearly, the advent of margin trading in the UK could do more than simply
help investors pay for shares more promptly; it could help sophisticated
investors engage in far more speculative trading strategies than they are
accustomed to. The question is whether the advent of speedier share
settlement in the UK will open the door for a bigger host of opportunities
for investors than they had ever dreamed possible.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (3): It's that festival
feeling again - Festival highspots / Keen on music, literature or racing?
Gerald Cadogan has been finding accommodation for festival goers
</HEADLINE>

The festival season has started again in Britain. Glyndebourne's new opera
house in East Sussex reopens tonight, continuing until August 25, and the
Cardiff Bay jazz festival in Wales runs until Monday. Brighton (East Sussex)
and Perth (Tayside) finish tomorrow. Hay-on-Wye (Powys) and Malvern
(Worcestershire) continue to next weekend.
Festivals starting in June include: Aldeburgh in Suffolk (the Benjamin
Britten and Peter Pears festival, in its 47th year), Bournemouth (Dorset)
puppets at Bradford (West Yorkshire), pop music at Glastonbury (Somerset)
and opera at Garsington Manor outside Oxford. And so the multi-course
cultural feast goes on - from Edinburgh in Scotland to Fishguard, in west
Wales well into the autumn.
Tickets and accommodation are the problem at many festivals. Main events
sell out quickly and hotels and boarding houses are booked, often by the
same people, year after year. What is the way out?
For one thing, you could always consider buying a place near your favourite
festival. From a base in mid-Sussex, for example, it is easy to 'do'
Glyndebourne, Brighton and Chichester (where Derek Jacobi has just been
appointed artistic director, a post inaugurated by Laurence Olivier).
Well placed for all three venues is Nettledown Cottage at Fulking, down a
long farm road with views to the South Downs. Price: Pounds 395,000 from
Humberts in Lewes (0273-478 828) and Fox in Haywards Heath (0444-459-966).
Close to Glyndebourne and Brighton, Humberts offers an unusual and handsome
white clapboard house that looks more like Massachusetts than southern
England. Gallybird Hall, near Barcombe, has six bedrooms and costs Pounds
240,000.
An intriguing house near Chichester is Jolyons at Bury. Built in 1931 from
old timbers, this Sussex barn was a studio home for artist Rudolph Sauter, a
nephew of author John Galsworthy, and stands in the grounds of his uncle's
house. Jackson-Stops in Chichester (0243-786316) is selling it for Pounds
285,000.
Cheltenham, an elegant Regency town on the edge of the Cotswolds, has three
festivals. In July there is music while, in October, its festival of
literature provides a welcome break in the dog days of the cultural year.
But the most famous of the trio is the Cheltenham festival of horse-racing
each March when the Gold Cup is the climax of the National Hunt season, run
over fences.
Three Queens is a smart Elizabethan, Queen Anne and Victorian house - hence
its name - in Prestbury, on the edge of Cheltenham. Its price is Pounds
345,000 from Jackson-Stops in Cirencester (0285-653334) or Charles Lear in
Cheltenham (0242-222722).
Charlton Manor in Battledown is equally close. But this one is purely
Victorian - originally, it was called Simla Lodge. Price: Pounds 750,000
from Humberts in Cheltenham (0242-513439).
The middle of the Cotswolds also offers opera-in-the-garden at Garsington,
on the east edge of Oxford. It is best on a fine night, although the
audience is in a tented stand and a cover can be unrolled over the singers.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Oxford (0865-790077) is selling the Dower House at
nearby Heythrop; offers over Pounds 700,000 are sought for the six bedrooms
(to house the party) and 40 acres (for the horses). Another Pounds 80,000
buys a cottage.
Just as convenient is Horn Farm at Evenlode, a good Cotswold farmhouse with
stabling and 45 acres (from KFR at Pounds 425,000), or Copse Hill Court, a
converted stables and coach house in Upper Slaughter for Pounds 575,000.
Bergersh Place at Witnesham, north of Ipswich, could prove a splendid base
for large parties bound for the music at Aldeburgh, or inspecting the royal
Saxon burial ground at Sutton Hoo, followed by oysters and Muscadet at the
Butley-Orford oysterage. For Pounds 900,000, you get a Regency house with
187 acres, restored by the present owners. Bidwells (0223-841841) in
Cambridge is the agent.
Otten Hall at Belchamp Otten, west of Sudbury, is handsome Georgian and
earlier, and has a pond in front, although it is further from the Suffolk
coast. The price (from Bidwells) is Pounds 375,000.
Kelsale Manor near Saxmundham, a 16th/17th century house in the shape of a
square bracket, is also convenient for Aldeburgh. Along with 10.5 acres,
Savills in Ipswich (0473-226191) is asking Pounds 460,000.
Salisbury has a festival in September that deserves to be known better.
A good base in the town is 46 St Ann's Street, a Georgian house near the
cathedral and close (where many events happen). Savills in Salisbury
(0722-320422) offers it for Pounds 230,000.
To live outside and come in for the events, consider renting a flat in
Wardour Castle, near Tisbury, one of England's handsomest Palladian
mansions. Built by James Paine between 1770 and 1776. it was used until
recently by the defunct Cranborne Chase school for girls.
Smart apartments, restored with great care by Nigel Tuersley, are on offer
for Pounds 1,600-Pounds 1,800 a month through John D. Wood in Basingstoke
(0256-398 004).
For Edinburgh, a flat looks the best idea. Use it yourself at festival time
and let it during the academic year to the students who throng the city. The
place to look is the Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre (031-2263891).

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (4): A 'back to basics'
policy for your home - Period pieces / Need to restore an old house? In
search of old bricks, tiles, flagstones or hearths? James Fisher has the
answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES FISHER

<TEXT>
Architectural salvage is a lucrative business. The practice is not new.
Builders throughout time have reclaimed old materials to re-use them. This
makes sense because it saves money - or at least it used to. Now we are
alert to the value of preservation - so it makes better sense to save the
salvaged artefacts and sell them to home-owners who will pay a good price
for something authentic. It is a 'back to basics' policy of which almost
everyone would approve.
Prices do vary, but they are generally high - the idea being that if you
want the real thing, you must be prepared to pay for it. There are also
strict laws relating to architectural salvaging.
The listing of a building not only protects it from structural change or
demolition, but also prevents the removal of its fixtures and fittings
without consent. So the older the required object, the less likely it is
that it will appear on the market - and the higher the price if it does. But
it is always worth shopping around and for some rare fittings it is very
necessary.
When Drummond Shaw, a former City commodities broker, moved to a Georgian
house which needed restoration, he wanted to do the job properly. But he had
problems finding what he needed locally in the Guildford area of Surrey.
After he had restored his house, he recognised with entrepreneurial insight,
a business opportunity. Five years ago he set up Drummonds of Bramley on an
old farm to cater for the needs of others with property to restore. His
colleague, Major Tony Swayne, claims expansively that the company has just
about everything anyone could need for renovations and covers domestic
property from the Tudor period onwards.
Where necessary, Drummonds will undertake to find particular items that
people want. With an estimated 70 per cent of the stock being bought in,
Swayne admits the company has to be very careful what it buys. It also has
builders who are skilled in the use of traditional materials and who can be
employed by customers. In some cases, the way fixtures are installed can be
as important as their authenticity.
In addition, Drummonds offers an unusual specialist service. For about
Pounds 900, the company will despatch your chipped and stained bath to
Eastern Europe and return it sparkling with six fresh coats of vitreous
enamel and a 50-year guarantee. The price varies according to weight and
size. If, however, a new old bath appeals, Drummonds has some to offer,
including one from the Earl of Derby.
Another company in the salvage business is Dorset Reclamation, of Bere
Regis, which is run by Tessa Pearce. Her sources include hospitals, schools
and, occasionally, dangerous structures that are being demolished. One of
her recent acquisitions was a set of Georgian doors.
Pearce stocks all the usual general fixtures as well as the more localised
staddlestones. Dorset Reclamation has a good selection of original
flagstones, hand-made clay roofing tiles, oak beams, quarry tiles and
floorboards. The company can deliver, and will search for specific objects
that customers want.
Because of the protective legislation, certain older fixtures and fittings,
such as lead guttering, are no longer readily available. So if you want a
match, the only option is to have the fitting made - which can be expensive.
Original bricks can be bought for houses under 200 years old.
Lazdan builders' merchants, in east London, currently has a stock of bricks
reclaimed from demolished buildings. Very old bricks can be bought but they
are difficult to find in significant quantities. Again, the alternative is
to have a specialist firm make up a matching product. A company specialising
in copying bricks is W T Lamb of Haslemere, Surrey.
People in the business are naturally sensitive about the issue of
provenance. But it can be advantageous when authenticity is assured.
'Provenance is important and adds to value,' says Les Smith, sales manager
of the London Architectural Salvage and Supply Company. 'A bathroom from the
Savoy, for instance, is not just any old bathroom.' This provides an extra
incentive, if it were needed, to deal in goods with provenance.
LASSCo has been in business for 20 years. The company says it houses one of
the UK's largest stocks of architectural antiques and reclaimed fixtures and
fittings in its warehouse, in a church just north of the City of London.
Other companies claim to have the largest supply.
LASSCo clears buildings that are due to be demolished or refurbished. Its
current stock of radiators comes from County Hall, London, the former
headquarters of the Greater London Council, which is being converted into a
hotel. There are fire surrounds a-plenty, stair rods, doors, weather vanes
and, appropriately for the surroundings, church pews and the occasional
lectern. The company also sells original brass door handles and keyholes,
and it has an extensive range of Edwardian taps and shower units which can
be ordered from a catalogue.
LASSCo also has some very unusual items, including a panelled deco interior
taken from a club and priced at Pounds 26,500. The company has also recently
acquired the complete neo-classical entrance that once adorned the
headquarters of the National Farmers' Union. Smith is open to offers on
this, but expects it to go outside the UK.
Architectural Heritage, in Cheltenham, has a large stock of 19th century
oak, mahagony and pine panelling. The company has a range of original
fireplaces and also makes stone fireplaces to order because it is often
difficult to find one to fit the available space.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues
</HEADLINE>

Shares in London Clubs International, owner of the Ritz Club and five other
London casinos, look a safe bet at the flotation price of 200p, writes David
Blackwell. The group, which will have a market capitalisation of Pounds
141.4m, is raising about Pounds 27.5m net of expenses to pay off bank debt
incurred under the 1989 management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan.
Samuel Montagu, which has underwritten the issue fully, is placing 16.38m
ordinary shares with institutions, of which 4.09m will be subject to a
clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. Broker is James
Capel.
The group will be quoted on the USM because the management has only two
years' experience of the company and stock exchange rules require three
years. The change of management followed a police raid in 1991 under the
Gaming Act, just days before a previous planned flotation.
The issue was priced to go even in the week which saw the stock market well
down and the announcement of the National Lottery winner. The strong
portfolio of casinos, from the high-rolling Ritz to the Golden Nugget,
reduces the risk of relying for profits on a few high-spenders.
The prospectus puts pro forma pre-tax profits at Pounds 23.1m for 1993-94,
and earnings per share, before restructuring costs of Pounds 2m, at 22.5p,
giving a multiple of 8.9. A dividend of 11.92p would have been recommended,
giving a high yield of 7.45 per cent.
Argent Group is the latest of a wave of property companies to seek a
listing. Private investors can subscribe through an intermediaries offer at
255p a share, writes Vanessa Houlder.
Argent, formed 12 years ago by joint chief executives Michael and Peter
Freeman, owns 16 investment properties valued at Pounds 197.1m. It also owns
a development site in central Birmingham, with planning consent for 1.1m sq
ft of offices, valued at Pounds 26.6m.
Argent is braving the market at a time when investors are unreceptive to new
issues and, in particular, new issues of property companies - as
demonstrated by the pulled flotation of London Capital Holdings this week.
Argent has priced its shares aggressively, at a discount of just 5 per cent
to its net asset value. If turbulent stock market conditions persist,
private investors might do better to pick up stock in the after-market
rather than take up the offer.
The company is tipped to perform well in the longer term, however; it has
good-quality investment properties and an interesting development programme.
The offer is sponsored by Schroders. Applications under the intermediaries
offer must be made on an application form provided by Cazenove, the broker,
and must be sent to Cazenove by midday on June 3.

De La Rue, the bank note printer which ended bid talks with Portals
yesterday, is expected to report strong profits growth when it announces its
full-year figures on Tuesday. Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 121m are
expected, up from Pounds 104.7m the previous year. The share price of Beazer
Homes, which closed last night at 156p, has consistently under-performed the
issue price of 165p since the company was floated in March. The next test
for the shares will be on Tuesday when the company is due to announce
figures for the six months to the end of March.
Forecasts have been made more difficult by the company's decision to change
its year-end, but the market appears to be expecting pre-tax profits of
Pounds 15m for the first six months, rising to Pounds 30m after nine.
Northern Ireland Electricity, the last of the UK power companies to be
privatised, is expected to announce 1994 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 81m
on Wednesday, a sharp improvement on the Pounds 58m of 1992-93. The dividend
payment is likely to be about 11.3p, against 10.02p last time. The City is
expecting considerable growth and expansion when Granada, the leisure,
television and computer services group, reports its results for the 26 weeks
to April 2 on Wednesday. Last time, before the takeover of London Weekend
Television, Granada had pre-tax profits of Pounds 68m.
This time, analysts are expecting between Pounds 90m and Pounds 100m - which
would be a considerable achievement given that little more than a month's
profits will be included for LWT. Yorkshire Water, the third of the big 10
water companies to report finals this year, is expected to show an advance
from Pounds 137m to about Pounds 144m on Thursday. But profits are likely to
be depressed by a restructuring charge of Pounds 10m, arising largely from
cost-cutting measures in the core utility business. Analysts are expecting
the dividend to be pitched at between 22 and 23p. Boots, the retailing and
pharmaceuticals group, is expected to complete the latest round of
retailers' results on Thursday with an increase in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 406.7m to about Pounds 460m before Pounds 35m exceptional charges for
the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug.
MEPC, the UK's second-largest property company, is likely to announce a
small decline in its profits when it announces results on Thursday. Analysts
expect pre-tax figures of about Pounds 50m for the six months to end-March,
compared with Pounds 52.5m, for the same period last year.
The company's profits will be affected by the loss of rent from disposals
made in 1992 and 1993, and a decline in the amount of interest capitalised,
although it might benefit from the ending of some of the rent-free periods
given to tenants in recent years.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Flat market hits balance -
Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the market ending up flat during the week reviewed here, it seems only
just that there should be a roughly equal balance between the number of buys
and sells over the period.
Wholesale Fittings, the family-orientated distributor of electrical goods
and components, has had a strong recovery since its trough in September
1992. At that time, joint managing director Richard Rose bought two tranches
of stock, each of 50,000 shares, at prices ranging between 153p and 168p.
The latest sale by Lennard Rose, the other joint managing director, was of
585,000 shares at 305p. Richard Rose also took profits recently by selling
60,000 shares at 331p. Final results are due in August and brokers forecast
earnings of 11.8p, which gives rise to an above-average prospective p/e.
Sir Michael Bishop is known better as chairman of British Midland, the
airline company, but he is also a non-executive director of Williams
Holdings, an industrial conglomerate. He has bought 10,000 Williams' shares
at 369p, his first purchase of these. The last significant purchase by any
of his fellow directors was in February 1992 when chairman Nigel Rudd bought
50,000 at 311p. William Richards is a non-executive director of Industrial
Controls Services, quoted under the electronic and electrical equipment
sector. He has sold 325,000 shares at 150p, leaving him with a holding of
2.1m. Announcing interim results at the end of February, the chairman
indicated that the order book looked encouraging. The consensus earnings
forecast is for 9.4p in the year to end-May 1994, rising to 12.1p for the
following year.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Sick - but not terminal - A look at
the rocky state of the new issues market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Predictions of the imminent demise of the new issue market may have been
exaggerated, but it has certainly been looking pretty sick lately. Several
flotations were pulled at the last moment and the fall in the stock market
dragged more new issues below their offer prices. Yet, there is still a
queue of hopefuls waiting to offer shares to investors who, clearly, have
had their fill.
In order to get the issues away, many vendors are seeing the price of their
shares cut back savagely. Even then, few go to a decent premium on first
dealings.
In these circumstances, it might seem wise for private investors to avoid
new issues altogether, or at least wait to see what happens when the shares
start trading.
For the brave, it is the flops that sometimes offer the best value. 'When an
issue flops, investors try to dump stock - which drives the price down
further,' says one private client broker. 'The shares then tend to sit
around, friend-less, like damaged goods on the shelf.'
Sometimes, there is a good reason why investors spurned the shares
initially. But shares in sound companies can be depressed artificially for
some time after a disappointing flotation.
The table lists all those new issues, excluding investment trusts, launched
in 1992 and 1993 that fell to a discount within a week of the start of
dealings. It then shows the gain or loss, relative to the All Share index,
had you bought them at that price and held them until now.
They range from the pretty disastrous (Canadian Pizza) to the highly
successful (the Telegraph and RJB Mining). On average, the 14 stocks have
slightly outperformed the market.
This result needs to be treated with some caution. For a start, most of the
14 are small companies which, as a class, outpaced the index comfortably
over the period.
Yet, it does serve to illustrate that quality companies - such as the
Telegraph - which chose a poor time to float, or in some way fail to catch
the mood of the moment, can be picked up cheaply if they get off to a bad
start.
The Telegraph came to the market in the summer of 1992 when a sudden flurry
of medium-sized flotations led to disappointing debuts by some very solid
companies, including MFI, Kenwood, and Anglian Group. In that sense, it had
some similarities with the present.
It should be noted, however, that while the Telegraph has gone to a handsome
premium and MFI has outperformed the market modestly, Kenwood and Anglian
both have lagged.
Of course, sometimes the market gets it exactly right. When Canadian Pizza
floated in November, investors were wary of the price demanded for a
one-product company with a few large supermarket customers such as J.
Sainsbury. When, last month, Sainsbury's decided to stop buying the
company's pizza crust for its delicatessens, the shares tumbled.
Issuing a profits warning shortly after flotation is just not done and
offenders get treated very harshly by the market. Shares in both United
Carriers and Cementone took bad knocks last week when they admitted trading
was below expectations.
If the trading problem proves only temporary, as it did in the case of
Holliday Chemical last year, those brave souls who buy on the warning can
pick up real bargains. But, all too often, an early profits warning is the
start of a slippery slope.
As always, the key to successful equity investment is being selective. When
it comes to picking the top of the flops, more than usual caution is
required.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (2): Paying for prestige and
a room with a view - New York / For many New Yorkers west is now best. Frank
McGurty explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a city of densely packed spires, the desirability of a residence is
defined as much by its view as by its street address. In New York,
apartments with sweeping vistas of Central Park or the East River still
command the highest premiums.
The new owner of a 10-room penthouse at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street, one of
the most prestigious corners on Manhattan's posh upper east side, can gaze
out at both these celebrated sights, and he paid dearly for the privilege.
The 4,700 sq ft residence, occupying the entire 20th floor of a newly
renovated building, recently sold for Dollars 5.05m (Pounds 3.45m). It was
one of the highest prices paid for a New York apartment since the end of the
property boom five years ago.
The penthouse is elegantly appointed, to be sure, with its four spacious
bedrooms, mahogany-panelled library and marble bathrooms equipped with
oversized whirlpools. But so are thousands of less expensive accommodations
in New York.
What sets the place apart, then? 'Quite simply, the views are spectacular,'
says Jack Heller, a principal in Heller Macaulay Equities, which developed
the property.
The sale price underscores how far the market has progressed since a
tentative recovery began two years ago. Prices for the most luxurious flats
and townhouses are steadily climbing and activity is picking up pace.
One leading Manhattan estate agency, Ambrose MarElia, recorded 26 town house
sales in the last three months of 1993, at an average price of Dollars 1.68m
(Pounds 1.15m) against 17 sales in the final 1992 quarter, at about Dollars
1.3m each. 'With fewer choice properties being offered for sale right now,'
says Joan Ambrose, who runs the company, '1994 is going to usher in a
seller's market.'
On the lower end, buyers are still dictating the market and prices continue
to slip. But across the spectrum, the rise in US interest rates has pushed
many prospective buyers off the fence out of fear that financing will become
even more expensive as the year progresses.
'People are always afraid of being left behind. It's a wonderful motivator,'
says Barbara Corcoran, head of the Corcoran Group, another leading New York
realtor. Sales at Corcoran are up 40 per cent this quarter.
Overall, the average price of a smart Manhattan apartment held fairly steady
at Dollars 84,920 a room in the six months to the end of 1993, in sharp
contrast with the trend during the 1989-91 recession, when prices plunged by
30 per cent. The bulk of Corcoran's sales, which tend to be at the top end,
were in the Dollars 400,000 to Dollars 1.2m range.
A one-bedroom flat on Horatio Street in Greenwich Village is fairly typical.
The 'sparkling and spacious' 900 sq ft apartment, half way between midtown
and Wall Street, was recently advertised in The New York Times at Dollars
185,000. A 1,800 sq ft, three-bedroom residence, near the Museum of Natural
History on the upper west side, was listed at Dollars 399,000.
Buyers last year were able to haggle down the price by about 18 per cent on
average; fewer than 5 per cent pay the full fare.
On the rental side, meanwhile, the upturn in sales and a dearth of new
construction has created a supply crunch. With more people looking to buy,
those who want to move house are no longer faced with the choice of renting
out their properties or leaving them vacant. As a consequence, leasing is
more expensive, whether for a modest studio near Times Square or a posh
four-bedroom on Park Avenue.
Still, where you are located in New York is nearly as important as what you
can see out of your window. 'The closer you move towards Central Park - from
both sides, east and west - the higher the price,' says Nancy Packes, head
of Feathered Nest, one of the largest rental agencies in Manhattan.
How much can a newcomer expect to shell out? On average, a one-bedroom flat
rents for Dollars 1,550 a month, a two-bedroom Dollars 2,350 and a
three-bedroom about Dollars 3,800. For posh apartments in prime locations, a
one bedroom will command Dollars 2,500-Dollars 3,500, a two bedroom Dollars
4,000-Dollars 6,000 and a three bedroom up to Dollars 10,000 a month,
whether on the east side or west.
For many New Yorkers, however, west is now best. The area bounded by the
park and the Hudson River, between 60th and 110th streets, has become the
neighbourhood of the 1990s, especially among those with children. 'It is
basically a revolt against the values of the 1980s,' explains Packes. 'The
west side represents old-time values - it's things remembered.'
When today's down-home west-siders were the young financial hotshots of the
1980s, they may have preferred the east side's thrusting glass towers and
the noisy night spots crowded along First and Second avenues. Now they most
often opt for the stately pre-war apartment blocks off Broadway and Columbus
Avenue, and easy access to grocery stores and other 'neighbourhood' shops
clustered in the area. 'The east side is Gucci; the west side is Baby Gap,'
explains one lifelong New Yorker.
The fresh demand is reflected in the price, of course. A new lease on a
one-bedroom flat on, say, West End Avenue cost 10.6 per cent more in 1993
than the year before, according to Feathered Nest, which conducts on annual
survey of the market. On the east side, a similar flat off First Avenue
commanded just 5.9 per cent more in 1992.
Another favourite with families is TriBeCa, a surprise perhaps for those who
remember the 'Triangle Below Canal' Street as a factory and warehouse
district that was deserted after dark.
Like SoHo, the section 'South of Houston' and above Canal, many of TriBeCa's
old industrial buildings have been converted into residential 'lofts', which
often feature acres of space and loads of lights. 'Whether people admit it
or not,' says Corcoran, 'light is their number one concern when looking for
a place to live.'
Unlike SoHo, TriBeCa is not choked with galleries, wine bars and upmarket
boutiques. Instead, it boasts one of the best government-supported schools
in the city. Battery Park, a few blocks away on the island's southern tip,
has one of the popular playgrounds in New York.
'TriBeCa is a small town, Manhattan style,' the broker says. For many New
Yorkers, that kind of ambience is worth much more than a spectacular view of
Central Park.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Building the right portfolio - The
ingredients for investment success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine an investment portfolio made up of shares in emerging stock markets,
European privatisation stocks, small companies, and securities producing an
ultra-high income. That is roughly the portfolio you would have if you had
put money into a cross-section of the latest unit and investment trust
launches.
It is an exceedingly high risk mixture. It is also very unlike the portfolio
you would have if your money was managed by the private client department of
most leading fund management firms, which usually work on a fairly
conventional asset allocation model. In other words, they first divide your
money between cash, bonds and equities; then they divide the equity money
between the major stock markets or economic blocs.
Many firms have more than one type of model, since clients differ. An
income-orientated investor would, for example, probably have more bonds and
a small or non-existent stake in emerging markets. But all the firms
emphasise that any prototype will be modified to suit the specific needs,
attitudes and existing portfolios of individual customers.
There are minor variations both in what the firms think clients want and how
they aim to achieve it. GAM (Global Asset Management) argues that the first
priority for most of its clients is to avoid losing money; they would also
like long-term capital growth roughly in line with that of equities, but
that objective comes second.
Kleinwort's prime objective is to maintain the real (inflation-adjusted)
value of the clients' assets. Its 'benchmarks' (see table) show how
portfolios for various types of investor would be split if stock markets
were expected to be relatively stable both in themselves and in relation to
each other. In practice, tactical considerations mean that the actual
portfolios often are very different from the benchmarks.
Take, for example, its most aggressive portfolio: the benchmark version is
20 per cent bonds and 80 per cent equities. And the equities are half in the
UK, with the remainder equally split between Europe, the US, Japan and
south-east Asia. Today, that portfolio has no bonds and is nearly 98 per
cent invested in equities, with the UK and emerging markets getting most of
the extra.
Markets as turbulent as the current ones can cause some fairly radical
rethinks. Early in March, for example, the more dynamic BZW portfolio model
had 12 per cent in each of the US, Europe and Japan. This week the actual
allocation had 6 per cent in the US, nothing in the other two, and over a
third in bonds and cash.
Generally, there is a fair consensus on where to put investors' money. Our
asset allocation table shows the latest snapshot from a range of different
fund managers*.
We stipulated that we were interested in portfolio splits suitable for a
client resident in the UK with at least Pounds 250,000 to invest. Where
managers have several basic models, we have picked the most comparable.
These are middle of the road portfolios, aiming for moderate growth and
suitable for someone willing to take some risk: too cautious for a
35-year-old with no worries but too risky for many older investors
approaching retirement.
How helpful, though, are these models to the investor who manages his own
money? They can be useful if handled with care, but there are several points
to bear in mind when using them as a yardstick:
They are blueprints only. The fund managers all emphasise that they have
several clients whose portfolios are very different from the models because
their needs, objectives and characters do not fit the stereotype. And
factors such as potential gains tax liabilities can complicate the
situation.
Many investors find themselves effectively locked into most of their
existing holdings because a major overhaul would land them with an enormous
gains tax bill. In such cases, any model portfolio is simply a target to
work towards at your own pace.
These portfolios assume that you have at least Pounds 250,000 with no
obvious claims on it. If you have known future commitments, such as school
fees or a mortgage to pay off, you need to allocate specific resources to
meet those liabilities.
They assume that you can afford to take at least a three to five year view;
they are not suitable if you might need your money back before that. This
caveat applies even to the cash in some portfolios. Make sure you have
enough of that cash elsewhere for your everyday needs.
They are, deliberately, broad brush. Several of our fund manager sample, for
example, are particularly enthusiastic about shares in smaller companies,
but we have not subdivided the totals.
Choosing the right shares can matter as much to the success of your
portfolio as choosing the right areas in which to invest. Indeed, some of
the most successful investors are pure stock-pickers.
If you still want to run a portfolio spread as widely as our models, how do
you do it? As we have pointed out, active dealing normally should be
avoided.
The costs of buying and selling a share (see page VIII) are likely to amount
to nearly 5 per cent for a UK blue chip and more for a small company, most
foreign shares and for many unit trusts. Indeed, Warren Buffett, the
American investment guru, urges you to think of dealing costs as an extra
tax on your profits.
The obvious implication is that it is self-defeating to fine-tune your
portfolio too often. Start with a broad idea of the overall shape, knowing
that you cannot afford to change it in response to every minor market
movement.
Should you invest directly in individual shares, or through unit and
investment trusts? This is an open question as far as the UK portion of your
portfolio is concerned. If you have the time, knowledge and inclination,
direct investment is probably more fun. An alternative is to put most of
your money into a cost-effective index-tracking fund (page III, Weekend FT ,
April 30) and run a much smaller portfolio of shares for your own amusement.
When it comes to investing overseas, most people will sensibly opt for
funds.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Chunnel visions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The light at the end of Eurotunnel means that those who bought shares in
November 1987 for the travel perks they offered will soon be able to make
their free trips. But was it worthwhile?
The timing of the original offer was not good, coming right after the stock
market crash. To lure private investors, shares were offered at 350p with
these concessions:
100 shares: one free trip through the Chunnel within a year of its opening.
500 shares: one return trip a year for 10 years.
1,000 shares: two return journeys every year until the end of Eurotunnel's
concession (originally 2042 but extended last December to 2052).
1,500 shares: as many trips as you like until 2052.
To benefit, shareholders must pay an annual registration fee of Pounds 15
and a Pounds 1 nominal charge for each journey.
The chart, re-based to 350, shows how the Eurotunnel shares have performed
in relation to the FT-SE-A All Share index (gross dividends re-invested) and
a 90-day Halifax building society account (gross income re-invested).
In fact, investors who have held on to their shares have done better than
the options. Return fares on Le Shuttle range from Pounds 220 to Pounds 310,
depending on the time of year the trip is made. If you had paid Pounds 350
to qualify for one return journey in the first year, and wanted to travel in
the most expensive period, you would have benefited to the tune of Pounds
327, allowing you to make another free trip.
The calculation assumes that Eurotunnel's price holds at Thursday's close of
348p. So, you would have paid Pounds 350 and got back Pounds 348.
There was a rights issue in 1990. If you had not taken it up, the value of
the nil-paid shares would amount to Pounds 35 for someone holding 100. Thus,
you made a 'profit' of Pounds 33 and got a trip worth Pounds 310. Since you
have to pay a further Pounds 16 for the journey, your total gain is Pounds
327.
You would have done less well by investing in a share matching the
performance of the All Share. Although the market has done well, turning
Pounds 350 into Pounds 875, paying for the Pounds 310 trip leaves a Pounds
215 gain.
The building society investor would have made Pounds 221 by depositing
Pounds 350 and getting back Pounds 571. But forking out for the Pounds 310
fare means he is out of pocket by Pounds 89.
Given the volatility of the Eurotunnel share price, shareholders cannot do
their sums until after their journey. The wiliest would have sold their
shares when the price reached a high of Pounds 11.64 in 1989. With Pounds
810 profit in hand, they could have bought a round-the-world airline ticket.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: FT guide to investment trusts - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A shake-out looks a real possibility for the investment trust sector, the
index for which rose by 46 per cent last year, compared with 23 per cent for
the FT-SE-A All-Share index. But although many trust shares are highly
priced, both in their own right and in relation to alternatives such as
comparable unit trusts, their long-term merits as an investment vehicle
remain. The FT Guide to Investment Trusts, to be published with next
Saturday's paper, will give them a thorough health check.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance Society approved a rule
change at the friendly society's annual general meeting on Wednesday,
sanctioning a 12 per cent levy imposed on their policies to create a
compensation fund. The decision followed a high court ruling last year that
39,000 policyholders who lost money because of unauthorised investment in
property by the society must be compensated. Compensation is due to be paid
in September or October, after which members will be consulted on the
society's future.

Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the investment bank, this week reported record pre-tax profits
for the year to March 31, reflecting sustained growth in commission and fee
income from advisory and underwriting activities.
At Pounds 297m, profits were double the comparable Pounds 148.2m for the
previous year, on total operating income of Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 715.8m).
'The business, in common with the industry, has had a good year,' said Lord
Cairns, chief executive. However, he added: 'It could prove to be a peak
year in the economic cycle.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: BA warning in spite of 63% rise in
pre-tax profits - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways this week reported a 63 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
more than Pounds 300m for the year to March, but warned that it might have
to make provisions on a Pounds 275.3m investment in USAir, its troubled US
partner.
Annual pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 301m, compared with Pounds 185m in
1992-93. BA's progress reflected its cost-cutting drive, increased revenues
and a 6 per cent recovery in first and business class traffic. The future of
BA's 24.6 per cent stake in USAir remains the biggest cloud over its
short-term prospects.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: Camelot offers refuge from bears - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot here we come] At 14m to one, the odds on winning the jackpot in the
new national lottery seem a lot shorter than making money in the currently
miserable stock market.
Only two things are required of us by the Camelot consortium awarded the
lottery license this week: pay it Pounds 1 and arrange six numbers in the
same order it picks.
Six numbers only the glummest bears were betting to see this year were
2,800.00 on the FT-SE 100 index. But by the close of play yesterday, after
the index had fallen below 3,000 for the first time in eight months, the
odds on the index hitting that number had shortened considerably.
The 160.9 point, 5 per cent, drop in the Footsie this week was caused by the
same factors which have remorselessly driven equities back from their
January peak: good news on economic growth and slightly poor news on
inflation combined to wreak havoc in bond markets at home and abroad.
The rot started in Helsinki on Monday when Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank
president, indicated that German interest rates might not fall further in
the short-term. By the time the Germans had aborted a government bond
auction and released another remarkably strong figure for money supply
growth on Wednesday, European bond markets were convinced interest rates had
nowhere to go but up. Equities, still fatally attracted to the fall and rise
of interest rates, had nowhere to go but down.
Is it right equities should drop back to where they were eight months ago?
After all, the UK's economic recovery is firmly established with, for
example, factory orders in May at their highest level in five years. The
corporate results season has been even better than forecast with dividends
rising 7 per cent on average.
For most analysts the answer is a resounding 'no'. The sell off 'is quite
ridiculous,' says Paul Walton, equity strategist at James Capel. He lays
full blame at the feet of futures traders.
Yesterday, for example, he says they took very bearish positions in bond
futures after the latest US data was released. But their positions
exaggerated the threat the data posed to US interest rates, let alone
European ones. Wall Street took the news better than London. The traders
aggressively sold stock futures to profitably exploit equities' slavish
attachment to bonds. This forced market makers to slash stock prices rather
than risk exposure over a long weekend. However, the light share trading at
these lowered prices, indicated that investors are disinclined to stampede
for the exits.
'The markets should not be down at these levels but the negative sentiment
is still there,' says Ian Harnett, strategist at Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull.
He concedes that 'there are some fundamentals to hang the weakness on' such
as the high real yield on index linked gilts. But down at, say, 2,800 on the
Footsie, equities offer indisputable value: a dividend yield of 4.5 per cent
and a prospective price/earnings ratio of about 12.5. 'We've not seen values
like this since the depths of the recession.'
He says two conditions are needed to reverse the equity market's slide: a
correction in over-sold bond markets; and a change in investors' focus from
interest rates to earnings. 'Even if interest rates are heading upwards,
this is for a healthy reason: the economy is growing and so are corporate
profits and dividends.'
Analysts at SG Warburg Securities concur. Rising interest rates have 'not
necessarily been a bear signal for equities,' they note. For example, two
recent periods of strong growth and climbing rates, 1984-85 and 1988-89, saw
equities rise 17 per cent. 'The recovery which prompted the upward pressure
on rates also prompted growth in earnings.'
Warburgs is less sanguine than Strauss Turnbull about equities' ability to
assert their attractiveness. 'The valuation arithmetic is sufficiently
stretched to suggest little hope of equities de-coupling from bond market
trends this summer.'
The greatest havoc falling share prices created this week was in the new
issues market. A number of high profile companies pulled their flotations
rather than cut offering prices to encourage investors. Tele West and
General Cable in cable television, London Capital Holdings in property and
Murray Johnstone's smaller companies fund in investment trusts were prime
examples.
One float which was priced was London Clubs International, the casino
operator. The news was less cheerful at Ladbroke. Its warning of a downturn
in its credit betting business knocked its shares.
The biggest poker game in town, the Eurotunnel rights issue, has so far paid
handsomely for the houses organising it. A group of advisers led by SG
Warburg Securities, Morgan Grenfell and Banque Suez will earn Pounds 42m for
pulling off the Pounds 858.3m rights issue.
Eurotunnel says the Pounds 1.5bn it has raised in the past week has ensured
its viability. There is little room for manoeuvre, though, within the tight
traffic forecasts. Shareholders who take up the rights will have to wait
into the next millennium for dividends.
A string of results from large companies underscored the strength of the
corporate recovery: British Airways' pre-tax profits for the year to March
were up 63 per cent to Pounds 300m and Marks and Spencer's profits rose 16
per cent to Pounds 851.5m.
But investors wanting a surer punt on future earnings need look no further
than the Camelot consortium. Smith New Court forecasts that membership of
the grouping will enhance the earnings of Cadbury-Schweppes by 3 per cent,
of De La Rue by 9 per cent and Racal by 22 per cent. And all that on only a
0.6 per cent profit margin, such is the sheer volume of money the British
public is expected to gamble on six numbers.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: A slowly-emerging blue chip share - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging companies are the home grown answer to emerging markets: the
investor's way of taking a stake in tomorrow's world. Not all new British
businesses will succeed. But some will. And one of the better times to buy
them is when the economy is moving out of recession - as it is now.
But buying into emerging companies is tricky - as many Business Expansion
Scheme investors found to their cost. So the safest way to do it is by
taking a stake in a group with proven experience in the field. And when
venture capital is concerned, blue chips do not come much bluer than the
giant 3i. It will never be a hot shot growth stock. It is a long term value
investment.
That is the basic argument in favour of investing in the shares, which are
coming to the stockmarket next month.* Of course there are other points to
consider, like the price. You can expect weeks of debate over whether the
investor is likely to get a cheap deal.
The equity market is soggy and scared at the moment, and some other lesser
new issues have been pulled. And since existing 3i shareholders are keeping
the majority of their holdings, they have a strong incentive to make the
issue a success. So the launch price could well be at an appetising discount
to asset value.
But of course the board and its advisers will be doing their best to create
an atmosphere of scarcity. After all, only 40 per cent is on offer, and
institutional investors need to get their weightings up. And so on, and so
forth.
This is all good clean fun, but it misses the main point.
If 3i is a long term investment, skirmishing over the initial price is
essentially a side show. Stags may make a bob or two out of the launch - if
the pricing and the market move in their favour. Or the issue may struggle
to get away. But anyone who approaches the issue in search of a small
stagging profit is being street smart to the point of myopia.
It would be churlish to carp at the shortcomings of the new monthly unit
trust guide. Unit Trust Analysis** boldly goes where no serious consumer
publication has gone before: it provides statistical information on over 300
of the most consistent unit trusts, plus a brief description of their
investment objectives, strategy, and portfolio split.
Given the dearth of accessible factual information on trusts, the guide is
as welcome as a McDonald's in the desert. And it retails at under Pounds 150
a year.
Each trust gets a page reminiscent of a simplified company Extel card. The
individual reports, neatly collected in a looseleaf binder, will be updated
twice a year. The six sectors covered, UK equity income, high income,
international equities, UK equity growth, far east, Europe and north America
are among those likely to be popular with private investors - though a
section on general trusts might have been handy.
The guide is produced by Fund Research, whose existing service caters for
financial advisers. The professional service grades funds, more than half
the 'marks' coming from the qualitative assessment of the fund and its
managers.
This qualitative assessment is the result of frequent and exhaustive
interviews with the fund managers. Fund Research always insists that its
ratings are not investment recommendations. But a Triple A rating for a fund
from Fund Research keeps financial advisers happy.
Lack of such qualitative assessment is the obvious flaw of the private
investor guide. For, rather than piggybacking on the existing research, the
retail guide is standing on its own feet. What a shame.
Derivatives pop up in the most unexpected places. How many of the homeowners
happily enjoying their fixed rate mortgage realise that it is probably based
on derivatives?
An increasing part of building society lending is at fixed rates, but the
vast majority of their borrowing - from individual savers - is at variable
rates. This mismatch leaves the society vulnerable to market movements. If
interest rates fall,they benefit, if interest rates rise, they suffer. This
lack of control over their own fortunes makes building society managers
sleep badly.
So the societies get rid of the risk by taking out a 'swap', which allows
them to exchange their stream of fixed rate income for a stream of variable
rate income. And suddenly they are back in a world where both sides of their
balance sheet have variable rates again. If interest rates go down, they no
longer benefit, but they are not at risk when they rise. The tricky bit is
deciding whether to lend first and swap later, or vice versa.
Dutch fund management giant Robeco this week claimed that its experimental
portfolios based on 'behavioural finance' outperformed markets by 17 per
cent in 1992 and 1993. Behavioural finance is the new name for a rather old
theory: that markets tend to excess, both at the top and at the bottom.
Investors frequently fail to act in a logical way. The canny investor is the
one who bases his strategy on how people do act; not on how they would act
if they were rational.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: The third demon has reared its head - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here we go again. Just when investors thought the demons which had plagued
US financial markets throughout the spring had been exorcised, an unexpected
upward revision in first quarter economic growth sparks a sell-off in bonds
and revives fears that the Federal Reserve might have to reassess its
decision to place monetary policy on hold.
The double demons of rising inflation and rising interest rates are back, or
so it seemed to investors early yesterday, when they lowered the benchmark
30-year bond three quarters of a point, pushing the yield above 7.4 per
cent, and took 10 points off the Dow Jones industrial average in the opening
minutes of trading.
Investors were selling stocks and bonds on the heels of an upward revision
in the first quarter gross domestic product data, which the Commerce
department changed from originally estimated growth of 2.6 per cent to
growth of 3.0 per cent.
Just as worrying, the fixed weight deflator, a closely-watched inflation
measure, was also revised upwards, from 2.9 per cent to 3.1 per cent.
Stronger economic growth and higher inflation was just what Wall Street did
not want to hear about, especially coming so soon after the markets had
staged an impressive rally in the wake of the Fed's fourth interest rate
increase in as many months.
The only reason why that rate increase had been so well received was because
traders and investors judged that it would be the last in a round of
monetary tightenings that began on February 4. The economic revisions,
however, suggested that this judgment may have been premature.
Yet, yesterday's declines might have been a lot worse. It was the markets'
good fortune that within hours of the first quarter GDP revision being
announced, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, was up before Congress at a
pre-arranged hearing explaining the thinking behind the central bank's
recent policy manoeuvres. Rarely can Wall Street have enjoyed such an
immediate opportunity to listen to what the Fed chairman thought of some
troubling economic figures.
Unfortunately, Greenspan was less than forthcoming and did nothing to
assuage investors' fears. If anything, he only made their mood worse by
reintroducing the third demon that has been plaguing the markets this year:
uncertainty about the direction of Fed policy.
The next meeting of the Fed's open market committee is not until July 5, so
the markets have a stretch of more than five weeks ahead of them in which to
sweat about the possibility of another rate increase. (The Fed, of course,
could tighten policy again before the FOMC meets, but analysts believe the
central bank is most likely to wait until July 5 before making another
policy move.)
Renewed uncertainty can only mean more volatility for securities prices in
the month ahead, with investors likely to react sharply to every piece of
economic news they believe might have a bearing on monetary policy.
A week ago it looked as if the markets had turned a corner; bond yields had
dropped decisively below 7.6 per cent and the Dow was climbing steadily from
3,650. Now, no one is quite so sure, and with many buyers likely to stay on
the sidelines, at least until the May FOMC meeting, both bond and stock
markets could be in for further declines.
A renewal of uncertainty was also troubling investors in Philip Morris this
week. Trading in the stock was suspended for Wednesday while the Phillip
Morris board discussed the pros and cons of separating the company's food
and tobacco interests.
In recent months speculation that the company would split in half has been
providing Philip Morris' shares with much-needed support at a time when
cigarette manufacturers were under fierce fire from anti-smoking forces in
Congress and across the US.
The speculation, however, proved off-the-mark, because after the board
meeting, Philip Morris announced that a decision on whether to split the
company's two main businesses would not be taken 'for the foreseeable
future.'
Disappointment at the move sent Philip Morris shares tumbling when trading
in the stock reopened on Thursday. Investors were unhappy because the
company started the speculation earlier this year when it revealed a
break-up was being considered.
Many analysts, however, believe the board's decision was primarily intended
to buy some time, and that a division of the businesses is still the only
way Philip Morris can protect its food operations from the problems
afflicting the company's tobacco interests.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets: Another price cut at M &amp; S - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Knocking 12 1/2 p off Marks and Spencer's share price on the day it
announced a 16 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 851m, extending its lead
as the UK's most profitable retailer, must rank as one of the stock market's
more churlish reactions.
Sir Richard Greenbury, Marks' pugnacious chairman, found it difficult to
conceal his irritation - perhaps understandably. By any standards, the
company's performance in the year to March was impressive. Group turnover
increased 10 per cent to Pounds 6.54bn, with operating profits up 18 per
cent to Pounds 873.4m. In the UK, sales grew 9.5 per cent to Pounds 5.48bn,
and operating profits 18 per cent to Pounds 810m.
Leaving aside the perennial trouble spot of Canada, the overseas businesses
all increased sales and profits, except continental Europe where profits
fell slightly.
In the UK, M &amp; S has achieved such results by offering outstanding value for
money. Cost savings through improvements in efficiency and information
technology were passed on to customers in lower prices, but without damaging
the operating margin - which at 14 per cent is a figure other clothing and
food retailers only dream about.
The increased volumes that resulted meant Marks and Spencer could put more
business through its suppliers' factories, and so get even better deals out
of them.
Sir Richard says M &amp; S has also improved the 'desirability and
fashionability' of its products - something attested to in recent features
in the fashion and national press.
There is, moreover, ample scope for growth. M &amp; S announced on Tuesday it
would spend Pounds 1bn on expansion over three years.
While it is already represented in most UK locations where it wants to be, M
&amp; S says many existing town-centre stores are too small to carry the full
range, and it will extend them where possible.
In financial services, where profits rose 40 per cent, M &amp; S has announced a
move into the pensions market.
Even more exciting in the long-term are opportunities overseas. In
continental Europe, where turnover reached Pounds 243m last year, the focus
will be France and Spain. The recession there has not helped the bottom
line, but makes it a good time to be investing in property.
Sir Richard says he expected developing the continental European business to
be his main task as chairman. But the outstanding success of Marks' ventures
in east Asia, especially Hong Kong, has forced him to take a closer interest
in that region.
The company is being wooed by the Chinese government and by Japanese
manufacturers. Both offer huge possibilities: China a market of 1bn people;
Japan a clothing market four times the value of the UK's. The Japanese, says
Sir Richard, are quality-conscious but are looking for retailers who can
supply at a lower price than the designer labels that dominate the market.
The company's experience in the US and Canada shows that not everything it
touches turns to gold, at least not immediately. Brooks Bros in the US is
improving, but still makes a smaller return on sales than the rest of the
group.
But there is a feeling among retail analysts that when it goes into China
and Japan, M &amp; S will get it right.
So why did the shares fall? One reason is that profits were slightly smaller
than forecast, due to an unexpected Pounds 16m increase in pension costs.
Another is a warning that cost inflation could re-emerge this year, although
the company said, perhaps justifiably, that it was better placed to absorb
this than its competitors.
An underlying reason for the fall was investors switching from M &amp; S into
Burton, which they believe offers bigger short-term growth opportunities if
its recovery programme starts to bear fruit.
That, however, is a big if. M &amp; S, on the other hand, has lifted earnings
per share 62 per cent and dividends 64 per cent in five years.
For a more exciting, and possibly bumpy, ride, jump into Burton, or even
Storehouse. For a more sedate, but perhaps ultimately more rewarding,
journey, stay aboard Marks and Spencer.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (1): Canny buyers lead a
modest recovery - Gerald Cadogan ponders a patchy upturn in the homes market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forecasts by estate agents that prices of prime UK properties will rise
substantially this year still deter some potential sellers from instructing
their agents. Savills, for example, forecast in December 1993 that prices
would rise by 19 per cent by the end of this year.
Although the owners of such properties have seen their FT-SE 100 shares fall
in value by around 10 per cent since February, and new taxes and smaller tax
reliefs are an irritation, they see a glorious vision.
When home owners decide to make their long-delayed move, they will recoup
their losses or even make a good gain if they bought the property long
enough ago. Is this picture at the back of many vendors' minds too rosy? The
answer seems to be, yes.
The general recovery in house prices is modest, mirroring the modest,
fragmented recovery of the UK economy - although Savills' other forecast of
a 25 per cent rise in prime central London is proving closer to what is
happening.
The consensus among agents is of a rise, on average outside London of
between 5 and 10 per cent. They see plenty of would-be buyers and do not
have enough houses to satisfy them. But these buyers are canny. In general,
they want value and will not pay over the odds. If there is competition they
may go above the guide price for a house of quality.
'Patchy,' is how James Laing, of estate agents Strutt &amp; Parker, calls the
market. 'But it is on the good side of patchy, if one can say that.' Some
houses sell quickly and in excess of their guide price.
Examples are Ellerker Hall, in Yorkshire (Carter Jonas, guide price Pounds
370,000), The Limes in Rochester (Strutt &amp; Parker, Pounds 190,000) and the
Manor House in Princes Risborough (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, Pounds 450,000 for
a 78-year lease from the National Trust). The total may be growing, to judge
from the agents I talk to.
The practice of popping out at the weekend to buy a house to sell on six
months later - as happened in the 1980s - is dead and, I expect, will not
return. The experience of the recession, and the possibility that even the
well-paid may lose their jobs and be unable to fund a mortgage or pay school
fees, has been a salutary fright. It is too risky now to trade in properties
in which one lives, except for the occasional super-rich development in
London.
This caution is typical of the end of a recession, thinks John Husband, of
Humberts. Although the Woolwich Building Society sees the number of families
with negative equity as falling below 1m this summer, it is still a huge
number and means that a mass of debt is still inhibiting people's movements.
Some vendors still expect to receive what they paid in 1989 or quote a
valuation they were given at the time. But houses which are priced too high
deter viewers - and bidders.
Stockton House, in Wiltshire, a superb Elizabethan house with rich panelling
and plasterwork, which Savills sold recently, had to come down from Pounds
1m to Pounds 700,000 before buyers moved. In the end there were five firm
bidders, which must reflect rising confidence as well as realistic pricing.
In Sussex, Humberts relaunched Streat Place, which had been on the market
for two to three years and, thanks to competition, sold it quickly for close
to the guide price of Pounds 750,000 (Pounds 1m in 1992). The buyers'
realism is healthy. This time, the shortage of houses on sale is not leading
to ever-inflated prices, Husband says. Eventually, reluctant sellers will
see that if they do hang on to get more next year, the only way they can
take advantage of any higher price is to trade down to a smaller house, as
retired people do. Or they can take their money from a part of the country
with high prices, such as London, to where it will go further - Norfolk, for
example.
Low inflation in the mid to long-term is an equal deterrent to overpaying,
as is the building societies' reluctance, steming from overzealous lending
in the 1980s, to lend such generous multiples of income as they did then. Of
course, interest rates are low and homes are more affordable than they have
been for a very long time, but the tax relief is now down to 20 per cent and
will be 15 per cent in 1995/96 and applies only to the first Pounds 30,000
of a mortgage.
These new conditions create a new property world, where renting is again a
sensible alternative, as it was before the second world war and as it
remains over much of the Continent. Assured shorthold tenancies guarantee
landlords' possession, while tenants conserve their capital.
The Halifax and Nationwide indices bear out the picture of a gentle
recovery. They concur more or less on how the different regions are doing
but not on the figures. For the first quarter of 1994 both agreed that East
Anglia and Northern Ireland had done well, and the north west, West Midlands
and Wales worst. But Nationwide credited East Anglia with 11.1 per cent
growth year on year, while Halifax allowed it only 4.3 per cent. For Wales,
Halifax saw 1.3 per cent growth, and Nationwide a 5.7 per cent fall. In
spite of these differences, which reflect different data bases and different
ways of handling them, the indices remain a useful general guide to local
variations in the market.
London is another story. It is a large and fluid market, where it is easy to
see if a home is for sale at thousands of pounds more than a few months ago.
Prices have gone up, by an average 13.6 per cent in the year to March 1994
for prime property in central London, Savills finds, and by 5 per cent in
the first quarter, with the increases spreading throughout the capital.
Winkworth reports 10 per cent rises on the edge of central London (such as
Hammersmith - W6, W14) in that period. Cluttons London Residential Agency
estimates that the average discount of selling price to asking price fell to
2.81 per cent, down from 11.13 per cent in the last quarter of 1992.
A high-class developer, such as John Hunter's Northacre, is putting its
money down (more than Pounds 10m of it) by buying the freehold of Earls
Terrace, W8 with its 21 listed Georgian houses. And large city bonuses are
fuelling the rises in Holland Park, an urban 'village' for merchant bankers.
It is fair to call this market patchy, with its buyers reluctant to pay too
much, and its sellers reluctant to sell. And it is picky. There is no
widespread boom. Local conditions matter most in assessing a price, for
buyers and sellers.
More houses are coming to market and, by the autumn, there may be many more
 -which may damp further rises. Peter Lewis, of buying agent Stacks, says
there is no better time than now to sell a good house in the country in the
Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 550,000 range. It is a rare event when a set of
chambers comes to market in Albany, London W1, home of the great, grand and
artistic, from 19th century British premier William Gladstone to writer
Graham Greene.
Savills (071-730 0822) is selling F3, on the second and third floors at the
north end of the long passage in the building known as 'The Ropewalk'. It is
freehold. The guide price is Pounds 850,000. I expect competition.

FT  28 MAY 94 / The Long View: Treasury plays with fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surely the London stock market is in a jittery enough mood without being
undermined by the vague anti-dividend threats which have been dribbling out
from the government - this week, in the Competitiveness White Paper. The
Treasury ministers are playing with fire at a time when British investment
institutions are already faced with the likely need to make fundamental
shifts in their strategy.
Many pension funds, certainly, are plucking up courage to reduce their 85
per cent exposure to equities (60 per cent in the UK, 25 per cent overseas)
for two reasons. They are becoming mature; fewer employees are paying
contributions, more pensioners are receiving benefits, and shorter-term
investment strategies with a higher fixed-income content are becoming
appropriate. Second, a new minimum solvency standard for pension funds is
likely to be trailed in a white paper this summer. Again, this will
encourage a lower risk strategy, with less reliance on equities prone to the
occasional solvency-busting crash.
The Treasury has looked around the world and noticed that British companies
pay bigger and steadier dividends than their counterparts almost anywhere
else. Dividends soared at the rate of 15 per cent a year in the prosperous
late-1980s; and although growth halted during the recession, they are now
advancing again quite strongly, even though average dividend cover is
historically low.
This week, for instance, Marks and Spencer raised its dividend by 13.6 per
cent and SG Warburg by 15.8 per cent. The All-Share index constituents are
paying out almost 7 per cent more than a year ago, and some City analysts
expect dividends will soon be climbing at 10 per cent on average.
Certainly, the present tax system encourages high distributions, and it has
happened largely by accident. When the corporation tax system was introduced
20 years ago, it was designed to be dividend-neutral - that is, the same tax
would apply whether profits were retained or paid out to shareholders. When
investors are liable to standard-rate income tax, this remains true: out of
Pounds 100 of pre-tax profits, a company can retain Pounds 67 after tax, or
pay out anything up to Pounds 67 in net dividends.
Since the early 1970s, though, there has been a vast increase in the number
of UK shareholders who are tax-exempt. Pension funds have grown enormously
over that time and now own 35 per cent of the shares of British companies;
charities also own equities to a much greater extent than they used to.
Moreover, during the past 10 years the government has invented personal
equity plans and personal pension plans. Altogether, tax-exempt domestic
investors own more than 40 per cent of UK equities. If there really is a
dividend problem, it has been created by the Treasury's own initiatives.
Exempt investors can claw back most of the underlying corporation tax on a
company's profits by reclaiming the imputed tax on dividends. Until the
rules were changed slightly in the 1993 Budget, the effective tax rate on
underlying profits, taking the company and the exempt shareholder together,
was only 10 2/3 per cent rather than the 33 per cent on undistributed
profits. Last year's measures raised this 'look through' tax rate to 16 1/4
per cent, to the fury of pension funds; but almost three-quarters of the
previous incentive for distribution remains intact.
The steady and growing stream of dividend income which this favourable tax
structure has generated has encouraged the actuaries who value British
pension and life assurance funds to calculate share values on the basis of
capitalisation of income rather than day-to-day stock market prices. But
further adverse tax changes would directly threaten the actuarial value of
equity portfolios by reducing gross dividends. Moreover, if dividends become
much more volatile and risky, as the Treasury has hinted would be desirable,
share prices would suffer.
The arguments for and against high dividend payouts are inconclusive. One
line of reasoning is that companies should pay out most of their earnings,
so long as it is tax-efficient to do so, because shareholders and the
markets can decide better than company executives in particular industries
where the best new investment opportunities lie.
On the other hand, in countries such as Germany they do not pay much
attention to the priorities of what they regard as short-term market
speculators. And, in the UK, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has just
published a study which suggests that companies will invest
internally-generated funds in expansion projects more readily than funds
raised externally, which they find more expensive. More dividends could mean
less expansion.
The most that can be said is that a system biased in favour of dividends
could be slightly disadvantageous. But this discussion should be strictly
reserved for a bull market. It is perverse and dangerous for ministers to be
flying these kites at a time when share prices are under heavy pressure from
rising bond yields.
Look at the returns on index-linked gilts - which pension funds regard as a
close alternative to equities. From only 2.9 per cent at the beginning of
the year, the index-linked yield has been rising consistently throughout
1994; this week, it topped 3.7 per cent. Historically, it has been a danger
signal for equities when the equity and index-linked yields have collided,
and so it proved on Wednesday this week. After the FT-SE 100 index crashed
by 68.4 points and the yield rose to 3.8 per cent, a chink of daylight
re-appeared compared with the yield on linkers.
Yield relationships in the UK securities markets are under strain. Careless
talk is bad enough, but investors might gain the impression that the
anti-dividend campaign is designed deliberately to steer institutions
towards gilts. This is no way to achieve industrial competitiveness.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Who needs Solzhenitsyn?: A mixed reception awaits the writer
as he returns to his Russian homeland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose image in the west is that of the conscience of
Russia in exile and the literary heir to Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, returned
yesterday to his country - bowing low on his first steps out of the plane in
Magadan to honour the memory of the many thousands of Soviet convicts who
perished there.
For two decades he has been an occasional, austere and often angry voice in
exile: he returns to a land where his generation is dying or exhausted, the
next is deeply compromised and the youngest is sceptical, even scornful, of
the imperatives which have driven him.
Grigory Amelin, a young literary critic, caught this iconoclastic mood in a
squib he wrote recently for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, one of the smart new Moscow
dailies. In compressed, stylised Russian, he began: 'His books piled up to
the roof, his beard fit for Hollywood, his conscience scrubbed absolutely
spotless, he appears in Russia like a holiday, like the First of May - and,
like it, shamelessly out of date . . . In Moscow he'll be received like a
demi-God . . . but who needs him? No one . . . For a long time now he has
understood nothing either of America, or of Russia.'
He ended: 'Solzhenitsyn is a spiritual statue, he is like a hatstand in the
lobby, displaying a vast arrogance, spouting prophetically - but in the end,
pretty moth-eaten.'
It was a stone dropped into troubled waters. On his return to Russia after
20 years (he was forcibly deported in February 1974), Solzhenitsyn will
doubtless be honoured and treated as a 'spiritual statue'.
But he will also be reviled; pushed and pulled to lend his name to causes;
re-evaluated as a writer as he has not before; and pestered, gawped at and
petitioned in a way which would try the nerves and strength of a man with a
less autocratic and solitary temperament, and with fewer years than his 75.
More, he will be - already is - a touchstone for the intellectual and
political classes, a measure of their own moral and creative worth. He may
also be, after an initial flurry, ignored - which he has not been for more
than 30 years.
Some of this was demonstrated as much by a defence of him as by the initial
attack. Vladimir Bukovsky, himself a man of courage whose dissidence in the
1960s earned him a sentence and then deportation, wrote in Izvestia from his
now voluntary exile in the English university town of Cambridge, that Russia
was 'struggling not so much with economic collapse as with a complete
atrophy of conscience . . . (People) hate those who are not soiled, who did
not sup from the cup of the Communist Party with everyone else. They never
forgive that.'
Bukovsky, naturally, was being a little autobiographical: he has professed
himself deeply disappointed by what is happening in Russia, seeing
everywhere a return to communism in practice if not in name. Speaking from
Cambridge this week, Bukovsky said that 'It might be possible for him
(Solzhenitsyn) to have a kind of spiritual appeal to people. I wish him well
and I hope he can - but I doubt it's feasible with this generation, it's not
prepared for him. The next generation might.'
'He should,' says Lev Anninsky, a prominent writer and chairman of the
Russian Booker Prize jury for this year, 'stay out of politics. He is a
writer: grant him a place to write.'
That he will write is certain, since his life has been an obsessive,
sometimes heroic, struggle to find the space and the time and the freedom to
write: but Anninsky's hope is probably vain, for two reasons.
First, Solzhenitsyn is a man who evolved, even before he left it, a view of
Russia which, though individual, nevertheless intersects with many of the
dominant themes of current political and social struggle.
He had come to believe, especially from the early 1960s, that Russia was not
just a country but a civilisation apart: as his greatest biographer, Michael
Scammell, has noted (in Solzhenitsyn: a biography, Norton, 1984), he even
went so far as to agree with (though not to work with) a strain in the
Soviet communist party which stressed the nationalist, chauvinist values
against the more liberalising and pro-western current which emerged after
Khrushchev came to power. And though he honoured Andrei Sakharov, the late
physicist and human rights campaigner, Solzhenitsyn's dissidence had a very
different philosophical and political base from that of the liberal,
relativist scientist.
In his famous Harvard speech, given in 1978 when he received an honorary
degree from that university, Solzhenitsyn excoriated the west, assumed its
long-term decline, blasted the 'collapse of courage' in intellectual and
political life, poured scorn on criminality, on the popular media and on the
consumer culture.
That view is largely unchanged: he sees Russia as a cultural fortress to be
defended, not as a too-long-isolated imperial power which must be
democratised and led to the market.
On the contrary: he has made clear over the past year that he sees the
liberal reformers as dangerous, guilty of reckless experiments with the
country on a par with those of the Bolsheviks eight decades ago, of having
reduced Russia to poverty, dependence and criminality.
'He is,' says the liberal philosopher Yuri Senokossov, 'a man who does not
speak to the needs of our times. I honour him for his courage and his
actions: I don't follow him in what he now thinks and feels. He wants a
strong hand: a return to the zemstvos (or pre-revolutionary village
councils). He does not want the institutions of constitutionality and legal
forms: but these are the essence of building a state which protects its
citizens.'
Second, his view of the scope of Russia has also been set out clearly, in
his pamphlet How we should reconstruct Russia, published four years ago. It
was, when published, daring in one way - a blast against empire, a call for
Russia to let the dependent Soviet nations in Central Asia, the Baltics and
Transcaucasia go, find their own routes to national independence. Russia, he
argued, should define itself as the Slav area - the Russian Federation
itself, Ukraine, Belarus and Northern Kazakhstan.
This recipe is now daring in another way: it is the programme of the
nationalist politicians who would indeed reconstruct Russia to include at
least these peoples; and strong echoes of it are now to be found in the
official, government rhetoric, even as the Russian president and government
remain formally committed to the recognition of the independence of the
former Soviet states around them.
To have Solzhenitsyn, with the authority he can still command, living and
working in Russia and representing, even if not actively propagating, such
views could be a moral boost to this wing of Russian polity - even though he
has made it clear he has no time for the more rabid expressions of the idea,
such as those of Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the Liberal Democrats.
Thus the cannier leaders in the opposition forces - nationalists, communists
and others - already see him as an ally, even if only because their enemies
might become his enemies.
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, said in a comment
earlier this week to the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily that 'we should expect
him to be critical - especially towards the authorities, and the president'.
(Though others in these circles dismiss him with the same contempt as
Amelin: Alexander Nevzorov, the nationalist journalist, asked sarcastically:
'Who is he anyway? A writer? He's more of a propagandist. A historian? But
from his novels you would understand history as from a Dumas novel.')
He will, it is likely, be either dragged or move of his own volition into
the political maelstrom. His life in Russia, from the publication of A Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, in the journal Novy Mir in 1962, until his
expulsion 12 years later, was stormy and public.
Much of this was because the Communist Party could not leave him alone,
whether as (at first) a 'true son of the Party' for his perceived value in
exposing Stalinist excesses, or - increasingly - as an enemy of the people,
the 'crime' for which he was expelled.
But part of it was his own choice: though he sincerely craved space to write
and usually created it, he could also not stand aside from bearing witness
to the crimes of Soviet society - even if he did so with generally greater
caution and circumspection than other, usually younger, dissidents, being
ever careful to protect his precious manuscripts and freedom to write.
Will he be different now? The manner of his return yesterday speaks of the
public rather than the private man - a touchdown in the former prison camp
area of Magadan, then to the far-eastern city of Vladivostok, a planned
train ride through the country to examine its state, accompanied by the BBC.
The voracious media, which he has both courted and hated, will no longer
observe the courtesies they maintained while he passed nearly 20 years in
seclusion in Vermont, where he created a refuge into which little American
was allowed to intrude.
He will be thrust into the pulpit whether he likes it or not. Says one of
his detractors from the nationalist camp, Shamil Sultanov of the weekly Den:
'Various political forces of the left and the right and the centre will try
to use him for their own ends . . . but when these attempts do not work -
and they will not - they will lose all interest in him.'
Says Gavril Popov, the former mayor of Moscow: 'If Solzhenitsyn takes part
in politics, his reputation will fall.' And he adds: 'He's come back a
little too late.'
This is a general theme of comment on him: that had he returned (as he at
one time said he would) in the last years of the Gorbachev period, then he
would have been swept up into the pantheon of the liberalisers and
truth-tellers, taking his place with Sakharov. At that time, to read Gulag
Archipelago - his stunning account of the camp system - was a cross between
a civic duty and a fashion. But now, he returns to a divided, exhausted,
struggling land.
'He missed the great period - 1988-91,' says Alexander Tsipko, a leading
social critic and philosopher. 'In these years, only his books were active
in the struggle. Now, his version of anti-communism has lost its influence,
since as a result of the break-up of country there has arisen a nostalgia
for the past, for what has been lost. And in these conditions his active
dislike for communism may not be comprehensible to people.'
He may thus, soon, be ignored, or simply judged on his literary merit, which
he might well say he preferred.
Many of his admirers - such as Senokossov and Anninsky - are not fans of his
later writing: Senokossov says he cannot read August 1914, the first of the
novels conceived as the 'Red Wheel' cycle. 'The language is so deliberately
archaic, of a kind no one speaks or spoke,' he says. Others would even query
whether the early novels - Ivan Denisovich, First Circle, Cancer Ward - had
real literary merit, as opposed to political and moral importance.
His main literary defender in Russia is Alla Latynina, Russian literature
editor at the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta - ironically, the organ of the
Soviet (now Russian) writers' union from which he was expelled in the late
1960s.
Latynina, in her cluttered office, says that 'he immediately stood out as a
master and was recognised as such by his contemporaries. Many camp inmates
wrote about their experiences: many were very fine books. But why has
Solzhenitsyn remained supreme? Because he is a great writer, in the great
Russian tradition. Why does the Gulag stand out as an account of the camps?
Because it was not just a list of horrors, but a work of literature.'
'Who needs him?' says Anninsky, irritably rehearsing the Nezavisimaya
question. 'I need him, I, I. We all need him, in conditions of freedom as
much as in conditions of lack of freedom. He is there to tell us of our
past, a very large part of it, and he can give unique expression to it. I
need him.'
Solzhenitsyn has been rendered into statuary - as much by the western media
and academe as by the Soviet Communist Party. But, like the famous statue of
the Commendatore in Don Giovanni, he can and probably will revive - to call
sinners to account and to reveal a fundamentalist vision of good and evil.
'If we, the creators of art,' he wrote a year ago, 'will obediently submit
to this downward slide, if we cease to hold dear the great cultural
traditions of the foregoing centuries together with the spiritual
foundations from which it grew, we will be contributing to a highly
dangerous fall of the human spirit on earth, to a degeneration of man into
some kind of lower state, closer to the animal world.'
This is a a vision of the artist as a saviour of mankind: and Solzhenitsyn
cleaves to that. The man who returned to Russia yesterday retains the power,
and probably the will, to challenge, to move and to disturb. He remains a
hero, in the classic, and perhaps tragic, sense.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Costs in Halcion libel case set to top Pounds 5m: BBC,
Upjohn and professor to pay damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC, Upjohn - a US drugs company - and Professor Ian Oswald, a
psychiatrist, face legal costs exceeding Pounds 5m at the end of one of the
costliest libel trials in UK history yesterday.
Damages totalling Pounds 210,000 were awarded. The BBC, Upjohn and Professor
Oswald were each found in a four-month High Court trial to have committed
libel.
Justice Sir Anthony May said the BBC and Prof Oswald had been wrong to
accuse Upjohn of deliberately misleading regulators about the possible side
effects of the sleeping pill Halcion.
At the same time, Upjohn libelled Professor Oswald, by attacking his
scientific credibility.
Upjohn, which employed the specialist libel law firm Peter Carter-Ruck and
Partners, won Pounds 60,000 from the BBC and Pounds 25,000 from Prof Oswald.
Dr Royston Drucker, an Upjohn employee, was awarded Pounds 75,000 against
Prof Oswald.
Upjohn faces legal costs that will probably exceed Pounds 2m.
Prof Oswald, whose views on Upjohn and Halcion were broadcast in the BBC's
Panorama programme and who wrote on the subject for the New York Times in
January 1992, won a counterclaim against Upjohn and was awarded Pounds
50,000 in damages. He faces a bill for up to Pounds 2m.
The BBC said yesterday it would appeal against the decision to award damages
against it. 'This is a blow to investigative journalism,' it said. It said
it had kept legal costs relatively low through using staff lawyers. Its bill
is likely to be less than Pounds 1.5m.
Halcion has a history of controversy involving claims that it could have
side effects such as amnesia, paranoia and violent behaviour. Britain and
several other countries banned the drug in 1991. The Panorama programme of
October 1991 entitled 'The Halcion Nightmare' alleged that Upjohn had
deliberately mishandled its clinical trials so as to provide evidence
supporting its applications for approval of the drug.
Upjohn admits it made 'human errors' but denies deliberate wrongdoing.
Each of the parties was heavily criticised by Sir Anthony.
Upjohn had been 'thoroughly discreditable' and 'reckless' in the way it had
conducted the clinical trials, which reduced the damages awarded in its
favour.
The seriousness of the company's libel against Prof Oswald 'speaks for
itself', and Upjohn 'persisted with the allegations'.
The libels against Upjohn, however, were 'obvious and great', and Dr
Drucker, a medical doctor had been accused by Professor Oswald of lying in a
professional context.
'The allegation may have permanently damaged his career,' said Sir Anthony.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Scrabble takeover bid on the board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday made a surprise move
to become the world's undisputed Scrabble champion. It launched a Pounds
46.9m unsolicited bid for JW Spear, the British company which owns rights to
the board game outside North America.
Scrabble, which ranks alongside Monopoly as a board game known throughout
the world, is produced in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30
per cent of Spear's Pounds 38.7m turnover. This year the company is planning
to introduce versions in Turkish and Hungarian.
Hasbro had sales of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1993. It has owned
Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented more than 50
years ago, since 1989.
It has been the UK company's biggest shareholder outside the Spear family
interests for the past four years, with 26.7 per cent. The trustees of some
Spear family trusts have given undertakings to accept the Hasbro bid in
respect of a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings become irrevocable next
Friday if a higher offer is not received.
Hasbro is offering 900p a share, a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.
The Spear board will meet this morning to consider the bid. The company,
which in March raised its final dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a 22
per cent rise in profits to Pounds 4.51m, is expected to find the offer
inadequate.
Mr Francis Spear, chairman, would make no comment last night, although he
dismissed any idea of a family row. Mr Paul Lipscomb, finance director, said
the bid had come like a bolt from the blue.
Spear's other products include Atmosfear, a board game linked to a video,
and more traditional pastimes such as Snakes and Ladders.
Mr Alan Hassenfeld, chairman of Hasbro, said the acquisition would be 'a
logical extension of Hasbro's strategy to develop and expand its core
operations around the world'.
The origins of Scrabble lie in the 1930s when it was developed as a
crossword game by Alfred Butts, a New York architect whose practice was in
trouble after the Wall Street crash.
It was launched as Scrabble in 1949 after almost two decades of rejection by
leading games players as too highbrow. The game took off in the 1950s after
the chairman of Macy's department store in New York became hooked and placed
a large order.
Mr Butts, a poor speller, earned only a 5 cent royalty on each set.
Nevertheless, at the peak sales levels in the late 1950s and 1960s, he was
getting about Dollars 50,000 a year.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Cornhill fined Pounds 150,000 fornot controlling sales
firms: Lautro investigation finds insurance group neglected its role as
overseer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cornhill, the composite insurance group, has been fined Pounds 150,000 by
Lautro, the life industry's regulator, and ordered to pay Pounds 45,000
costs for failing to control two firms which acted as appointed sales
representatives.
The announcement was made yesterday after a disciplinary hearing on Thursday
night. Cornhill is said to have wanted to resolve the issue before the start
of the first Test match between England and New Zealand on Thursday.
Cornhill is sponsoring the series.
The two charges, admitted by the company, relate to the activities of
Cornhill Financial Management (Northern Ireland), formerly known as Castle
Insurance Group, and Challenge Financial Management, between 1990 and 1993.
Lautro carried out special investigations into both firms last year.
In cases where Cornhill failed to ensure that its policies were sold by
authorised sales agents, it has offered to return money, together with
appropriate interest, to investors who might have suffered a loss.
Cornhill refused to give any indication of the scale of the compensation,
but Lautro noted the payments were 'a significant cost to the company'.
Cornhill was also charged with failing to take steps to ensure that the two
appointed firms met regulators' requirements in areas such as recording
investor information and taking remedial action where problems had been
identified.
Cornhill failed, for example, to react to concerns, raised even by some of
its own staff, about the possibility of unauthorised selling.
While the Pounds 150,000 penalty is only half those levied recently on
Norwich Union and Premium Life, the charges relate to concerns raised during
the first round of routine inspection visits in December 1990.
The other most recent fines have related to misconduct from the second round
of routine visits, for which Lautro has increased significantly the
penalties it was ready to impose.
Cornhill said the fine would be paid from shareholders' rather than
policyholders' funds.
It has ended its relationship with one of the appointed representative
firms. Management at the other firm involved has been changed since the
period covered by the charges.
Life and pensions policies represent the smaller part of Cornhill's
business. In 1993, Cornhill's premium income from life and pensions policies
was Pounds 103.8m, while its general insurance premium income totalled
Pounds 605.2m.

FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue/Portals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All credit to De La Rue for walking away from a hostile bid for Portals. The
logic of combining banknote paper-making and security printing was never
compelling, especially at the kind of heady multiple De La Rue would have
had to pay for control. The risk of upsetting Portals other customers
weighed against the benefits of pooling technology. It is a measure of
investors' scepticism that De La Rue's shares fell by 10 per cent once the
market caught scent of the talks. Yesterday the stock rose by 1.5 per cent
against a falling market.
Wider stock market wobbles must have been a mixed blessing. Since De La Rue
has a large cash pile, falling share prices generally work in its favour.
But the equity component of a bid for Portals would have been more difficult
to arrange. That may have added to the pragmatic arguments for pulling back
from the brink. An unsuccessful hostile bid would also have soured the
commercial relationship between the two sides. One can only hope
co-operation can be achieved without the rigmarole of a takeover.
De La Rue can take some comfort from its participation in Camelot's
successful bid for the national lottery. While the lottery should boost
earnings, though, the company's Pounds 11m equity investment in Camelot will
barely dent its Pounds 250m cash pile. Still, De La Rue's recovery since
1990 has been built on efforts to narrow the focus of the group. That record
remains intact.

FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP will be the biggest winner if the US ban on Alaskan oil exports is
repealed. Not only is it the largest producer of Alaskan oil, accounting for
220m barrels a year. Unlike Atlantic Richfield, the other main producer, it
does not have refineries in California where most Alaskan oil is processed.
If the export ban were to go and producers were free to sell where they
wished, the fat Californian refining margins would be squeezed.
The current regime requires BP and other producers to ship more than a third
of output through the Panama Canal to the US Gulf. Demand in California is
just not big enough. Repealing the ban would allow them to ship crude to
oil-hungry markets in the Far East, particularly Japan.
BP would benefit in four ways. First, shipping costs would be roughly
50c-60c a barrel lower because of the shorter distance. Second, the group
could obtain 20c-30c more a barrel in the Far East than in the US Gulf.
Third, prices for crude shipped to California could rise as producers would
be able to divert some of their oil from the state's saturated market.
Finally, BP would find it more attractive to develop its untapped Alaskan
exploration acreage.
The annual boost to BP's earnings from just the first two factors would be
about Dollars 70m or nearly 1p a share. The other factors are harder to
quantify but would probably double the overall benefit. A change in the law
is, of course, not certain. But, with the unions squared and the US Energy
Department moving towards lifting the ban, the chances of a repeal look
good.

FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's falling market was hardly an auspicious backdrop for 3i to
launch its pathfinder prospectus. The venture capital company has a fair
wind behind it nonetheless. Assuming it is sold on a reasonable discount to
net assets, the issue involves only around Pounds 700m in new money. Since
3i will be snapping at the heels of the FT-SE 100 index, if not a
constituent, institutions will need to acquire stock for weighting purposes.
And since it is deeply involved in the small company sector, which is highly
geared to economic recovery, the chances are it will outperform.
The more difficult question is how far 3i is different from the run-of-the
mill venture capital investment trust. Its argument that its broadly-based
portfolio, close relationships with its customers and long-term approach to
investment has considerable appeal. It should make of 3i a stock which shows
both high growth and relatively low volatility. That does not free it from
the effects of the economic cycle - last year's underlying 30.3 per cent
total return could not be sustained in a downswing - but the 10-year record
does show a higher average return than other venture capital and small
company investment trusts.
To some extent the comparison may be distorted by different methods of
valuing unrealised investment gains. 3i's approach is linked to the equity
market because it makes heavy use of market multiples. Its long-term average
return at 16.1 per cent is only just higher than the Hoare Govett Smaller
Companies Index. Buyers may not require a discount to net assets as large as
the 15 per cent applying to venture capital investment trusts. But the
difference will not be great.

FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Shares take a tumble
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who thought last year's wave of liquidity would sweep equities ever
upwards must be truly distressed to see the FT-SE 100 index fall below
3,000. As before, the problem originates with bonds. This week's decision by
the Bundesbank to cancel an auction of debt securities and an upward
revision in US first quarter growth seemed calculated to upset bonds and
therefore equities too. It is striking, though, that London equities, which
fell 5 per cent this week, have been worse hit than their US equivalents.
The Dow is little changed.
Perhaps European markets were relatively more exposed to speculative
international flows. That would explain the violent nature of the downturn.
Perhaps too the earnings story was not strong enough to sustain equities at
higher levels. The London market does not look expensive on fundamental
yardsticks. The prospective yield of around 4.5 per cent is not far short of
what is available on cash. The prospective multiple of about 14.5 times is
not very demanding.
Yet such ratios do not make the market an unequivocal buy. While the bond
markets remain nervous, there is a temptation to cling on to cash.
Index-linked gilt yields are again uncomfortably close to those on equities,
and unsettling talk of government interference on dividends continues. The
market could have some way further to fall before it bounces.

FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady ahead of holiday
weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks weathered a downturn in the bond market yesterday as investors
squared their positions ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.68 higher at 3,757.14,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.27 at 457.33. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite added 1.32 to 440.94, and
the Nasdaq composite 1.50 at 733.14.
In view of an early sell-off in the Treasury debt market, stocks held up
well. Bonds turned bearish after the Commerce Department confounded
economists with an upward revision of its estimate of first-quarter economic
growth to 3.0 per cent. Analysts had expected the government to trim its
estimate of gross domestic product from 2.6 per cent to 2.4 per cent. The
surprise sent the benchmark 30-year government bond tumbling, though it
recovered somewhat during the afternoon. Share prices dipped, steadied and
then returned to their opening levels, remaining there for the rest of the
session.
In the morning, Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, testified before Congress
but his remarks elicited no discernible reaction in the markets. He left
open the possibility of further tightening of monetary policy during the
summer.
Many equity investors apparently decided to relax and get an early start on
the weekend. Volume was light, with only 186m shares exchanged.
When Wall Street gets back to business on Tuesday, however, it faces a
barrage of economic data next week, culminating with Friday's employment
report. Trading activity is likely to pick up pace as the week progresses.
A mostly dull session yesterday was highlighted by active trading in Upjohn,
the pharmaceuticals house considered ripe for takeover. The stock gave back
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 after Hoechst of Germany denied speculation
that it was considering a merger or strategic alliance with the US group.
Upjohn's share price had jumped Dollars 3 7/8 in the previous session.
McKesson, the largest US drug distributor, also provided some fireworks. Its
share price jumped 11 per cent during the previous session, on speculation
that a foreign buyer would emerge for its drugs-benefit business. But when
Glaxo denied interest in such a deal yesterday morning, McKesson dropped
Dollars 2 1/2 but later reversed direction to close up Dollars 3 at Dollars
84. Meanwhile, Philip Morris continued to suffer from its board's decision
to take no action on a proposal to split the company's tobacco and food
operations. The stock shed a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 after
dropping Dollars 3 on Thursday.
Oil stocks were mixed, with Arco gaining Dollars 2 to Dollars 102 and Mobil
shedding Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 81 3/8 although Oppenheimer lifted its
estimate of the company's 1995 results because of a restructuring of its
chemical operations.
Canada
Toronto ended flat in quiet dealings. The TSE 300 composite index slipped
1.83 to 4328.88 in volume of 60.9m shares, up about 31 on the week. Ten of
the 14 stock groups fell, with mining and consumer products slightly down,
banking and industrial products flat, and energy and golds up a little.

FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Clouded horizons for upset German
bourse - A look at Frankfurt's fall from grace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, pulled the rug on the German
stock market last Monday. It was the H-word that did it. Speaking in
Helsinki, while his domestic traders were enjoying the Pentecostal holiday,
Mr Tietmeyer proclaimed that as far as central bank interest rates were
concerned, the 'horizon is now clear for some time'.
Although some saw this as a roundabout way of saying that the Bundesbank
could see no obstacles in the way of continued discount rate cuts, a
consensus rapidly emerged that Mr Tietmeyer meant that he could see no
reason to put the bank's short-term rates back in the salami slicer for a
little while yet.
Although there was little pressure from sellers or buyers, Frankfurt's Dax
index of 30 leading shares was left with nothing to stand on and slid
rapidly downwards. Within the next three days, helped along by darkling
hints of lurking inflation from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council
member, the Dax lost around 120 points. Yesterday, an early upturn was not
sustained and when the Ibis-indicated Dax closed at 2,112.80 in the post
bourse it was down around 6 per cent on the week.
An enduring recovery may take some time to emerge, and will once again
depend on the development of interest rate prospects. The improved outlook
for industrial profits this year has long been included in most German stock
prices. Meanwhile, according to a pessimistic analysts' report from the
Bayerische Vereinsbank, the Dax is more likely to dip further towards the
2,000 mark within the next two months than shift up towards the key 2,300
level it strove and failed to attain in rises which were sparked solely by
the April and May discount rate cuts.
There appear to be few reasons why the Bundesbank should consider further
short-term rate cuts for several months. Although the bank insists that its
business is monetary - not economic - policy, the softly-softly decline in
rates which began late in 1992 has clearly helped economic recovery in
recent months. The upswing is under way, as shown by strongly rising export
demand and clear signs of improvements at home. It appears to have enough
momentum without the need for a further push from the Bundesbank, which in
any case will want to avoid any risk of over-heating.
After three cuts in short order, which have brought the discount rate down
to 4.5 per cent - the lowest level since mid-1988 - the bank needs to be
careful to avoid giving the impression that the economy's troubles are over,
and raising inflationary expectations in a workforce earning sharply reduced
real incomes. Public spending has also still to be brought under control in
a process likely to last far beyond the official end of recession.
Although experience shows that no assumptions are safe in regard to the
Bundesbank's tactics, it appears Mr Tietmeyer and his men have allowed
themselves three to four months in which to come to grips with their most
pressing concern - money supply.
The bank's key indicator for monetary policy, and its most trusted guide to
inflationary potential, the M3 measure, has been running wild for four
months. At the last count, M3 was growing at 15.8 per cent annualised
compared with the bank's top target of 6 per cent for this year. By senior
officials' own admissions, it has also become opaque.
The figure has been distorted by a hefty overhang from the last quarter of
1993. The impact of the much-discussed special factors (the unhappy
side-effects of tax measures introduced by the government) has been
considerable, but apparently impossible to define. And as was suggested this
week, the persistently high borrowing demands of government and quasi-state
institutions such as Telekom, the railways system and the Treuhand
privatisation agency, plus the private sector, may well prove to contain the
seeds of future inflation.
As the bank explained at the time, the most recent cut in the discount rate
was intended to adjust the interest rates structure. The idea was to
encourage investors rattled by uncertainty on rates to move funds currently
parked in short-term deposits, which fall within the definition of M3, into
longer-term instruments, which do not. Although this process of so-called
monetary capital formation appeared to accelerate in April, several
observers have been quick to claim that it is now too late for M3 even to
approach the central bank's 4-6 per cent target range this year.
They argue that if that turns out to be the case, the Bundesbank will have
lost the 'gamble' it took by cutting rates three times this year while M3
was clouded in so much uncertainty. That loss could cause serious damage to
the credibility which the bank sees as its most valuable asset.
On the other hand the bank would hardly have won praise if it had left rates
unchanged, and there is a certain measure of Schadenfreude detectable in
some of the attacks. But the fact that the bank should have lost sight,
arguably through no fault of its own, of the true amount of liquidity or
readily-available funds sloshing around in the system at such a delicate
time suggests that the M3 formula at least requires tuning.

Nikkei to 1994 high
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Active buying by foreign investors, investment trust funds and dealers
pushed up share prices and the Nikkei index rose 1.4 per cent, closing at
the year's high, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose 281.36 to 20,777.16, surpassing the previous high of
20,677.77 in March. It moved in a narrow range in the morning, registering a
low of 20,510.10; but buying by dealers in the afternoon session triggered
activity by domestic institutions, and a peak of 20,824.56.
Volume rose to 530m shares against 399m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks jumped 19.78 to 1,670.76 while the Nikkei 300 rose 3.90 to
305.75. Advances led declines by 832 to 197 with 147 unchanged and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.46 to 1,378.07.
In spite of the rise, few in the market expected the index to break the
21,000 level easily. Traders said that large-lot selling orders had been
placed.
Large capital steels and shipbuilders were higher. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y11 to Y749 and Nippon
Steel gained Y2 to Y372.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y7,000 to Y868,000. Other
telecommunication and multimedia linked stocks were also higher with Fujitsu
up Y40 to Y1,090 and NEC gaining Y20 to Y1,190.
Profit-taking depressed East Japan Railway, which lost Y1,000 to Y508,000.
Speculative favourites gave way to blue chips. Sumitomo Coal Mining fell Y11
to Y884.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 213.71 to 22,881.19 in volume of 26.8m
shares. Capcom, a video game software maker, gained Y400 to Y4,930 on
reports that its pre-tax profits will rise 10 per cent for the current year
to March.
Roundup
Individual markets displayed strength in an otherwise quiet region.
SHANGHAI B shares rose 5 per cent on US renewal of most favoured nation
status to China. The index rose 3.56 to 75.55, for a 12.5 per cent advance
over the week as foreign and domestic buyers built their portfolios. Renewed
confidence in the outlook began to emerge at the start of last week after a
40 per cent fall in the market since the start of the year.
BANGKOK rose 2 per cent on the day and 3.4 per cent over the week as buyers
moved in to large market capitalisation stocks. The SET index rose 27.55 to
1,383.57 in turnover of Bt8.5bn, down from Thursday's Bt10bn.
TAIPEI was pulled lower by late profit-taking in industrials after
Thursday's rebound, and the weighted index fell 45.59 to 5,806.77, or 1.7
per cent, over the week. Turnover rose to TDollars 41.51bn from TDollars
35.78bn.
MANILA opened strongly on foreign buying of blue chips but dipped at the
close as profits were taken. The composite index fell 10.07 to 2,907.00, 1.3
per cent higher on the week.
SYDNEY firmed on a late spurt of bargain-hunting which took the All
Ordinaries index up 5.3 to 2,102.2, little changed on the week, in turnover
of 207.3m shares.
HONG KONG finished a mixed day slightly lower, sapped by profit-taking on
confirmation of US renewal of China's MFN trade status and concerns over the
lower domestic property market. The Hang Seng index fell 11.58 to close at
9,470.13, 1.7 per cent lower on the week.
SEOUL was slightly higher as investors switched attention between a number
of different sectors. The composite index added 3.10 to 953.86, little
changed on the week.
SINGAPORE was firm on late blue chip buying by institutions which took the
Straits Times Industrials index 8.75 higher to 2,323.95, little changed on
the week, in volume of 98.48m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR finished the day's highs as investors again took quick profits
amid continued uncertainty over the market's near-term direction. The
composite index closed 3.06 ahead at 1,000.11, almost unchanged on the week.
BOMBAY ended with gains on buying by speculators and mutual funds which took
the BSE-30 index 51.51 higher to 3,789.51 in a session shortened to enable
the BSE to prepare for the launch of two new broad-based rupee and
dollar-based indices.

FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses suffer after
revised US data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revised gdp data, and consumer sentiment indications from the US had little
impact on their domestic market, but were followed by substantial foreign
selling in senior European bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS dropped 2 per cent after substantial selling orders from the US, said
Mr John Fordyce at Ferri International. The CAC-40 index fell 41.22 to
2,050.67, down 4.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of FFr4.4bn.
The story of the day, however, was strictly European: Schneider, the
electrical engineering group, dropped FFr23.30, or 5.6 per cent to FFr390
after its chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, was jailed by in Brussels
following a complaint by minority shareholders in two of the group's Belgian
subsidiaries.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne is scheduled to appear before a judge on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, for the whole market, Mr Fordyce feared the absence of UK and US
participation on Monday, after a fall of 300 points in the CAC-40 since
early in Febuary. 'We could see small shareholders coming in as a flotilla
of sellers, with no prop from abroad,' he said.
FRANKFURT was hit by heavy selling of Dax futures and foreign selling of the
cash market from a little after midday, said Mr Edgar Benischek, head of
trading at Bank Julius Bar.
It closed the official session with the Dax index 10.74 higher at 2,140.99,
down from a day's high of 2,158.26; it then slid further in the afternoon to
an Ibis-indicated close of 2,112.80.
Turnover eased from DM8.5bn to DM7.3bn. Big stocks like Deutsche Bank,
Daimler and Volkswagen took the brunt of the selling as proxies for the
market, said Mr Benischek. Looking at the 6.1 per cent fall on the week, he
thought that the German bourse could be in a correction phase similar to
that experienced earlier this year by the Swiss bourse - when, from peak to
trough, blue chips fell by 19.5 per cent.
MILAN remained under pressure until a late technical rebound pulled shares
off their worst levels as the Comit index tested support around the 720
level. The index finished 10.26 lower at 730.69, for a 5.9 per cent fall
over the week.
A heavy flow of capital increases announced this week contributed to the
unsettled mood of a market facing profit-taking, particularly by foreign
investors, in the wake of the post-election euphoria. Trading volume,
however, was thin.
Ifil, the Agnelli family holding company, was the day's big loser, down
L1,083 or 14.3 per cent to L6,511, in response to its announcement of plans
to raise L800bn in fresh funds. Analysts commented that investors were
unhappy that half the cash would be used to finance the switch of the Unicem
cement group to Ifil from its sister IFI holding company.
BCI gave up L74 to L5,031, adding to Thursday's sharp fall in the wake of
news that it planned to raise L2,000bn.
Fiat lost L66 to L6,635 in spite of hopes that the new government might be
about to announce measures to jump-start the economy, including incentives
for new car buyers.
Mediobanca lost another L399 to L15,225 amid expectations that official
notice of an inquiry into the merchant bank's role as adviser on the
restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison was expected to be sent to bank
directors within the next few days.
ZURICH was heartened by data indicating that the economy was gaining
momentum, while inflation remained low and the SMI index rose 22.7 to
2,711.9, for a 0.8 per cent fall on the week.
Better than expected May inflation figures yesterday followed Thursday's
announcement of 1.3 per cent growth in the first quarter of the year.
Financials were firm: UBS bearers rose SFr10 to SFr1,170, CS Holding put on
SFr6 to SFr612 and Zurich Insurance was SFr16 higher at SFr1,336.
Nestle continued its come-back, adding SFr22 to SFr1,145 while Roche
certificates were SFr65 better at SFr6,610 ahead of Tuesday's annual
meeting.
AMSTERDAM was under pressure from domestic bonds and the weak showing of
London equities, and the AEX slid 3.11 to 401.63, close to the
psychologically important 400 level. The market had fallen 2.7 per cent over
the week.
Chemical stocks continued to recover after the weakness of the last two
weeks. DSM picked up Fl 1 to Fl 135 while Akzo was 90 cents higher at Fl
210.70.
Nedlloyd gave up another Fl 1.40 to Fl 71.10 in response to this week's
lower than expected first quarter results.
ATHENS recovered another 2.3 per cent, the general index rising 19.12 to
855.43, but it was still 6.3 per cent lower on a week which saw a continuing
liquidity crisis driving investors to high-yielding investments in
risk-free, bank-to-customer repurchase agreements (repos).
ISTANBUL, in contrast, fell by 3.65 per cent as investors fled into treasury
bills, the composite index ending 599.72 down at 15,825.12.

FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Portals tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News that De La Rue and Portals had called off merger talks sent shares in
the two groups moving in opposite directions. Bank note printer De La Rue,
which had initiated the discussions, jumped 14 to 843p, while paper supplier
Portals slumped 112 to 653p. The dramatic share price movements followed De
La Rue's announcement that it did not intend to bid without the backing of
the Portals board.
De La Rue's final results on Tuesday are expected to disclose an increase in
profits from Pounds 104.7m to a market range of Pounds 115m to Pounds 130m.
The sale by Thorn EMI of a large part of its security business encouraged
hopes in the market that the group had taken a further step towards its
eventual demerger. The shares held steady in the face of the faltering
market to close just a penny off at 1025p. Speculation that Thorn may split
its two core businesses - music and rental - into two separately quoted
companies, long-rumoured in the market, were given extra credence this week
by remarks from the group's management at the results meeting.
Strauss Turnbull downgraded profit expectations and turned seller of
Dalgety, citing increased competition in the pet food market, and price
increases in the potato market which are likely to impact on the company's
crisp snack business. The shares fell 10 to 423p.
The well-flagged sale of Bakers Oven by Associated British Foods caused some
disconcertion over the price - Pounds 18.9m against best market expectations
of Pounds 30m - and the shares fell 12 to 543p. Purchaser Greggs rose 12 to
805p on the deal and an upbeat trading statement.
Discount supermarket group Shoprite endured another torrid session as
turnover hit 1m and the shares weakened 10 to 80p. A profits warning on
Thursday sent the shares crashing from 144p.
There was some disappointment over the price struck by Boots for its Farleys
baby food business. The shares slid 15 to 509p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo, which initially gained 10 in early trading,
finished 5 down at 534p as the downward pressure on the market took its
toll. Comments from the chief executive which came after the the market
close denied the group was in acquisition talks, following strong
speculation that Glaxo was seeking to buy or form an alliance with the US
drug company McKesson.
Shares in chemicals group Courtaulds bucked the poor market trend to close 3
ahead at 514p, after trade of 1.4m, on further reflection of the board's
report of a positive trading outlook.
The group reported lacklustre figures on Wednesday but it was the bullish
statement and positive analysts meeting that led several brokers to upgrade
profit expectations. Hoare Govett, which had the stock on its hold list,
turned an aggressive buyer of the shares.
However, Kleinwort Benson remain negative on the stock and said ' . . . we
continue to recommend a reduction in weightings'.
Legal &amp; General tumbled 23 to 408p, as dealers reflected on the balance
sheet effect on insurers of the falls in both the bond and equity markets.
Volume at the close was 1.9m. Prudential Corporation continued the heavy
selling of recent sessions and fell 10 to 277p, in trade of 4.2m.
Bargain hunters were evident around Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel which
this week launched a much-anticipated Pounds 816m rights issue, one of the
largest in UK corporate history. The shares gained 11 to 359p in modest
turnover.
Shares in engineering group William Cook fell 23 to 262p after it reported
disappointing second half figures. Pressure on margins was blamed for the
setback.
British Steel gave up 2 to 136 1/2 p with NatWest Securities issuing a
detailed negative note on the stock.

FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite more positive comments from some market sources, Granada suffered
another weak session as bearish sentiment prevailed. The shares retreated 6
1/2 to 490 1/2 p, making a fall over the past two weeks of 10 per cent.
Mr Alastair Smellie at Lehman Brothers expressed concern that the group's
television rental division was the source of around 35 per cent of profits.
'This business is fully mature and ex-growth. Granada will have to make
further acquisitions in order to maintain profits which carries a lot of
risk in the shares. I will be happier when they are down to below 450p.'
But Mr Jason Holden at NatWest Securities took a more positive view. 'The
recent underperformance in the shares ignores the value and potential of
BSkyB, the cyclical recovery in motorway services, margin improvement in
contract catering, retail growth in the rental business and the obvious
synergy benefits of the LWT integration.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market weakness hits Recs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a rollercoaster ride in the regional electricity companies (Recs)
yesterday with a strong performance by the shares finally succumbing to the
overall weakness of the market. South Western was a strong feature in early
trading, as it announced that it was to seek permission from shareholders to
buy back up to 10 per cent of the issued share capital. The shares moved
forward on the news and led a sector-wide rise, underpinned by investor
enthusiasm for yield plays and recent buy recommendations from several
brokers.
However, the strong downward momentum in the market, fuelled by the sliding
gilts market, sapped the undercurrent of support and the shares gave way.
South Western managed to end the session unchanged at 609p, while London
slipped 3 to 570p, Eastern 6 to 604p and Manweb 6 to 700p. Analysts said
that they expected a further half-dozen of the highly cash-positive Recs to
initiate share buy-back schemes. Last month, Eastern completed the first
buy-back, purchasing 10 per cent if its share capital.

FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: New rate worries drive Footsie below
3,000 - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A confident opening performance by UK equities was wiped out by a series of
blows delivered first from Germany and then from the United States, which
triggered a flurry of heavy selling pressure originating in the futures
markets. News yesterday suggested that German rates had effectively bottomed
out while there were worrying signs inflationary pressures in the US.
The FT-SE 100 index plunged below the 3,000-mark for the first time since
September 1993, ending another turbulent session a net 53.3 lower at
2,966.4, a fall of over 160 points, or 5 per cent on the week. The UK
market's second-line stocks also fell heavily, with the FT-SE Mid-250 index
retreating 44.1 to 3,572.3, leaving the index 142 points, or 3.8 per cent,
lower over the five-day period.
The US inflationary worries pervading international bond markets also
gripped UK gilts where long-dated issues, which began the day around 1/4
firmer but came off sharply and closed with losses in excess of a point,
with dealers showing concern over next Tuesday's May MO money supply
figures. Dealers said an MO figure showing year-on-year growth in excess of
7 per cent could bring renewed pressure.
The UK equity market, together with most European bourses, has been badly
hit this week by worries that German interest rates may have bottomed out in
the current cycle.
The gloom encompassing the London market at the close was far removed from
the lively mood at the outset, when marketmakers hoisted opening levels
after taking in details of the latest Confederation of British Industry
Survey which revealed that factory orders reached a five-year high in May.
The survey, which also highlighted optimism that economic recovery is
filtering through to manufacturing sectors, saw the FT-SE 100 race to a
session high of 3,033.7, up 14.4, within an hour of the opening.
After the initial flush of institutional buying, the market ground to a halt
and lost heart as sell trades in the FT-SE future weakened sentiment in the
cash market.
The real pressure across the market emerged around midday, when a burst of
selling of the FT-SE future, reportedly of a similar size to that which
triggered Wednesday's market sell-off, drove the future lower and saw the
FT-SE 100 index plunge through 3,000 as the market reacted to the higher
than expected increase in US gross domestic product and the deflator figure.
With little sign of support the 100 index dropped rapidly to reach the day's
low point of 2,959.5, with other European markets similarly hit. The low
point coincided with details of the testimony given to the US Senate Banking
Committee by Federal chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, who spoke of concern at the
dollar's lack of response to monetary policy moves.
A senior trader in the London equity market spoke of 'investor fatigue' at
the close of a difficult week. There was no real selling pressure in the
cash market, dealers insisted. 'There is nothing in this market to tempt the
buyers who continue to give the market a wide berth,' said the head of
marketmaking at one of the big UK integrated houses.
Turnover of 569.8m shares was described as 'unremarkable, given that the
market has dropped almost 60 points'.

FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures came under heavy pressure, responding to selling by US
investment banks.
After opening at 3,015 and moving ahead to 3,024 in quiet trading, the June
contract on the FT-SE 100 faltered as one of the big UK investment houses
sold 1,000 contracts into the market. The big hit came around midday when
one of the writers of over-the-counter tailored options sold the market
aggressively. The future plunged through the 3,000-mark, hitting the session
low of 2,932 before closing at 2,940.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upward revision in US first quarter GDP figures failed to bolster the
dollar which finished the week at the same low levels where it started,
writes Philip Gawith.
Trade was fairly light ahead of the long weekend - US and UK markets are
closed on Monday - and the dollar closed in London at DM1.6444 against the
dollar from DM1.6438. Against the yen, it finished at Y104.400 from
Y104.405.
There was little movement in Europe, with the D-Mark finishing at FFr3.417
against the French franc from FFr3.418.
Sterling again traded in tandem with the dollar, finishing virtually
unchanged at DM2.4806 against the D-Mark and Dollars 1.5086 against the US
currency.
The upward revision in US first quarter GDP growth to 3 per cent from 2.6
per cent gave a midday fillip to the dollar. This was soon erased by reports
of sales of dollars for Swiss francs.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of currency research at UBS in London, said this was
simply a case of traders taking 'a flyer' in thin trading ahead of the long
weekend. He said the market was trying to break through the key level of
Sfr1.40 against the dollar.
The UBS analyst said he remained of the view that the market was ignoring
fundamentals. The key for the dollar, said Mr Chertkow, would come when US
short-term interest rates rose above those in Germany.
In the futures market, the December contract finished five basis points
lower at 93.78, with 20,410 lots traded. The back months gave up more
ground.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the longer end of the
market had taken its lead from the gilts market where there had been a big
cash seller.
Euromark volumes were again good, with the December contract trading 48,000
lots. Sentiment was improved by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank
president, clarifying observations he had made earlier in the week
suggesting that interest rate reductions were on hold.
Mr Tietmeyer said he had been referring to official rates, with the repo
rate still free to fall. The December contract continued its rally from the
sell-off at the start of the week, closing nine basis points up at 94.88.
In the UK money market the Bank of England provided assistance of Pounds
860m after forecasting a Pounds 900m shortage. Overnight money traded
between 3 per cent and 5 1/2 per cent.
German call money rates fell sharply as banks disposed of surplus cash
holdings ahead of the weekend. Overnight money rates were quoted at 4.50/5
per cent from 5.15/5.25 per cent. Rates are expected to rise above 5 per
cent after the weekend.
The Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo, both of which have been under
pressure recently, had fairly quiet days. The escudo closed at Es104 from
Es104.1 against the D-Mark, while the drachma was fixed firmer at Dr149 from
Dr150.070 on Thursday.
Buying pressure was seen at Es104, with unconfirmed reports that the Bank of
Portugal was in the market. The central bank intervened on Thursday.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee falls as metals climb
higher - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity markets took a mid-week breather from the fizz and fury that has
sharply driven up most prices. Then the markets took off in different
directions: Copper and other metals renewed their bull run; Coffee and cocoa
ended the week with heavy losses as investment funds started to sell.
Meanwhile, the oil market remained uncertain about whether to extend the
explosive rally that lifted prices by 25 per cent since the end of March.
London July futures for the benchmark Brent crude closed last night at about
Dollars 16.30 a barrel, unchanged from a week ago. Traders said buyers had
appeared any time the price dipped towards Dollars 16.
A long-awaited sell-off hit the coffee market after prices had started the
week much stronger and traders were looking for the market to make fresh
highs. However, the rout started in New York late on Tuesday when weakness
across the commodity markets, starting in grains, spilled into coffee and
cocoa.
Coffee lost most of its gains made earlier in the week on Wednesday when
prices plunged by Dollars 138 a tonne on the London Commodity Exchange. The
price fall intensified on Thursday when the market lost Dollars 175 a tonne
in nervous trading.
Coffee prices began to stabilise on Friday, however. Prices remained
extremely volatile and the London market lost Dollars 30 a tonne to close at
Dollars 2,004. Analysts point out that coffee stocks remain tight.
Soyabean futures prices in Chicago tumbled by over 60 cents on news of rainy
weather. This nervousness was evident across the soft commodity markets with
cocoa losing Pounds 73 a tonne after hitting a 6-year high at the start of
the week. It closed on Friday at Pounds 993 a tonne - Pounds 17 a tonne
lower than Thursday.
Copper prices also fell victim to the mid-week sell-off. But a
bigger-than-expected fall in London Metal Exchange copper stocks yesterday
sparked trade buying and metal for delivery in three months ended last night
at Dollars 2,264.50 a tonne, up Dollars 35 on the week.
Attention on the LME switched to zinc and tin yesterday after
Metallgesellschaft, the financially-troubled metals group, announced it
would cut production at Ruhr-Zink's Datteln zinc smelter from 200,000 tonnes
a year to 90,000 tonnes. The Berzelius 10,000-tonne a year tin smelter at
Duisberg will close.
Analysts pointed out that the proposed zinc cut was only one-third of that
needed to bring European supply and demand into balance. Exports from China,
Russia and North Korea were adding to western over-supply. Mr Angus
MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said MG's move would merely
slow the rate at which LME stocks of zinc were increasing.
Nevertheless, three-month zinc was carried up with copper and closed last
night on the LME at Dollars 986.50 a tonne, up Dollars 15.25 on the day but
down Dollars 30 over the week.
Analysts suggested that the Duisberg closure was only marginally supportive
for tin prices. One said that annual output from the plant was way below
capacity - less than 4,000 tonnes - so the closure would not have a
substantial impact on the tin market's growing oversupply. However, three
month tin was also caught up in the metals rise and closed at Dollars
5,662.50 a tonne, up Dollars 67.50 on the day and Dollars 40 from a week
ago.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: More cost cuts at
Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft's German base metals operations yesterday joined the
growing lists of sacrifices being made to salvage the battered metals,
mining and engineering group.
A tin plant is to be shut, along with a zinc alloy works, while zinc
production at MG's Ruhr-Zink smeltery in Datteln is to be more than halved
to 90,000 tonnes a year.
The measures will cost around 500 jobs, the group said yesterday, indicating
further payroll cuts to come soon with an announcement that restructuring
measures were under way in lead smelting. Earlier this month MG said it
planned to reduce its total workforce by 7,500, saving DM550m (Dollars
329.3m) a year.
The group, which made a loss last year of some DM2bn, also said it had
bought a further 24.2 per cent ofthe London metals trading business,
Metallgesellschaft Ltd, from MIM Holdings of Australia.
No price was disclosed for the deal which raised MG's stake in the London
Metal Exchange business to 86 per cent.
Yesterday's statements, following the disclosure earlier this week of the
sale of prime assets to help cover freshly-discovered risks in the US oil
market, confirms that the promised shake-out at MG is well in hand.
Earlier disposals included a 49 per cent stake in vehicle components
supplier Kolbenschmidt, and a small holding in Methanex, a Canadian methanol
maker.
In the light of European over-capacity, low profitability and the added
burdens of Germany's tough environmental laws, action on the domestic base
metals business had been expected.
However, the sale of the Buderus heating business, MG's headquarters in
Frankfurt and the Lenkhering Montan Transport company, came as a surprise.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the renowned company doctor shipped in by the banking
consortium responsible for a DM3.4bn package which saved MG from the brink
of collapse earlier this year, had previously insisted they were 'not for
sale."
The group has not stated the extent of the fresh risks uncovered in the US
oil business. However, its 80 per cent holding in Buderus, the real estate
and transport companies are estimated to be worth almost DM2bn.
Buderus, a high-profile brand, is benefiting from a continuing domestic
construction boom. The company's offices occupy a prime, historic site in
the heart of Frankfurt's business district.
Although many more of MG's 250-plus subsidiaries are likely to go, progress
so far suggests Mr Neukirchen is focusing manufacturing operations on
environmental technology and engineering.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sharp bucks the gloomy trend in
electronics
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, yesterday broke the gloomy
trend of its domestic competitors and reported an earnings recovery for last
year.
It cited cost cuts across the board and a rise in sales of electronic
components - where Sharp is the industry's leading maker of liquid crystal
displays - as reasons for its 1.8 per cent rise in parent company pre-tax
profits.
Taxable profits rose to Y45.3bn (Dollars 431.4m) in the year to March, from
Y44.5bn in 1992, when they had fallen 37 per cent. Turnover last year rose
by 1.5 per cent to Y1,170bn, due to a 20 per cent increase in sales of
components, which represented 30.5 per cent of Sharp's total sales, its
biggest business area.
It forecasts a 26 per cent rise in taxable profits this year, on sales up 5
per cent to Y1,230bn, on the strength of new products and stronger
marketing.
Sharp expects no help from the Japanese economy, where it believes political
instability is delaying measures to combat the recession and providing a
drag on private sector investment. It is tentatively planning on 0.4 per
cent growth in Japanese gross national product this year, but company
officials warn this could prove over-optimistic.
Last year's turnover declined in all divisions except for components,
reflecting the continued sluggishness in Japanese consumer spending and the
impact of the yen's strength on export revenues, nearly half the total.
Sharp, meanwhile, is ploughing cash into strengthening its liquid crystal
display production.
A smaller electronics industry recovery appeared yesterday in the shape of a
turnround from Oki Electric Industry, the leading communications equipment
producer. Oki made a pre-tax profit of Y3.88bn last year, after a Y38.33bn
loss in 1992, on turnover up by 0.4 per cent over the same period, to
Y565.5bn.

for year

<TEXT>
Puma, the sports shoe maker plagued by poor results in recent years,
yesterday said it would make a 'significant' profit this year following
first quarter earnings of DM11.5m, (Dollars 6.8m) against a DM11.8m loss a
year ago.
'We have completed trenchant and some cases drastic changes,' said Mr Jochen
Zeitz, chief executive. '(We have) reached our goal of working profitably
again a year faster than planned.'
Mr Zeitz aged only 30, took over at Puma exactly a year ago. It was an
appointment that raised eyebrows in Germany's often staid corporate
environment.
He said the company had reduced senior management, merged certain production
stages and focused on products in mid and upper prices ranges. Puma
Classics, a sports shoe first made by Puma in the 1970s and which has now
been relaunched, were selling especially well in the US, Mr Zeitz said.
Apart from a profit of DM497,000 in 1991, the company had made a loss every
year since 1986 culminating in a loss of DM68.8m last year. As part of the
restructuring Puma shed 69 per cent of its workforce in 1993, leaving it
with 1,081 employees.
Turnover in the 1994 first quarter was DM117.1m, compared with DM117.9m in
the same period last year. However, Mr Zeitz said turnover would fall this
year as Puma scaled back its loss-making discounted products.
Puma closed its last German factory last year and about 90 per cent of its
sports shoes are now made at low-cost sites in Asia.
The company is 82 per cent owned by Aritmos, the Swedish group.
Rheinmetall Berlin, the German engineering and defence group, made a net
loss of DM39.8m for 1993, against a profit of DM20.2m a year earlier, Reuter
reports. The dividend is going down from DM8.50 a share to DM7.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Digital's finance chief resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment's chief financial officer has resigned as the embattled
computer company prepares for a broad restructuring to include about 20,000
job cuts.
Mr William Steul, who has been chief financial officer since June 1992, is
the second senior Digital executive to resign since the company reported far
bigger than expected quarterly losses of Dollars 183m last month. Mr Edward
Lucente, head of worldwide sales, also resigned unexpectedly.
Digital said Mr Steul will be succeeded by Mr Vincent Mullarkey, Digital's
controller since 1992 and who has long-standing ties to Mr Robert Palmer,
Digital's chief executive.
Mr Mullarkey's appointment 'is one of an ongoing series of steps we are
taking to strengthen our management team,' said Mr Palmer, suggesting that
further management changes may be planned.
'Digital is making steady progress toward the resumption of sustained
profitability,' Mr Palmer said, 'the appointment accelerating that
progress.'
Prior to his latest position as controller, Mr Mullarkey had held a
financial management position in Digital's semiconductor operations, which
were headed by Mr Palmer before he was appointed chief executive in 1992.
Mr Mullarkey's first task will be to develop restructuring plans which the
company has said will be completed by the end of the fiscal year, in June.
These plans are expected to include proposals to sell portions of the
company's operations, as well as extensive workforce reductions.
Analysts expect Digital to take a charge against earnings of about to
Dollars 1bn to pay for cutbacks and lay-offs.
In a further management change, Digital announced yesterday that Mr Bernhard
Auer, manager of the company's European personal computer operations, has
been promoted to take charge of the PC business world wide.
He succeeds Mr Enrico Pesatori, who recently assumed additional
responsibilities for all of Digital's computer operations and worldwide
sales and marketing, following the resignation of Mr Lucente.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Novell ahead of expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novell, the leading computer networking software company, reported
higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings, boosted by the sale of a
software licence to Sun Microsystems.
Net income for the quarter (ended April) grew 30 per cent to Dollars 105m,
or 33 cents a share, up from Dollars 80m, or 26 cents a year earlier.
Revenues increased 45 per cent to Dollars 407m.
The results included a one-time gain of Dollars 81m from the sales of a
licence to UNIX technology to Sun Micro-systems and associated expenses to
Novell of Dollars 35m.
Excluding this transaction, net revenue for the second quarter was up 16 per
cent, and net earnings declined by per cent to Dollars 75m or 24 cents a
share.
Mr Robert Frankenberg, Novell's president and chief executive, said: 'Novell
has weathered the difficult year-over-year financial comparisons that
followed major investments in technology in the second half of 1993.
'The company is now positioned for more favourable comparisons during the
last half of fiscal 1994.'
Half of net revenue during the second quarter was from the US, excluding the
effect of the UNIX technology royalty. Revenue from the US grew by 9 per
cent, from Europe by 13 per cent, Asia Pacific 52 per cent and Latin America
72 per cent.
Together the rapidly growing markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America now
represent over 20 per cent of total revenue.
For the first six months revenue was Dollars 718m, up 33 per cent. Net
income increased 17 per cent to Dollars 178m, or 57 cents per share. At the
end of April, cash and short term investments stood at Dollars 930m.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank to sell stake in
Holzmann
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank and a holder of substantial stakes in
dozens of other companies, is planning to dispose of its blocking minority
in the Philipp Holzmann construction group.
According to Mr Lothar Mayer, Holzmann chairman, the bank diluted its stake
last year from 27.3 per cent to 25.3 per cent by not participating in a
rights issue.
In the long-term, it wanted to withdraw completely within a time-span to be
agreed with the Holzmann board, Mr Mayer said.
His comments, following predictions this week from Mr Edzard Reuter,
Daimler-Benz chairman, that Deutsche is to reduce its holding in Daimler,
adds weight to speculation that the bank's long-term strategy is to run down
its outside interests.
German banks' intricate networks of outside holdings and cross-holdings,
largely built up in the post-war economic reconstruction, have come under
increasing fire from small shareholders and activists who complain that
financial institutions have too much influence on industry.
Bank directors are commonly among the most prominent figures on the
supervisory boards which govern companies' investment policies.
Commenting on Thursday on Mr Reuter's forecast that Deutsche's Daimler stake
would be cut from 25 per cent to between 15 and 20 per cent within 10 years,
the bank said there were no immediate plans for changes. 'I would not like
to speculate over a period of 10 years,' a spokesman added.
The timing of Deutsche's withdrawal from Holzmann is likely to hinge on the
ownership of other important chunks of the group's stock.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rights issue and fears of
inquiry hit Mediobanca
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Shares in Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, fell again yesterday
to cast a deep shadow over the group's planned L1,500bn rights issue.
The shares have fallen almost 20 per cent since the issue was announced on
April 29 and following the disclosure that Ravenna magistrates are
considering a criminal investigation into the bank.
Official notice of an inquiry is expected to be sent to bank directors
within the next few days.
The magistrates are examining Mediobanca's role as adviser on the
restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison, the Italian industrial group which
collapsed last year, as part of a wider investigation of Ferruzzi finances.
In particular, they will probe allegations by Mr Carlo Sama, former chief
executive of Ferruzzi, that Mediobanca was aware last June of L400bn
(Dollars 251m) of undeclared bad debts to offshore companies, but did not
insist that these were disclosed in the Ferruzzi 1992 accounts.
Under Italian law, this is a criminal offence.
Mediobanca is co-operating with the magistrates, but is understood to regard
the alleged breach as a purely technical matter, that had no effect on the
subsequent restructuring of Ferruzzi's L31,000bn of debt.
When Mediobanca launched its rights issue, it said new shares would be
issued at a price of at least L15,000 each, against a market price at the
time of more than L18,500. But yesterday the shares slipped by a further 2
per cent to L15,290, perilously close to the floor set for the capital
increase.
Mediobanca's shareholders - dominated by a group of large former state-owned
banks and some of Italy's biggest companies - will meet to approve the
rights issue plan on June 13.
The possibility of a criminal investigation into the merchant bank is
fascinating the Italian media, because of the influence Mediobanca exerts
over the financial and industrial community. The bank's strategy is still
guided by Mr Enrico Cuccia, its honorary chairman, who is 86.
Mr Vittorio Vicini, the chief prosecutor in Ravenna, where the Ferruzzi
family is based, fuelled speculation on Thursday when he told journalists,
after meeting with Mediobanca's lawyer, that 'no sanctuary was inviolable'.
He said a decision on the case would be taken early next week.
Mediobanca has also come under attack for installing allies on the boards of
the two recently privatised banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito
Italiano.

Interest on advances dropped marginally to R10.17bn from R10.97bn as did
investment income, declining to R940.4m from R1.44bn. Operating income
improved to R4.82bn from R4.73bn.
Mr David Brink, chairman, said the results were disappointing but that the
overall quality of ABSA's book had improved and some market share in the
mortgage industry had been recovered.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the prestigious Paris jeweller, has been
clouded by uncertainty following reports that Chanel, the famous French
fashion house, may challenge LVMH, the powerful luxury goods group, by
bidding for the business.
Chanel, which like Van Cleef is one of the few prominent luxury houses still
in private hands, yesterday issued a denial following a report in Les Echos,
the French financial daily that estimated Van Cleef's value at between
FFr1.5bn (Dollars 260m) and FFr2bn.
However, Mr Alain Wertheimer, the secretive Swiss businessman who
masterminded Chanel's success in the 1980s, has recently been diversifying
away from fashion notably by buying a vineyard. Chanel, which has for years
been renowned for costume jewellery, last year opened its first 'real'
jeweller's in Paris.
By contrast, Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has made no secret of his
hopes of expanding into jewellery. LVMH is the world's largest luxury goods
group with a clutch of prestigious brands including Christian Dior perfume
and Louis Vuitton luggage. Jewellery is one of the few gaps in its
portfolio.
Mr Arnault is also on the hunt for acquisitions after significantly reducing
LVMH's debt by unraveling a cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the
UK drinks group. He is said by analysts to have considered bids for both Van
Cleef and Tiffany, the New York-based jewellery group: but to have opted for
the Paris-based business.
Van Cleef was founded in 1906 and is still controlled by the founding Arpels
family. It has recently been affected by the downturn in the luxury goods
market. Van Cleef has seen net profits fall to FFr25m in 1993 from FFr50m in
1990, with sales declining to FFr207m from FFr305m.
The acquisition of Van Cleef represents a rare opportunity for Mr Arnault to
buy a prominent name in jewellery. However, it would also bring him into
direct competition with Cartier, the French subsidiary of South Africa's
Richemont group, which is a formidable force in the jewellery field.
LVMH is also expected to try to acquire Van Cleef's fragrances from Elf
Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals company. Sanofi plans to sell some
fragrance brands to finance its proposed acquisition of part of Eastman
Kodak's pharmaceutical interests.
Sanofi said yesterday that it had not yet decided whether to sell the Van
Cleef perfumes, which made sales of around FFr430m last year.

<TEXT>
An Australian court ruled yesterday that Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texas-based
oil and gas producer, should be allowed to proceed with its ADollars 294m
(USDollars 211.5m) bid for Sydney's Bridge Oil. The ruling permits P&amp;P to
present its formal 'part A' takeover statement to Bridge shareholders.
After hearings this week in the New South Wales Supreme Court, Mr Justice
Windeyer determined that the bid was not invalid, although he also said the
bidder should issue a supplementary statement to accompany the 'part A'
documents.
Lawyers for the target company had argued that P&amp;P's takeover documents
should be scrapped and the offer redrafted.
The cash bid, the latest in a series of moves which have indicated a growing
interest on the part of US energy exploration groups in the Australian
market, is pitched at 70 cents a share. This has been firmly rejected by the
Bridge board.

FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Competition blamed for 56%
decline at NTT
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Increased price competition hurt profits at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
the Japanese telecommunications company, as three new companies entered the
long-distance telephone market.
The company posted a 56 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax earnings for
the year ended March to Y109.5bn (Dollars 1.04bn) on a 1.4 per cent fall in
sales to Y5,809.1bn.
Operating profits fell 41.2 per cent to Y230.2bn and after-tax profits
plunged 74.5 per cent to Y41.4bn.
NTT said revenues had fallen due to an average 21 per cent cut in
long-distance telephone call rates implemented last October to compete with
its three rivals - DDI, Japan Telecom, and Teleway Japan.
The dominance of NTT, a former state-owned company, has been eroded by the
cheap rates offered by the competitors.
Non-operational costs, including interest payments, fell 7.2 per cent due to
interest rates, while personnel costs declined due to the company's
restructuring programme.
On a consolidated level, the company also posted sluggish results. Pre-tax
profits fell 47.3 per cent to Y139.9bn on a 2.3 per cent rise in sales to
Y6,652.4bn. After-tax profits declined 70.2 per cent to Y49.9bn.
For the current year, NTT expects pre-tax profits to decline by a further 5
per cent to Y104bn on a 0.4 per cent dip in sales to Y5,784bn. On a
consolidated basis, the company forecasts flat pre-tax earnings growth at
Y140bn on a 1.4 per cent rise in sales to Y6,747bn.

decline 21.4%

<TEXT>
Fanuc, the world's largest maker of numerically controlled machine tools,
yesterday reported a 21.4 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the year
ended March.
The group, a bell-weather of Japanese industrial investment, attributed the
fall to a decline in demand caused by Japan's recession, but forecast stable
taxable profts in the current year.
Profits fell to Y22.99bn (Dollars 219m) in 1993, from Y29.23bn a year
earlier, a slowdown on 1992's 44 per cent profits fall. Fanuc estimates
pre-tax earnings will reach Y23bn in the current year.
Sales fell by 9.8 per cent to Y106.16bn last year and are forecast to rise
slightly to Y107bn this year.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Fever checks new issue flood: A look at a worrying case of
oversupply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be merely acute indigestion, but fears are mounting that the new
issue market is suffering from a killer bug.
The symptoms certainly worsened this week. Several large flotations were
pulled and with the stock market ailing fast many were predicting that the
infection would spread.
'The new issue market is virtually shut and companies which do not need the
money should do themselves, and everybody else, a favour and wait,' says an
adviser to one of the recent casualties.
However, the optimists, including advisers to 3i, argue that the problem is
localised.
The biggest cluster of casualties is in cable communications with two of the
biggest UK operators, TeleWest and General Cable, both postponing flotations
this week.
Most of the advisers involved with the sector believe it is a special case,
partly because cable companies are being sold on the basis of future profits
rather than current earnings. 'The postponements are a direct result of
market volatility. When share prices in general are unstable investors focus
on the present and are less likely to believe tomorrow stories,' said one
investment banker.
He believes that UK institutions were also worried that US investors, who
are much more familiar with the cable industry, would shun the issues. 'I
don't think they were right but it is true that in nervous times US
investors tend to stay at home.'
A rival banker believes the resistance encountered by the cable companies
was only to be expected. 'Experience shows that when markets are off colour
investors want good plain cooking, not fancy food like cable.'
The fact that most UK fund managers know little about cable also counted
against them. One weary fund manager admits: 'We've ploughed through so many
prospectuses over the past few months that the last thing you need is
getting you mind round a whole new market. At least we all know what 3i is
about.'
All involved with the cable companies insist that they will return to the
market. 'We will be back as soon as the market is in a better mood but I
don't know whether that will be in 6 weeks or 18 months,' says a sponsor.
The other sector looking sickly is property, where several recent issues
have been scaled back significantly and the flotation of London Capital
Holdings pulled.
But the picture is patchy. Last week also saw the pricing of shares in
Argent, a property investor and developer, which were confidently pitched at
a discount of only 5 per cent to net asset value. One broker, not involved
with Argent said: 'That pricing demonstrates there is still demand for good
companies, even in sectors like property where there have been a lot of
floats.'
Argent is valued at Pounds 140m and there is general agreement that it is
smaller flotations that are particularly vulnerable to the market's malaise.
'If you are floating a company which is a major force in its market,
institutions which have holdings in that sector are bound to look at it. The
tiddlers they can afford to ignore,' said one adviser.
Such an argument bodes well for 3i. 'If you are interested in unquoted
company funds at all you are very unlikely to turn down 3i.'
Yet even the best quality floats are meeting resistance from some fund
managers. According to Mr David Barclay, deputy managing director of
corporate finance at NatWest Markets, one institution has declared that it
will not look at any flotations in June.
Another corporate broker says: 'The best thing sponsors could do is to give
investors a summer holiday and come back in the autumn when there is more
cash in the kitty.'
In spite of the heavy calls on institutional cash flow over the past year
the main major investors are not short of money. 'The problem is that funds
allocated for small companies have been exhausted by all the flotations,'
says a smaller companies analyst.
Ironically, one of the flotations postponed last week was Murray Johnstone's
Acorn Turst, an investment trust which planned to raise Pounds 60m to invest
in small quoted companies and some venture capital projects.
The disappointing response from institutions was blamed partly on the past
glut of new trust launches and on 3i's flotation.
This week also saw a number of profit warnings from recently floated
companies which underlined worries about the general quality of the current
crop.
Says one broker: 'We are near the end of the cycle, and though there are
obvious exceptions, we have already had most of the cream.'
He believes City advisers need to weed out some of the weaker hopefuls on
their books. 'Otherwise there is a risk we could kill off the market
completely. In its current state, it would not take much.'

Dixon Motors, the car dealer which came to the USM last year after reversing

rights issue of 3.94m shares at 180p apiece.
The proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings and provide additional

The company has also applied to the Stock Exchange for an official listing.
The existing ordinary shares will continue to be traded on the USM until

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Greggs pays ABF Pounds 19m for bakery
outlets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greggs, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based bakery chain, almost doubled in size
yesterday with the Pounds 18.95m purchase of Associated British Foods'
retail bakery outlets.
The cash deal comprises 424 shops, mostly operating as Baker's Oven, and two
manufacturing bakeries - one in Newcastle upon Tyne and another in
Twickenham.
Shares in Greggs rose 12p to close at 805p yesterday. ABF shares were down
12p at 543p.
Greggs opened its 500th shop in January. Announcing 1993 profits of Pounds
9m on turnover of Pounds 110.4m in March, Mr Mike Darrington, managing
director, was already claiming to run the biggest and most profitable retail
bakery company in Britain.
The group is not planning to close any branches. The deal takes the employee
total from 6,000 to more than 11,000.
Mr Darrington said the deal marked an important strategic move for the
company, whose shops have been concentrated mainly in the north of England.
The ABF shops are mainly in the south-east.
He pointed out that 78 of the shops were freehold or long leasehold. In
addition, there were 169 with in-store bakeries, providing good
opportunities for expansion.
The deal will be paid for with the group's own cash resources and
borrowings. At the end of its financial year on January 1 Greggs had net
cash of Pounds 12.1m.
Allied Bakeries, ABF's bakery arm, said the deal would reduce its Pounds
100m turnover by about 20 per cent and the number of employees by 40 per
cent. Allied Bakeries has about 35 per cent of the bakery market for
supermarkets and grocery chains.
Mr Garry Weston, ABF chairman, said the wide geographic spread of the retail
operations had required an increasingly uneconomic daily delivery of fresh
bakery products. Baker's Oven shops had achieved 'only modest levels of
profit contribution' because of the competitive conditions.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Fine Foods back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted biscuit and cake group, returned to
the black for the year to end March, but is not resuming dividend payments.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 211,522 compared with a previous deficit of Pounds
5.66m. Turnover fell from Pounds 21m to Pounds 15.9m, although the
comparative figure included Pounds 7.4m from Lees, the confectionery and
chocolate maker sold at the beginning of last year.
The 1992-93 deficit included Pounds 3.7m on the disposal of Lees and a loss
of Pounds 584,193 on continuing activities.
Last month NFF acquired Jesse Oldfield, a Manchester-based cake
manufacturer, for a maximum Pounds 2.56m. The acquisition is expected to
bring a further Pounds 8m of turnover this year.
Mr Henry Roberts, chief executive, said the management had been able to
focus its attention on biscuits and cakes since the disposal of Lees. He
described the group's new structure as 'well balanced' with each of its
three divisions producing about Pounds 8m of turnover.
The Gateshead factory, which makes both own-label and branded biscuits for
the supermarkets, returned to operating profits on the back of a 10 per cent
sales increase. The group's own Dunkers biscuits, launched last summer, had
achieved Pounds 1m of sales in the first year. Launch costs of Pounds
400,000 had been written off against profits. Sales of a chocolate version
begin next month.
The Huddersfield-based distribution arm, known as Biscuits for the
Connoisseur, increased sales by 19 per cent and gave 'a very satisfactory
performance in terms of profit and cash generation.'
The balance sheet shows net current assets of Pounds 541,000 compared to
previous net liabilities of Pounds 3.08m. The improvement follows last
August's Pounds 785,000 rights issue and the conversion of Pounds 2.5m of
borrowings to a term loan.
Net interest paid fell from Pounds 660,847 to Pounds 302,659, giving gearing
of 85 per cent. Earnings per share of 0.56p compared with previous losses of
14.41p.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Boots sells Farleys baby foods to Heinz for
Pounds 94m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, is selling its Farleys baby
food group and its adult nutrition business to HJ Heinz, the US grocery
products group, for Pounds 94m.
The sale includes Pounds 20.7m of net assets, and brands such as Farleys
baby milk and rusks, Timers baby cereals, and the slimming products Complan,
Casilan and Crunch 'n' Slim.
Farleys sales totalled Pounds 53.3m in the year ended March 1993 - about one
third of the total sales of its parent division Boots Healthcare
International - with 70 per cent of those in the UK.
Other important markets are the Republic of Ireland, Pakistan, New Zealand
and east Asia.
Boots said that Farleys, which it acquired in 1986, was a strong business
but did not fit in with its strategy of developing the core over-the-counter
drugs business of Boots Healthcare International, by concentrating on the
four OTC categories of cough and cold remedies, pain relief, eye care, and
skin care.
The proceeds would be used to expand BHI, which was planning more
acquisitions. It purchased two French and Italian healthcare companies, La
Societe Francaise du Triclocarban, and Marco Viti, for Pounds 14.5m last
year.
'We are being fairly aggressive in terms of developing BHI into a
fully-fledged pan-European business', Boots said.
For Heinz, the purchase is expected to increase its worldwide baby food
sales by 15 per cent to about Dollars 750m (Pounds 500m) and make it the
UK's biggest supplier of baby food.
It said Farleys' range, comprising mainly 'dry' foods such as rusks and
cereals, would complement its own range of mainly 'wet' foods in jars and
tins. Heinz is taking on all 450 staff at Farleys, which has factories in
Kendal, Cumbria, and in Karachi, Pakistan.
Mr Andrew Barrett, managing director of HJ Heinz UK, said the acquisition
represented a 'significant opportunity to develop further our overseas
business and, specifically, to build towards our goal - to be a leading
player in baby feeding in Europe.'
Analysts welcomed the deal, saying the price of Pounds 94m was a fair one,
but Boots shares closed down 15p at 509p in a weak market.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Liffe seeks Pounds 10m via rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, hopes to raise up to
Pounds 10m through a rights issue which it says is primarily aimed at
addressing the demand for trading permits.
Liffe plans to issue 'quarter-shares' by way of a bonus which may be
converted into full A,B,C or E shares on a 4-for-1 basis. A share in Liffe
entitles the holder to a permit which allows them to trade specific
products.
Holders of A shares can trade in all futures, B shares in all financial
options, C shares in all futures except long gilt and short sterling
contracts, D shares in all equity options, and E shares in all futures
except long gilt, short sterling, bund and Euro-mark contracts.
Liffe said the issue would provide for a 25 per cent increase in each
relevant category of trading permit. The amounts payable on conversion are:
Pounds 50,000 for A shares, Pounds 25,000 for B and C shares and Pounds
6,250 for E shares.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the issue would overcome the
potential constraints on the further development of futures and financial
options business on Liffe.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: London City bids for Towles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towles, the lossmaking clothing manufacturer, was the subject of a Pounds
4.22m cash bid yesterday from London City, an Australian investment group,
which has 51 per cent of the shares but only 14 per cent of the votes.
London City, which has been a shareholder since 1987, said it was 'outraged'
at Towles' continuing losses. Mr Peter Murray, chairman of London City,
said: 'We fear for the value of our own investment and have no alternative
but to make an offer.'
The offers, which were announced after the market closed, are 265p cash for
each ordinary share, 115p cash for each A ordinary share, 52p for each A
preference share and 78p for each B preference share. These represent a
premium over the last recorded market prices.
This week Towles reported losses up from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 236,000
for the year to February 28 on turnover of Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 16.2m).
London City said it planned to introduce 'new and experienced senior textile
management' if the offers are successful.
There was no response from Towles which was closed for its spring holiday.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: 3i's net assets improve 39% to Pounds
1.85bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i's results, issued with the pathfinder prospectus yesterday, revealed a 39
per cent increase in net assets to Pounds 1.85bn.
The figure demonstrated the improvement in the health of the unquoted
companies in 3i's portfolio, said Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive.
The results for the year to end-March 1994 were flattered by the release of
a Pounds 152m provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation, which
will no longer be needed because 3i will have exemption from capital gains
tax once it floats as an investment trust. Without this write-back, net
assets increased by 27.7 per cent and a 30.3 per cent return on
shareholders' funds.
3i's total return - from all forms of interest fees and capital gains - was
Pounds 555m, compared with Pounds 88m the previous year. By far the largest
element of this increase came from the Pounds 210m increase in the
unrealised value of the portfolio.
3i said the growth in value of the portfolio resulted from an 'improvement
in the profitability of underlying investee businesses, certain investments
being valued in excess of their costs for the first time and higher price
earnings multiples of comparable listed companies'.
Of this, about Pounds 100m referred to investments being valued in excess of
cost for the first time. Another Pounds 101m of the increase in total return
was the result of a sharp decrease in provisions - from Pounds 170.9m to
Pounds 38.8m - and an increase in profits on investments realised during the
year. Revenue profits before tax increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 65.4m.
The group is paying the seven banks and the Bank of England, which together
own 3i, a dividend of Pounds 37.6m, up from Pounds 26.8m.
As part of the flotation, 3i is restructuring via a tax-efficient rights
issue and special dividend to existing shareholders. The group will pay a
special Pounds 290m dividend which will be funded from a rights issue to the
existing shareholders that will raise exactly the same amount.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NatWest interest in TSB Bank purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank said yesterday that it had expressed interest in
buying TSB Bank, the fifth biggest Irish bank. TSB trustees have discussed a
merger with National Irish Bank, a subsidiary of National Australia Bank.
NatWest is thought likely to have to bid more than Pounds 100m for TSB if an
offer was allowed. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, has personally told
the Irish government that his bank would like to be allowed to bid for TSB
Bank.
NatWest said that it believed that it could reinforce its presence in
Ireland by buying TSB. It already owns the third largest Irish bank in
Ulster Bank, which is significantly smaller than Allied Irish Bank and Bank
of Ireland.
National Australia Bank has said that it is in discussions with the TSB
trustees and the Irish government over merging its subsidiary National Irish
Bank with TSB.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lamb's bleating disrupts HSBC meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual shareholders' meeting of HSBC Holdings, the parent company of
Midland Bank, was yesterday halted amid chaos as a student protestor
handcuffed herself to the chair occupied by Mr Keith Whitson, the bank's
chief executive.
The meeting was disrupted as Ms Catherine Muller, a Leeds University student
protesting at Midland policies on the environment and lending to less
developed countries, was carried out of the Barbican hall in London.
Guards had to cut another student, Mr Chris Dunham, free from a microphone
cable next to Sir William Purves, HSBC's chairman, and pull him from the
stage along with others. The meeting resumed after being halted for 10
minutes.
The protest was staged by a group called Lloyds and Midland Boycott (Lamb),
which has organised one of the most vociferous bank boycotts since protests
against Barclays' presence in South Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s.
The disruption came after Sir William, who was questioned fiercely by Lamb
members who had bought HSBC shares, insisted that he had personally refused
some loans because he believed that the projects could damage the
environment.
Sir William said his four children 'leave me in no doubt about the
importance of the environment . . . the world's environment has been
severely damaged and continues to be, and we take a keen interest in such
affairs'.
One protestor said Midland was implicated in deaths in less developed
countries because of its failure to 'forgive' all debt there. Sir William
said he hoped HSBC 'played no part at all in deaths in any country'.
Lamb activists said afterwards they intended to focus their boycott on
Midland because they had been given verbal assurances by Lloyds executives
who they met after disrupting that bank's annual meeting last month.
Mr Simon Lewis, a protestor who was carried out, said afterwards that a poll
undertaken by Lamb had found that students in Manchester were switching
accounts from Midland.
Midland said that the number of new student accounts opened with the bank
last year had risen by 40 per cent. It said the bank had raised its market
share of new student accounts from just under 20 per cent to 23 per cent in
1993.
Sir William said pre-tax profits improved in the first quarter 'despite
difficult trading conditions in the bond markets'.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: CPL rises 30% to Pounds 1.44m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CPL, the fragrance and flavour manufacturing company that is coming to the
market, yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus and reported a 30 per
cent increase in profits for the year to end March.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.44m on turnover of Pounds
17.3m (Pounds 14.7m).
The company, which claims its products are used as ingredients in products
found in most homes, is aiming to raise up to Pounds 5m net of expenses
through a placing with institutions. It is expecting a market capitalisation
of up to Pounds 20m.
The family of Mr Terry Pickthall, chairman and founder, owns 57 per cent of
the company, and is expected to retain around 40 per cent after the listing.
The pathfinder shows that the directors expect to invest at least Pounds 2m
of the proceeds in a project to develop a manufacturing plant to produce
aroma chemicals. The acquisition is conditional on the listing.
The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital.
The company owns two manufacturing sites in the UK, together with one in
Hong Kong and one in India. Customers include many multinational and
well-known national companies in more than 80 countries. Overseas sales
account for 57 per cent of turnover.
Impact day is expected towards the end of June. Credit Lyonnais is sponsor
to the issue.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Thorn sells majority stake in security arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI yesterday announced the disposal of a majority stake in its
lossmaking security business for Pounds 38.6m, and said it was in
discussions regarding the sale of part of its electronics division.
The music and rentals group is selling 60 per cent of Thorn Security to its
management in a deal backed by Hambro European Ventures, the venture capital
company.
Some Pounds 11m of the sale price will be paid with interest to Thorn
between 1998 and 2000.
The disposal was widely expected following comments from Sir Colin
Southgate, Thorn's chairman, earlier this week that a sale was imminent. The
group will book a post-tax exceptional gain of about Pounds 1m, before the
Pounds 16m goodwill write-off.
Thorn EMI has reserved the right to increase its holding by 2.5 per cent in
the event of a trade sale or flotation. It is likely the company will seek a
listing in 1995.
The security division, which pre-dates the Thorn merger with EMI in 1979,
has been pegged a non-core business for several years.
In the year to March 31, Thorn Security incurred a Pounds 3.5m operating
loss on sales of Pounds 160m. Before restructuring charges, the division was
marginally profitable.
The management has invested Pounds 500,000 in return for an unspecified
stake. Mr Allan Hendry, Thorn Security's technical director, said the main
difficulties had now been dealt with.
The group, which claims a market share averaging 20 per cent in its UK
businesses, expected to expand in east Asia and the US.
Thorn EMI's decision to retain a 40 per cent stake is in character with many
of its disposals in recent years.
It retained an 8 per cent stake in Kenwood, sold in September 1989, 20 per
cent in Thorn EMI Software, disposed of in 1991, and 12 per cent in Thorn
Lighting, which was shed in 1993.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Seeking gain beyond venture - Richard
Gourlay witnesses the fanfare as 3i steps into the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unperturbed by the sharp fall in the equity markets, 3i, the UK's largest
investor in unquoted companies, yesterday launched with great fanfare its
long-awaited pathfinder prospectus ahead of flotation next month.
With an anticipated market capitalisation of about Pounds 1.6bn, 3i will be
the largest new issue this year, unless the government acts quickly on the
sale of part of the Post Office.
The 45-year old institution will also emerge abruptly from the relative
seclusion of the venture capital world, where it is very well known, and
into the glare of publicity reserved for companies in, or on the fringes of,
the FT-SE 100 Index.
The attractions of 3i as an investment will depend to some extent on the
pricing of the issue on June 22, and the state of the decidedly edgy stock
market.
But 3i, which has helped float over 800 companies, is likely to attract more
interest in the venture capital industry from institutional and private
investors than it has ever seen before.
For the seven high-street banks and the Bank of England, which set up 3i to
provide equity to smaller companies, there are a number of benefits. After
an embarrassing about-turn 14 months ago when 3i's last attempt to float was
pulled, the banks will be able to realise some of their investment and hold
the balance in a more liquid form.
And by turning the group into an investment trust, the shareholders will be
able to shelter the capital gains 3i is confident will continue to flow as
the small companies in its portfolio continue to benefit from economic
recovery.
For investors, 3i offers an entirely new way of investing in European
economic recovery. Until now, private investors have had relatively few
opportunities to invest in small and medium sized companies. Shares in some
of the listed venture capital investment trusts are relatively illiquid and
high-risk, because their funds are invested in a small number of companies.
3i is wholly different. Since it was set up to provide long-term finance to
private companies, it has grown to dominate the British venture and
investment capital scene.
By the end of 1993, it had investments in 3,400 smaller companies with a
valuation of Pounds 3bn. It does about 500 smallish deals a year, where many
of its competitors would typically do 10 larger deals; it has 18 regional
offices, double the number of its nearest competitor and is rolling out the
formula to the continent though five offices focused on providing management
buy-out and buy-in finance.
'Most fund managers know the small cap venture capital funds,' says Mr Ewen
Macpherson, chief executive. 'But most find it difficult to grasp our size.
It is a different game to the venture capital boutiques.'
Mr Macpherson says 3i, which is not raising any money through the float,
will not alter how it positions itself in the market. It focuses on
companies with sales of Pounds 1m to Pounds 100m employing typically 15 to
500 people.
Nor will 3i change its approach to customers. It says it gains a strong
competitive advantage by leaving the decision when to float or sell the
companies in which it invests entirely to their managements. Many venture
capital funds with limited lives are more interventionist.
3i argues this approach has born fruit in terms of investment returns.
More recently, there have also been developments that suggest 3i may be
casting off its reputation of being a slow and old-fashioned institution.
Early this year, in a departure from tradition, 3i began raising funds from
other institutions which it will invest and manage. The first was a Ecu300m
fund for co-investment in continental European management buy-outs and
buy-ins. The second was a Pounds 150m fund for co-investment in UK buy-outs
larger than Pounds 10m - the latter allowing it to reduce the number of
deals it has had to syndicate to competitor venture capital groups. 3i will
generate fees from the management of the first fund.
3i's move into raising funds will increase the pressure on other venture
capital groups raising funds. But 3i has also ruffled feathers by
undertaking not to take management fees from institutions investing in the
UK fund. Instead it will take a 'share in the performance' of the
investments when they float or are sold.
Another sign of a slicker operation is 3i's cost-cutting. Since 1989, it has
withdrawn from areas in which it had no distinctive competence - like the
US, consultancy and property investment - cutting staff numbers from 944 to
566.
The listing of such a large investor as 3i might have been greeted as
unwelcome news to the existing venture capital trusts and independent funds.
Mr Hugh Mumford, chief executive of Electra, the investment trust that looks
most similar to 3i, welcomes the move as an opportunity for more investors
to learn about investing in private companies.
Ironically, too, 3i can gain some comfort from the fall in equities - so
long as it does not continue too long. After yesterday's fall, 3i is more
likely to go straight into the FT-SE 100, immediately increasing the demand
for its shares from institutions that try to match the index.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis acquires hotel chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jarvis Hotels is paying Pounds 43.5m for 20 hotels and two restaurants from
the collapsed Resort Hotels group, and is planning a flotation for the
enlarged company during 1995.
Mr John Jarvis, who founded the company in 1990 and was formerly chairman of
Ladbrokes' Hilton Hotel chain, said: 'The acquisition makes us the largest
private hotel company in the country'.
The sales were expected. Resort had been recently delisted from the Stock
Exchange with a negative net worth of Pounds 23m, after it suffered a Pounds
71m loss in the year to April 1993 from property write-downs and provisions.
The sales enable Resort to free itself from bank debts, and pay off some
trade creditors.
Shareholders will be compensated through a total of Pounds 2m of vouchers -
around 3p per share - to be spent in Jarvis' hotels. But they will retain
shares in what is effectively a worthless shell company.
After the acquisition Jarvis will own 61 hotels, and manage a further nine.
The hotels made an Pounds 18.5m profit in the year to March, and in spite of
recession, the company has increased profitability every year since it was
formed from the Pounds 186m purchase of Allied-Lyons' Embassy chain.
Jarvis originally planned a reverse takeover of Resort, which would have
provided a ready-made shareholder base, and facilitated flotation. However,
the amount and quality of Resort's debt made this unfeasible.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue and Portals discontinue bid talks
 -Close relationship expected to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De La Rue, the banknote printer, and Portals, the security and specialist
paper maker, yesterday ended merger talks saying they had been 'unable to
reach agreement on the terms of an offer'.
The announcement that negotiations had been 'terminated' sent Portal's share
price tumbling to close 112p lower at 653p, eliminating most of the gains
made since the talks were revealed two weeks ago.
Shares in De La Rue closed 14p higher at 843p. De La Rue is expected to
reveal strong profit growth and a further increase in its cash reserves,
perhaps to around Pounds 250m, when its full year results are announced on
Tuesday.
In their brief joint statement yesterday the two companies said they had
'long enjoyed an exceptionally close commercial relationship, which is
expected to continue'.
They added that 'when suitable opportunities exist, they expect to
collaborate, for mutual benefit'. On the basis of this relationship De la
Rue said it has 'no present intention of making an offer for Portals without
the recommendation of the Portal's board'.
The statement ended uncertainty surrounding the discussions, which are
understood to have begun some time ago on a friendly basis and to have been
initiated by De La Rue.
Portals' shares jumped two weeks ago when the group was forced by market
rumours to confirm that it had received an unsolicited approach from an
unidentified suitor which might lead to a bid.
A few days later De La Rue, one of Portals' largest customers, confirmed
that it was the unidentified potential bidder. The banknote printer is
understood to have been keen to acquire Portal's technology and acknowledged
expertise in developing banknote security features.
Although the two companies hold regular discussions about commercial issues,
including security features, news of the talks came as a surprise to
analysts, who immediately expressed doubts about the industrial logic of a
takeover.
In particular they voiced concerns that Portals' other customers would balk
at purchasing paper supplies from a company owned by a rival.
In addition they argued that if De La Rue took all of Portals' paper
production it would lose the flexibility to pick and choose its suppliers.
Analysts also calculated that De La Rue might have to pay up to Pounds 10 a
share - or about Pounds 650m - to win endorsement from Portals' board. Such
a figure was clearly more than De La Rue was prepared to spend.
In any event, negotiations between the two companies appear to have soured
over the past few weeks after news of the discussions leaked out and
allegations of 'mud-slinging' began to circulate.
The announcement therefore that the two companies had abandoned negotiations
is expected to be greeted with relief by the Portals management and a degree
of satisfaction by the City.
Indeed the negotiations may have served to throw a spotlight on Portals'
niche security and specialist paper making business which was once viewed as
'slow but steady', but more recently has been growing at between 4 and 5 per
cent a year in real terms.
The outcome appears less satisfactory for De La Rue which has quadrupled its
profits since Mr Jeremy Marshall, the ex-Hanson man, became chief executive
in 1989 following a tough programme of disposals and efficiency
improvements. Mr Marshall will now have to consider other options for his
growing cash pile.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Myddelton's view (Letters, May 23) that there is no virtue in
companies retaining profits if they cannot invest the funds profitably is
typical of the finance/accountant approach which has destroyed British
industry.
US President Bill Clinton, unveiling his new federal technology policy, has
left his country in no doubt that the challenges that lie ahead can only be
met by advanced technology based on innovation and R&amp;D investment.
'Investing in technology is investing in America's future.'
When will the British come to realise that manufacturing companies must be
freed from control by short-sighted lawyers, financiers and accountants in
favour of broadly based engineers with the drive, vision and capability
required to secure the future?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STUART ETHERINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate about civil rights legislation for disabled people has moved
to the point where it is not a question of if the bill will be passed, but
what kind of bill will enter into British law.
The business community has nothing to fear from civil rights legislation for
Britain's disabled people. In the US, the Americans with Disabilities Act,
passed two years ago, is seen as pro-business - enabling businesses to
access new markets, and opening new opportunities, and turning millions of
tax-users into tax-payers.
When Jack Ashley reintroduces the disabled persons civil rights bill into
the House of Lords on June 22, the business community, the government and
disabled people, together with their organisations, should come together to
discuss new and imaginative ways of making the act work - such as providing
tax incentives for smaller businesses.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Hunters harpooned: The whales might finally be saved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the International Whaling Commission to set up a sanctuary
around Antarctica is being hailed as a victory for the green movement's
whale diplomacy.
'This is the end of deep-sea whale hunting,' said Gordon Shepherd of the
World Wide Fund for Nature. 'The Japanese whale industry is dead.' The
sanctuary, to be monitored bu Australia, would link up with an existing safe
area in the Indian Ocean, to protect about 80 per cent of the world's
surviving whales, and indefinitely put off-limits some 750,000 minke whales
that Japan says are legitimate commercial targets.
At the annual commission meeting in Puerta Vallarta, Mexico, attended by
representatives from the industrialised world and international
environmental groups, Japan was the only country to vote against the
sanctuary, with Norway, which does not hunt in the Antarctic, refusing to
vote. Japan is now threatening to withdraw from the commission, which in
principle would allow it to resume hunting.
The triumph of the environmentalists is partly symbolic, since commercial
whaling is prohibited under a moratorium in effect for eight years. While
the commission is considering lifting the ban, most observers believe a
decision will not be made for years.
Nevertheless, the sanctuary is viewed by the greens as an essential safety
net, amid signs that the moratorium is 'leaking'. Norway has recently
resumed limited commercial minke whale hunting off its coastline in the
north-east Atlantic, while Japan kills about 300 minke whales a year in the
Antarctic for 'research' purposes - allowed under the moratorium. Activists
believe that Japan will give up research killings in the Antarctic sanctuary
now there is no hope of commercial hunting.
The sanctuary may have wider implications. Some campaigners see the 23-1
vote as a vindication of their tough tactics, which included threatening the
Caribbean supporters of Japan's position with a tourism boycott. 'We can
definitely learn from this and apply it to other animals,' says Kate
O'Connell, an environmentalist based in Colombia.
The governments of non-whaling countries such as the US, the UK, France and
Germany are happy to go along with the environmentalists because of the
domestic political credit they earn. 'They see this as a cheap way to buy a
green image,' says Milton Freeman, an anthropologist at the University of
Alberta, Canada. 'Who could possibly be against a whale sanctuary?'
Such attitudes infuriate Japan and Norway, which stress that the charter of
the commission requires it to base decisions on scientific grounds, and
regulate whaling so as to provide for 'the optimum utilisation of the whale
resources'. They say there is no scientific basis for a comprehensive
sanctuary, since endangered whales such as the blue whale, are already
protected, and will continue to be protected whatever happens to the minkes.
Having lost the battle over the sanctuary, Japan and Norway are pushing to
replace the moratorium with catch quotas for minkes, the only whale species
not endangered. Quotas would allow the Japanese to hunt on a limited scale
for minke whales off its own coast, and take political pressure off Norway
for resuming whaling unilaterally in the north-east Atlantic.
They are seeking support from the commission, whose scientific committee has
developed a mathematical model, known as the Revised Management Programme,
to calculate how many whales of a species can be caught in a year without
threatening survival.
But the commission is in no hurry to implement the model, and the
non-whaling countries would like to avoid a politically sensitive vote on
the moratorium. The stalling game was given a boost by reports this year
that the former Soviet Union under-reported killings of blue and other
endangered whales. One ship caught 7,207 humpback whales and 1,433 blue
whales during a period of the 1960s, and not 152 and 156 as reported,
according to Alexei Yablokov, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on ecology.
Environmentalists said proof of Soviet misreporting would reduce any catch
quotas agreed - although the commission has said its impact would be
minimal. More important, environmentalists argue that observation and
monitoring of catches has to be tight to prevent further cheating. With one
minke whale worth up to Dollars 50,000, the temptation to misreport is
considerable.
As well as doubting official reports of Soviet kills, scientists have also
begun to question estimates of stocks. The Norwegians reckon there are
87,000 minke whales in the north-east Atlantic, giving a catch quota of 290,
according to the model. Dr Justin Cooke, a scientific consultant who helped
develop the commission's mathematical model, reckons they are 53,000 minkes,
which would give a quota of just one minke a year.
Anti-whaling nations say that debates such as these could hold up the
implementation of a quota scheme for off-shore hunting forever. Even if
there is acceptance of the numbers, there is the problem of how whales are
killed. The UK objects to whale hunting because of the slow and painful
death of a harpooned whale.
As a European commissioner put it: 'The point about whales is you get an
enormous response - we received 60,000 postcards backing the sanctuary.' The
fact that whale meat is regarded as a delicacy in Japan does not seem to
matter.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Information, not technology, is key
asset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRENT WORK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I commend your editorial position ('IT's not a knockout', May 17) that
information technology is no 'magic bullet'. There is, indeed, a growing
body of research which indicates that IT rarely produces lasting advantage.
IT seems only to magnify existing advantages. Yet, the same research
suggests that the electronic integration of both markets and organisations
is inevitable. No company can afford to ignore the consequences of the
dramatic industrial reorganisation which this is now causing.
As you suggest, in one sense business will remain as usual. Success will
belong to those with 'shrewd judgment, entrepreneurship, innovation, and
sound organisation'. However, these terms are likely to have new
connotations. An abundance of information forces us to take a more complex
view of the world. Future entrepreneurs may have to reflect more carefully
before acting. What will 'gut instinct' mean when existing information
concerning customer preference can be run through sophisticated models of
market demand? The answer will not be welcomed by executives who thrive on
simple solutions, for example, those who believe in magic bullets.
We must learn that information, not technology, is the crucial asset and
that learning to use information judiciously will be the key to success in
an electronically integrated world.
Governments and businesses invest billions annually developing new
technologies. Surely, they should spend a fraction of this sum learning to
use information better.
This is the 'secret' of sustaining competitive advantage, both at national
and corporate levels, but it is a lesson which we refuse to learn. Until we
do, the FT will continue to have stories such as Taurus, London Ambulance,
and Wessex Health Authority to write. The FT must have a vested interest in
keeping the secret.

Sir, In the interests of accuracy, I point out that Lawnside School in
Malvern is not closing 'at the end of this year because its governors
believe it is no longer commercially viable', as stated in your article,
'Sums don't add up: dog days in Britain's independent schools' (May 13).
It is merging in September with a neighbouring school because its governors
have the wisdom to see that current trends might otherwise result in the
school becoming commercially unviable. By this means they have protected the
educational future of all current students and ensured continuity for them.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Flashpoint of fraternal feelings: A look at the potential
clash over the Crimea peninsula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a reckless hand, it seems, the conditions for a civil conflict in
Crimea are being piled one upon the other. So far, the will to fight appears
lacking, but graceful and low-cost exits from confrontation grow narrower by
the day.
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Crimean peninsula has been
seen as the epicentre of a potential clash between Ukraine and Russia. It is
the benchmark for how Moscow grapples with the issue of the Russians abroad,
a test of its commitment to observe in spirit and in letter the borders of
the newly independent state of the former Soviet Union.
Crimea is an acid test, indeed, transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954
by Nikita Khruschev as a mark of Russian-Ukrainian friendship. It is Russian
by majority of its 2.7m people, by culture and language, strongly felt to be
so by most people in Russia and economically more linked to Russia than to
Ukraine.
Cossacks, the traditional guardians of Russia's frontiers, have revived
since the collapse of communism. In their brown and blue uniforms, boots and
peaked caps, the officers with ornamental whips, they stroll about the
square before the Crimean Supreme Soviet (parliament) - their age-old task
of keeping order apparently restored to them. 'We are against the separation
of Slav brothers,' says Captain Yuri Gagalo, commanding a unit from
Bakhchiserai near Simferopol. 'There should be no border between Ukraine and
Russia; we do not recognise them.'
Signs on the fence in front of the Supreme Soviet building read: 'Crimeans
decide their own fate. Crimea - Russia]' and 'Radetsky (the Ukrainian
defence minister) wants to shed our blood.' One poster shows a map of Crimea
with an angel flying up from Russia to hold back threatening figures looming
in from the north, with the slogan: 'Help and save us.'
Last week the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution which brought into force a
constitution of the Crimean republic drawn up two years ago. It claims
autonomy for the peninsula and, in the view of the Ukrainian government in
Kiev, establishes independence prior to rejoining Russia. A flurry of
negotiations followed: Crimean deputies went to Kiev this week to talk over
the demand that they rescind their constitution by Monday (they refused):
while the Crimean deputy premier, Mr Yevgenny Saburov, joined talks (so far
inconclusive) in Moscow on the division of the Black Sea fleet - the
300-ship navy based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, under uneasy joint
Ukrainian-Russian command.
The security situation is tragi-comic opera. Mr Yuri Meshkov, Crimean
president, last month named Valentin Kuznetsov, a retired Soviet army
general, as his interior minister, and General Ivan Kolomitsev as head of
the Crimean KGB. Gen Kuznetsov effectively took command of the interior
ministry; Gen Kolomitsev could not establish his authority over the KGB
officers, who remain loyal to Kiev.
Gen Kuznetsov, professing himself relaxed, reckons there are 100,000 men
under arms in the peninsula - 50,000 Ukrainian troops, 35,000 Black Sea
fleet sailors and marines, 15,000 militia and 2,500 Ukrainian National
Guards - the latter reinforced with armoured personnel carriers.
'There is a danger,' he says, 'that the Ukrainian intervention will split
the militia. If the Ukrainians were to try to take Simferopol, they might
have initial success - but it would be a hollow victory. We must go on
talking, and try to get agreement.'
Mr Valentin Nedrehaylo, Ukrainian deputy interior minister, also talks
peace, disclaiming the use of force. His job in Crimea, he says, is aimed at
the reconstitution of the militia to control the criminals flourishing in
the political crisis. He has a point. On Thursday, a smart Audi with four
young men wearing sunshades and cropped hair drew up before a new
restaurant. One crooked a finger to a waiter who ran over and pointed within
the restaurant. A militia man, lounging on the patio, disappeared. The
driver got out, ambled into the restaurant and came out a minute later, his
pocket stuffed with the Ukrainian coupon now exchanging at about 50,000 to
the dollar. It was an almost cinematic display of a protection gang on their
rounds.
'There will be a planned implementation of Ukrainian command,' says Mr
Nedrehaylo. 'Ukraine is a unitary state and Crimea is part of it.'
But Kiev is weak. The parliamentary elections in April yielded a split
parliament with a dominant socialist-communist wing hostile to reforms and
distrusting President Leonid Kravchuk. Mr Kravchuk should be preparing for
elections next month, but has called for a postponement because of the lack
of a constitution. In the Crimean crisis he sees a reason, possibly, to
declare presidential rule.
The growing pressure upon the peninsula is causing cracks in the Crimean
political facade, too. Mr Meshkov, a former lawyer elected on a ticket of
unity with Russia, has been essaying caution. He admitted this week he had
been against the vote on the constitution, preferring to wait in the hope
that a new president in Kiev with pro-Russian leanings - Mr Leonid Kuchma, a
former Ukrainian premier, is the favoured candidate - would bring the two
Slav states together. Mr Meshkov is in danger of being pulled by, rather
than leading, the political process.
Mr Mustafa Djemilyev, leader of the 200,000-strong Crimean Tatar community
and loyal to the Kiev government, confirms this view. 'We had hoped Meshkov
would become moderate after his election. But he has become a hostage to his
party (the Russia bloc) and to his campaign promises.'
Not only the Tatar deputies were heated in a debate in Simferopol this week.
Many deputies appeared angered by Mr Meshkov's appointment of Mr Saburov - a
former Russian finance minister - as effective head of the government
(though the president is the titular premier) and his intention to appoint a
group of Mr Saburov's colleagues from Moscow to the main ministerial posts.
'Saburov is trying to become God,' one deputy snorted. The unease appeared
to be roused more by resentment over young Muscovites coming to Crimea than
by ideological splits.
The programme which Mr Saburov is struggling to get past the parliament goes
to the root of the Crimean crisis. He is trying to revive the peninsula's
economy even as it remains within Ukraine, with a currency prone to
hyper-inflation and with ever-tighter central control, which is ineffective
in regulating business or collecting taxes but effective in deterring
domestic and foreign investment.
Crimea lacks attraction not because it could not be rich. Its climate,
offshore oil and gas reserves, its agriculture, its shipyards - all could
contribute to a standard of living higher than the hand-to-mouth,
post-Soviet lifestyle to which its citizens have become accustomed.
But it is trapped, politically. Presidential decrees on abolishing the
Ukrainian fixed rates on currency exchange and on attracting foreign banks
(while Ukraine repels them) are largely inoperable. While the three-cornered
struggle for state power goes on between Ukraine, Crimea and Russia, there
can be no confidence and no way out paved by firm investment.
Thus the pressure mounts, in the lazy heat of late spring, as the Cossacks
step smartly to and fro, whacking their whips gently on their boots. The
politicians argue and rival militias glower across a common courtyard.
Whatever outcome emerges, it is the signpost for how Russia conducts itself
in the former Soviet Union, and how far Ukraine can succeed in establishing
a statehood still fragile and contested.

FT  28 MAY 94 / New vroom for sporty icon: A look at the cultural revolution
at a legendary Italian carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferrari is learning humility. Brought down to earth by a fall of almost 50
per cent in sales in the past two years, the carmaker has decided it has to
listen to its customers.
Ferrari sports cars may be modern icons, exhibited last year at the New York
Museum
of Modern Art and currently at Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie, but the
Italian carmaker has been having trouble finding customers during the past
two years of global recession.
The company is fighting back. It is unveiling an array of new products at
almost indecent speed; the latest is the 183mph F355, on display at its
Maranello headquarters in northern Italy this week.
The 3.5-litre F355, which boasts five valves per cylinder and 380bhp,
replaces the existing 348 and will be crucial to Ferrari's fortunes. It is
to be launched around the world in the second half of this year.
Priced in excess of Pounds 80,000, the F355 will be Ferrari's new
'entry-level' car, the lowest-priced in the range and set to account for
about 60 per cent of its annual sales.
While the engine roar of the F355s hurtling around Ferrari's Fiorano
test-track this week under the guidance of former Formula One champion Niki
Lauda and current driver Jean Alesi, may have been unmistakably Ferrari, the
company's sales and marketing pitch is changing drastically.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a wave of speculative buying as
auction values soared. 'There was big speculation, it was so easy to sell
Ferraris,' says Mr Michele Scannavini, sales and marketing director. 'We had
three to four years that were crazy, to the beginning of 1992. You just had
to produce it and the car was sold.'
In the second half of 1992, however, 'things changed dramatically', he says.
'Social and economic conditions changed. We have had a couple of very
difficult years.'
Sales dropped sharply, to 2,350 in 1993 from 4,400 in 1991. With stocks of
unsold Ferraris growing, production was halted for 40 working days last year
to bring inventories more into line with sales. Ferrari decided it had to
become more user-friendly if it was to halt the decline.
The arrival of Mr Scannavini at the beginning of last year from a career at
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, and at BSN, France's
largest food group, has marked the cultural revolution at the carmaker.
'There is a clear evolution in the Ferrari product,' he says. 'We decided to
be much more attentive to what the customer says, wants and expects. We like
to say we don't have a competitor, but we cannot be blind.'
The change of heart - and the replacement of the 348 - has not come a moment
too soon. The results of a recent comparative road test of the Ferrari 348,
Honda's NSX and the Porsche 911 in Autocar, the British motoring weekly,
carried the dire headline: 'NSX kills 348 shock.'
Mr Scannavini may have come to Ferrari from a world of detergents, oral
hygiene and household cleaning products, but he insists it was a sector that
demanded close attention to both consumer needs and the marketplace.
He stresses how the F355 has electronically controlled suspension settings,
with a sport and comfort setting to even out the bumps. There is power
steering, though the muscle-bound can still order the car with mechanical
steering only. There is ABS (anti-lock braking), though the same
unreconstructed Ferrari buyer can deactivate it at the flick of a switch.
The gear change has been smoothed. The perfect polished metal gate and gear
stick remain, but the new six-speed gearbox replaces the old dog-leg
five-speed box.
And, yes, the colour. Gone are the days when you could have a Ferrari in any
colour as long as it was red - or maybe yellow. 'We've renewed our colour
range,' says Mr Scannavini. The F355 comes with a range of 17 exterior and
12 interior colours.
The F355 has also been designed to behave impeccably in town as well as on
the race-track. Crucially, Ferrari has decided that annual sales and
production will never again be allowed to exceed the ceiling of 3,000 a year
to protect the exclusivity of the marque. Sales are also to be spread more
thinly across more markets. Six markets are being opened in the Far East and
four in Latin America.
'We saw what happened by selling too many at the end of the 1980s,' says Mr
Scannavini. 'There were too many cars in the used car market.'
He also wants to go back to the 'right' customers. 'When the Ferrari myth
became strong, it was with the gentleman driver. In the period of
speculation, too many Ferraris went into the wrong hands. Our customers do
not want to be associated with Mafiosi, dealers and prostitutes.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Formula for auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CHAMBERLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'The liabilities of auditors' (May 23) is to be welcomed
for its support for the principle that reform of the law seems sound. It is,
as you state, unreasonable that auditors should be held wholly responsible
for corporate disasters when they have not been the direct cause of
problems.
It is much less easy to agree that amendment of Section 310 of the Companies
Act in order to allow auditors to limit their liability in contract is a
flawed alternative to more fundamental, and therefore less readily
realisable, change.
The monetary limitation of liability that would flow from this amendment
should not be pitched at so low a level that the sense of professional
responsibility felt by auditors would be put at risk. It is surely possible
to arrive at levels which are reasonable and appropriate to the size of
individual companies audited.
We hope the Department of Trade and Industry can be persuaded to engage in a
public consultation so as to ascertain how some such formula should be
devised. I believe that there is a measure of sympathy within the business
community to this general approach.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Endgame in a deadly zone: Financial pressure, exhaustion and
a fall in support could persuade the IRA to end its violence soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For nine years, nearly Pounds 2m has been kept frozen in the bank account of
a well-known local businessman in the Irish county town of Navan, once a
fortified outpost of British sovereignty.
The money was allegedly on its way from a Swiss bank to the paymasters of
the Provisional Irish Republican Army. But it was intercepted by the Garda.
The Pounds 2m was intended to help fund the IRA's armed struggle in Northern
Ireland, condemned as the 'six-county prison house' by Gerry Adams, the Sinn
Fein president.
'The account holder claims it is all legitimate,' says a high-ranking Garda
officer. 'But it stays exactly where it is until the killing stops.'
Exactly what happens to the Navan cash when one of the world's most
intractable conflicts finally ends is low on the list of current republican
concerns.
The recent shadow boxing with the UK government has involved matters of much
greater moment, such as agreement on the meaning of Irish national
self-determination and the fate of hundreds of convicted IRA prisoners
kicking their heels in jail.
Ann Anthony, a protestant mother of two from Lurgan in the north, could be
forgiven for wanting the prisoners to stay where they are. This month, with
the death toll from 2 1/2 decades of street warfare rising beyond 3,000, the
IRA blew up her husband. Charge: working as a cleaner at a police station.
Penalty: death.
The cycle of hatred has also cut deep into the flesh of an innocent,
Catholic community caught in the sectarian crossfire. Eamon Fox and Gary
Convie died together five days after Fred Anthony as they tucked into
lunchtime sandwiches; 76-year-old Roseanne Mallon ended her life alone, at
midnight, in a bullet-riddled armchair.
And yet, in spite of the latest, random murders and the cries of 'no
surrender', the 25th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in
Ulster approaches with hope, not despair, in the ascendant.
As republicans pick at the Downing Street declaration, a document intended
to be all things to all parties, a widespread belief persists that the
end-game is under way.
Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's police force, expects heightened savagery in the
short-term but hopes to see an end to most terrorist violence within three
years. Jim Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, reckons the worst
could be over in a year. Adams himself, who has sounded at his most
optimistic this week, claims the struggle has entered a new and final phase.
But the choice between peace and another 25 years of human tragedy is
testing to the limits the cohesion of hardline republicans intent on a
32-county socialist state. In the words of a convicted IRA bomber: 'Not long
ago, the mere idea that men married to armed struggle should talk to the
Brits would have meant a beating. Now even the big boys are into it.'
Out of sight, small groups, united under the 'ballot box and armalite' creed
of Sinn Fein and the IRA - Adams concedes they 'draw water from the same
well' - are debating the unthinkable.
Could violence, which alone has given the cutting edge to the Irish
question, soon be over? Might it be possible to decommission the IRA, the
world's most technically advanced terrorist organisation?
The pressures on the republican movement for a political deal have
intensified since last December's declaration, which united London and
Dublin in leaving open all options for Ulster's future but rejected coercion
of one part of the Irish community by another.
Despite unprecedented publicity for the republican case and the platform
given to the tactically astute Adams to sell his peace agenda, the unbending
London-Dublin stance has won overwhelming backing.
Electoral support in the north for Sinn Fein, which won 78,291 votes in the
1992 general election (10 per cent of the vote) has halved, though the
British government stresses it recognises the party's modest mandate. In the
republic, polls suggest the party is backed by barely 1 per cent of voters.
Political isolation, however, holds no demons for the battle-hardened men at
the heart of the IRA - the dominant partner in its intimate relationship
with Sinn Fein - who number about 400 - with perhaps another 50 key players
in the south. It is these men, who numbered about 1,000 20 years ago,
presided over by an Army Executive and a seven-man Army Council, who guard
the soul of the IRA.
They look to Belfast, still the political centre of the organisation, for
guidance. A northern command structure split into 11 operational areas
(southern command embraces the entire republic) plans attacks mounted by
active service units.
There are thought to be at least two units currently on the British
mainland. In Ulster, active service units are supported by similar numbers
of part-time volunteers, blooded in minor sorties. Behind the volunteers,
within the Catholic strongholds, are the supporters who offer safe haven in
an estimated 2,000 homes: 'There is always someone to run them a bath to
wipe out the evidence,' says an senior intelligence source.
In Ulster border towns such as the largely republican Crossmaglen, the
British army survives under siege, and lamp posts carry mock, triangular
signs warning: 'Danger: Sniper at work.'
Not all support for the IRA in Ulster is freely given. Intimidation of
Catholics by Catholics is widespread. On a night of terror in April, IRA
'punishment' attacks in Belfast left one man dead and 16 with gunshot wounds
to the legs.
Growing sections of the IRA leadership now share a conviction that the
prospect of a glorious victory is as remote as the threat of complete
defeat. And most grass-roots republicans no longer have any stomach for
slaughter, as a series of Sinn Fein public meetings staged to debate the
Downing Street declaration made clear.
At the same time, the IRA confronts a combined north-south assault on its
manpower, weaponry and financial resources. In the republic, which is
spending IPounds 200m a year to bring the IRA to heel, the Garda claims
recent arms finds have dealt a hammer-blow to IRA quartermasters moving arms
and explosives up to the 282-mile border.
With Libya no longer supplying the arms which sustained the IRA in the
1980s, fresh sources are proving hard to find. The recent exposure by
British intelligence of attempts to forge new supply links with Iran is a
further set-back - though, for the time being, weaponry is not a problem for
the IRA, which has stored enough to sustain the fight for another 10 years.
The IRA arsenal includes more than 600 AK47 rifles, 30 machine guns, nine
SAM7 missiles, a dozen hand-held, surface-to-surface missile launchers,
eight flame throwers, hundreds of Webley pistols and tons of imported
Semtex, Irish security sources say.
The organisation's engineering and electronics experts can add to the
arsenal with home-made devices. Though icing sugar and fertiliser are still
sometimes mixed to provide a deadly cocktail, a bomb factory discovered in
Kilcock, near Dublin, recently yielded sophisticated equipment.
Waging a high-tech war - the IRA now has electronic devices to break into
police and army frequencies - is expensive. The annual cost is estimated by
the security forces at up to Pounds 7m, and the rising number of bank raids
in the south suggests the books are not balancing.
Most IRA income comes from organised in the province and in the republic - a
network of racketeering and fraud, which ranges from video and audio tape
piracy to tax abuse. In the eyes of those who fight the IRA, this makes it
more of a Mafia than an army of liberation and means its activities are
unlikely to be extinguished by a political settlement.
The RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit, which has overseen prosecutions
involving nearly Pounds 50m destined for IRA coffers since 1982, has now
been bolstered by a finance unit of 30 tax inspectors, lawyers and
accountants. This unit played a large role in the recent joint operation,
codenamed 'Madronna', between police on the British mainland and on both
sides of the Irish border to nail the sources of IRA financing. Meanwhile,
in the US, funds for the IRA have been dwindling since the early 1980s.
The combination of political and financial pressures on the IRA and Sinn
Fein to enter the peace process is not lost on elements in their
leaderships. But they are acutely aware of the dangers of moving too far too
fast. 'If Adams screws it up, he could end up with a bullet in his head,'
says a senior member of the RUC.
A majority within the IRA army council is now said to favour searching for a
political accord, but one which will not oblige republicans to endorse the
Downing Street agreement. A second ceasefire this year has not been ruled
out.
But, remarked a source claiming to be close to one council member: 'They
know it would be of no use just to sign up tomorrow. They first have to
bring with them the constituency of armed, physical-force tradition people.
That will take time, carries great dangers and will also need the Brits to
play the game.' A former IRA volunteer indicates the scale of the challenge
within the organisation: 'Sure, we are tired, they are tired, everyone's
tired. But we'll see them out of the six counties or in hell before we give
up.'
There are some in the high command opposed to going further down the
political road, which historically has always ended in traumatic
disintegration for republicans.
To the hard men of south Armagh, east Tyrone and Fermanagh, the only option
is to continue to wage a war so sacred as to justify the killing of
schoolchildren in Warrington, nurses in Enniskillen and six-month old
infants in Germany.
Talk of a split, however, provokes impatience among Sinn Fein heavyweights
such as Martin McGuinness - publicly branded a senior IRA figure by Sir
Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. 'Do you really think,' says
McGuinness, 'we have come this far without ensuring full agreement on our
position each step of the way. There is no split, there will be no split.'
An RUC intelligence officer agrees: 'The name of the game is to get people
on side and gradually isolate the others.'
The highest levels of the IRA appear confident that before the year-end, the
organisation will again be in contact either directly or indirectly with the
British government. Moreover, they believe that, ultimately, they will be
able to bring their argument to the heart of Whitehall not in a stolen,
mortar-laden van but in a briefcase.
This week London and Dublin offered republicans more time to choose between
peace and continuing armed struggle. The 'Brits' say they are more than
ready to talk. But there is, first, the one precondition: an end to all
violence; just 12 weeks of peace will do.
Like Gerry Adams, who recently quotedIrish poet Patrick Galvin to express
his wish, London and Dublin, too, 'dream of a green land without death, a
new silence descending, a silence of peace'.
A second article planned for Monday examines the influence of Irish
Americans on the Northern Ireland conflict.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Man in the News: Crown prince of Camelot - Tim Holley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pictorial coverage of the UK National Lottery announcement this week was
evenly split between Richard Branson the Loser, and Sir Ron Dearing the
Winner.
The Virgin chairman was photographed in various disconsolate poses while Sir
Ron, chairman of Camelot, the winning consortium, was doing the things
photographers expect winners to do - waving his arms in the air, or offering
champagne toasts to the camera.
In a few pictures there was another man, smiling less extravagantly: Tim
Holley, the 54-year-old chief executive of Camelot, who put the bid
together, saw off seven rivals and who is responsible for making sure that
the first multi-million draw of the lottery goes ahead as planned, probably
on Saturday, November 12.
It will almost certainly be Sir Ron, former chairman of the Post Office and
chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, and the
Northern Development Company, who will be handing out cheques that turn
ordinary citizens into millionaires most weeks of the year.
Behind him Holley, calm, undemonstrative, will be running, if forecasts
prove correct, a start-up business with revenues of Pounds 32bn over the
next seven years. From that, Pounds 9bn will go to the government's 'good
causes' - the arts, charities, the national heritage, a fund to mark the
millennium, and sports.
Colleagues describe Holley, whose gambling has been limited to an occasional
bet at a horse race, as 'exceptionally clear-minded and focused', and 'very
steady under fire'.
Outside the computer industry, the former chairman of Racal Data
Communications group is hardly a national business name, yet his meticulous
preparation and planning put Camelot well ahead of the other bidders and
created an unambiguous winner.
Camelot was the first to begin large-scale recruiting of staff within weeks
of the formal bids being submitted on February 14. Interviews were conducted
and conditional offers made. The job offers have now been confirmed and the
pivotal staff will report for work on Monday week.
'We have done a rigorous amount of planning and testing, and we started to
produce our applications as soon as the draft invitations to apply came
out,' Holley says.
During his career he picked up several skills relevant to launching a
national lottery.
After school in Somerset, his first job was as a Barclays Bank trainee. He
thus has some knowledge of retailing and life in the high street. He then
worked in computer programming and marketing at ICL, the computer group,
before spending the last 12 years at Racal, where he specialised in data
communications. He led the team that won a government data network service
contract, linking government departments, that could be worth Pounds 400m to
Racal over 10 years.
More intriguingly, while in his 20s, Holley set up his own think-tank to
suggest ideas on raising money for a charity he was associated with - the
Muscular Dystrophy Group. Charity balls were organised. Several million
pounds were raised by ideas such as persuading pubs to compete against each
other to see which could come up with the most cash. A show business
personality then presented a cup to the winner.
'You put charity collection boxes in pubs and nothing happens,' says Holley.
But give people the chance to compete, the chance to win and the money rolls
in.
Holley represented Racal in talks with potential shareholders of the lottery
consortium, and three approached him separately, asking if he would become
chief executive.
'Then Ernie Harrison (Sir Ernest Harrison, Racal chairman,) came to me and
asked whether I would be prepared to be chief executive, and whether I would
be acceptable to the other shareholders,' says Holley, who has been running
companies with several thousand employees for years.
'Clearly, running something that will affect people all over the country is
something rather different, and that's a new challenge,' he says.
The strength of Camelot, he believes, is that all the partners - Cadbury
Schweppes, Racal Electronics, ICL, De La Rue, the banknote and document
printer, and G-Tech, the US lottery equipment manufacturer - have all
brought contributions to the consortium.
Racal has a communications network which handles information for 42
government departments; ICL has a manufacturing base to make G-Tech lottery
terminals in the UK; De La Rue has security expertise; and Cadbury has
contributed retail knowledge.
Already the lottery is off and running, although details of the licence have
still to be hammered out with Mr Peter Davis, director of the National
Lottery. The planned launch date may slip a week because it is on
Remembrance Day weekend. BBC1, which will probably carry the lottery draw,
traditionally broadcasts the commemoration live from the Royal Albert Hall.
Retail outlets are being signed up daily. The total is approaching 2,000,
including the Post Office and chain stores. Camelot also hopes to hold
discussions with Marks and Spencer, which reserved its position on the
lottery until the winner was announced.
The announcement has prompted a surge of interest, with so many calls coming
into Camelot's temporary headquarters in Windsor - 1,200 on Thursday alone -
that special message desks have been set up.
'I think two-thirds of the adult population will play within the first year,
although not every week,' says Holley. 'People will play regularly and get a
lot of excitement and I think that's wonderful, at the same time as raising
a lot of money for good causes.'
Unlike some of his customers, however, Holley will have to continue working
for a living. There will be no windfall for him. Along with the rest of the
Camelot staff, he will be banned from paying Pounds 1 to choose six numbers
out of 49 to take part in their own lottery. 'It's a penalty of the job,' he
says.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Removing the punch bowl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the job, so the adage goes, of a central bank to take away the punch
bowl just as the party becomes lively. That is precisely what Mr Alan
Greenspan's Federal Reserve has managed to do, even though many American
politicians and economists have failed to recognise the achievement. But
what about the Germans? They are apparently thinking of removing the bowl
before the guests have taken off their coats.
That the Federal Reserve has judged things rather well was confirmed by
yesterday's release of the revisions to US gross domestic product for the
first quarter. The annualised growth rate had been initially estimated at
2.6 per cent. This has now been raised to 3 per cent, contrary to market
expectations, which were for the growth rate to be revised downwards, to 2.3
per cent.
Last week's half a percentage point increase in the US discount rate looks
even better judged now than it did then. The Federal Funds rate is a little
under 4 1/4 per cent, 1 1/4 percentage points above where it was in early
February. This increase must be judged the least that can be justified,
given what has been happening to the US economy and bond markets.
US and German short-term interest rates have been converging since the
autumn of 1992, when the gap was 6.7 percentage points. But even now, after
a tiny reduction this week, the Bundesbank's repurchase (or 'repo') rate, at
5.2 per cent, remains more than one percentage point above the Federal Funds
rate. A visitor from Mars, looking at the two economies and the two rates,
would surely be puzzled.
The US economy has been growing since the beginning of 1991, while German
recovery remains notional. Most measures, notably unemployment, suggest the
US economy is running at close to full capacity, while German unemployment
is at 9.3 per cent, even excluding the high levels in east Germany. US
inflation is running only a little below German rates, which have been
falling steadily, to below 3 per cent. US long rates of interest are more
than half a percentage point higher than those in Germany, underlining the
greater confidence in German price performance.
German rates
The visitor from Mars would be puzzled. The investor in European markets
seems to be shocked, if not by the level of German interest rates, at least
by the fear that they may not decline further. Both the German and UK stock
markets registered marked falls over the week. By contrast, US and Japanese
markets have been relatively robust. Similarly, Salomon's European bond
index lost 1.59 per cent in local currency over the week to Thursday, making
European bonds the biggest losers for the second consecutive week.
It had been widely assumed that, by cutting the discount rate to 4.5 per
cent on May 11, the Bundesbank had deliberately given itself room for
substantial cuts in the repo rate, which was then (and is even now) well
above the previous floor of 5 per cent. That confidence has since been
punctured.
The proximate reason for the change in perspective has been remarks by Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, and a number of his colleagues.
Mr Tietmeyer said that 'we are not following a step-by-step cut in interest
rates for the time being'. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's monetarist chief
economist, Mr Otmar Issing, remarked that 'current money supply figures did
not match a landscape of falling interest rates.' The data certainly
underlined the warning, since the Bundesbank's target measure of broad
money, M3, grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised rate of 15.8 per cent
between the last quarter of 1993 and April 1994.
Twin desires
Two desires are warring in the heart of the Bundesbank. The first is not to
throttle German and, indeed, European recovery. The second is to remain a
credibly monetarist institution, one that takes its targets as seriously as
it would like outsiders to take them. That side of the Bundesbank is worried
by the weakness of the German bond market, looks askance at the German
fiscal deficit and feels comforted by the emerging signs of recovery, not
just in Germany, but also in France. It is good news, for example, that
Insee, the French government's statistics agency, predicts a 0.9 per cent
growth in the French economy in the first half of this year.
The first impulse drove down the discount rate in early May, while the
second is determined to use the room for manoeuvre as cautiously as
possible. But German short term rates of interest still seem set to decline
further (whatever the monetary numbers may say to the contrary). Similarly,
US interest rates have further to rise. What is happening to monetary policy
in US and Germany merely underlines the vastly divergent politics in the two
countries. In the US people ask why rates are so unreasonably high. In
Germany they ask why they are so riskily low. That is why the Bundesbank is,
once again, a convincing party-pooper.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Imro joins probe of options fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has become
involved in a transatlantic investigation of a suspected options fraud which
may have resulted in a loss of more than Dollars 90m (Pounds 59.6m) to
investors, Jimmy Burns writes.
Imro said last night that it had been 'liaising closely' with enforcement
and regulatory authorities in the UK and overseas investigating the alleged
fraud involving the activities of Mr William W. Dunn, a US-based commodities
broker and his company, Delta Consultants. Earlier this week it emerged that
the broker and the company were the subject of an investigation by the
Serious Fraud Office, the FBI and the US Commodity Future Trading
Commission.
In its report on cases under investigation, the SFO says that Delta
Consultants solicited funds for the purpose of investment in currency
futures through the agency of AP Black, a member of Imro.
The SFO said last night that AP Black remained part of the inquiry into
Delta Consultants, but it was not prepared to say whether AP Black itself
was being investigated. Imro does not comment on investigations unless they
result in disciplinary action against members.
AP Black has been unavailable for comment all week. However Mr James Todd, a
director, said last night: 'There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by AP
Black.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Red Star searches again for a buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Red Star, British Rail's express parcels company, was put up for sale for a
second time yesterday after a reorganisation intended to make it more
attractive to bidders, Charles Batchelor writes.
The company was first offered for sale almost a year ago, but no
satisfactory buyer was found. It has since shed 350 staff and is dropping
two of its slower services.
Red Star failed to find a buyer because of its large losses - Pounds 9m on
turnover of Pounds 43m in 1993. The streamlining of its operations will not
entirely eliminate the loss, it said yesterday.
It is the only UK parcels carrier to use the rail network and has more than
200 outlets, mostly in or near stations.
Final bids must be made by July 31, with the aim of completing a sale by the
end of September.
Red Star is to focus on its same-day service and its 9am and 10.30am
next-day services. It will drop from today its noon and 5.30pm next-day
services.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Lib Dems hope to cash in on Penhaligon legacy: John Authers
finds fond memories of an MP who defied London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberals have long understood how to campaign in Cornwall. Now the Liberal
Democrats hope to win Cornwall's seat in the European parliament using the
brand of populism typified by the late David Penhaligon, who 'stood up for
the Cornish' against London as MP for Truro from 1974 until 1986.
Their candidate, Mr Robin Teverson, a 42-year-old transport consultant, has
campaigned almost full-time for five months, backed by heavy funding and a
stream of national party figures. He could well defeat Mr Christopher
Beazley, Conservative MEP for 10 years.
Liberal Democrats captured Cornwall County Council last year and gained five
wards in Penwith District Council in the county's only local elections this
month.
The party holds two of the county's five parliamentary seats, and its
Euro-campaign is designed to help defeat Cornwall's three Conservative MPs
at the next general election.
Cornish politics are different. Campaigners for a single local authority for
Cornwall say today's county was a separate domain until the 16th century.
The ancient Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral, they say, divided Britain
into four realms - England, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall.
The county has its own nationalist party - Mebyon Kernow, fielding a
candidate in the Euro-election - and its own language.
Unlike neighbouring south-western counties, Cornwall has an industrial past,
to which china clay heaps and disused tin mines bear testimony. Socially and
politically, Cornwall is at least as close to Scotland as it is to Devon.
Water is the campaign's hottest issue. South West Water charges 50 per cent
more than the national average, thanks to a costly coastal clean-up
campaign. The Liberal Democrats gleefully refer to the issue as 'Cornwall's
poll tax'.
The likely introduction of differential charges for gas - given Cornwall's
distance from the North Sea - also arouses anger.
Local Conservatives acknowledge the water issue is damaging them, and want a
national water levy to reduce bills for the South-West.
Rail services are also emotive. The Cornish fear that, in future, trains
from London will terminate at Plymouth - two hours from Penzance.
The government's 'Days at Sea' policy, which temporarily prohibited
fishermen from going to sea on specific days, is another Liberal Democrat
issue.
The policy was introduced to implement European rules to stop over-fishing,
but by limiting fishing to certain days - when the weather might be
dangerous - Mr Teverson claims Westminster was putting sailors' lives and
livelihoods at risk.
European funds are taken seriously. The county council opened an office in
Brussels to lobby for funds in 1988 - the first UK local authority to do so
 -and maintains European liaison staff. Their money helped fund the
ambitious new Tate gallery in St Ives.
However, Conservatives are not giving the seat up easily, with Mr John Major
making an appearance in St Mellion, east Cornwall, earlier this week.
The incumbent MEP, Mr Beazley, says predictions of Liberal Democrat gains
come from the London media who do not understand the difficulties of
campaigning in the area.
He claims that Mr Teverson has no experience of Europe, and could not
replicate the contacts that have taken 10 years to build. Tories also claim
the Cornish vote for candidates they trust personally, regardless of their
politics.
Mr Beazley avoids the government's record, concentrating instead on Europe
and his experience. His posters do not include the word 'Conservative'.
Tories point to Mr Teverson's defeat by the Conservative Mr Robert Hicks in
South-East Cornwall in the 1992 general election.
They also believe that the Liberal Democrat emphasis on local and national
issues for a European election will backfire.
The angry words of one man Mr Teverson met on the street in the clay-mining
town of St Austell showed that the Liberal Democrats still have to look
beyond local issues:
He said: 'I saw your first pamphlet and it never mentioned Europe once. I
never saw the word Europe.'
But another who shook Mr Teverson's hand in St Austell said: 'You've got my
vote just because of David Penhaligon all those years ago. He was a great
guy and he was a great Cornishman.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Tourist interest in gardens increases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Museums are losing their appeal as tourist attractions while gardens have
benefited from an increase in visitors, the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday.
Numbers visiting UK museums and galleries fell 1 per cent last year, but
visits to gardens rose by 6 per cent.
Hampton Court in south-west London was the most popular garden with 1.1m
visitors in 1993.
The Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire topped the table of visitor
attractions that charge for admission with 2.6m. Second was the London
waxworks museum Madame Tussaud's (2.4m) and third was the Tower of London
(2.3m). The top two, and sixth-placed Chessington World of Adventures,
belong to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Visits to leisure parks were up 4 per cent compared with 1992, while
workplaces - such as whisky distilleries and the Cadbury World chocolate
factory - were up 5 per cent.
The most popular attractions in terms of numbers were Blackpool Pleasure
Beach and the Wembley Stadium complex in west London which each had 6.75m
visitors last year.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Exchange to take big stake in Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange board has voted to become one of the largest
shareholders in Crest, the Bank of England's proposed system for paperless
share settlement, partly in the hope of influencing the design of the
project.
The Tier 1 stake, which could cost up to Pounds 750,000, will give the stock
exchange a Crest shareholding of up to 10 per cent. There are to be four
tiers of shareholdings.
The Crest board will consist of Bank of England appointees during the design
phase, but shareholders will be entitled to influence a 'shadow board' which
will be allowed to make some important decisions.
The Bank has indicated that, because of strong demand for Tier 1 stakes,
each shareholder's stake may be cut to about 6 per cent of the total and the
price cut accordingly.
The Bank set up a team to develop Crest after the collapse of the stock
exchange's ill-fated Taurus paperless share settlement project, intended to
replace the existing Talisman system.
Since then, the stock exchange has been seeking a role for itself in
equities settlement. When Crest is fully operational, the exchange may have
no role in settlement.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, stock exchange chairman, had said the exchange would
like to have a stake in Crest of up to 30 per cent.
However the Bank said it did not wish any single entity or interest group to
have a significant stake and told the exchange a 30 per cent holding would
be inappropriate.
The stock exchange has also suggested it could become the 'service manager'
for Crest, a role the Bank has indicated it may well award to the exchange.
The service manager would work for Crest on a contractual basis and set
policy for the new system.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Biffen sees EU 'evil'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European constitution is an impending and evil political reality which
seeks to hijack partnership among nations and turn it into a tightly knit
political and economic bloc, Mr John Biffen, the former Conservative cabinet
minister, warns in The European Journal, the Euro-sceptic monthly, David
Owen writes.
Mr Biffen says such a constitution would be preventable 'only if the most
vigilant arguments' were continually deployed. 'The determined search for a
centralised Europe, with a constitution that further erases national
government, is no longer an idealistic search for the holy grail of peace
and co-operation. It is a contest about power and pay-off.'
Mr Bill Cash, the Euro-sceptic Conservative MP, presses the case for a new
referendum on Europe. He says 16m of the present UK electorate did not take
part in the 1975 referendum on membership and a new referendum would not be
inconsistent with constitutional practice.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Kohl stokes up EMU dispute: Foreign Office minister breaks
ranks to criticise threat to sovereignty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected intervention by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday
threatened to reopen the divisions in the Conservative party over British
participation in a single European currency.
At the end of the first week's campaigning for the June 9 European
elections, Mr Kohl flatly contradicted the judgment of Mr John Major that
economic and monetary union is now a remote prospect.
That in turn prompted Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the Foreign Office minister
responsible for Europe, to break with the government's formal neutrality on
the issue. He warned that a single currency would undermine British
sovereignty.
Echoing controversial remarks made this month by Mr Michael Portillo, the
Euro-sceptic chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr Heathcoat-Amory said the
replacement of sterling would 'dilute' Britain's national identity.
Making little effort to disguise his own distaste for the idea, he added:
'The Foreign Office view is that the timescale laid down in the Maastricht
treaty - the two trigger dates of 1997 and 1999 - is unrealistic.'
His comments contrasted with the studied neutrality on the issue in the
Conservative manifesto, which leaves a decision on a single currency to a
future parliament, and with the view of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Clarke, a supporter of monetary union, said this week he expected the
issue to return to the European agenda.
Mr Kohl said on BBC television that he remained firmly in favour of a single
currency. The target dates set out in Maastricht were not sacrosanct but:
'It will come, I have no doubt at all.' He said many of those who focused on
particular dates wanted to wreck the project.
By contrast, Mr Major indicated that he thought a single currency was
unlikely in his lifetime.
Mr William Cash, a prominent Euro-sceptic on the Tory backbenches, accused
the German leader of meddling in Britain's domestic affairs. 'This is also
an unwarranted interference in the British European elections and is in
support of Liberal Democrat and Labour policy on a single currency.'
But the opposition parties accused the government of trying to disguise its
internal divisions by keeping Mr Portillo and other cabinet Euro-sceptics on
the sidelines during the European election campaign.
A MORI poll in The Times today says the Conservatives could lose at least
half and possibly up to 80 per cent of their European seats. Of 1,929 people
asked how they would vote, 47 per cent said Labour, 27 per cent Conservative
and 22 per cent Liberal Democrat.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Labour shifts poll focus to social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour claimed yesterday that its twin agenda of 'jobs and social justice'
would provide better living standards for working people, as the focus of
its European election campaign moved to the social chapter of the Maastricht
Treaty.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, outlined his party's
'positive approach' to the social chapter, arguing that it would guarantee
Britons 'the basic rights and standards enjoyed by every other worker in
Europe'.
As the first week of the Euro-election campaign drew to a close, Mr Prescott
interwove his call for social justice with another powerful attack on the
government's economic policy.
He accused the Conservatives of resurrecting 'the five great evils' outlined
by Sir William Beveridge, the pioneer of the welfare state, 50 years ago -
idleness, want, disease, squalor and ignorance.
However, in spite of calling again for full employment and a minimum wage,
the shadow employment secretary was careful not to be drawn too closely on
how these goals would be implemented.
He said the exact formula by which Labour would calculate a minimum wage was
'under constant review'. On the issue of full employment, he said that the
first aim of a Labour government would be to reduce the jobless total.
Labour's approach to the social chapter is similar to that outlined by the
Liberal Democrats earlier this week, in which they argued that the
government's lone refusal to sign was losing the UK money that would
otherwise have been available for training.
Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, has said that the
social chapter makes it 'absolutely clear that there are hundreds of
millions of pounds available specifically for the relief of unemployment and
for training'.
Mr Carlisle said last week that these funds could be 'targeted on areas of
most need.' He said Britain was contributing to the social chapter in any
case and the government was being 'incredibly cussed'.
Yesterday, Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, widened the
scope of that attack. He said funds intended to help the unemployed were
being blocked because of an unresolved policy dispute between Britain and
the European Commission.
Mr Beith said the government's insistence that regional structural funds be
concentrated on helping unemployed people was at the heart of the
controversy. The European Commission maintained that priority should be
accorded to plans for training people already in jobs.
He called on the government to 'sort this mess out'.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Three bootleggers jailed for cross-Channel racket
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three men who ran a cross-Channel smuggling ring, selling cheap French beer,
wine and champagne in Britain, were jailed yesterday.
The men were the ringleaders of an 11-man gang which made at least 42 trips
on the Dover-Calais ferry in three months, Cardiff Crown Court was told.
Vanloads of cheap drink were brought into the country and sold illegally at
Sunday markets and corner shops in south Wales. Two undercover teams of
Customs officers tracked vehicles between Kent and Cardiff in an operation
codenamed Chancer. Eleven men admitted their part in a conspiracy to evade
paying duty on beer and spirits.
Mr Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting, said it was estimated that Pounds 70,000 of
unpaid duty was involved between January and April last year when the gang
was operating the ring. Cases of beer, wine and champagne were brought to a
rented warehouse in Cardiff before being distributed to traders.
'It was a fairly slick operation,' said Mr Thomas.
Mr Ricardo Nichols, a former market trader, Mr Richard Spencer, a shopowner
and licensee, and Mr Raymond Tout, were jailed for terms of nine, four and
three months respectively. Judge Michael Burr said the gang had used 'an
army of helpers' in an organised conspiracy to flout the law and try to make
easy money. He ordered six other men to carry out community service and
conditionally discharged two others who had played a lesser role.
After the case Customs investigators said that the gang made up to four
cross- Channel trips a day, mainly to a hypermarket near Calais. The gang
went into business only three weeks after the new Customs laws came into
force on New Year's day last year.
The investigators added: 'We hope these jail sentences will be a big
deterrent to help tackle this widespread crime which is causing concern to
the retail industry.'
Two weeks ago, three bootleggers from Wolverhampton were jailed for six
months after admitting evading duty on beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes
worth more than Pounds 73,000.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Lib Dems urge Bottomley to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats last night called for the resignation of Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, the health secretary, after her department appeared to admit
conniving to block a Labour MP's backbench bill.
Ms Liz Lynne, the Liberal Democrat voice on health, said a parliamentary
written answer suggested that Mr Giles Radice's medicines information bill
was killed off in the same controversial way that a backbench bill seeking
to provide new rights for the disabled was blocked recently.
Branding the move 'a disgraceful abuse of parliamentary process', Ms Lynne
urged Mrs Bottomley to accept responsibility and resign.
'Clearly this government has used disgraceful tactics more than once,' Ms
Lynne said.
The answer - in the name of Mr Thomas Sackville, health minister - said that
amendments to Mr Radice's bill were drafted by parliamentary counsel on
instructions from departments and subsequently passed to backbench MPs. This
was done with the authority of ministers.
Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister responsible for the disabled, recently made
a similar admission about the civil rights disablement bill.
In apologising for misleading the House, Mr Scott admitted that amendments
had been prepared by parliamentary counsel in co-operation with DSS
officials and made available to Conservative backbenchers who opposed the
bill.
Lady Olga Maitland, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam, this week apologised to
the Commons for her role in blocking the bill. Lady Olga had claimed that
amendments in her name were 'mine and mine only' - an assertion later
contradicted by Mr Scott.
Mr Radice's bill was in effect killed a year ago after failing to complete
its report stage within time.
The bill sought to relax provisions in the 1968 medicines Act on the release
of information so that they restricted the publication only of genuine trade
secrets. Mr Radice also wanted to create rights to information on drug
safety.
Mr James Couchman, Tory MP for Gillingham, tried to introduce amendments
that could have wrecked the bill during its committee stage. Mr Couchman
declared an interest as an adviser to Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals group.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Ofgas is suspected as source of smear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search for the source of a smear campaign against Ms Clare Spottiswoode,
director-general of the gas regulator Ofgas, has shifted to the organisation
itself.
Suspicion that a disgruntled Ofgas official may be to blame comes after
press reports alleging that Ms Spottiswoode was having an affair with Mr
John Michell, a senior official of the Department of Trade and Industry who
helped select her.
The DTI investigated the allegations and said it had found no substance to
support them. There was speculation this week about the source of the
campaign to undermine Ms Spottiswoode in the run-up to her appearance on
Wednesday before the Commons committee on the environment.
Suspicion had fallen on those upset by her opposition to passing on to gas
consumers the cost of conservation projects promoted by the Energy Savings
Trust.
There was also speculation that parts of the gas industry, including some
'old guard' elements of British Gas, could have been involved.
But Ofgas officials now believe that the most damaging allegations are
likely to have come from a member of the Ofgas staff.
'We are trying to find out who has been leaking all this stuff. It's really
unfortunate but we think it's come from within Ofgas,' said one official.
Ms Spottiswoode, who took over from Sir James McKinnon last November, has
replaced his combative, adversarial approach to British Gas with a more
measured line.
Ofgas officials who were particularly close to Sir James are thought to be
unhappy with the change in emphasis.
They are also likely to have reacted badly to Ms Spottiswoode's now
withdrawn allegation that Sir James acted illegally in implementing schemes
connected to the trust.
Ofgas officials say no formal inquiry is yet under way.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Report beggars to the police, PM tells public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An effort to clear Britain's streets of beggars was urged by Mr John Major
yesterday.
The prime minister called on the public to be 'rigorous' in reporting
beggars to the police. He pointed out that they could be fined up to Pounds
1,000 and jailed for up to three years if they resorted to violence.
Mr Major's blunt condemnation of the increasing number of vagrants who
regularly beg in London and other city centres was fiercely attacked by
political opponents and officials of leading charities.
Mr John Battle, shadow housing minister, said the government should tackle
the real problems of poverty and homelessness.
Withdrawal of benefits for people aged 16 and 17 had forced many young
people on to the streets - and the benefits should be reinstated, he said.
Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, denounced the prime
minister's attack on the homeless as 'an absolute outrage'.
Mr Nick Hardwick, director of Centrepoint, the young people's charity, said
fining young beggars was daft.
'They simply have to beg to raise the money to pay it off again,' he said.
'What offends people is not the beggars themselves, but that in one of the
wealthiest countries in the world so many young people and others who cannot
look after themselves should be forced to beg.'
However, Mr Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for Eltham, said he had
encountered a man begging for food who had difficulty walking because his
pockets were 'full of cash'.
Mr Bottomley said: 'I bought him a hamburger, a Coke and chips. But he had
more money on him than I did.'
In an interview with the Bristol Evening Post, the prime minister insisted
that there could be no justification for people to be 'out on the street'.
Beggars were an eyesore and could drive tourists and shoppers away from
cities. They caused offence to many and their activities were particularly
damaging to areas dependent on tourism.
Mr Major maintained that the social security system made begging
unnecessary, and called on those responsible not to shrink from enforcing
the rigorous penalties that were available.
Asked if he thought people should report beggars to the police, the prime
minister replied: 'Yes certainly, most certainly.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / Prisoners' output replaces imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prisons are making their contribution to improving Britain's balance of
payments by manufacturing goods previously imported into the country - and
helping change attitudes to work among staff and inmates.
Longer working days and higher pay are being encouraged and prison
enterprises are making a growing contribution to prison running costs.
Strangeways prison in Manchester - refurbished at a cost of Pounds 80m after
being almost destroyed four years ago in Britain's worst prison riot -
yesterday announced a 35-hour working week for prisoners.
The prison has negotiated a contract with a Warrington company to make 2,000
polypropylene bulk containers a week, undercutting a supplier in Turkey.
Import substitution is one way to expand output without arousing allegations
of cheap prison labour undercutting outside suppliers and destroying local
jobs.
The containers - used for moving granular or powder products in palletised
loads - are to be marketed throughout Europe.
Other Strangeways prisoners carry out upholstery for a local furniture
company which used to buy finished products from France; now it imports the
wooden frames, which are completed in the prison workshops.
The Strangeways laundry has so many orders that Mr Pat Smith, the manager,
says he is starting double-shift working. Customers include local
restaurants, and Barnardos children's homes. The prisoners earn up to Pounds
10 a week.
There is another reward for co-operative behaviour at Strangeways - a
television set in the cell, which must be paid for from prison earnings.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Bank staff set to reach lowest total since 1985
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff working for big British banking groups are likely to fall this year to
the lowest total since 1985, British Bankers' Association figures suggest.
The total number of staff at the nine leading banks is expected to be below
300,000 this year, compared with last year's 300,100.
Part-time jobs are assuming greater importance, with their numbers remaining
reasonably stable - around the 48,000 mark - but rising by 500 between 1992
and 1993.
The figures also give a clear picture of how the high street banks operate,
showing a decline in the number of branches and an increase in the number of
cash machines.
Almost 11,500 branches were operated last year by the nine banking groups
covered by the statistics. This is the lowest total since 1983, when the
annual figures were first collected.
The rate of closures has fallen, however, since the sharp drops of 500 or
600 a year over the past few years.
Within the overall total, Abbey National and National Westminster Bank
increased their numbers of branches slightly. Co-operative Bank and
Yorkshire Bank also extended their branch networks to a limited degree.
The number of cash machines has already significantly outstripped the number
of branches, and for the high street banks could well exceed a total of
15,000 this year. Co-operative Bank, whose cash machine total rose from 89
to 119, had one of the biggest increases.
Customers' use of bank services is also reflected in the figures, which
reveal that the use of overdrafts is still falling while the proportion of
longer-term lending by individuals and companies continues to rise.
Use of plastic cards as a form of credit has continued to increase, the
association says, perhaps to some extent as a result of the declining use of
overdrafts.
The growing use of debit cards has been even more striking: the value of
retail transactions in which they are used rose from Pounds 1.7bn in 1989 to
Pounds 17.9bn in 1993.
The figures also confirm the banks' success in gaining mortgage business
last year, showing that they won almost 50 per cent of UK net mortgage
lending last year - about twice the 1983 proportion.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Cable company shrugs off float delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest, the UK's largest cable company, promised yesterday that its
decision to postpone a flotation will not affect the speed with which it
builds its cable networks.
Mr Stephen Davidson, TeleWest finance director, said the company would spend
around Pounds 200m this year building networks capable of providing
television and telephone services to between 350,000 and 400,000 homes.
'The rate will probably increase next year,' he said.
The company, owned by TCI of Denver - the world's largest cable operator -
and US West, the American telephone company, said it had postponed a
flotation that would have valued the company at around Pounds 1.7bn 'in the
light of current stock market weakness'.
The company said it would return to the markets when conditions were more
favourable. Autumn is possible, but next year looks more likely.
The company had been planning to sell only a minimum 25 per cent stake and
was not desperate for money. For instance, on Tuesday TeleWest completed a
Pounds 195m debt facility to pay for the construction of cable franchises in
Scotland.
Some industry specialists believed there could be as much as Pounds 1bn in
the London syndication markets earmarked for cable construction.
One reason that TeleWest had wanted to float was to give UK investors the
opportunity to invest in a US-owned cable company.
The decision was the third cable flotation postponed this week - following
General Cable and Comcast UK Partners.
There must now be doubt whether a further group, made up of Bell Canada
International and Jones Intercable, will be able to go ahead with plans for
an offering.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission,
was almost relieved yesterday that the flotations had been postponed. 'I
have been unhappy about some of the valuations. The prices were too far
ahead of the performance of the industry.'
He did not believe that the flotation decision would affect investment or
the speed at which cable networks would be built.
The latest figures from the ITC for the first quarter show modest gains by
the industry this year.
On April 1 the total number of subscribers was 642,000 compared with 611,000
on January 1. The penetration rate - the ratio of those who can subscribe to
those who actually do - dipped slightly from 21.9 per cent in January to
21.5 per cent on April 1. In the first quarter of last year the ratio was
21.6 per cent.
The average penetration figure hides considerable variations. Birmingham,
the most successful franchise in the UK, has a penetration rate of around 34
per cent.
The number of telephone subscribers to cable networks is growing much more
rapidly than television subscriptions. The total has risen from 314,000 in
January to 377,000 in April.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Differences emerge on Anglo-Irish blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Dublin are at odds over whether the framework agreement they hope
to complete for July's Anglo-Irish summit should contain an explicit
commitment by Dublin to rescind its constitutional claim over Northern
Ireland.
Details of these differences emerged as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, emphasised in a speech in Oxford that a settlement must win clear
approval from the province's nationalists as well as its unionists.
The two sides have made good progress on the document, which is designed to
help forge a durable political settlement in the province by spurring
political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties.
But there are believed to be two potential sticking-points.
The first concerns Dublin's move away from its claim on Ulster, and the
other is over whether the agreement should set out a specific blueprint for
Northern Ireland's future, as Dublin prefers, or simply provide a
starting-point for new talks, as London wishes.
Speaking just 24 hours after an informal meeting at Downing Street with Mr
John Major, Mr Reynolds said that consent was needed by 'both traditions to
a political framework that accommodates them both'.
Just as Dublin had accepted that Irish unity could only come through
consent, so unionists must accept that 'if Northern Ireland is for some time
to come to remain under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom . . . then
they too must win the consent of northern nationalists to the democratic
arrangements and structures under which this will happen'.
He added: 'The total domination of one community by another is no longer
acceptable as a basis for being governed.'
Hinting that Dublin may adopt a tough stance in behind-the-scenes talks on
the framework agreement, Mr Reynolds argued that the two governments'
acceptance of the principle of consent had 'implications' for the 1920
Government of Ireland Act, as well as for Ireland's constitution.
Though Dublin would support proposals for constitutional changes that 'fully
reflect' the principle of consent in Northern Ireland, the Irish Supreme
Court had already decided that the articles enshrining its territorial claim
were 'fully compatible' with the country's obligation in international law.
But Mr Reynolds combined his tough defence of the interests of northern
nationalists with a strong condemnation of republican and loyalist violence.
If violence continued, then Sinn Fein's quarrel would be 'not only with the
British government but with the rest of the Irish people', he said.
He called on unionists to tell loyalist paramilitaries that there was 'no
valid excuse or justification for continued violence of any kind'.

FT  28 MAY 94 / China opens airline sector to foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is opening its booming domestic airline business to foreign
participation on a limited basis. The move is certain to attract
considerable interest from the international aviation industry.
The official China Daily reported yesterday that foreign carriers would be
permitted to invest in local airlines or launch joint projects. Foreigners
would also be encouraged to invest in ground facilities such as the
operation of terminals and catering.
Foreign investment would be limited to 35 per cent, and voting rights could
not exceed 25 per cent, the newspaper quoted a government circular prepared
by the Civil Aviation Authority and Ministry of Trade as saying.
Although Beijing announced last year that it would allow foreign
participation in its domestic airlines, yesterday's statement reveals more
detail about the scope and nature of foreign investment.
China, whose annual rates of passenger growth of about 20 per cent are among
the world's highest, has been striving to upgrade its domestic airlines and
facilities, but has found it almost impossible to cope with the huge and
growing demand in this latest phase of its economic liberalisation.
The official circular specified that in the case of joint venture airlines
and ground facilities the positions of chairman and general manager should
go to Chinese. Other positions could be filled by foreigners.
The directive said airlines with foreign investment would be treated equally
with airlines owned and operated exclusively by the government.
International carriers have long been eyeing the Chinese market. A western
airline executive said yesterday that China had the 'potential of being the
largest airline market in the world ..virtually every airline is
interested'.
China now has more than 30 regional airlines and has declared for the moment
a moratorium on the licensing of new carriers following a rash of accidents
and near misses.
Foreign airlines have already made a start in attempts to become more
involved in China's aviation business. Lufthansa, for example, has a joint
venture with Air China which provides aircraft maintenance at Beijing
capital airport.
Qantas, the Australian carrier, has an aicraft maintenance joint venture
with China Southern airlines based in Guangzhou and Thai Airways is training
cabin crews for the Guangzhou-based carrier.
Boeing is close to clinching a Dollars 5bn deal to supply 50 jets to China
following President Clinton's decision to extend most favoured nation
status.
Under the agreement the Chinese could order as many as 15 each of Boeing's
new twin-engine 777 jets, the mid-size 757s and smaller 737s. They may also
buy several wide-bodied 747-400 jumbos.

FT  28 MAY 94 / UK backs Virgin-Delta pact on transatlantic route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANNECY, FRANCE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain yesterday said it was ready to approve the transatlantic airline
partnership between Virgin Atlantic Airways and Delta Air Lines to encourage
greater competition and consumer choice on flights from London's Heathrow
airport to the US market. A formal announcement from the department of
transport is expected on Tuesday.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said he was pressing Mr Federico
Pena, his US counterpart, to approve a Virgin-Delta deal as soon as
possible.
During a meeting of European transport ministers at Annecy, which Mr Pena
attended as an observer, Mr MacGregor said he was prepared to offer US
airlines greater access to UK regional airports as well as London's
Stanstead airport as part of a package on air transport liberalisation,
including US approval of the Virgin-Delta deal.
It was the first face to face meeting between the two transport secretaries
since last September. In December, the US walked away from negotiations on
liberalisation following the UK's refusal to open up immediately London's
Heathrow airport to all US carriers.
Instead, the UK has proposed a gradual approach to open skies between the
two countries and has become increasingly frustrated at the US refusal to
return to the negotiating table with constructive counter-proposals.
Mr Pena is facing conflicting pressures from US airlines which have made his
negotiating position difficult. American Airlines, one of the two largest US
carriers, has been pressing Washington to block negotiations unless the UK
opens up Heathrow, the world's largest airport, immediately.
TWA has also opposed the Virgin-Delta partnership, while Delta this week
urged the US government to approve the pact.
The two companies' partnership includes a ticket code-sharing deal which
would give the US airline access into Heathrow.
Under the current aviation agreement only American Airlines and United
Airlines can fly into Heathrow.
Mr MacGregor said the Virgin-Delta partnership would increase competition on
transatlantic routes from London. It would also provide more consumer choice
without putting additional pressure on scarce landing slots at Heathrow
since Delta would be buying about Pounds 100m-worth of seats a year on
Virgin transatlantic flights to Heathrow. The UK has seen the partnership as
a lever to reopen talks on a wider open-skies agreement with the US.
Mr MacGregor said approval of a Virgin-Delta deal would demonstrate 'in a
practical and constructive way that the UK was trying to make progress in
its efforts to liberalise air services between the two countries.'
Mr Pena was unable to give Mr MacGregor any assurances on the Virgin-Delta
deal because the US administration was still receiving representations on
the partnership from other US carriers.

FT  28 MAY 94 / BP fights to end ban on Alaska oil exports: The British
company could benefit by Dollars 100m if allowed to sell crude to Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The battle to lift a 20-year ban on exporting oil from Alaska is about to
break out again.
The ban was imposed by Congress in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab oil
embargo, when the US was loathe to do anything that could increase its
dependence on foreign oil.
A repeal of the ban would improve revenues for both the state of Alaska and
the main oil producers in the state, the biggest of which is British
Petroleum.
The Export Administration Act, one of four overlapping statutes that
implement the ban, is due to expire at the end of June. Senators Frank
Murkowski and Ted Stevens of Alaska are expected to use the debate to try to
persuade Congress to allow North Slope oil, which accounts for nearly a
quarter of the US's 6.6m barrels a day oil output, to be shipped to Asia.
Preliminary results of an Energy Department study, tend to support an end to
the ban. The study reportedly shows a gain of 6,000 jobs in the Alaskan and
Californian oil industries, largely by encouraging Californian producers who
are now swamped by Alaskan oil.
The study also shows an increase in federal royalties and taxes of Dollars
284m, and no significant impact on petrol prices in California. Although
lifting the ban is likely to push up west coast crude prices by about
Dollars 1 a barrel, officials believe Californian refiners, who enjoy wider
margins than elsewhere in the US, would be able to absorb the increased
cost.
Another factor is the stance of the seafarers' trade union, a traditional
supporter of the ban because the Alaskan oil must be carried in US built and
flagged ships with US crews if it is shipped to another US state.
The union is apparently ready to agree to a deal with BP as long as any
exports are carried in US tankers, although they have yet to publicly
announce this.
BP, unlike Arco and Exxon, the two other major Alaskan producers, has no
refinery on the US west coast, so it must either sell to independent
refiners in the glutted California market, or face additional pipeline costs
through Texas or across Panama to reach Gulf coast refineries.
It would like to sell its Alaskan oil to Japan, or at least have that option
to strengthen its hand in price negotiations with the Californian buyers.
Analysts suggest BP could gain around Dollars 100m a year from the lifting
of the ban, through a combination of lower transport costs and higher
prices. It costs about Dollars 2 a barrel for BP to ship Alaskan oil to Gulf
of Mexico refineries, compared with about Dollars 1.25 a barrel to the US
west coast or Asia.
Arguments about US energy security, strong when the ban was first imposed,
have diminished, and the idea of making a dent in the US trade deficit with
Japan remains appealing.
BP is also likely to have argued that lifting the ban would encourage it to
invest more in expanding Alaskan production.
But the ban still has a strong coalition of supporters.
Environmentalists were instrumental in the first ban, which was imposed as a
quid pro quo in Congress's approval of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. They fear
that allowing exports of North Slope oil could add to pressure to extract
oil within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge - although some energy
officials argue that it might reduce pressure on ANWR by encouraging
producers to invest more in existing fields.
And although the seafarers appear to have been won over, not all maritime
interests are in favour. Shipyards fear that tanker owners might repair
their vessels in Asia, while the Maritime Administration of the
Transportation Department disputes the analysis of job gains and losses in
the Energy Department report.
The opposition of independent refiners in California is reinforced by that
of two of the principal outlets for the west coast oil surplus: the
Trans-Panama pipeline, built to handle oil shipped to refineries along the
Gulf coast, but now coping with just a fraction of its former throughput,
and the Hess refinery in the US Virgin Islands, which receives about 100,000
barrels a day of North Slope crude.
State Department officials have voiced concern at the protectionist
implications of enshrining BP's deal with the seafarers union in law, while
some Commerce officials are concerned about putting an avoidable hurdle in
the way of the renewal of their Export Administration Act.
If, however, the Energy Department study emerges more or less intact from
the process of inter-agency review, it could lend powerful ammunition to the
Alaskan senators in next month's battle.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Japan threatens to quit whaling commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan yesterday threatened to withdraw from the International Whaling
Commission following its decision to establish a whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic Ocean.
Officials at the ministry of agriculture, forestry and fisheries said the
government would consider what action to take when it had heard the full
report of the Japanese delegation to the IWC when it returned to Tokyo next
week. But they said Japan's departure from the commission could not be ruled
out.
At the meeting in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, the IWC agreed to ban all whaling
in more than 28 million square kilometres around Antarctica.
The ban is expected to protect 90 per cent of the world's whales, which feed
in the waters of the southern hemisphere. It was supported by 23 member
countries and opposed by Japan alone. China, South Korea and four other
countries abstained. Norway, the other significant whaling nation, did not
take part in the vote.
A succession of senior ministers swiftly denounced the decision. The chief
cabinet secretary, Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, said: 'We cannot say it is a
scientific decision. The Japanese government regrets it.'
Mr Koji Kakizawa, the foreign minister, said that debate over the sanctuary
should be based on scientific and research data, claiming that the
population of minke whales in the region, the main object of the
commission's ruling, was actually increasing.
Japan has 90 days in which to lodge a complaint against the decision, and
seems likely to do so.
Japan has threatened to withdraw from the commission in the past but has
failed to do so in order to avoid international condemnation.
Mr Mutsuki Kato, the fisheries minister, suggested that, short of
withdrawal, other options would include a detailed review of Japan's
significant financial contribution to the IWC.
But it was also possible that the government would seek an exemption from
the whaling ban or simply ignore it. The commission has no power to enforce
its edicts which have proved flexible in the past.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Arafat's Jerusalem plan sparks rumpus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have begun a battle of
words over the most sensitive element of their conflict: the future of
Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital.
The final status of the city, united under Israeli rule when Arab East
Jerusalem was captured by Israeli troops in the 1967 Six Day War, is
intended to be resolved in negotiations due to begin in about two years'
time.
But a draft Palestinian constitution, published this week with the appparent
approval of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, proclaims that 'Jerusalem is
the capital of Palestine.' Mr Arafat's aides have been saying for several
weeks that the chairman intends to visit the city during his trip to
newly-autonomous Jericho next month, and lead a prayer march to the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem's Old City.
When Mr Arafat's plans to visit the city were first publicised, aides to
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin indicated privately that there would be no
government opposition. But the city's mayor, Mr Ehud Olmert, who is also a
Knesset member from the right-wing Likud opposition, has threatened to bring
500,000 demonstrators into the streets to ensure Mr Arafat is kept out of
town. Mr Rabin now appears to have registered the symbolic significance of a
triumphant Arafat-led procession through the city. On Wednesday, he convened
a meeting in his office of senior ministers and police, army and security
chiefs, to discuss PLO attempts to focus attention on Jerusalem and assert
Palestinian rights in the eastern half of the city, where more than 150,000
Palestinians reside. Mr Moshe Shahal, the minister of police, intimated
after the meeting that Mr Arafat was unlikely to receive an Israeli
government invitation to visit.
In a speech yesterday, Mr Rabin declared that Israel would block any PLO
effort to set up official institutions in Jerusalem. 'All the Palestinian
self-government centres will be in Jericho,' he said, 'as we and they have
agreed and committed ourselves to in writing." No official date has yet been
set for Mr Arafat's trip.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Japanese inflation subsides to 0.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese inflation sank again last month, falling to 0.8 per cent a year
from 1.3 per cent in March.
Meanwhile government forecasters admitted that they still could not see the
bottom of the recession.
The inflation figure is in line with market expectations, but adds fresh
weight to fears that the economy is on the brink of deflation. The slowdown
has continued into May, according to figures for Tokyo consumer prices, up
0.6 per cent this month, as against 0.8 per cent in April. A reduction in
the rate of increase in home rents - a result of falling property values -
was the main factor, said an agency official.
This is the latest in a recent series of poor economic figures, which have
caused official forecasters to soften earlier cautious suggestions that the
worst was over. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday
maintained that 'the basis for movement for recovery is being prepared' but
admitted he was still seeking proof that the bottom had been reached.
Mr Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the government's economic planning
agency, was even more cautious. 'As of now we can't see the bottom' and the
economy remained in an 'extremely severe' state, he said.
Gerard Baker adds: Japan was the world's largest creditor nation in 1993 for
the third consecutive year, according to a report from the country's finance
ministry.
Net overseas assets grew for a 12th year, to reach Dollars 610.8bn at the
end of 1993, up by 18.9 per cent on a year earlier.

FT  28 MAY 94 / MFN Renewal for China: Mr Clinton eats humble pie in Asia -
Why the US president caved in over human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration came to office promising to put economics on the
front burner of foreign policy and give Asia, the fastest-growing economic
region, a focus at least equivalent to that enjoyed for decades by western
Europe.
But there was a gap between conception and execution that not even President
Bill Clinton's Asian trip last summer and the first-ever Apec summit last
November could bridge. Whatever its good intentions, the US remained at
severe odds with both China and Japan, the two most important Asian powers.
This week, Washington has twice made amends. On Monday it agreed with Japan
to re-open trade negotiations on terms that remain ambiguous in the extreme
but which certainly have broken a painful impasse. On Thursday, Mr Clinton
said he would renew China's most favoured nation trading status without
reference to its human rights record.
Earlier this month, Mr Winston Lord, the subtle undersecretary of state for
Asian affairs, wrote a memorandum to his boss, Mr Warren Christopher,
outlining what he saw as a real problem. An essential passage ran as
follows:
'A series of American measures - threatened or employed - risk corroding our
positive image in the region, giving ammunition to those charging we are an
international nanny, if not a bully. Without proper course adjustments, we
could subvert our influence and our interests.'
Mr Clinton himself acknowledged that 'course adjustment' very frankly on
Thursday evening. Difficult though it was for him to lower the banner of
human rights on which he had campaigned for the presidency and which formed
the basis for his executive order coupling trade preferences and Chinese
civil liberties, his concerns had to be balanced against other factors.
'China has an atomic arsenal and a vote and a veto in the UN security
council,' he said. 'It is a major factor in Asian and global security. We
share important interests, such as in a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and in
sustaining the global environment. China is also the world's fastest growing
economy. Over Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn) of US exports last year supported
more than 150,000 American jobs.'
He even conceded the merits of the arguments of those who contend that
economic and political progress are inter-linked. 'Will we do more to
advance the cause of human rights if China is isolated, or if our nations
are engaged in a growing web of political and economic co-operation and
contacts?' President George Bush never put it better.
Mr Christopher, perhaps the staunchest human rights advocate inside the
administration, refused to admit that the strategy of last summer was
misconceived. He argued in a television interview that at least it brought
Congress and the administration together on China, ending years when both
had been at 'loggerheads'.
But he added, 'I think it was always difficult for the Chinese to do what we
had asked', especially in releasing political prisoners. Philosophically, he
went on, 'we'll be keeping steady pressure on through other instruments in a
way that may cause them to make more progress in the future.'
All Mr Christopher got on Thursday was a handful of modest sanctions on
Chinese munitions, a Dollars 200m drop in the ocean of Dollars 40bn
bilateral trade, and a few promises to spend a little more on human rights
propaganda. It may be doubted that US companies will do much to enforce the
'voluntary set of principles for business activity in China' commended by Mr
Clinton.
The problem with Japan has been of an entirely different political
dimension. The last two governments in Tokyo have been weak, whereas
Beijing's has proved itself capable of thumbing its nose at the US. But
trade pressure on Japan appeared to be producing diminishing returns.
In arriving at pragmatic solutions, the administration found itself under
growing pressure from a variety of powerful commercial lobbies in Washington
and elsewhere. Britain insistently chipped in that a trade confrontation
with China was bound to have a deleterious effect on the economy of Hong
Kong in the run-up to the resumption of Chinese control in 1997.
But the critical political calculation that made this spring different from
last summer surely lay in the shift in sentiment in Congress, itself the
target of much lobbying.
Much as human rights advocates like Senator George Mitchell, the majority
leader, and Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi continued to press their case on
moral grounds, many who had supported the executive order on China began to
question the wisdom of its logic if it put American exports and jobs at
risk.
Whatever the threats of additional legislation from Capitol Hill, the
political line-up on China now resembles that of the Nafta debate, where the
coalition of labour and liberal interests, who voted for Mr Clinton in 1992,
proved insufficient to stop free trade with Mexico and Canada.
This realisation strengthened the hand of those inside the administration
who have put much effort in the US export promotion drive, which has already
produced dividends with large aircraft and telecommunications deals with
Saudi Arabia and which eyes China greedily. Boeing, for example, could only
describe as 'premature' reports that it was close to landing a Dollars
5bn-plus order by China.
The treasury and commerce departments responded to the wishes of their
domestic constituencies, with the former increasingly concerned that the
impasse with Japan was disturbing international currency markets. Mr Robert
Rubin, the self-effacing but influential head of the White House national
economic council, was also reluctant to push China to the hilt.
Whether the 'new Asia', which, with Singapore and Malaysia in the vanguard,
has taken to lecturing the US on its own shortcomings, will respond to a
clear shift in US policy remains to be seen. But the invitation, issued by
Mr Clinton at the cost of ditching some old friends and eating some humble
pie, is at least on the table.

respectability

<TEXT>
It is not the smallest of ironies that on the eve of the fifth anniversary
of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre China, with President Clinton's help, has
taken another and substantial step in its long march back to international
respectability.
The US decision to extend China's most favoured nation trade status for
another year virtually without conditions and to propose that the linkage
between trade and human rights be severed could hardly have come as a more
welcome development for Beijing.
Five years after Chinese tanks blasted demonstrators on the streets of the
capital to worldwide disgust, China's international rehabilitation is well
on the way to being formalised; although its human rights transgressions are
certain to continue to be an irritant to its relations with the West.
While Western states maintain military sanctions, even these bans are
weakening. Judging by increased military exchanges between China and the
West it is only a matter of time before restrictions on arms sales are
removed.
From China's standpoint, among the more important consequences of the mfn
decision is that another obstacle has been removed that might interfere with
its manifest ambition of becoming a world trading power to match its
political aspirations.
In the short term, Mr Clinton's decision should also ensure that China
becomes a more active participant in regional forums such as the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation forum which is emerging as a potential
cornerstone of US policy in the Pacific.
Indeed, China's foreign ministry yesterday referred to the opportunities for
an enhanced regional partnership. 'China and the United States sharebroad
interests,' it said. 'The current situation offers an historical opportunity
for the enhancement of Sino-American relations.'
The US decision will certainly have a positive impact on the Apec summit to
be held in Jakarta later this year to be attended by, among others, Mr
Clinton and Mr Jiang Zemin, his Chinese counterpart,
The mfn decision is also likely to facilitate China's negotiations to rejoin
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and its successor World
Trade Organisation. An early indication of progress on this front will come
in Washington late next week when Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief Gatt
negotiator, begins bilateral talks with US officials on the Gatt issue.
Gatt negotiations, which have proceeded in fits and start partly because of
US diffidence, are likely to accelerate. The chances of China becoming a
founder member of the WTO when it comes into being at the beginning of 1995
have been enhanced.
Perhaps the most important consequence of the mfn decision is its likely
impact on the fractious Sino-US relationship itself. As the 21st century
approaches and with it what is widely expected to be the era of the Pacific
there is scarcely a more important partnership. Mr Clinton has made possible
a less rancorous and more constructive relationship. But he has not waved a
magic wand. Differences will persist with the West over human rights and
other issues.
If the process of the past year has demonstrated anything, it is that China
will be tough and combative in defence of what it perceives to be its own
interests.

'hypocritical' US

Human rights groups reacted angrily to the decision to extend China's most
favoured nation trading status, accusing Mr Clinton of removing all pressure
on the Chinese to improve their human rights practices.
'Clinton has left his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical,
while the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed,
uncompromising, and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by this decision,'
said Ms Sidney Jones, the executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia.
The consensus view among western officials in Beijing is that the
administration bungled the mfn-human rights issue from the start by
insisting on linkage and has suffered embarrassment as a consequence.
'The lesson here for a young and inexperienced American president when
dealing with the dragon throne is that you better be prepared and have a
carefully-thought-out strategy,' said one diplomat.
Western officials expressed concern that China's apparent 'victory' on the
vexed mfn issue would strengthen the hands of hardliners in the leadership
who advocate an uncompromising stance on human rights.
American business in China welcomed the decision. Mr Phil Carmichael,
president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, predicted that 'a
lot of deals with be concluded' and that US trade deficit with China would
shrink.
Sino-US two-way trade reached Dollars 40.3bn (Pounds 26.8bn) last year, an
increase of 21.8 per cent over the year before. The balance in China's
favour reached Dollars 22.8bn, a 25.3 per cent jump over 1992.
Human Rights Watch/Asia warned that the MFN decision left 'outspoken
intellectuals, workers, and religious activists' more vulnerable to
persecution and arrest 'given that Chinese leaders understand that a
crackdown would not bring about a disruption of trade'.
It said that in spite of claims to the contrary by the administration,
severe restriction remained on Chinese emigration; exports of prison-made
goods continued; no agreement had been reached on Red Cross access to
Chinese prisons; and 'no progress' had been made in curbing human rights
abuses in Tibet.
The group called on Congress to authorise Mr Clinton to raise tariffs on all
exports from China by 10 per cent across the board. 'This would not destroy
US-China trade, but it would require China to pay a significant price for
not fulfilling conditions laid down last year for mfn renewal.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / German inflation 'beaten' at 2.9%: Early cuts in key
interest rates unlikely, Bonn adviser says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
German inflation is beaten, but cuts in key interest rates are unlikely in
the near future, leading officials said yesterday.
'The Bundesbank has won the battle against inflation,' said Mr Wolfgang
Franz, one of the 'five wise men' on the Bonn government's council of
economic advisers.
The annual rate of consumer price rises had fallen to 2.9 per cent this
month, and if the effects of administered prices - charges for local and
federal government services - were excluded, it would be just over 2 per
cent, he said.
Speaking in an interview with a domestic news agency, Mr Franz ducked
questions on the possibility of further interest rate cuts raised by falling
inflation. That was more Bundesbank territory, he said.
But Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank president, made plain there was
little likelihood of change.
His remark earlier this week that 'the horizon for rates was now cleared for
some time' - which caused this week's sharp fall in German stock markets -
related only to the discount and Lombard rates, he said on radio.
It was obvious that money market levels - including the repo rate at which
the bank supplies short-term liquidity to the markets - must be able to move
freely in the range of the 4.5 per cent discount and the 6 per cent Lombard,
he added.
His explanation seemed to be intended to clear up any lingering doubts still
unsettling local and international financial markets.
Mr Franz said he and his colleagues were investigating the persistent strong
growth in money supply behind the Bundesbank's decision to put rates on
hold.
However, he had more positive views on the economy. West German gross
domestic product would grow by 'a good 1 per cent' this year, he said.
Whether that meant 1.3 or 1.5 per cent could not be discerned from the
available data.
Mr Herbert Hax, the council chairman, said separately yesterday that 1.5 per
cent real growth was possible this year.
Although the council does not issue interim reports, yesterday's statements
suggest a marked change of heart.
In its formal forecast last November, the council's prediction of stagnation
in the west ran counter to government and economic institutes' expectations
of 1 to 1.5 per cent growth.
Opinions on prospects from all acknowledged expert sources are now broadly
in line.

German car, bus and truck output rose 5 per cent in April, bringing total
production in the first four months almost level with the comparable period
last year, according to the VDA industry association, Christopher Parkes
writes.
A 4 per cent rise in exports last month brought the total shipped abroad in
the four months to 761,400 units, a rise of 2 per cent overall.
The association, noting that total output rose 10 per cent, said car
production last month increased to 350,900 units from 333,754 a year
earlier.
Light-truck makers suffered further from weak demand, with production down
almost 2,700 at 10,500 units.

Spain replaced its chief public prosecutor yesterday in the latest in a
series of high-level resignations over the last four weeks. The departure of
the controversial Mr Eligio Hernandez was not directly related to recent
corruption cases. However, his impartiality had been called into question by
opposition parties. A government spokesman denied that the move was
connected to a forthcoming Supreme Court decision on Mr Hernandez's
qualifications for the job, and said Mr Hernandez was leaving at his own
request, submitted a fortnight ago.
Professional legal associations challenged his appointment in 1992 on the
grounds that he did not fulfil the criterion of 15 years' experience in the
judiciary. The cabinet named Mr Carlos Granados, a Supreme Court judge, to
replace him.

The Greek drachma rallied yesterday against both the D-Mark and the US
dollar, as overseas investors poured in foreign currency to buy next week's
issues of Ecu- and US dollar-linked government bonds, with interest rates
set at over 7 per cent. The drachma closed at DM149, up from DM150.1 and at
Dollars 245.7, up from Dollars 246.4.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou claimed the battle to avert devaluation
'is still critical but has been won,' saying that short-term interest rates,
now at record levels, would start coming down next week. However, economists
predict renewed pressure on the Greek currency as soon as interest rates
decline. They said the government would be forced to accept a faster
depreciation of the drachma over the next few weeks.

<TEXT>
Spain's escalating labour costs are being sharply reduced as unions settle
for below-inflation salary increases in the 1994 round of collective wage
agreements. An annual pay increase over the next two years of 2.75 per cent
covering 150,000 bank employees, which was signed yesterday, followed an
agreement with unions for a 2.5 per cent wage rise in the construction
industry. Year-on-year headline inflation is currently 4.9 per cent and is
expected to fall to 3.5-4 per cent by the end of this year.
Mr Ignacio Montejo, chief economist at Madrid brokers FG, forecasts that
average wage increases through Spain this year will be within the 2-3 per
cent range and that unit labour costs will rise by 1.5 per cent against an
increase of 3 per cent in 1993. For most of the past decade Spain's unit
labour costs rose between 5 and 8 per cent a year.

<TEXT>
A consortium including RWE, the utility, and Deutsche Bank yesterday won the
contract to operate a data transmission network in Germany, a market worth
DM2bn (Pounds 800m) annually.
The contract marks another step towards the deregulation of
telecommunications in Germany, a process due to be completed by 1998
following the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.
The new company, called Gesellschaft fur Datenfunk (GfD), will compete
against DeTeMobil, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, so far the only company
to provide data transmission services. GfD said it would spend DM500m to
build about 1,500 stations across Germany through which it would relay data
on short wave to subscribers using portable computers and modems.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post minister, said the RWE-led consortium was
technically better than another bid led by Viag, the industrial
conglomerate. Viag, one of Germany's 10 largest companies in sales terms,
said it was 'somewhat surprised' to have lost the bid. Only days ago the
group said it was confident of winning the contract, arguing that IBM -
which had a 5 per cent stake in the consortium - had unrivalled experience
in data transmission with Ardis, one of the world's largest networks which
it built up in the US.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Conference on stability skips Balkan problems
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday got its new 'conference on stability' in
eastern Europe and the Baltics under way, at the price of setting aside
contentious Balkan issues, including disputes between Greece and Albania and
Italy and Slovenia. Two regional round tables dealing with central European
and Baltic issues would be convened 'at the earliest opportunity' by the EU,
as part of 'a new impetus' agreed by the foreign ministers and officials
from more than 40 participating countries, whose aim is to settle ethnic and
border disputes before the former communist states enter the Union.
The general consensus was reached despite rumbling disagreements. Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said Russia, which sees itself as the
protector of the rights of ethnic Russians, was awaiting full details of the
composition and scope of the Baltic round table before deciding. Slovenia,
which aspires to EU membership, was struck off the list of full participants
at the insistence of the new Italian government. Rome's refusal to discuss
border issues with its Slav neighbours was criticised by Mr Lojze Peterle,
Slovenia's foreign minister, but he agreed to continue bilateral talks. At
the closing session Albania's foreign minister, Mr Alfred Serreqi, attacked
the Greek government for 'dangerous and unacceptable manipulation' of the
Greek minority in Albania. But Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's European
affairs minister, used his position as EU president and conference chairman
to overrule the Albanian complaint.

The European Commission is heading for a confrontation with the new Italian
government over subsidies paid to steel producers.
Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner for competition, said yesterday he had
asked his staff to prepare proceedings against the Italians, following the
collapse of the European Union's steel rescue plan last week.
Government aid paid to steel mills in the northern Brescia region in return
for capacity cuts was, until last week, permitted under the rescue plan.
Since the plan's collapse, the subsidies have fallen foul of the
Commission's rules on state subsidies.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Van Miert said he would play no
part in reviving the rescue plan which collapsed after Brussels rejected his
proposals for capacity cuts.
'I have a minimum of dignity,' said Mr Van Miert. 'I am not coming back.
This is the end.'
The Commission's action will present Mr Vito Gnutti, Italy's new industry
minister, with a difficult challenge. It may also evoke the wrath of Italy's
Euro-sceptics, who are urging the new government to take a tougher line with
Brussels.
Mr Van Miert's determination to follow normal Commission procedure, in spite
of protests that the plan could yet be rescued, will also cause
consternation in the steel industry. The industry was relying on Brussels to
salvage the plan, launched 18 months ago to reduce overcapacity in the
recession-torn sector.
Under the plan Italy would have restructured its steel sector in return for
production cuts. But a proposal to cut capacity at mills in Brescia in
return for subsidies was rejected last week when commissioners questioned
the legality of the payments.
Mr Van Miert said there were now no viable alternatives to achieving the
plan's minimum 19m tonnes of capacity cuts. One option would be to proceed
under article 95 of the European coal and steel treaty which allows state
subsidies to be paid to companies, but only after unanimous consent from the
Council of Ministers. Mr Van Miert said that procedure would delay action
for so long that it would amount, in effect, to the plan's collapse.
The new cabinet of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday passed a
series of decrees to boost employment and pull Italy out of its worst
economic recession since the second world war, Reuter reports from Rome.
The media tycoon's free-market government set aside some L500bn (Pounds
209m) to boost youth employment over the next three years and help business
in the building sector which has been ravaged by two years of corruption
scandals.
Over 150,000 construction jobs have been lost in the past two years.

<TEXT>
Mr George Ball, the diplomat who battled against the widening of the Vietnam
war by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, has died, aged 84.
A lawyer by training who served in the war-time Lend Lease Administration
created to help the UK against Germany, Mr Ball was recruited by President
Kennedy in 1961 on the basis of his European expertise to serve as assistant
secretary of state for economic affairs.
Within a year, he was number two in the department and, in spite of many
internal disagreements over US policies towards Indochina and Cuba, remained
there until his resignation in 1966 shortly after crucial decisions to
expand the war were agreed over his opposition or in his absence. He later
served briefly as interim US ambassador to the UN at the tail-end of LBJ's
term.
Years later, Mr Ball wrote that US intervention in Vietnam had been 'a
defeat for our political authority and moral influence abroad and for our
sense of mission and cohesion at home'.

FT  28 MAY 94 / German vehicle output increases 5% for April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German car, bus and truck output rose 5 per cent in April, bringing total
production in the first four months almost level with the comparable period
last year, according to the VDA industry association, Christopher Parkes
writes.
A 4 per cent rise in exports last month brought the total shipped abroad in
the four months to 761,400 units, a rise of 2 per cent overall.
The association, noting that total output rose 10 per cent, said car
production last month increased to 350,900 units from 333,754 a year
earlier.
Light-truck makers suffered further from weak demand, with production down
almost 2,700 at 10,500 units, while output of 'other' commercial vehicles
showed continuing growth, expanding 27 per cent to 9,700.
This sector, the only part of the motor industry showing consistent
improvement, has stepped up manufacture 9 per cent in the first four months
and increased exports 25 per cent. Car exports rose 2 per cent to the end of
April.
According to the VDA incoming domestic and foreign orders for new cars rose
last month, supporting a report of 'pleasing' developments from German
distributors.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Kohl warns on EU contributions: Funding of Union becomes big
issue in German Euro-elections

Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday warned that Germany had reached the limit
of its financial contributions to the European Union, and called for future
budget payments to be linked more closely to per capita incomes.
In the stormiest debate so far in Germany's European election campaign, Mr
Kohl sought to counter a rising tide of criticism of the country's
contributions to the EU budget.
He was facing an accusation from Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the
opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), that the government was guilty of
'gross negligence' in fixing its budget contributions without proper regard
for the soaring costs of German unification.
In a formal government declaration to the German parliament on European
policy, Mr Kohl said that those member states with income levels comparable
to Germany's should assume greater financial responsibility.
At the same time Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said the government would
refuse to approve any new EU programme which was financed according to the
'old key'. Finance Ministry officials were unable to clarify his statement
last night, but it suggests that he will be seeking an adjustment of
Germany's budget contributions before approving any new spending areas
beyond those already included in EU budget headings.
He pointed out that Germany had sunk from second to sixth place in the
prosperity-ranking for EU member states, although it remained by far the
largest net contributor to the Brussels budget. He added that Bonn would
reject any attempt to finance the budget with greater use of borrowing.
The harsh line on EU financing from Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel comes in response
to a wave of criticism in Germany over the country's net contributions to
the EU budget, which reached Ecu9bn (Pounds 6.9bn) in 1992. The question has
become a big issue in the current European election campaign.
Mr Scharping, accused the government of agreeing to a German budget
contribution fixed up to 1999, without taking any account of the loss of
German per capita income since unification.
In a sharp attack on the government's record in Brussels, he insisted that
Germany's budget contribution was at least DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) higher than
it should be, aggravated by a further DM1.2bn contribution to the British
budget rebate.
The confrontation in the German Bundestag came in an emergency debate on
European policy, summoned specifically to answer the challenges emerging in
the current European election campaign.
Mr Kohl also spoke out on his commitment to European economic and monetary
union, stressing that maintenance of the strict economic convergence
criteria for a single currency was more important than keeping strictly to
the present timetable.
'We do not want in any way to postpone the deadlines,' he said, 'but
realistically I must stress that the correct priority must be to stick to
the stability criteria in the first place, while the question of the
timetable must take second place. That must be clearly said.'

FT  28 MAY 94 / 3i likely to be valued at Pounds 1.6bn in June flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i, Europe's largest investor in unquoted companies, yesterday paved the way
for a public share offer that is likely to value the British company at
about Pounds 1.6bn. The flotation will be one of the year's largest share
issues and the biggest UK investment trust ever launched.
The listing will give private investors their first opportunity to buy
shares in a group that has taken equity stakes in a wide range of small
unquoted businesses since it was formed as the Industrial and Commercial
Finance Corporation in 1945.
3i has investments valued at Pounds 3bn in 3,400 small UK businesses and has
a strong bias towards manufacturing companies.
Seven leading commercial banks and the Bank of England, which own 3i, plan
to sell about 40 per cent of the equity. A quarter of this will be made
available to private investors, according to the pathfinder prospectus which
was published yesterday. The offer is scheduled to be launched on June 22.
The current weakness of the stock market prompted some analysts to wonder
yesterday whether the shareholders might consider pulling the issue in a
repeat of the embarrassing postponement 14 months ago when some banks
believed the likely float price was too low.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive, would not comment on the market fall
or whether there was any chance of the issue being postponed. In the past,
he has said the issue would be pulled 'over my dead body'.
If the market continues to fall before the issue is priced, the banks are
likely to proceed but sell less than the planned 40 per cent of their
stakes.
'The issue is very important in the totality of the unquoted market and in
terms of the whole function of getting venture capital into the
marketplace,' one analyst said.
In the year to March 31, 3i's net assets rose 39.1 per cent to Pounds
1.85bn, after including the write-back of a Pounds 152m provision for
deferred tax. That provision will not be needed once 3i floats and becomes
an investment trust that is exempt from capital gains tax.
The issue will be priced at a discount to this net asset value. Even though
3i is most likely to attract long-term investors, the discount may have to
widen to make the shares attractive to investors if the market is still
depressed before June 22.
3i has set up a share information office and a 'retail brokers' scheme' to
encourage private investors to register early for application forms. Early
registration will not confer extra allocation of shares. The adviser to the
issue is Baring Brothers and brokers are BZW, James Capel and National
Westminster.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Markets tumble on inflation fears: Upward revision of US
growth estimates to 3% provokes sharp reaction in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European financial markets fell sharply yesterday as an upward revision of
growth estimates for the US economy in the first-quarter rekindled fears of
inflation and further rises in interest rates.
The Commerce Department in Washington lifted its growth estimate for the
period to an annual rate of 3 per cent from 2.6 per cent, well above
expectations and prompting fears that the Federal Reserve may reassess its
holding stance on monetary policy.
The US news, coupled with concerns that German interest rates had bottomed
out, provoked a wave of heavy selling across Europe, hitting stock and bond
markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and London, where the FT-SE 100 index
closed 53.3 lower at 2,966.4. This was the first time that London had closed
below 3,000 since September 1993, and it brought the total fall this week to
more than 5 per cent.
The US growth figures were released as Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
chairman, came under attack on Capitol Hill for tightening US monetary
policy too aggressively recently. The Fed has increased short-term rates
from 3 per cent to 4.25 per cent since early February.
On Wall Street, shares finished marginally higher and bonds recovered from
early sharp selling after Mr Greenspan used his testimony to the Senate
banking committee to defend past rate increases rather than to prepare the
ground for further tightening of policy in the near term. However, he left
open the possibility of increases later.
The revised growth figures reflected stronger US consumer and government
spending than previously thought. That more than offset a downward revision
to corporate inventories.
The US economy is expected to grow faster again in the second quarter, with
estimates of annualised growth ranging from 3.5 per cent to as much as 6 per
cent.
Senior Democrat members of the committee warned that Fed action would have a
'withering effect' on growth and challenged Mr Greenspan to produce evidence
inflation was accelerating.
Rate increases announced so far 'would not impede satisfactory economic
growth', Mr Greenspan said. The Fed had acted 'in advance of the potential
emergence of inflationary pressures, so as to forestall their actual
occurrence'.
Mr Greenspan said the dollar's recent weakness had been a 'source of some
concern' and drew attention to a sharp acceleration in credit growth.
Business loans grew at an annual rate of 9.5 per cent in the first four
months after declining between 1990 and 1993. Industrial capacity
utilisation, at 83.5 per cent, was at its highest since the late 1980s.
Mr Greenspan gave the fullest account to date of the Fed's strategy since
early February. The Fed had begun to tighten policy partly because it had
been worried by a sharp rise in financial asset prices, driven in part by
huge investments in stock and bond mutual funds - Dollars 281bn (Pounds
187.3bn) in 1993 alone. The prolonged period of low short-term rates had
created a 'false sense of security and certainty' and 'investor
complacency'.
The Fed chose to raise rates cautiously at first - in quarter-point steps -
for fear that a larger move 'would create too big a dose of uncertainty
which could destabilise the financial system, indirectly affecting the real
economy'. Given the sharp rise in bond yields, 'our worries would appear to
have been justified', Mr Greenspan said.
He said most of the adjustment in bond and stock prices had occurred by the
Fed's policy meeting on May 17. The half-point rate increase announced last
week did not produce an adverse market reaction.
The overall picture of rising US inflationary pressures and the potential
for further Fed tightening left long-dated UK government bonds almost a
point lower at the close, driving the yield on benchmark 10-year gilts up to
8.39 per cent from 8.26 per cent.
Elsewhere, Paris was hit by substantial US selling orders, pushing the
CAC-40 index down 41.22 to 2050.67. French 10-year bonds fell  3/4 of a
point and Italian 10-year bonds lost a full point. In Germany, the Dax index
closed 10.74 up at 2,140.99.

FT  28 MAY 94 / Meat men pack in voters for City fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smithfield meat market traders and leaders of the Corporation of London, in
dispute over market rents, are exploiting the City's medieval electoral
system in a battle to win extra votes.
Both sides are trying to pack the rolls with their supporters before the
June 15 closing date for this year's City elections.
In one ward 360 traders have registered to vote though they are technically
resident in an office building while BP has given staff car parking spaces
for a fee making them technically resident and therefore able to vote.
In January two Smithfield meat traders won election to the Corporation's
general council, after a high turnout by Smithfield traders in one ward.
Yesterday, a market trader, Mr Peter Martinelli, submitted nomination papers
to become the next sheriff of London. He appears to have a good chance of
victory.
If successful, he would appear next to the Lord Mayor at ceremonial
occasions, and would have the right to sit at the Old Bailey law courts.
Mr Michael Cassidy, the Corporation's head of policy, appears to be the meat
traders' prime target. He said yesterday that 360 market tenants had
registered to vote in his ward. All of them are technically resident on one
rented floor of an office building.
Only residents, partnerships and sole traders can vote in City elections. To
be resident, an individual needs only to rent property with a rateable value
of Pounds 10 or more. The government has refused requests to increase this
sum.
Private companies - which pay about 99 per cent of the City's rates - are
excluded.
However, civic leaders are now encouraging companies to stretch the
franchise by granting employees tenancy of their buildings.
British Petroleum, one of the Square Mile's largest employers, has already
boosted its representation on the electoral register by allocating car park
spaces to employees, for a small fee. Technically, they are now resident and
are able to vote.
Mr Cassidy believes that meat traders will take about a third of the seats
on the general council if more private companies do not follow the example
set by BP before the June 15 dead-line.
The government refused to introduce a bill to change the council franchise
when the Corporation last requested it two years ago.

Correction (published 30th May 1994) appended to this article.
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday settled a long-running
patent infringement dispute with the Japanese group Takeda, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The out-of-court agreement lifted its
A shares by SKr8 to SKr168 (Dollars 21.90).
The dispute centred on Losec, Astra's best-selling anti-ulcer drug, which
last year had total sales, including sales through licensees, of SKr12.7bn.
Losec is the world's fifth best selling drug worldwide. Astra accused Takeda
of marketing a generic version of Losec, claiming this infringed the patent
protection which Losec enjoys until 1999. It filed a series of suits against
the Japanese group and its licensees last year.
Under the terms of the settlement, Astra will receive unspecified
compensation for Takeda's future sales of products containing the generic
version of Losec.
CORRECTION
Under the terms of the settlement between Astra, the Swedish pharmaceutical
group, and the Japanese group, Takeda, Astra will receive unspecified
consideration for Takeda's future sales of products containing lansoprazole
and not the generic version of Losec (Astra's best-selling anti-ulcer drug)
as stated in a May 27 story headed 'Astra-Takeda patent row settled'.

Thomson-CSF, the French state electronics group, said it could report a loss
of up to FFr2.2bn (Dollars 380m) for 1993 because of its 21.6 per cent stake
in Credit Lyonnais.
In March, the French bank announced a loss of FFr6.9bn for 1993 and a
FFr44.9bn government-backed rescue package including the transfer of FFr40bn
of non-performing property loans to a new shell company.
Without Credit Lyonnais, Thomson-CSF would have made a FFr1bn profit last
year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Greek telecoms returns to market
 -The new government has scaled down the flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The much-delayed flotation of OTE, the Greek telecoms monopoly, is back on
track after an eight-month gap caused by a change of government. However,
the socialist administration's plan to sell 25 per cent of the company
through the Athens stock exchange is less ambitious than the one launched by
its conservative predecessor in 1993.
The conservatives wanted to sell 49 per cent of OTE, disposing of a 35 per
cent strategic stake to an international telecoms operator, together with
management rights, before floating another 14 per cent.
The socialists insist the company should remain under state management.
Nevertheless, government advisers, aware that the question of efficient
management will loom large in investors' minds, propose appointing a
telecoms operator from abroad as a technical consultant.
The selection of a consultant could be timed to coincide with the flotation,
provisionally set for October, they suggest.
Analysts say that given investors' current enthusiasm for international
telecoms issues, neither the delay nor the decision to restructure the
disposal are likely to reduce the appeal of OTE.
OTE, valued by analysts at around Dr1,000bn (Dollars 4bn), is one of only a
few profitable public utilities in Greece. Company officials say that
operating profits in 1993 amounted to some Dr120bn on turnover of Dr300bn, a
25 per cent increase on the previous year.
Although Greece is a mature market in terms of its fixed network - with 40
lines for every 100 residents - there is considerable room for growth.
Digital lines amount to only 15 per cent, while data transmission systems,
paging and tele-conferencing are all in their infancy.
OTE is also benefiting from substantial European Union funding for a 'crash
programme' to improve telecommunications in Athens. Last month, Siemens
Hellas and Intracom, a local telecoms equipment supplier, were awarded a
Dr40bn contract to provide 1m digital lines for the capital. New transit
exchanges will be linked by fibre optic cable, and 12 outmoded exchanges are
being replaced with remote concentrators.
A crucial question will be tariff policies, still controlled by the
government. Some effort was made last year to iron out distortions in
pricing - which favoured domestic customers making local calls while
long-distance and international rates were charged at high rates - but
further restructuring will be needed.
'Revenue per line for OTE is only half the European average, so there is
plenty of potential. But if the company stays under the state umbrella, will
the government allow realistic price hikes?' asked a local analyst.
The government this week re-appointed Credit Suisse First Boston and J.
Henry Schroder Wagg, originally the conservatives' choice, as co-ordinators
and lead managers for the issue flotation. CSFB was already advising the
government on the strategic sale.
Schroders will structure the issue, while CSFB will place an international
tranche, expected to amount to 10 per cent of OTE's equity, with investors
in Europe and the US.
National Bank of Greece, the biggest state-controlled bank, will be lead
manager for the domestic tranche, replacing Credit Bank, the private Greek
bank selected last year.
The experience acquired last year should help the international investment
banks to meet the new timetable for the flotation. It will still be tight:
revised legislation on the regulatory framework must be passed, a full audit
must be completed, and decisions are needed on OTE's heavy pension fund
liabilities.
There are still gaps in OTE's balance sheet, as its first audit to
international standards, launched last year by Arthur Andersen, was halted
when the change of government took place. However, it is clear that current
pension fund liabilities amount to over Dr300bn, analysts say.
OTE contributes Dr14bn annually to the fund, which also receives a subsidy
from the budget. However, if the company's pension obligations are not
reduced, the fund will become a serious drain on future earnings.
With the socialists now committed to increasing Greece's base of small
shareholders through privatisation, the domestic tranche, expected to amount
to some 10 per cent of the offering, may include some incentives. The
remaining 5 per cent is to be stripped out and sold at a discount to OTE
employees and pensioners.
Government advisers discount fears that the issue, five times bigger than
the largest offering to date, could overwhelm the Athens stock exchange.
They see no shortage of liquidity, as more than than Dr50bn in listings and
rights issues was raised without difficulty during the first quarter of this
year.

Kaufhof Holding, the German retailer, yesterday reported 1993 profits of
DM240m (Dollars 145.5m), up 7 per cent from DM222m the year before. The
company also forecast steady earnings for the current year.
Kaufhof is set to take a stake of between 50 and 70 per cent in Horten, a
smaller department store chain. This would increase group turnover to around
DM28bn, comparable to that of Karstadt, Germany's biggest retailer. Final
details of the deal will be announced in about three weeks after
negotiations are completed.
Turnover in the first four months of this year rose 8 per cent, to DM7.6bn.
Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive, predicted retail sales would pick up
throughout the year as Germany pulled out of its worst recession.
The dividend will be raised by DM1.5 to DM13.50 for ordinary shares, and by
the same amount, to DM14.50, for preferential shares.
In 1993, turnover rose to DM23.1bn, up 12.7 per cent from DM20.5bn the year
before. The rise was driven mainly by a 33 per cent increase in turnover at
Media Markt, Vobis and Saturn, the specialist stores which the group plans
to expand.
European sales leapt 54 per cent to DM4.3bn following the consolidation of
Kuoni, the tourist agency in which Kaufhof holds a 50.1 per cent stake.
Total foreign sales rose to 19 per cent of group turnover.
Mr Odewald said the group would invest DM900m in the coming year and
increase its retail outlets by 120 to 1,235.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd returns to black with

<TEXT>
Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, swung to a net profit of Fl 10m
(Dollars 5.4m) in the first quarter of 1994 from a loss of Fl 86m in the
same period of 1993.
The company, which yesterday implemented its new policy of publishing
quarterly figures, said the improvement stemmed largely from cost-cutting,
lower interest expenses, the firmer dollar and higher volumes of ocean-going
cargo. Turnover was virtually flat at Fl 1.60bn compared with Fl 1.61bn.
In line with the company's performance in 1993, Nedlloyd's ocean shipping
saw the biggest improvement, posting an operating profit of Fl 24m against a
loss of Fl 57m in the same quarter of last year. Although downward pressure
on shipping rates resumed in early 1994 after a period of stable rates in
1993, Nedlloyd said it was helped by a rise in the volume of cargo
transported.
Nedlloyd's European road haulage business saw a rise in operating profit to
Fl 14m from Fl 9m, but the performance was still below expectations.
Nedlloyd repeated earlier forecasts that it would post a profit for the full
year.

Novo Nordisk, a leading producer of industrial enzymes and insulin for
diabetics, is planning to set up an enzymes factory employing about 300
people in China, the company announced yesterday, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
Novo Nordisk has acquired a 160,000 square metre site near the town of
Tianjin by agreement with the administrative commission of Tianjin
economic-technological development area.
The site is big enough to house a plant for pharmaceuticals production as
well, said Mr Mads Ovlisen, Novo's chief executive, but added that plans for
this stage of the development remain at a very early stage.
Work on the enzymes factory will begin next year and production is due to
start in 1998-99, the company said. 'China has a population of 1.2bn and
large industries in washing powders, brewing, alcohol and textiles. The
country therefore has a big potential as a customer for Novo Nordisk's
enzyme products,' said Mr Rebien Sorensen, who is responsible for the
group's projects in China.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton said yesterday he was sending a special delegation to
examine conditions in East Africa, where a possible famine could threaten
the lives of nearly 20m people, Reuter reports from Washington.
A White House statement said Mr Clinton had asked Mr Brian Atwood,
administrator of the US Agency for International Development, to head the
bipartisan delegation including members of Congress and private
organisations.
The group would try to prevent mass starvation in Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Kenya by investigating and then raising and co-ordinating more help from
global organisations.
'The crisis in the east Africa region threatens every nation in the region
and is caused by drought conditions and civil conflicts,' the White House
statement said. 'At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid
widespread famine, but an estimated 20m people are currently at risk and may
have to leave their homes to search for food.'
It said concerted regional and international action two years ago prevented
a similar drought in southern Africa from becoming a severe famine.
'Our effort to head off the incipient famine will be both short- and
long-term and will help the nations of the region address what have become
chronic food shortages.'
The delegation is to examine programmes sponsored by the US government and
other donors in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya, and meet heads of state and
government representatives.
The current delegation will travel to Rome, Geneva, and Brussels to seek
increased aid for east Africa. The White House said it would meet officials
of the World Food programme, the Food for Agriculture Organisation, the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees and leaders of the European Union.

FT  27 MAY 94 / South Africa aims to double arms exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the
lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous
governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry.
Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms
procurement agency, said yesterday the company could boost defence exports
by more than R1bn (Dollars 270m) in the current fiscal year.
His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the
defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President
Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen
to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South
Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which
are globally competitive.
Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial
government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of
moral arguments against arms exports.
Mr de Waal noted, for example that South Africa sold a variety of weapons -
rifles, grenades, mortars - worth R100m to Rwanda over a five-year period.
He said the deal was terminated late last year because of evidence the
weapons were used against the Rwandan people. In recent weeks, Rwandan Hutus
loyal to the government have been blamed for horrific slaughters of minority
Tutsis and other Hutus that killed tens of thousands of people.
Mr Peet Smith, Armscor general manager for imports and exports, said the new
government's policy permitted arms exports to countries only to defend their
sovereignty and not where the weapons might be used to violate human rights.
Despite anxieties about exports to the rest of Africa, South Africa's urgent
need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on
heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will
probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future.
Selling more of its respected military hardware is the key to Armscor's
survival, Mr de Waal said. The company currently more than R800m of arms per
year, which he said represented less than 0.5 per cent of the international
arms market.
Products that could sell well abroad include sophisticated Rooivalk
helicopters, frequency-hopping radio transmitters and receivers that avoid
interception, landmine-proof armoured vehicles, advanced mine detection
equipment, and G-5 and G-6 long-range artillery.
Mr de Waal identified Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe as potential
markets. This will be eased by Tuesday's UN Security Council decision to
lift a mandatory ban on the sale of arms to South Africa.
President Mandela said this week Pretoria should be allowed to sell weapons
if it wanted to and Defence Minister Joe Modise, a former guerrilla fighter,
said expanding weapons exports could create 20,000 jobs.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Japanese household spending falls 4.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Household spending in Japan slipped by 4.3 per cent in March, the worst
year-on-year decline since 1981, the government's management and
co-ordination agency announced yesterday.
This is the second month of spending decline, a worrying reversal of a
four-month run of increases in household spending to the end of January and
a sign of the continuing economic challenges facing the government of Mr
Tsutomu Hata.
The spending figures cast doubt on Japan's chances of an imminent,
consumer-led recovery and increase pressure on the Bank of Japan to reduce
its official discount rate (ODR) to give the flagging economy a
psychological lift, economic analysts said.
The official rate, at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, has
stood at a record low of 1.75 per cent since last September. Yesterday, it
stood a mere 0.3 percentage points below the overnight money market rate, at
which commercial banks lend to each other.
That leaves the Bank of Japan little room to intervene to cut short-term
money market rates, which are already at a record low, unless there is
another reduction in the ODR.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, warned this week that
corporate balance sheet adjustment and the pace of labour-shedding were
amongfactors that might impede growth.
However, the bank has so far used the money markets to influence interest
rates.
Management and co-ordination agency officials argued that part of the March
spending decline was caused by delays in car purchases, ahead of a fall in
car sales tax in April.
Its survey also shows a 0.4 per cent decline in wage earners' real incomes
in the year to the end of March, the first such drop for 13 years. Bonuses
(a large part of annual wages) and wives' income from part-time work both
declined, the agency said.
The survey showed that spending on food, furniture and clothing fell, while
households spent more on housing, utility charges and medical care.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (20): The ugly bride with the
big dowry - Investing in Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no escaping it. Whatever the commercial and strategic attractions
of setting up shop in Northern Ireland, the many positive aspects to life in
the province remain overshadowed by deeply-ingrained images of a hopelessly
divided, dangerous society.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, in a recent speech to businessmen, did his best to place
Ulster's troubles in their correct perspective, stressing that the province
was 'not running a Clint Eastwood scenario 24 hours a day'. Given recent
successes in attracting new corporate investment, the message has not been
falling on deaf ears.
Northern Ireland inevitably has a hard job in selling itself as a business
location to companies looking to move existing operations or to establish
new ones; why should anyone opt for west Belfast, with its random, sectarian
murders and brick and iron barriers intended to separate alien communities?
Surely, life in Telford would be much easier?
The media agenda dictates that Ulster usually means bad news, with the
result that its problems can be distorted and exaggerated. But problems
there are and they cannot, sensibly, be minimised by those seeking to
attract new investment from within the UK or beyond.
Business assets in the province are regularly the victims of paramilitary
activity and employees are regularly subjected to intimidation; security
costs can be punitive and employers face a daunting catalogue of obligations
under a tough set of fair employment laws designed to eradicate
discrimination in the workplace.
But for most people and most sections of the business community, Ulster's
tragedy rarely intrudes directly into their daily lives. The province's
economy has, despite the recession, remained relatively buoyant and
performed better than in the UK as a whole. Last year, for example,
manufacturing output grew by double the UK average.
Equally to the point, the province can provide a business base which offers
newcomers, by virtue of its extraordinary difficulties, extensive financial
incentives to help overcome reservations about moving into what many see as
nothing less than a 'war zone'.
Ulster, because of its higher-than-average UK unemployment and its 'category
one' status within the EU aid hierarchy, can offer cash help that is
unrivalled anywhere in Europe. No matter that one development official
remarks: 'The bigger the dowry, the uglier the bride'.
Cash help may not, alone, be sufficient to give Ulster the edge over
alternative locations but in the final analysis, it can tip the balance.
Financial aid played a big role, for example, in the recent decision of
Transtec, a Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, to set up a
Pounds 16m plant in Londonderry to manufacture aluminium castings for the
automotive sector.
The company will join a growing list of automotive suppliers who have now
established operations in the province, including companies from Japan,
France, the US and Germany. The new plant will, in the first instance,
supply cylinder heads for shipment to Ford of Germany.
Transtec already employs more than 2,000 people in 12 wholly-owned
subsidiary operations, most of them in the West Midlands. According to Mr
Peter Munday, chairman of the company's automotive division, the business
had decided on strategic grounds to look beyond its existing casting
facility in England for the new plant and had considered a number of
European locations before opting for Ulster.
The reasons for deciding on Londonderry, already the recipient of a
significant inward flow of overseas investment, include good infrastructure,
the potential for recruiting quality labour and the all-important assistance
of the local industrial development board.
Mr Munday added: 'The package of assistance also had to be sufficient to
counter offers being made to us by other European locations. Aluminium
casting is a very competitive, price-conscious business and we needed to
ensure we kept our costs as low as possible.
'We could only do this by examining development areas with the highest
incentives for inward investors. Although this was the major priority, it
needed also to be coupled with the other plus factors which can be delivered
in Northern Ireland, such as good transportation links and a factory which
could be built quickly to our specifications.'
The Industrial Development Board is not always too keen to discuss the
details of financial assistance for specific projects but Mr John McGuckian,
its chairman, disclosed that the total government aid package made available
to Transtec will be about Pounds 4m. Few locations in Europe will prove as
generous in offering cash help accounting for one-quarter of total start-up
costs.
Operational costs, once established, are also significantly lower than in
Britain or in mainland Europe, a point forcefully underlined by Sir Patrick
Mayhew in a recent ministerial check-list of Ulster plus-points. He claimed,
however, the beneficial picture was 'not the result of sweated labour but in
part from a generally lower overall cost of living in Northern Ireland'.
For overseas investors, access to the markets of the European Union offers
another important bonus and has been the driving factor behind location
decisions taken by companies from the US and south-east Asian countries. IDB
estimates suggest that around 55,000 people in Ulster are now employed by
foreign owners.
The total is rising steadily in the wake of a particularly successful period
of IDB activity and is shortly expected to be given a huge boost with the
decision by Hualon, a Taiwanese textile group, to commence the biggest
inward investment project since the ill-fated De Lorean car plant.
The European Commission has given clearance to a synthetic fibre project
which will bring 2,000 jobs to Glengormley, close to the Belfast. At one
stage, the project was thrown into doubt when European textile companies
complained that it would create unfair competition, but the overriding need
for jobs in the province finally won the day.
The new plant is expected to cost nearly Pounds 157m and the UK government,
via the IDB, will put around Pounds 60m into the kitty. With financial
support on such a scale, fears about the likely impact on business of
limited, civil strife quickly recede.
The Hualon decision was welcomed by Mr Roy Baillie, vice-chairman of the
Confederation of British Industry in Ulster, not just for the badly-needed
jobs it would bring but also for the strong signal it would send to other
international companies looking for a route into Europe.
The hope is that such decisions will not be seen merely as a positive move
in the face of Ulster's problems but that, in bringing new prosperity to be
shared by all parts of the community, they will help end the province's
troubles.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (19): Two regions with plenty
to offer - Wales and the South-West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven cranes tower over a huge construction site near the motorway to the
north of Bristol, a highly visible sign that relocations to the region have
not ceased in spite of the recession.
At Bristol, the Ministry of Defence is to consolidate its procurement
executive, at present scattered on sites in London and southern England. The
new headquarters, costing Pounds 255m, will see the first of 5,500 staff
move there in the autumn of next year.
The scale of the MoD relocation dwarfs other recent activity in south-west
England and Wales. Before the recession, both regions benefited from
considerable relocation and inward investment. In particular, Wales has
attracted it from overseas - it has more than 400 foreign-owned
manufacturing companies - and the south-west especially from London and the
south-east.
The pace has slowed but not stopped. During 1993-94 in Wales, there were 169
projects from other parts of the UK and overseas, compared with 201 schemes
the previous year. One big investment announced last year was by Asat of
Hong Kong, which is building a Pounds 42m integrated circuit plant in Gwent
that is expected to create 1,000 jobs. But, as in the south-west, there are
fewer large greenfield investments; instead, projects are tending to be
small-scale or expansions of existing operations.
In both regions, there are recent signs of an upturn. Mr Ken Poole, senior
manager with Price Waterhouse in Cardiff specialising in inward investment
services, says: 'In the last few months the level of inquiries has picked up
in the financial services sector and on the manufacturing side.'
In Avon, on the other side of the Severn bridge, it is a similar story.
'We're much more optimistic than for a long time,' says Mr Mike West, of the
Western Development Partnership, an economic strategy forum. 'We're on the
move.' Particular interest is being shown in joint ventures with
locally-based companies.
The WDP, set up by the public and private sectors, is a recent product of a
changed attitude in the south-west, which in the past has been complacent
about the need to attract new businesses. During the 1980s, counties such as
Avon, Gloucestershire and Dorset had not needed to woo inward investors
because they came anyway.
Ironically - in view of the MoD's investment in Bristol - it is the
contraction of the defence and aerospace industries, a mainstay of the
regional economy, which is a leading motivator in stimulating the south-west
to be more pro-active. The region was also hit hard by the recession in the
financial services sector, which in the 1980s had seen much relocation to
Bristol, Cheltenham-Gloucester and Bournemouth-Poole.
A plethora of partnerships to encourage diversification and inward
investment is now in place. In addition to the WDP, there is an economic
strategy forum in Gloucestershire and a similar body in Dorset called
Partners for Prosperity. The South Dorset Economic Partnership is seeking
businesses to counter the defence rundown at Weymouth and Portland, which
last year gained assisted area status. Somerset has formed an economic
partnership, and Devon and Cornwall is being promoted by the Westcountry
Development Corporation.
Behind these initiatives lies a common concern at the lack of a regional
development organisation. A 'partnership of partnerships', the West of
England Partnership, is about to bid for Department of Trade &amp; Industry
funding as an RDO for attracting international investment. The only existing
such agency in the south-west is the Devon and Cornwall Development Board.
Envious eyes are cast in the direction of Wales with its government-funded
Welsh Development Agency and Development Board for Rural Wales. These can
adopt a co-ordinated approach to marketing, land acquisition and property
provision and, in conjunction with the Welsh Office and local authorities,
offer a range of grants and incentives.
Both regions share similar advantages for companies which relocate: a wide
variety of sites, a flexible and often skilled labour force, relatively low
pay levels, and networks of professional and business services, especially
in Bristol and Cardiff.
While there are weaknesses in the transport infrastructure - for example,
air services - perhaps the biggest selling point is the countryside. Staff,
and their families, are easily persuaded to make the move. In consequence,
the south-west in the past decade has had the highest net migration of any
UK region. Half of these immigrants are people of working age.
In Wales, the favoured area for inward investment has been near the M4 which
runs close to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of
British Airways which in 1993 opened Pounds 100m maintenance and components
facilities in south Wales, last month described himself as 'a satisfied
inward investment customer'. BA had first shopped around, Sir Colin said,
but had 'chosen to acquire the currency of Welsh skills and efficiencies'.
Energetic efforts are being made to attract companies to the south Wales
valleys and to mid and north Wales. Design Sculptures, a company set up in
the Rhondda by its Guildford-based parent, says that what tipped the balance
'was the availability of a labour force which is open to new ideas and not
averse to retraining'. It acknowledges, though, that it would not have
relocated to Wales without regional selective assistance.
Most attention in the principality now focuses on Cardiff Bay, where a
barrage replacing mudflats with a lake will help to regenerate 2,700
dockland acres. Mr Peter Connor, Cardiff Bay Development Corporation's
director of business development, reports 'very strong interest' now that
construction of the barrage is about to start. 'There is an awareness that
Cardiff Bay is a special place,' he says. 'The bay can offer a very
competitive grants package as an intermediate assisted area, with additional
incentives as a development corporation.'
Both Wales and south-west England offer many other sites with potential.
These range from the Snowdonia Business Park, virtually surrounded by the
national park, to the Atomic Energy Authority site at Winfrith, Dorset,
where it is intended to establish a technology park, and to the old naval
docklands at Plymouth, now the responsibility of a development corporation.
Another development corporation is at Bristol, where its prime site at Quay
Point, near the city centre, is being marketed. Around Bristol, large
industrial sites are becoming available north of the city, and to the west
at Severnside, near the expanding Bristol port and the second Severn
crossing due to open in 1996. Avon has a strong image within the UK as a
good location for industries such as telecommunications, and for research,
development and innovation with its three universities.
Further east, along the M4 corridor, Swindon remains a leading town for
inward investment. In the 1980s, more than 100 companies employing at least
20 people moved there, drawn by its proximity to the motorway and Heathrow
airport. The new arrivals, many of them specialising in high technology,
account for over 12,000 jobs.
The best-known newcomer to Swindon has been Honda with its Pounds 350m
plant. While no one in the south-west or Wales expects inward investment on
that scale in the foreseeable future, and competition to win business has
become much tougher, it is felt that the two regions can compare favourably
with other UK regions in what they have to offer.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (16): Culture shock that paid
off - The British Council's move to Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Council has not yet stopped counting the benefits - many of them
unexpected - of its relocation from London to Manchester in 1992.
The council is Britain's principal agency for cultural relations overseas.
It has charitable status, a royal charter and a funding link to the UK
Treasury. Most people would expect it to do the bulk of its headquarters
work, like other such British institutions, in London.
But the council's main strength is its global network of about 6,000 people.
They staff the real front offices. Where the British head office and
back-office staff work is now irrelevant as the UK becomes ever smaller
through improving physical and electronic communications.
In any event, London posed problems. At one stage, council staff were
scattered through 10 office buildings. Support services were a problem. A
large, in-house maintenance staff was needed. A fleet of cars and vans was
required to move people, paper and packages through the London traffic. A
corps of messengers had to be employed. There was a perpetual problem with
junior staff: like many London organisations, the council found it hard to
retain them in a competitive labour market.
On top of all this, there were the 'London' problems of high overheads and
operating costs - and the effect on productivity of unreliable public
transport failing to get everyone to work on time every day.
Nevertheless, within the council's own ranks there was initial dismay that
it should contemplate a move from the capital. As Mr Brian Humphreys, the
council's resources manager, puts it: 'The first reaction in London was of
disbelief, followed by resistance, then acceptance, then co-operation, then
surprise.'
The choice of where to go narrowed to Glasgow, Leeds and Manchester. There
was not much to choose between the three cities in terms of quality of life
and the accommodation on offer; but Manchester was the only one with an
international gateway airport designated as a hub - and that 'gave
Manchester the edge,' Mr Humphreys says.
Although the building which the council took is a 10-minute walk from
Manchester Town Hall, it is only a 20-minute drive from Manchester Airport.
The site itself was developed by British Gas and was once a depot in the
shadow of a railway viaduct. With the land reclaimed and landscaped, the
development has made a notable contribution to environmental regeneration by
removing a substantial source of potential blight.
It has also linked well to other developments - such as GMEX, the Greater
Manchester Exhibition and Conference Centre converted from a derelict
railway station - to assist the expansion of Manchester city centre. The
arrangement of the 116,000 sq ft of offices is the work of Business Design
Group, a consultancy in working environments with 200 staff throughout
Europe.
But the relocation of the British Council was not just a transplantation.
The move offered the chance of a radical restructuring of the organisation
and its operating procedures. With increasing competition for government
contracts from universities, the Crown Agents or small or individual
overseas aid administrators, it wanted to reduce unit costs.
It decided not to move its big services and maintenance department, but to
split its functions and use contractors. Competitive tendering enabled it to
pick and choose separate contractors for catering, building maintenance,
security and cleaning. In addition, there are two 'implants' providing
services - Thomas Cook for the council's Pounds 10m of travel of each year
and Rank Xerox for reprographic work.
Another decision was to have no messengers and dispense with the fleet of
vehicles and drivers. Instead, more use is being made of information
technology, with a terminal per desk, and video-conferencing facilities with
London and the council's Hong Kong offices. Similar links will follow to
other overseas bureaux.
The Treasury allocated Pounds 15m for the move. There was an overall project
manager, plus one for personnel, one for the building, one for information
technology, one for the move, and one - Mr Humphreys - to get everyone into
the building and get it running.
The British Council started the move in March 1992 and completed it with a
big push for most relocating staff during a single October weekend. 'People
arrived on the Monday to find telephones working,' Mr Humphreys says. 'I
doubt whether we lost more than a few hours of downtime.'
About 250 staff moved permanently and 50 commute weekly between the
south-east and north-west. Some 300 were recruited locally and there are now
100 temporary employees.
Mr Humphreys adds: 'We have been quite embarrassed by the high quality of
the local staff when compared with what we had known in London. Their
commitment has proved high and greater than what we were used to.'
Another surprise was that interaction does not stop at the end of the
working day. Staff used to rush for trains, tubes and buses as they
scattered all over the south-east, commuting homeward. Now the council's bar
is a gathering place for between 50 and 60 people every night.
'Some people worried about the loss of London's anonymity and did not want
to be bumping into each other all the time. But here, the spirit of
community is so much greater. Many young people have been able to buy good
property within five or six miles of the office and can drive to work, where
the parking is free,' Mr Humphreys says.
Yet there must be some drawbacks? 'We underestimated the stress,' Mr
Humphreys confesses. 'The greatest stress comes from moving house and coping
with a changing organisation, the switch to more IT, the minimisation of
support staff and the big training programme.
'You need to provide a lot of money and time for stress relief and
counselling. A counsellor still comes in at least one day a week.
'Against this, there are lots of delightful things, like easy drives to
work, free parking, a nursery to look after your kids, and a fitness room.
There is a good social side, and a good working environment. And because of
who we are there is always a high quality of art on display.'
The approach worked well enough for the British Council to win last year's
Du Pont Office of the Year award. The council is now building on
pre-existing contacts with local universities and Manchester Business School
and aims to play an active role in regional economic development. 'We are
integrating with the whole community,' Mr Humphreys says.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (18): Shift in help to south
 -The North
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The full impact of last year's redrawing of the Assisted Areas map has yet
to become apparent in northern England, where the provision of state aid to
reinvigorate the local economy dates from the 1930s.
In one sense, the region did not see any great change in the review; while
Darlington in County Durham was taken off the map, the Morpeth and Ashington
area of Northumberland was added, and in Cumbria Workington's demotion from
development to intermediate area was compensated by the granting of IA
status to Whitehaven and Barrow-in-Furness.
However, the government's decision to give help for the first time to parts
of London and the south and east coast means the 'traditional' assisted
areas may have to fight even harder for inward investment, with fewer
financial resources.
The Northern Development Company, the economic regeneration body for
north-east England and Cumbria, with overall responsibility for the region's
inward investment drive, learnt recently it had suffered a 2 per cent cut -
Pounds 32,000 - in its 1994-95 funding from central government.
The NDC had sought a zero increase - a cut in real terms. 'The recovery of
this region in terms of economic regeneration is a very slow process,'
complains Dr John Bridge, NDC chief executive.
The issue is certain to be raised next month at the annual meeting between
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, and the NDC and its counterparts
from other regions. The minister faces some tough questioning.
Already, the new competition is asserting itself; on a recent visit to Dubai
with the Cumbria Marketing Initiative Mr Harry Knowles, chief executive of
Furness Enterprise, the Barrow-based agency, came across the rival East Kent
Initiative. 'There's only so much inward investment to go round; we're all
competing like crazy for it,' he says.
The East Kent team emphasised its area's proximity to the Channel tunnel.
North-east and Cumbrian agencies do not believe the tunnel will lose them
significant inward investment; indeed, Mr Chris Fraser, the NDC's director
of international investment, says the new link between Britain and France
should be generally beneficial in marketing terms.
In the north, the need for further improvement to the A66 between Cumbria
and the east coast ports is more of a live infrastructure issue.
The region's inward investment agencies are reporting a recent rise in
inquiries.
Dr Bridge has noted growing interest from Germany, because of the UK's
improving comparative productivity and relatively low labour rates and the
strength of the D-Mark.
In recent years, the NDC has aimed to secure about 5,000 projected jobs
annually, including new and safeguarded jobs, through inward investment.
This year, says Dr Bridge, 'we'll be lucky to get 4,000.'
Even so, the past year has seen some big breakthroughs. West Cumbria has won
its first Asian investment. Sammi (UK), a subsidiary of Korean audio speaker
manufacturer Sammi Sound Technology, has taken over a former shoe factory
near Workington. It is now starting production, employing 30 people, rising
to 60 by the end of 1994. The target is 100 within two years.
This month Taiwan's CMC Magnetics Corporation opened its Pounds 26m floppy
disk production plant in Cramlington, Northumberland, expected to create 550
jobs over three years.
The project, receiving Pounds 8.25m in government regional assistance, is
the UK's seventh investment from Taiwan, and Northumberland's third. 'Taiwan
is one of our markets with the most potential at the moment,' says Mr
Fraser.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (17): Accent on 'aftercare' -
The Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Controls, the US automotive components manufacturer, will be the
first occupant of the Black Country Development Corporation's automotive
components park at Wednesbury. The company figures on East Midlands
Development's 1993-94 success list because it is investing in Mansfield. It
already has a presence at Burton-on-Trent.
Its investment decision emphasises a developing trend in the attempts by
Midlands agencies to stiffen the indigenous economy by injections of new
capital. It is the desire to sustain companies which have already made
investments.
The reasons are not hard to seek. The domestic recession has both reduced
the capacity of British companies to expand and dimmed the desire to
relocate. The operating cost differential between London and the south-east
of England on one hand and the Midlands on the other has been eroded.
Lower domestic activity has increased the importance of foreign companies in
the economic mix of the Midlands. Indeed, Mr Chris Tillett, chief economist
at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants, in Birmingham, observes: 'If the rate of
inward investment falls, the West Midlands' chances of growing at the
national average will be much reduced.'
But with less inward investment about, there is growing competition to
attract it. 'Given the downward trend in inquiries, the principle of
'aftercare' has never been more important. Further investment by way of
expansion of foreign-owned companies is becoming an increasing percentage of
recorded investment successes,' noted the forward plan of East Midlands
Development, the inward investment agency.
Indeed, the 20 companies on its 1993-94 success list together account for
about 2,300 jobs.
Similarly, the West Midlands Development Agency reported that 56 per cent of
the investment projects for 1993-94 resulted from expansion programmes. 'The
47 expansion projects generated Pounds 309m capital expenditure, created
2,100 jobs and safeguarded a further 4,000. The jobs created through
expansion projects represent 66 per cent of all new jobs.'
In total, there were 83 investment projects in the West Midlands. But only
14 were new and 19 were acquisitions of local companies by overseas groups.
The investment involved was Pounds 652.7m, triple that of 1992-93. But it is
doubtful if so high a figure will be repeated in the current year.
'The performance in 1993-94 reflected the relative buoyancy of the world
economy the previous year,' says Mr Paul Richards, WMDA's chief executive.
'International companies coming to the UK have been more active than
indigenous companies. They were slightly ahead of the upturn.' This has been
most notable among North American companies.
This year, though, the downturn in European economies is more likely to be
reflected, suggesting that, in terms of economic development, expansion of
existing operations should be more significant than greenfield investments.
In this respect, the West Midlands is in a stronger position than its
counterpart. With about 1,000 companies of overseas origin already, the
volume of activity is creating its own dynamism. By contrast, the East
Midlands has done badly in attracting foreign investment - only about 3 per
cent of the national total.
One reason has been the lack of a regional organisation and, allied to that,
the fragmented effort to attract investment. East Midlands Development has
been operating for just over six months, compared with West Midlands
Development Agency, which has been in the business for 10 years.
In trying to make up the lost ground, Mr John Finch, its chief executive,
stresses the need to work with local organisations. 'The way I see that
happening is that you say to the authorities: 'You have the knowledge and
expertise about your area; our expertise is in promoting the region and
getting industry to look at the region - see us as the overseas marketing
arm, if you like'.'
In the East Midlands the hope lingers that inward investors will provide an
economic stimulus to offset the effects of coalmine closures. Incentives are
available for a development area around Mansfield and an intermediate area
for the north of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.
But, although the incentives are helpful, they are not likely to be of
crucial importance in attracting new investment. KPMG Peat Marwick,
accountants, in a recent survey of foreign companies in the East Midlands
found that, 'when asked about their motivation for selecting their current
site, only 2.3 per cent of respondents were attracted by available grants
and incentives'.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (13): Message gets across -
Advisers can help with moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken a long time for the business community to accept the need for
specialist advice on moving. Unlike footloose America, where the relocation
industry shifts small armies of staff every year, UK companies have tended
to maintain a stiff independence. Relocation, like cold showers, might be
good for the constitution, but it is something one does privately and in
complete acceptance of inevitable discomfort.
Gradually, however, the message has worked through. Since the idea was
brought across the Atlantic 20 years ago, a network of more than 60
consultancies has carved itself a niche in the market, with about 150 small
operations geared to the more limited task of homefinding.
However, last year the Inland Revenue threw a bombshell. A Budget
announcement restricted tax-free expenses to Pounds 8,000 a head - about
half the true cost of moving staff.
As relocation had almost ground to a halt because companies could not afford
to move or were no longer being driven out of London and other cities by
high rents, this final straw cut business by 30 per cent last year.
Recently, the threat has been dispelled through a carefully-worded
government climbdown. Consultants and employers can continue to buy homes of
staff at a guaranteed price without facing tax demands.
Ironically, however, last year's potential disaster could end up as the
making of the sector. 'All these expenses still have to be noted on each
employee's tax form,' says Mr Andrew Finney, managing director of Hambro
Countrywide Relocation. 'This shifts the focus of relocation from personnel
offices onto finance officers' desks and will finally make companies aware
of the real costs.'
That will give consultants the chance to insist they can do it cheaper. 'We
are no different to any out-sourcing service,' says Mr Finney. 'Companies
can move themselves. But we do it better.'
Around 70,000 people are provided with full relocation support by employers
each year through house purchase guarantees, bridging loans, moving expenses
and resettlement counselling. Relocation specialists still handle only
around around 20,000 of these, says Mr Finney. 'But there are probably
250,000 moves for employment reasons each year, so the potential is
enormous.'
The range of consultants is vast. The Edinburgh-based Association of
Relocation Agents lists over 140 members, from sophisticated commercial
agencies to one-woman offices that try to find homes for long-distance
movers.
Black Horse is the market leader, moving about 6,000 people when the market
peaked in 1992, although this may almost have halved since activity tailed
away. Hambro has just narrowed the gap by swallowing Nationwide Relocation,
pushing the combined total to around 2,500 fully-supported moves and about
double that number of assisted relocations.
Groups such as ARC and Hamptons make up the next layer, but a much larger
number of smaller operators sit between them and the home-search brigade.
They claim to offer greater local knowledge, something the big agencies are
trying hard to combat in the search for business.
Because of the slump, new products are being added almost by the month in
the effort to gain an edge. The large agencies now offer a wide range of
services from guaranteed house purchase - the biggest problem during the
property slump - through specialised counselling to comprehensive project
planning.
PHH Homequity launched a computerised property database this month to help
companies decide on the right level of mortgage subsidy for employees moving
to more expensive areas. But Mr Liam Robson, corporate development manager
at ARC, says his group already runs a similar scheme for matching movers to
a similar area, using social and economic data.
Finding a standard charge is becoming more difficult as groups compete for
business. PHH declines to reveal its fee scale (or the number that it moves
in the UK). ARC's charges range from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 2,000 a head,
depending on the type and size of contract negotiated with a company.
Hambro has widened its service base to cover movers who require a less
extensive service. Fees can be as low as Pounds 250 a head compared with
Pounds 1,250 for the full treatment.
'Since the tax threat cut business, the industry is generally becoming more
market-sensitive,' says Mr Finney.
But there is still a residual resistance to bringing in consultants.
Companies often underestimate the complexity and costs of group moves, but
individual moves are more likely to be handled in-house. Agencies are
chipping away at this barrier, however. About half the sector's business in
1992 involved career moves, according to Black Horse.
Fees are perhaps the major barrier to attracting business. Companies seeking
to cut costs through relocation are often reluctant to take on the expense
of a consultant.
The average fee for a corporate property purchase is almost Pounds 1,400,
while private customers pay a Pounds 1,500 flat fee plus just over 1 per
cent of the purchase price, according to the ARA.
Even paying staff to move sticks in the craw of some managers. 'But there is
a simple counter-argument to companies who balk at relocation subsidies,'
says Mr Finney. 'They can pay the average cost of Pounds 15,000 to Pounds
20,000 to move a manager or lay out the same amount with a recruitment
agency for a replacement.
'They then have the on-going costs of familiarisation, as well, and will be
getting an unknown quantity rather than a manager they know.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (15): Keep the workers in the
picture - Staff transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the marriage of labour and capital, the partners are unequal. Staff are
usually the last to know about a crisis that can sometimes lead to divorce.
The decision to relocate is often signed, sealed and ready to deliver before
anyone gets around to telling most of the people affected. Few companies
will then drop the whole idea if a workforce decides not to play. In fact,
some are quite happy to leave them behind.
'While costs and better premises are the main factor in moves, some
relocators see a definite advantage in shaking up working practices and
getting rid of dead wood among staff,' says Ms Caroline Rawson-Gardiner, of
property consultants Hillier Parker.
They still need to persuade a core group to move, however, and most are
shocked by the depth of feeling generated. They appear blind to the feelings
of people whom they should know intimately.
For instance, one company questioned in a Hillier Parker study was
threatened with an action before the Equal Opportunities Court by women
workers. They had mobility clauses in their contracts but still felt they
could not move because their husbands were primary breadwinners.
Three-quarters of relocating staff with a working spouse are concerned about
their partner finding work and loss of double income, according to a survey
by Black Horse Relocation (BHR) and the CBI. Yet only a third of employers
saw this as a problem. The same gap is evident over education of children,
which worries 90 per cent of relocating parents but never crossed the minds
of two-thirds of company decision-makers.
As the typical relocator is a 38-year-old middle-manager with two children
and a working spouse, the potential for disruption and loss of key staff is
obvious.
Even when feathers have been smoothed and workers won over by promises of
help, employers still appear to get it wrong. Few staff polled by Black
Horse/CBI claimed to have seen information on help for 'trailing' spouses.
Almost 40 per cent believed there was no non-financial assistance.
Most problems boil down to lack of communication. 'Just knowing someone is
there to answer questions can make all the difference,' says Mr John
Carolan, managing director of BHR.
Many companies use relocation specialists in some way during moves, which
means staff should have access to counselling services. Trained advisers can
provide information on buying and selling homes, jobs for spouses and
details of potential schools in the target area. Some agencies allocate
personal counsellors who take responsibility for particular individuals. But
only half of all relocators stump up the extra cost for staff counselling.
Most relocators tend to call for help from consultants too late, adds
Hillier Parker. This is usually once they realise the dissatisfaction among
staff - by which time the damage has been done and relationships have been
soured.
Avoiding hurdles before they appear requires careful planning. The first
requirement is a formal relocation policy so staff at least know where they
stand. 'Correct timing of a relocation announcement is vital,' says Mr Steve
Abbley, managing director of PHH Homequity.
'No company should make known its intentions before establishing its
relocation strategy and in particular its policy for employees.' Most major
groups have already thought of this: 90 per cent of those with an annual
turnover of more than Pounds 500m have a written policy, says BHR.
Unfortunately, hardly any include non-financial assistance in these
statements.
Trouble can flare even when there is a written policy. 'Support from the
workforce will only be achieved if the information is believed and trusted,'
says Mr Abbley.
Companies must also stand their ground once a decision has been taken to
move - even if this comes as a shock to workers. Confusion and wavering over
whether a relocation will go ahead can be even more harmful to staff
relations than the threat of losing key workers.
That means doing an exhaustive study about why - and whether - to move.
Bringing workers into decision-making can be the glue that holds staff
together, says Mr Abbley. Briefing key staff early on about the support
available gives them a feeling of importance.
The tenor of the follow-up approach is crucial, however. 'We see the workers
as our clients nowadays rather than the employers, and treat them
accordingly,' says Mr Andrew Finney, managing director of Hambro Countrywide
Reloc- ation.
That means counselling and advice for whole families rather than just
cramming workers into a hall for a lecture. 'All too often, an employee's
family is the real source of discontent,' says Mr Abbley.
Hillier Parker found that almost half the country's top 500 companies intend
to cut costs by relocation.
During the recession staff have been forced to tag along. But as the economy
revives, alternative job opportunities will emerge. So employers will face
twin pressures of needing to rationalise and move but greater difficulty in
holding on to key workers. Unless they make greater efforts to improve
communications, the divorce rate between capital and labour could soar over
the next decade.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (14): Era of jobless growth -
Can Scotland continue to attract foreign investment?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An English economist who visited Glasgow recently was ticking off features
of the Scottish economy for which, he said, even the south of England would
give its eye-teeth. He listed a (slightly) lower unemployment rate, an
almost total absence of negative equity, a manufacturing base that now
included virtually no aged plants and, finally, an unrivalled capacity to
attract inward investment.
In Scotland inward investment (or foreign direct investment - FDI - as it is
increasingly called) is no longer the fashionable subject it was a few years
ago. Only last winter Scottish Enterprise, the development agency, was
warned by the US consultants Monitor that foreign branch manufacturing
plants were artificial creations which showed little capacity for
spontaneous growth.
The report, focusing on the Scottish electronics industry, also reiterated
concerns that in the near future Scotland would find it increasingly
difficult to attract FDI. It would face stronger competition from low cost
manufacturers in southern and eastern Europe.
Yet the fact is that a steady stream of foreign-owned companies continues to
arrive and open manufacturing plants. Scotland is gradually getting more
used to having an economy in which the commonest manufactured item is an
assembled printed circuit board, rather than a piece of riveted steelplate.
It is difficult to argue that plants like International Business Machines'
complex at Greenock or Compaq's nearby facility at Erskine have not put down
roots in Scotland, even if the former does only a small amount of product
development, and the latter almost none.
'We've had a hell of a year,' says Mr Robert Crawford, director of Locate in
Scotland, the inward investment bureau which has offices in the US, the
Asia-Pacific basin, continental Europe and London.
Though he cannot reveal his totals for 1993-94 (the report has to go to
ministers), he hints that Scotland's performance in terms of the number of
FDI projects won, jobs created and money committed will be even better than
in 1992-93, when foreign companies committed about Pounds 350m of FDI to
Scotland and said they would create more than 5,000 jobs.
As an example, Mitsubishi Electric opened its fourth manufacturing plant in
Scotland a few weeks ago, a 95,000 sq ft facility at Livingston which makes
air-conditioners and employs 200 people. In November the Singapore
electronics manufacturer PCI announced it would open a plant in East
Kilbride that would eventually employ 300 people.
At the beginning of this month, ICC, a Chicago-based company which
manufactures portable battery chargers, said it would set up a plant in East
Kilbride, creating 400 jobs over the next three years. It will be a major
supplier of, among others, Motorola's big mobile telephone plant at Easter
Inch.
And so it goes on. Setbacks, such as the departure from East Kilbride last
year of AST Computers, are absorbed. The fact that Compaq decided to
establish a new surface mount technology assembly line at Erskine, instead
of locating it in Singapore, is justifiably highlighted, as is a further
Pounds 93m investment by Roche in its Dalry, Ayrshire pharmaceuticals plant.
According to Mr Crawford, the US economy, growing at 5 per cent a year,
continues to be a good source of new FDI projects. Japan, on the other hand,
is yielding little. Taiwan and Singapore, he thinks, are more likely to
produce joint ventures and licensing arrangements with Scottish companies
rather than FDI projects, though he hopes to win a Taiwanese project later
this year.
'I don't think the emphasis on jobs as a measure of success is sustainable
in the long term,' he says, while acknowledging that as a yardstick it has
attractions for politicians. 'In an era of jobless growth we've got to find
some new way of measuring what foreign companies contribute to the economy.'
To try to extract more value from the foreign businesses already operating
in Scotland (there are between 400 and 500 of them) Locate in Scotland is
establishing a post for an official to strengthen contact with them and see
what extra opportunities they offer. It is also appointing a staff person to
Taiwan.
Although the threat of competition for FDI from eastern Europe is often
flagged up, Scotland has yet to feel its effects strongly. 'Eastern Europe
has not become massively competitive so far,' says Mr Crawford, 'but it will
develop. Most of the foreign money that's gone in there has been used to buy
up privatised businesses rather put up new plants,' he says.
Scotland has the advantages for investors of a good infrastructure (although
the Monitor report found some significant faults), government grants (though
not as good as those on offer in Ireland), duty-free access to the EU market
and the English language.
While Scotland is also winning investments from companies in other parts of
Britain, the flow of businesses relocating to Scotland is not as strong as
it was in the late 1980s, when Glasgow had a plausible hope of being able to
lure company headquarters to the city (it never succeeded). Now Glasgow
should get the army's new centralised personnel centre as part of the
government's relocation scheme.
In a well-publicised manoeuvre, the Department of Trade and Industry
transferred 60 engineers and geologists in the Petroleum Engineering
Division, which approves oilfield developments, from London to Aberdeen. As
part of a decentralisation trend, Conoco, the US oil company, is making
Aberdeen its UK headquarters, moving staff from London.
A possible threat to the winning of FDI is posed by the winding up, now
under way, of Scotland's new towns, where most inward investors want to go.
Scottish Enterprise has moved to acquire new town factory sites which could
be attractive to potential inward investors, with the government allocating
about Pounds 10m for that this year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (12): Barrier that may fall -
Impact of the Channel tunnel on business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel, the first land link between Britain and France since the
ending of the Ice Age 11,000 years ago, will have a profound impact on
travel patterns and the British psyche. It is also expected to have a
considerable influence on the location plans of business.
The tunnel should be able to offer a degree of convenience and reliability
which the ferries, subject as they are to the vagaries of the weather,
cannot match. Despite the improvements in the quality and the frequency of
ferry and airline services in recent years, the need to board a ship or take
an aeroplane has meant that the Channel has remained a psychological barrier
to business.
The creation of a land link between Britain and France should change all
that, though the tunnel is just one element in the rapidly evolving European
business environment. The creation of the single European market and changes
in manufacturing and distribution patterns also have an important influence
on a company's location decisions.
The tunnel's opening will have both a regional impact - on location
decisions in south-east England and north-east France - and also a broader
European impact on companies with a scale of operations and a location
strategy which embraces the entire continent.
At a regional level, location decisions will be influenced by the
development activity which is under way along the rail links between the
tunnel and London and Paris respectively. In Kent, Ashford has high hopes of
becoming a growth centre while across the Channel ambitious developments are
under way in Lille.
Ashford's position seems assured following the government's decision to
route Channel tunnel trains through the centre of the town rather than
bypassing it to the north. This should provide a boost for the new
international railway station currently being built in the centre of the
town.
But elsewhere along the route of the Channel tunnel rail link, the delays
and uncertainties which have surrounded the project have held back property
developments, according to Mr Kevin Lee, a property researcher at chartered
surveyors St Quintin.
Waterloo is the site of an impressive new international terminal but
completion of the Channel tunnel rail link in 2002 will shift the main
London terminus to St Pancras. The prospect of this move has left companies
uncertain as to the best location for fast Channel tunnel connections.
Similar uncertainty reigns over the site of another intermediate station on
the route with three contenders in the ring. Stratford in east London,
Rainham in Essex and Ebbsfleet in Kent are all seeking to win approval for
ambitious property developments though it is likely that only one will be
chosen. Too many stops on the high speed link would reduce the value of
building the link in the first place.
In stark contrast to this delay in the UK, the French government has pressed
ahead with the construction of a high speed line linking Calais with Paris
via Lille. Lille, which is now only an hour from Paris by train a grande
vitesse, is developing Euralille, a sizeable office and retail project on
the site of its recently completed TGV station.
On the broader, European scale, the vastly improved rail freight links
between, for example, the north of England and Italy, will clip hours, if
not days, off shipment times across Europe. This can be expected to
influence the location decisions of businesses with manufacturing plant
spread around Europe.
By the same token, rapid passenger journey times between London, Paris and
Brussels may prompt multinational corporations to rethink their decision on
the location of main or branch offices. Even before the high-speed rail link
is completed between the tunnel and London, through journey times should
prove very competitive with the airlines.
When the tunnel is finally open for business it will offer four principal
services to the traveller or the freight operator. Freight will travel
through the tunnel on long-distance services carrying containers, swap
bodies and trailers or on shuttles
The shuttles will carry trucks between Folkestone and Calais but the
long-distance services will run to a wide range of destinations throughout
Europe.
London to Madrid should be possible in 36 hours and Manchester to Mannheim
in 24 hours. In the absence of the delays associated with rail freight
shipments across the Channel by ferry, through journeys by train should take
only half as long as the equivalent road journey, according to calculations
by the organisations selling rail space.
Railfreight Distribution, British Rail's freight arm responsible for
container shipments, expects the opening of the tunnel to increase train
freight volumes from 2m tonnes a year to 6.5m tonnes after two years.
In the meantime, passenger services will also consist of through services,
initially between London, Paris and Brussels, and of car shuttles operating
between Folkestone and Calais.
The opening of the tunnel will make it easier for multinational companies to
include the UK in the rationalisation of their distribution operations. Many
companies have been moving away from national distribution centres - which
involve considerable amounts of inventory - towards continent-wide
distribution operations.
'Because the Channel tunnel provides a more effective link with Europe it
creates the option for distribution centres to serve the whole of north-
west Europe, including the UK,' says Professor James Cooper, director of the
Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Transportation.
This may mean that companies which at present have a UK distribution centre
in the Midlands will consider relocating to northern France or the Benelux
countries. However, such a move would not be without its problems because
supplying the Scottish and Irish markets would be more difficult.
Creating Europe-wide distribution centres may also run into the problem that
different national markets may have their own technical, language and
packaging requirements which reduce the scope for cutting back on inventory.
Delays to the opening of Channel tunnel services have proved a distraction
from the benefits that the tunnel will eventually bring. If it can show it
is able to provide a reliable, high-quality service it will become an
important factor in location decisions.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (11): Rail and road in a new
climate - Franchising and motorway tolling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What the railways achieved in the middle of the 19th century, the motorways
have done in the second half of the 20th. Both opened up parts of the
country previously cut off from the commercial mainstream and increased the
choice of locations available to business.
But while both transport networks are now substantially in place, the ways
in which they are managed and financed are undergoing considerable change.
British Rail is being privatised after 47 years in public ownership while
the motorways, previously free at the point of use, are being prepared for
an ambitious electronic tolling programme.
If these two experiments are successful, there is every prospect that both
road and rail will provide a better service for the business community. But
the more commercial climate in which both modes of transport will be
required to work could have considerable financial implications for the
business user.
To take rail first: the privatisation, or more accurately the franchising
out, of British Rail's operations will lead to the creation of 25
independent train operating companies. They will compete to provide train
services, using leased rolling stock on track rented from a separate
infrastructure company, Railtrack.
Management buy-out teams and trade bidders from sectors such as buses and
shipping are all gearing up to bid for BR's operating companies as they are
put up for sale over the next three years. The operations on offer range
from single lines such as the London to Gatwick airport express to entire
networks such as Scot- Rail and Great Western.
Successful bidders will acquire franchises, probably for between five and 15
years, to provide a rail service over their designated routes. As the train
operators settle down, they are likely to want to expand their activities to
compete with other franchisees.
The government will maintain a considerable level of subsidy to most of the
operating companies but it hopes that managers freed from the constraints of
BR will be able to expand the market place.
Many of the BR managers currently contemplating bids have ambitious
marketing plans. Despite the sophistication of BR Intercity's marketing to
the business traveller and its success in expanding rail usership, there is
still enormous potential among business travellers previously wedded to the
company car.
While much of the market growth is expected to come from expanding off-peak,
discounted leisure travel, some rail managements have plans to attract
business travellers who may not have used a train for the past decade. Many
businessmen and women have an outdated idea of the service now offered by
the railways.
Ideas under consideration include free travel to reintroduce people to the
idea of using the train, the provision of 'club class' carriages for
business travellers, and an increase in high-speed shuttle services designed
to attract the businessman.
Privatisation does, however, also increase the prospect that little-used
lines will close. The government says it expects there will be no
significant changes in the extent of the rail network for the first few
years but splitting up the railway will expose to public view the
profitability or otherwise of individual routes. It would then prove harder
to justify massively loss-making lines.
Less radical change appears likely for the freight side of BR where its bulk
operations, carrying products such as coal and steel, are being split into
three geographically defined companies and put up for sale to the private
sector. The domestic container business, moving 'boxes' from ports to inland
railheads and the international business, shipping containers by ferry and
the Channel tunnel, will also be sold.
Domestic rail freight has always been hampered by the absence of many viable
long-haul routes in the UK but the opening of the Channel tunnel will plug
the British rail network into that of continental Europe and does open up
significant opportunities.
The government's plans for BR coincide with moves internationally to free
railways from state control though the British approach is considerably more
ambitious than that elsewhere. Proposals to introduce tolls on the motorway
network, on the other hand, follow a pattern long-established in France and
Italy.
With ever-tighter constraints on the government's transport budgets, the
idea is to make better use of the existing motorway network rather than to
continue building new roads. The Department of Transport recently dropped or
shelved nearly a third of its Pounds 21bn roads programme.
The department is currently working with nearly 400 private sector companies
to develop a comprehensive electronic tolling system which could cope with
Britain's busy motorways. The system needs to be capable of registering and
charging up to 12,000 vehicles an hour travelling at speeds of up to 70mph.
The likelihood is that overhead or roadside 'readers' would record the
passage of a vehicle, deducting a sum from the driver's pre-paid account or
billing him or her for future payment. The government has rejected from the
outset the idea of installing payment booths on the motorway on the grounds
that they would slow the traffic flow.
In its technical detail this programme is more advanced than any tolling
system in use around the world, a factor which causes some observers to
doubt whether the government will achieve its ambitious target date of 1998
to introduce the new system.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has spoken of charges of 1.5p a mile
for cars and 4.5p a mile for lorries. The government calculates this would
raise Pounds 700m a year if the entire 1,900-mile motorway network were
covered. These charges are low compared with those imposed on the continent
but the government is fearful of driving motorists off the motorways to
other trunk roads.
Motorway tolling will force travellers to make a payment at the time of
travel. That may lead them to consider if their journey is worthwhile or
whether they should take the train. Clearly, the impact of tolling will
depend on the level at which charges are finally set, though travel costs
would be only one issue among many to be taken into account.
There is no doubt, however, that modern manufacturing methods frequently
require raw materials, components and sub-assemblies to travel considerable
distances between factories. The cost of transport will therefore increase.
But motorway tolling should lead to a reduction in congestion and thus
reduce journey times for the business traveller and lorry shipments.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (9): Getting some cash for
your move / A look into the availability of public finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No business can afford to make a relocation decision in the UK without
looking into the availability of public finance to assist in the move.
The highest profile help comes in the form of the regional selective
assistance provided by the government, which can make a significant cash
grant towards the costs of a business locating in the assisted areas.
Smaller firms may also be eligible for regional investment grants.
But there are many worthwhile incentives in other forms, including cheap
accommodation, help with training and tax incentives for businesses that
locate in enterprise zones.
The cash grants provided in the assisted areas make them the most appealing
places in the first instance for businesses seeking a new location. Nissan,
for example, received two tranches of regional selective assistance worth
Pounds 44m in total towards the capital costs of its plant at Sunderland,
Tyne and Wear.
Regional selective assistance has made a substantial impact on employment in
the assisted areas according to Mr Nick Mansley of PA Cambridge Economic
Consultants, which last year published an evaluation of the scheme. This
estimated that between 1985 and 1988, the scheme had created between 75,000
and 100,000 additional jobs at a net cost of Pounds 560 to Pounds 790 per
net job year.
'For companies choosing to locate in the UK, it is on average the third most
important factor after a pre-existing presence and the need to be in the UK
market,' says Mr Mansley.
In most of the assisted areas, a variety of local development bodies can
offer further help in relocating a business. These include:
The urban development corporations which clear derelict industrial sites and
create modern factory and office developments.
Training and Enterprise Councils - they can help in recruiting and training
staff.
English Partnerships, the urban regeneration agency which has inherited the
portfolio of factories, workshops and offices managed by English Estates.
Regional and local development organisations such as the Northern
Development Company which covers the north-east and Cumbria.
Enterprise zones offer companies which set up in them exemption from
business rates, 100 per cent allowances on corporation tax for capital
expenditure on buildings, and greatly simplified planning procedures. At
present there are just six, with three more about to be set up in former
coalfield areas such as Lanarkshire in Scotland.
One of the most successful enterprise zones was set up after the closure of
the steelworks in the Northamptonshire town of Corby. Its term expired in
1991, but it had been sufficiently successful in attracting new businesses
for Corby to be removed from the list of assisted areas when the map was
redrawn last year.
At the same time as Corby disappeared from the map of assisted areas, parts
of London and the south-east of England were added for the first time.
In London, the Lea valley, Park Royal estate and the London end of the East
Thames corridor are now included - providing help for companies relocating
close to the capital's heart. Outside London, the Isle of Wight and parts of
Kent, Sussex and East Anglia have joined the list of economically
disadvantaged areas.
Overall, the assisted areas cover 34 per cent of Britain's working
population. Slightly less than half lie in what are termed development
areas, those the government says have the worst unemployment problems. They
are eligible for higher rates of regional selective assistance and for both
types of regional enterprise grants.
Less generous support is available for the remaining assisted areas, known
as intermediate areas.
The Isle of Thanet in East Kent is the first part of the south-east to
acquire development area status, to the delight of the local authority.
'It has taken Thanet into a different league,' says Mr David Ralls, chief
executive of Thanet district council. 'We've already had Pounds 2/3 m in
grants for Thanet companies seeking to expand. And there is an accelerating
range of inquiries from companies thinking about moving into the area,
attracted by the availability of grants.'
Regional selective assistance is available to manufacturing industries other
than those where support is barred by the European Union (such as iron and
steel, shipbuilding and man-made yarn). Services also qualify so long as
they serve more than the local market.
Grants are based on the fixed capital costs of a project and on the number
of jobs it is expected to create. On average, awards in development areas
run at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the capital cost of a project.
In intermediate areas, the average is 10 per cent.
Regional enterprise grants are available to small companies in assisted
areas and localities affected by colliery closure. For investment projects,
these can cover 15 per cent of the cost of fixed assets up to a maximum of
Pounds 15,000.
Innovation grants to support the development and introduction of new or
improved products or processes cover 50 per cent of eligible costs up to a
maximum of Pounds 25,000. They are also available in inner-city areas
covered by a City Challenge scheme or a task force.
In 1992-93, more than Pounds 200m was paid out in regional selective
assistance by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Scottish Office and
the Welsh Office. Regional enterprise grants totalled Pounds 8.4m. Northern
Ireland, which has its own industrial development programmes spent another
Pounds 95m.
To qualify for regional selective assistance, there are several criteria:
The project must show viability - ie a good chance of paying its way.
It must need the grant if it is to go ahead. This requires it to be shown
that the project would not go ahead without the grant, or would go ahead on
a smaller scale.
It must create or safeguard jobs.
It must have a regional or national benefit.
Meeting both the first two criteria can be a fine balancing act, according
to Mr Vince Taylor, a specialist grants consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the accountants.
'It is important not to begin the work before making the application for
regional assistance,' he says. 'Officials will assume that if you've already
started, you're committed to taking the project forward and don't need
help.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (10): The best place to live
 -The findings of countrywide researchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea breezes. Lakes and mountains. Historic sites and buildings. Such
attractions feature prominently in advertising and marketing material as
Britain's cities and regions compete with each other for new industrial and
commercial investment.
It is an easy game to play, at least for advertising agencies. Britain's
compact nature and extensive motorway system ensure that no example of grim
industrial dereliction and urban decay is more than about an hour away from
glorious scenery.
This is, however, only the beginning. Companies considering relocating - and
their employees - are asking increasingly detailed questions about the
quality of life. Access to fresh air and outdoor amenities is indeed an
important consideration, but it will not sell a location that has a negative
reputation in other ways.
In Britain, many organisations considering a move, and local authorities
seeking to attract investment, make use of the researches of the Quality of
Life Group, a joint unit at Glasgow and Strathclyde universities. Since the
1980s, the group has tried to break through the inevitably impressionistic,
'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' approaches to finding a good place to
live, and develop a sound academic basis for measuring the quality of life.
Opinion surveys were constructed to establish the factors people regarded as
most important in a location, and the results then applied to amenities
available in particular cities and towns.
Living in a low crime area emerged as the most important priority, followed
by access to good public services and suitable housing. All these factors
were regarded as more important than employment prospects, which came fourth
in the order of priorities.
When the Glasgow-Strathclyde researchers applied the public priorities to
actual towns and cities, Edinburgh emerged as Britain's most desirable urban
location. Aberdeen was second with another Scottish location,
Motherwell-Hamilton, featuring in the top ten. Scotland's attraction was
further confirmed by a subsequent study of smaller towns, when the most
popular were headed by Perth.
Edinburgh's position as number one is untypical of big British cities in
general which, on the Quality of Life Group's criteria, tend to be seen as
less desirable places to live than smaller locations. And not all the most
popular locations share Edinburgh and Perth's strong tourist images.
Bradford, Stoke-on-Trent and Middlesbrough all featured in the top ten.
Sheffield came one place ahead of Oxford, and Birkenhead several ahead of
Bournemouth.
Regionally, the West Midlands fares particularly badly, with Wolverhampton,
Coventry and Birmingham all low on the list. Can a city improve its standing
in relocation league tables if some of the image factors that make it appear
unappealing to outsiders are, perhaps, out of date? Birmingham, of all
English cities, has recently made gigantic strides to develop its amenities
with a new convention centre, its world class Symphony Hall and nurturing of
arts institutions.
Members of the Quality of Life team believe it is possible to change an
image, although it will involve prolonged effort. Glasgow, which was
regarded in negative terms a decade ago, now enjoys a more positive
reputation after sustained campaigns. Research showed that impressions of
the city rose considerably during 1990 when it was European cultural
capital, although some - but not all - of the improvement was lost when
attention switched from the city afterwards.
growing number of households, meaning that employers must take account of
employment prospects for spouses when making relocation decisions. Living
costs are obviously another factor likely to feature in discussions about
locations.
The Staffordshire-based Reward Group, which conducts research and
consultancy on pay and benefits, carries out surveys on relative living
costs around the country. Its most recent found that all the most expensive
locations were in the south-east - London, Woking, Welwyn Garden City,
Slough and Berkhamsted - while the cheapest were Northern Ireland,
Billingham in Cleveland and Wolverhampton. Over the past five years,
however, living costs in the north have risen compared to the national
average while lower house prices have reduced the relative cost of living in
the south.
London scored badly on the Quality of Life Group's assessment of British
locations. Its powerful international image does, however, sometimes give it
advantages in attracting institutions from overseas. The government found
last year that the capital's reputation as an international city, its
worldwide air transport links and advanced telecommunications were all
strong factors in a successful campaign to attract the European Medicines
Evaluation Agency to London. It will open next year and, although initially
employing only about 300 staff, may indirectly create thousands more drug
industry jobs.
Britain remains a nation of rich regional variations. These include some
disturbing ones that should perhaps be taken into account when considering
relocation decisions, but often are not. Health differences, for example,
vary dramatically around the country. The most significant variations are
related to economic status and deprivation but, across all classes, there is
also a north-south divide. For reasons that are only partly understood, the
south is, generally speaking, a healthier place to live than the north.
By taking all available and often conflicting factors into account, it would
be possible to spend a lifetime researching the ideal place to live. East
Anglia has the greatest proportion of detached houses in the country - but
also the highest fatal and serious road accident rate.
However much relocation is turned into a precise science, part of any
decision will always be made on basic impressions, as the friendly rivalry
between neighbouring cities often illustrates. Edinburgh may win polls as
Britain's most desirable location but many citizens of Glasgow, proud of
their city's reputation for sociability, would rather move to an uninhabited
Scottish island than live there.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (7): Long haul to raise
standards - Skill levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accurate comparisons between skill levels in the UK and its main competitors
such as France, Germany and Japan are difficult to make.
Indeed, they may not always be a fair measure of workforce skills. In Japan,
for example, training is much less likely than in Europe to lead to a
qualification.
Nevertheless, there is common agreement that the UK has a skills problem.
And, despite the recession and large-scale unemployment, severe skills
shortages are forecast in a number of occupations, including high-tech
industries, unless the problem is solved.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the London-based
organisation, has estimated that in 1988-89 the proportion of the workforce
with higher educational qualifications was roughly comparable to that in
Germany, whereas the proportion with an intermediate level qualification,
that is at craft or supervisory level, was far lower than in France or
Germany.
It is a problem that many in the UK regard as the central difficulty
affecting UK manufacturing. Indeed, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, who this week published a white paper on competitiveness, has
said he considers training and education as the second most important factor
in competitiveness after the management of the economy.
A recent report, from a Commons select committee for trade and industry,
said: 'Given that it is becoming ever easier to transfer capital and
technology around the world, the skills of the workforce will increasingly
be the determining factor in the competitiveness of different countries.'
So what is the UK government and industry itself doing about the situation?
A number of initiatives, which may bear fruit over the next decade, have
been put in place.
One of the most significant, albeit controversial, has been the development
of a coherent framework of new national vocational qualifications which are
based on an individual's ability to do a job.
Called National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) they start at level one,
which is fairly basic, progressing through craft level qualifications to
level five, which is a managerial one.
The qualifications themselves have been attacked for various reasons.
Nevertheless, they are a basis upon which refinements can be made, according
to their supporters, which include the Confederation of British Industry.
Indeed, national targets for improved attainment of qualifications among the
workforce and young people were drawn up by the CBI, and endorsed by the
government.
There are several targets. One of the most important seeks to tackle the
underlying problem of poor standards achieved by young people. The target is
that by the year 2000, 50 per cent of young people should reach NVQ level 3,
which is a craft level qualification, or its academic equivalent of two 'A'
levels.
Attainment of the targets may not, however, be sufficient to create a
workforce that can compete. Indeed, the National Advisory Council for
Education and Training Targets, an employer-led body which is monitoring the
targets, has warned that some targets may have to be higher if the UK is to
match the attainment levels of its competitors' workforces.
A second important development by the government has been the establishment
of 82 employer-led training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in England and
Wales, and 14 local enterprise companies (Lecs) in Scotland.
The government's intention is the private sector, from which these bodies'
non-executive boards are mainly drawn, will bring a new dynamism to the
drive to improve skills in the UK as well as foster economic regeneration in
their local areas.
Tecs and Lecs have been in existence for a little over three years and there
is growing evidence that they are generally improving the attainment of
qualifications among young people and the long-term unemployed. They are
paid nearly Pounds 2bn a year by the government to administer training
schemes.
However, there is no measurement yet of whether Tecs have made any impact on
improving the training of existing workers, this being a key group as 80 per
cent of the workforce of the year 2000 is already in work.
The problem is not simple. According to a recent survey by Price Waterhouse,
the management consultancy, the expenditure on training in the UK as a
percentage of pay bills is reasonably in line with elsewhere in Europe.
However, it is the UK's relative failure in basic education, according to
the select committee, that makes employers' roles more difficult and
expensive.
The government is seeking to address the latter problem, with the
introduction of new vocational qualifications into schools, so as to cater
for those who are not academically inclined. These reforms will take some
time to introduce.
At the same time Tecs, in partnership with other bodies such as local
authorities, are introducing a wide variety of strategies in their local
areas to assist both existing employers and inward investors. These include
initiatives such as Investors in People, an assessment based on best
management practice which helps companies improve their in-house training,
as well as customised training.
Tyneside Tec, in the north-east of England, working in partnership with the
government's Employment Service and South Tyneside College, recently
provided customised training for new employees being recruited by Onwa, a
subsidiary of a Hong Kong television manufacturing company, which has opened
a plant in the region.
More than 250 people - some 190 of whom were unemployed - have been taken on
by the new inward investor. Tec representatives visited other plants owned
by Onwa. 'We observed the range of occupations and the culture within the
company,' says Mrs Jean Thomas, business development manager at Tyneside
Tec.
to the needs of their constituents, the Tecs hope they can 'add value' in
their localities. Their efforts, along with those of the government, will,
however, be a long haul.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (6): Crumbs of comfort for
pessimists - Philip Coggan assesses the prospects for Britain's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long experience of the UK economy has made observers deeply cynical. Even
after the so-called 'Thatcher miracle', the long 1980s boom ended as so many
had done before it, with inflation rising sharply and the current account
slumping into deficit.
So it is not surprising that many fear the current UK recovery will
eventually run into the same problems.
Throughout 1993, the pessimists were repeatedly disappointed. Growth was
stronger and inflation lower than they had expected. Indeed, interest rates
and inflation were at their lowest levels for a generation.
Such conditions were all the more remarkable when one considers the policy
vacuum which followed sterling's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism
in September 1992. Many commentators thought that inflation was bound to
revive 12-18 months later, as it had done after previous devaluations.
They evidently under- estimated the deflationary pressures which were
present in the world and UK economies. In early 1994, the oil price dropped
back, in real terms, to the levels reached before the first oil shock in
1973.
The debt hangover from the late 1980s boom has made both companies and
consumers nervous about borrowing: broad money supply growth has been
sluggish in the UK. Central banks remain vigilant against inflation and have
kept real interest rates at high levels, despite deep recessions.
Nevertheless, all the above factors may merely be cyclical, rather than
structural.
One does not have to look too hard at the economic statistics to find
evidence that the UK's old problems may return: a pick-up in the rate of
growth of average earnings, a high budget deficit, a trade account that
stayed in deficit throughout the recession and is now widening, an excess of
private consumption and a lack of investment.
An equally forthright school of thought believes that the current recovery
will be too feeble to bring much prosperity to the average Briton, or to
make much of a dent in the unemployment totals. The tax increases introduced
by Chancellors Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke, which will raise between
Pounds 15bn and Pounds 17bn over the next three fiscal years, are expected
to prove a drag on economic growth.
Often, these debates about the prospects for the UK economy become bogged
down in sterile arguments about the size of the 'output gap'. According to
this theory, there is a trend rate of output growth. If the economy is
growing above the trendline, capacity constraints are likely to cause
inflation, as they did in the late 1980s. If the economy is growing below
the trendline, there is a 'gap', and the country can enjoy non-inflationary
growth.
The problem is that there is no consensus on the trend rate of growth, nor
on the size of the output gap. Pessimists, like Mr Bill Martin of UBS, think
that the gap is small and that 'the economy is structurally deficient,
having neither ample spare capacity nor an adequate internationally-trading
sector.' But the International Monetary Fund estimates an output gap of 4-5
per cent which, if correct, would allow the UK many years of
non-inflationary GDP growth at, say, 3 per cent.
International investors might prefer to look back at the UK's long
inflationary history and reflect that, when push came to shove, the monetary
authorities have always gone for the easy option of devaluation and
inflation.
Economic policy was perceived to be in ruins after sterling's departure from
the ERM. Piece by piece, the authorities have put together a monetary
framework designed both to gain credibility with the financial markets and
to allow the UK economy to recover. The Bank of England now has a much more
prominent role. It publishes a quarterly inflation report and has the
responsibility for the timing of interest rate moves.
The theory is that 'political' influences on interest rate moves should be
avoided, although the chancellor still has the final decision on whether to
change rates.
When the minutes of the monthly meetings between the chancellor and the
governor of the Bank of England were first published in April, they duly
showed that the former was much more keen on cutting rates than the latter.
Publication of the minutes may give the governor more power, since if the
chancellor were perceived to be recklessly ignoring his advice, that
information would soon be common knowledge. But the real test may come when
it becomes public knowledge that a chancellor has overruled the governor's
desire for an increase in interest rates to combat inflation.
Financial markets do not yet seem ready to accept the anti-inflationary
credentials of the new system. There is certainly a perception that the Bank
is much more keen than the chancellor on getting inflation down to the lower
half of the 1-4 per cent target range.
The other traditional British problem, the balance of payments deficit, is a
further source of debate. The deficit appears to be deteriorating; on the
current account, from Pounds 1.8bn in the third quarter of 1993 to Pounds
2.6bn in the fourth quarter; and on visible trade, from Pounds 1.77bn in
1993's fourth quarter to Pounds 2.12bn in the first quarter of 1994.
The official statistics also appear to show that British exporters used the
devaluation to raise prices, rather than to increase their market share.
Thus, the trend in trade is much worse in volume, than in value, terms.
However, doubt is cast on these figures by the Confederation of British
Industry's survey, which appears to show that exporters have been cutting
prices. And the switch to the Intrastat system of collecting statistics
(based on VAT receipts, rather than customs returns) for trade with the
European Union has led some to believe that the new figures are understating
imports.
Doubts about the quality of the statistics make it even more difficult than
usual to be definitive about the economy's prospects. But for a government
seeking re-election in 1996 or 1997, neither of the two most likely
scenarios have much appeal.
The first is that the economy will accelerate and run into balance of
payments and inflationary constraints, causing the authorities to slam on
the monetary brakes.
The other is that growth will continue at a modest, non-inflationary pace
but without creating the 'feel good' factor of rising prosperity and low
unemployment that makes voters smile on governments.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (8): The showcase of Europe /
A look at an extremely competitive telecoms market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is Europe's telecommunications showcase. Its government has pushed
liberalisation and privatisation farther and faster than anywhere else on
the continent.
Not just in law or theory. In practice, the UK telecoms market is more
competitive than any other in the EU, or arguably in the world. More than 40
operators hold govern- ment telecoms licences, and at least a dozen are
currently operating services in all or part of the UK.
At the national level, BT faces stiff competition from Mercury, a subsidiary
of Cable &amp; Wireless, an experienced international telecoms oper- ator.
Mercury offers a nationwide service - including ISDN - to the business and
residential markets.
Launched a decade ago at the privatisation of British Telecommunications -
then the monopoly operator - Mer- cury has won 11 per cent of the national
market. Most of its custom comes from the bus- iness sector, especially in
the City of London, where it has about two-thirds of outgoing long-distance
traffic secured through cheaper tariff pack- ages than those offered by BT.
A recent survey by Analysys, a UK consultancy, shows the UK to be cheaper
than France, Germany and Italy for tele- coms for all users except
residential customers and some one-line businesses, where France comes out
better.
The City is the focus of the most intense competition in the UK. Apart from
BT and Mercury, three other operators are competing for business with
dedicated networks - US operators MFS and Colt, and Videotron, a Canadian
operator which also has licences to provide combined cable television and
telephone services elsewhere in London.
A third operator with a dedicated long-distance network - and facilities for
direct connections to large City institutions - is also about to join the
fray. Energis, a subsidiary of the National Grid, is about to launch a
network erected on the UK's long-distance electricity pylons. It is likely
to engage in a price war with BT and Mercury - putting Mercury on the
defensive for the first time.
All of which is good news for business. As is the competition in urban areas
across Britain between BT and the cable companies - mostly US-owned -
building combined television and telephone networks. Over the next five
years the cable companies are investing Pounds 6bn in new networks and
already boast nearly 400,000 lines - 40,000 of them business lines.
The cable companies claim that their ability to harness three revenue
streams - telephony, television and the new world of inter-active
'multimedia' services - from one network will enable them to slash the cost
of telecommunications. If so, Britain will enjoy the fruits before most of
Europe, where cable networks are either undeveloped or utilised exclusively
for television.
However, for most telecoms users the benefits of competition and
privatisation are measured in better service from BT itself. At
privatisation BT had an unenviable reputation for inefficiency. Spurred on
by competition, the company has made itself responsive and user-friendly to
a degree unmatched across much of Europe, where state-owned monopoly
operators continue to reign supreme - albeit, in most of the EU, with an
obligation to open their markets to competition by 1998.
However, beware of the hype. A recent benchmarking survey by the UK's
Department of Trade and Industry concluded that Britain's telecoms services
were, all-round 'a good second' - towards the top of the international
league on most scores, but heading it on practically none. No other European
country occupied a more commanding position overall, but the US was ahead on
many scores.
On pricing, for instance, a very different picture emerges if one looks at
leased lines - essential for large businesses constructing their own
national or international 'virtual private networks' - rather than public
network charges. For leased lines, while the benchmarking survey found the
cost of similar high-capacity leased lines markedly lower in Britain than in
most of continental Europe, the prices were far lower in the US than in
Britain.
Reuters, which has the largest private telecoms network in the world, claims
that it would save 90 per cent of its outgoings for leased lines in Europe
if the equivalent network were in the US. As the DTI notes, 'such high costs
not only increase the costs for business, they also suppress business
activity by making it uneconomic to offer certain types of service or to
carry out some business activities.'
There is another moral. Britain may be an island, but its competitive
position in telecoms depends critically on high-quality services and low
tariffs across its continent. Services are improving and tariffs falling -
but overall, Europe lags behind the US on both scores.
However, on the same regional dimension Europe is well ahead of Asia-Pacific
 -the other great regional magnet for relocating companies - where a few
islands of first-world telecoms subsist in a sea of inefficiency and
antiquated networks.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (5): Regional gap in cost of
renting gets narrower - The recovery of the property market in different
parts of the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK property market has begun its recovery, after the deepest downturn
since the war. But the legacy of the property recession will have a lasting
impact on companies which are considering a relocation.
The fall in property costs over the past three years has relieved some
companies of pressure to uproot from their existing locations. Moreover, the
incentive for a company to move long distances has diminished, as the gap
between the cost of renting property in different parts of the country has
narrowed.
The property recession hit London far more severely than most regional
centres, helping to even out some of the formerly sharp variations in
property costs and supply around the country.
For example, in the City of London, which was part- icularly badly affected
by the downturn, top quality property can be rented for less than half the
Pounds 70 per sq ft it fetched at the peak of the market in 1988. In
Manchester, by contrast, top rents have scarcely fallen during the recession
from a peak of Pounds 21 per sq ft.
Another consequence of the property downturn which has reduced the flow of
relocations is that many companies are unable to move premises because of
the difficulty of disposing of existing leases. Many tenants are locked into
leases which require them to pay far more than the market rate, creating
difficulties in assigning leases to another tenant.
Nonetheless, companies which have the freedom to move have the opportunity
of securing property at rents close to the bottom of the market. Office
rents have fallen by about 40 per cent from their peak and industrial rents
are down by about 20 per cent, according to Hillier Parker, chartered
surveyors.
In most parts of the country, asking rents are static or falling. But
gradually, as tenant demand increases, the incentives on offer from
landlords, such as rent-free periods and cash contributions for fitting out
costs, are declining. Most tenants are still able to negotiate relatively
flexible leases, although as supply and demand returns to balance, landlords
will be anxious to return to 25-year leases, with upwards-only rent reviews
at five-year intervals, which are traditional in the UK market.
Signs are emerging that pockets of the London market may recover more
rapidly than other parts of the country. The vacancy rate for Central London
office property - of which 23.5m sq ft is available - has fallen from a peak
of 18 per cent in mid-1992 to 12 per cent, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe,
property advisers.
Brokers at Paribas Capital Markets predict that rents for the best modern
office properties in London could rise by more than 30 per cent this year,
although poorly-located and older buildings will continue to decline in
value.
Outside the south-east, the main office markets have been relatively stable,
as a result of fewer developments during the 1980s and a lower impact of
recession on office employment levels. But with a smaller pool of potential
demand, the prov- incial cities may experience less upwards pressure on
rents than in London.
The availability of property, as well as its cost, is a crucial factor in
determining a reloc- ation decision. After several years when development
activity has been at a low ebb, there is a shortage of modern offices in
several cities. According to Chesterton, the property advisers, 'regional
centres offer little to potential relocators in terms of readily available
office space. Major requirements exceed supply in many regional centres.'
Birmingham, for instance, has some of the lowest levels of available space
of any large UK office centres. At the end of 1993, there was about 789,000
sq ft of empty space - available at a cost of up to Pounds 20 per sq ft -
out of a total market of 16m sq ft.
Developers are gradually getting back into the market. In a recent report,
Chesterton estimated that just 2.7m sq ft of speculative development was
under way in London and 3.2m sq ft in regional centres. Although more
developments are now starting, activity is likely to remain at a low ebb
while tenant demand is uncertain and there is a shortage of bank finance for
speculative schemes.
In the industrial sector, signs of increased tenant demand are slowly
beginning to appear. In January, the availability of empty premises began to
fall for the first time since 1989.
According to King Sturge, chartered surveyors, a total of 182m sq ft of
industrial property is available to let. Demand is concentrated on new
buildings, which account for just 9 per cent of the total available space.
Tenant demand has been strongest for large distribution warehouses adjacent
to motorways.
The availability of industrial space is at its greatest in the south-east,
Wales and East Anglia. But in the West Midlands and the south-west, vacancy
rates are tighter and agents believe there could be some rent increases as
soon as the first quarter of next year.
Another factor affecting relocation decisions is the impact of the
revaluation of the Uniform Business Rate in 1995, which is based on rental
values in April 1993.
The revaluation is likely to shift the rates burden from the south to the
north. In London and the south-east, where rents fell sharply between 1988
and 1993, reductions in rateable value could be between 40 and 50 per cent,
according to James Capel, the broker. In regional centres outside London,
where rents peaked later and subsequently underwent more modest falls, the
rates burden is set to increase.
Herring Baker Harris, a firm of surveyors, has estimated that the proportion
of the business rates bill shouldered by industrial occupiers will rise from
18 per cent to 22 per cent, while that borne by retailers will remain
broadly stable and that from offices may decline from 29 per cent to 27 per
cent.
The shift in the rates burden, together with differential falls in rental
costs, has tended to even out property costs across the country. As a
result, companies needing to relocate their premises are tending to move
shorter distances.
Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors, believes that about two-thirds of
companies moving out of London over the next three years will stay in the
south-east region.
The cost of property remains a key factor influencing a company's decision
to relocate. Jones Lang Wootton reports that between 1983 and 1992, the
chance to make property cost savings was the main reason for moving in 55
per cent of cases.
In 1993, however, four out of the eight large companies moving out of London
London cited 'operational and organisation issues' as the main factor
influencing their decision. As companies emerge from recession, the drive to
improve their efficiency is encouraging them to consolidate and restructure
their operations.
The prospect of substantial property savings has become a less important
factor in generating long distance property moves than it was in the late
1980s.
Nonetheless, the opportunity to obtain property at prices close to the
bottom of the market could secure an important advantage for companies that
are willing and able to move.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (4): Workplaces open up to
innovation - How the industrial relations scene has changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's industrial relations system - once notorious in the outside world
for its wildcat strikes, obstacles to change and low productivity  - is seen
as an increasingly important factor in the country's attractiveness for
inward investors.
In the words of a recent study of the UK manufacturing sector's
competitiveness produced by the House of Commons trade and industry
committee, it is 'now widely regarded as a competitive strength'.
Working days lost through strikes last year were the lowest since official
records of industrial conflicts began in 1891 - following on 1991 and 1992
which were themselves remarkably trouble-free. But that alone does not
explain the new mood of optimism about labour performance. More important
has been the accumulation of evidence that suggests attitudes towards
workplace innovation have been transformed.
This has led to the widespread removal across much of industry of the old
'them' and 'us' divisions of the shopfloor, with the outlawing of the closed
shop, the dismantling of demarcation lines between jobs and the removal of
restrictions on recruitment. An increasing number of companies are replacing
adversarial attitudes with a new spirit of partnership in the workplace.
Of course, the techniques of Human Resource Management are still hardly the
norm in British industry. 'The empowerment of employees has taken root in
only a minority of UK manufacturing firms,' admitted the trade and industry
committee report.
a wide range of foreign companies operating in Britain suggests workplace
change based on consent and co-operation is by no means uncommon, either. In
recent months a number of them - Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Sony - have been
parading the achievements of their UK plants before MPs in a number of
separate inquiries.
Dr Paul Marginson, of the School of Industrial and Business Studies at
Warwick University, argues multinational companies are attracted to Britain
nowadays because they face 'fewer statutory constraints' in the way they
handle labour than in mainland European countries. As a result, there is
'greater scope' for them to introduce 'innovatory practices'.
He also points to the attractiveness of the UK's low labour costs for some
inward investors. This is not so much a case of low pay. Hourly earnings in
the UK remain substantially lower than in Germany but are higher than in
France and Japan.
The big difference lies in the so-called 'on-costs' covering social welfare,
training, holidays and welfare benefits which are met in the UK mainly by
the state or the employee.
Companies operating in Britain have a much lower non-wage labour cost burden
to carry than those in any other European country except Ireland. This
provides the UK with a distinct cost advantage compared with its main
trading competitors.
The latest comparative labour cost statistics (taking into account exchange
rate differences) compiled by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics indicate
that the UK manufacturing employers' labour costs in 1992 averaged Dollars
14.69 an hour compared with Dollars 16.16 an hour in Japan, Dollars 16.17 an
hour in the US and Dollars 25.94 an hour in Germany.
Many of the public agencies are keen to point to the low cost of labour as
an attraction for inward investors. As Locate in Scotland declared: 'Wages
and salaries in Scotland are lower than the UK average. Indeed, Scottish
hourly scales are among the lowest in Europe, especially in manufacturing.
'Total on-costs are lower as a percentage of salary in Scotland than in
other countries, with the cost of both company and statutory costs adding
around 25 per cent (only 7.1 per cent of this being due to statutory
requirements) to basic salary. This compares to over 40 per cent in some
other countries.'
The promotional effort also proclaims the fact that Scotland 'has one of the
most progressive and flexible employment regimes in Europe'.
The document points out: 'Part-time and shift working is common and there
are no restrictions on the use of temporary labour. These conditions are
considerably different from the more regulated environments in many other EC
countries.'
Promotional material for inward investors into Wales is similar in tone.
'Wales has benefited from a combination of lower relative wage costs and
improved productivity during the 1980s,' says the Welsh Development Agency.
It asserts that unit labour costs are nearly 10 per cent lower than the UK
average, 'making Wales by far the most cost-competitive region in the UK.'
On a different tack, the Northern Development Company emphasises the
positive role of trade unions to companies in the region as 'social
partners'.
A recent study of 80 new inward investors into the region pointed to the
'progressive' character of organised labour in pursuing a 'philosophy
appropriate to company needs' while 79 per cent of foreign companies
surveyed in 1992 said industrial relations in their northern plants were
'comparable to or much better than their plants elsewhere'.
In fact, low labour costs are by no means a positive factor for many inward
investors. As the Commons committee pointed out, these only give Britain 'an
important short-term competitive advantage, the breathing space to increase
the UK's competitiveness in other areas'.
It added: 'The efficient use of labour and the raising of its value through
better education and training ultimately matter far more than low labour
costs.'
Indeed, lower productivity in the UK means unit labour costs remain higher
than in France, Germany and Japan.
This suggests Britain's competitive advantage stems from its low wage,
labour intensive, low skill base. Moreover, the employment element in total
industrial costs is quite small, commonly 25 per cent in manufacturing.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (3): Population grows grey /
A look at how Britain compares with the rest of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
The UK population is growing. And, like that of much of western Europe, it
is also greying.
But while the increase in the pensioner population may cause problems in the
middle of the 21st century, there is some good news in the shorter term.
The number of people of working age (defined as men aged 16-64, and women
aged 16-59) is still increasing, according to the Office of Population
Censuses and Surveys. From around 35.5m in 1992, the working population is
expected to increase to around 37.4m by 2011, while the overall UK
population grows from just under 58m to 61.25m over the same period.
The birth rate in the UK has edged up in recent years after the lows of the
late 1970s and early 1980s; live births per 1,000 people were 13.5 in 1992,
compared with an average of 12.9 in 1981-85.
Nevertheless, the fertility rate is still below the replacement level of
2.1. Children were 25 per cent of the population in 1971, but are expected
to be only 18 per cent in 2031.
It is only a low death rate, as life expectancy marches ever upwards, that
keeps the population growing. (Immigration plays a small part. The UK had a
net inflow of 34,000 people in 1992.) The average male born in 1990 had a
life expectancy of 73 years, compared with 67.9 years in 1961; female life
expectancy grew from 73.8 to 78.5 years over the same period.
The UK's population profile is not too bad in European terms. In terms of
maintaining a future workforce, the key is the number of those aged 0-19 as
a proportion of those people of working age. Here the champion is Ireland,
which has more than one child for every person of working age, while the UK
ranks seventh out of 17 countries surveyed by the OPCS in 1990-91.
Bottom of the league is Germany, which has only one child for every three
people of working age.
The number of 16-year-olds joining the UK workforce has been steadily
declining from a peak of 936,000 in 1981 and may have reached a trough of
628,000 in 1993. It is now expected to rise gently during the rest of the
century.
The UK does not rank quite so well on the greying factor. There were 39
people aged over 60 for every 100 of working age in 1990-91, the third
highest total of the European nations studied. (Sweden was the greyest with
43 people over 60 for every 100 of working age.)
According to the OPCS, there were 8.93m people of pensionable age in England
and Wales in 1981, 18 per cent of the total; by 1991, there were 9.45m, 18.5
per cent of the total. And within the ranks of the pensioners, the number of
people aged over 75 increased from 2.93m (5.9 per cent of the total
population) in 1981 to 3.62m (7.1 per cent) in 1991.
The growing numbers of the elderly will undoubtedly create social costs
(particularly in terms of health and pensions provision) which will probably
be reflected in higher taxes for the working population.
However, greying is a European-wide problem. About a fifth of the European
Union's 320m citizens are aged over 60 (with 20m aged over 74). By 2010, the
proportion of over-60s is projected to grow to 23 per cent and to 25 per
cent by 2040. The only countries expected to have a pensioner population of
less than 20 per cent in 2010 are Portugal and Ireland.
Steps may be taken to alleviate potential problems by increasing the
pensionable age. In the UK, the plan is for the retirement age for women to
be increased to 65, to match that of men. This change will be phased in
between the years 2010 and 2020.
The effect, according to the OPCS, is that the number of pensioners in the
UK will peak at 15.2m in 2038, compared with a total of 16.8m had the change
not occurred.
Within England, population rose in every region bar two between 1981 and
1991. The exceptions were the north and the north-west, which experienced a
fall of 0.1 per cent per year. East Anglia and the south-west saw the
fastest growth rates, at 0.9 and 0.7 per cent a year respectively.
In 1992, the English region with the highest proportion of people of working
age was the south-east with 61.2 per cent (64.1 per cent in greater London
itself). The region with the lowest proportion was the south-west, with 59.2
per cent.
In terms of the future, the region with the highest proportion of those
under 16 is the north-west, with 21.2 per cent, while the south-west is the
lowest with 19.2 per cent.
Looking at the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has a higher proportion of
children than any English region, at 25.7 per cent, while Scotland beats all
the English regions in terms of the proportion of people of working age, at
62 per cent.
OPCS projections show that, in 2011, the south-east region will still have
the lowest proportion of pensioners and the highest proportion of those of
working age in England; the south-west will still be at the opposite end of
the scale on both counts. The south-east will also have moved to top the
scale in terms of the proportion of children.
However, a study of migration flows shows that people have been leaving the
south-east for the rest of England. In the five years between 1988 and 1992,
the south-east experienced a net migration outflow to the rest of the UK of
206,000. In fact, all of that and more was a loss from greater London, which
had an outflow of 250,000.
The region which saw the biggest inflow was the south-west, which gained
119,000. The east midlands and East Anglia both gained, while the west
midlands and the north-west were net losers.
Within the UK as a whole, there has been a small migration from England to
the other three countries. And there has been a steady shift away from
cities towards more rural areas. Perhaps as the elderly retreat from the
towns to retire to 'rural bliss', this trend will continue.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (1): A new catalyst for
change - Activity has started to pick up, but the motive now is usually
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Relocation activity within the UK has started to pick up, after several
quiet years. But the moves now being made by companies are different in
character from those which took place at the turn of the decade, when
relocation activity reached an earlier peak.
'The theme has been retrenchment, rather than expansion,' says Mr David
Rees, a relocation specialist at accountants Ernst &amp; Young.
Companies are no longer being driven out of their existing locations by high
property costs and labour shortages, as they were in the late 1980s. Rather,
the catalyst for many corporate relocations is the need to reorganise and
rationalise businesses.
Restructuring is also important in determining where multinationals decide
to locate. The creation of a single European market has allowed companies to
seek economies of scale and rationalise the structure of businesses that
were originally designed for more fragmented markets.
Instead of placing a national headquarters in each large European country,
multinationals are establishing one European headquarters. Likewise,
companies are tending to consolidate their European manufacturing operations
into their most efficient or low-cost plants.
Examples of this trend includes the decision by Gillette of the US to cut
excess European capacity by closing a razor-blade factory near Seville and
transferring production to plants in west London and Berlin. In another
example, CPC (UK), a subsidiary of the US food group, is moving production
of its Knorr brand of soups and cubes from near Glasgow to more modern
plants in France and Italy.
These upheavals within European industry have led to some acrimony between
countries competing to retain and attract investment. Last year's decision
by Hoover of the US to stop making vacuum cleaners at Dijon in France and
move its operations to Scotland provoked charges that the UK was indulging
in 'social dumping' using lower wages and less favourable working conditions
to lure the company away from France.
In recent years, the UK has attracted a disproportionate share of the EC's
inward investment. In the last decade, the UK is calculated to have taken
nearly 40 per cent of all non-EC investment made in Europe. After Belgium,
the UK is home to a larger number of European headquarters of US companies
than any other European country, according to Ernst &amp; Young.
Direct investment in the UK in 1992 amounted to Pounds 9.2bn, a Pounds 800m
increase on the previous year. But inward investment is running at markedly
reduced levels compared with 1989 and 1990. The UK will have to fight
increasingly hard if it is to increase or even maintain its share of inward
investment coming into Europe.
Advantages of investing in the UK include a relatively cheap and flexible
workforce, factors that are reinforced by the UK's opt-out from the EU's
'social chapter'. Cultural and language considerations also play a part in
securing investment from the US and Japan.
But Britain cannot afford to be complacent. According to Ernst &amp; Young's Mr
Rees, potential relocators are often unimpressed by the UK's transport
infrastructure and the skills of its workforce. Moreover, the perception
that the UK is not 'at the heart of Europe' worries some potential
investors.
Competition from rival centres is becoming more intense. 'The UK is facing
greater competition both within Europe and globally,' says Mr Elias van
Herwaarden of Plant Location International, a subsidiary of Price
Waterhouse. US investors' attention is shifting to south-east Asia, he says.
At the same time, Ireland, Northern France, and parts of Belgium, the
Netherlands and the former eastern Germany are all fighting harder to win
mobile companies.
Even if the UK continues to attract a large number of projects coming into
the EU, the scale of investment may be diminishing. Mr van Herwaarden notes
that there is an increasing trend for US companies to embark on smaller
projects, valued at less than Dollars 5m. 'Companies are moving step by
step. There is an increased emphasis on flexibility with respect to adapting
to changing market needs and circumstances,' he says.
Similarly, if there is a second wave of investment from Japan, it is likely
to stem from supplier and sub-contractor activities rather than large-scale
projects. The number of large Japanese deals has diminished, partly because
so much investment was brought forward before the creation of the single
European market as a result of fears of a potential 'Fortress Europe'.
Competition for investment has also increased within the UK. Last year's
redrawing of the assisted areas map, when the government decided for the
first time to give help to parts of London and the south and east coast has
increased the pressure on long-standing assisted areas such as the
north-east.
Another reason why it is harder for outlying parts of the country to attract
investment is that some key factors driving companies out of London and the
south-east, such as labour shortages and high property costs, have
diminished in importance.
The gap between the cost of renting property in different parts of the
country has narrowed. Whereas rents in the City of London have halved since
1990, those in, say, Manchester have hardly fallen. The 1995 rating
revaluation, which will shift the rates burden from the south to the north,
will further erode potential cost savings for companies moving out of
London.
As a result, the incentive for companies to make long- distance moves has
diminished. Changes to the tax treatment of relocation expenses have also
tended to discourage such moves.
The cost of relocating increased substantially last year when the government
introduced a Pounds 8,000 ceiling on taxable allowances on relocation
expenses. The impact, however, was substantially lessened this April when
the Inland Revenue decided that tax would not be charged when an employer
buys an employee's existing home.
The prospect of cutting property costs is the single most important reason
for relocations, according to a survey by Jones Lang Wootton of large
companies that have moved out of London over the last decade.
But increasingly, operational considerations, such as the desire to
consolidate businesses, are becoming more important. The JLW survey found
that operational considerations accounted for half of the large corporate
moves out of London last year, compared with a third of moves between 1983
and 1992.
Large-scale corporate restructuring and rationalisation promise to be
increasingly important catalysts for relocations over the next few years.
British Telecommunications, for example, is considering moving up to 10,000
jobs out of 76 London offices over the next three to five years to locations
in and around the M25. As well as cutting property costs, the proposals
would allow BT to reduce its employees' commuting times and to pioneer new
forms of working based on advanced telecommunications.
Overall, the pace of UK relocation appears to be picking up. Last year, just
eight companies moved more than 100 jobs out of central London. But this
year, twice as many such moves are expected. A further 11 moves have already
been planned for 1995 and 1996.
As the worldwide recession lifts, the number of multinational and domestic
companies planning relocations is likely to increase. But competition from
other European centres and the diminished attractions of moving long
distances within the UK will add to the pressures as the regions try to
attract new investment.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (2): Pitfalls for foreign
investors - Ian Hamilton Fazey on problems, and the agencies that solve them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some parts of the British government have made it as easy as they can for
foreign companies to move into the UK - even to the extent of being ready to
argue with those parts of the government which sometimes make it difficult.
The clash is of cultures: the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Department of Employment want inward investment to improve the overseas
trade balance, to create jobs and broaden Britain's economic and,
particularly, manufacturing base. The Home Office, on the other hand, is
rightly charged with enforcing tight immigration controls to prevent
foreigners from taking jobs that could be done by European nationals.
Difficulties can therefore arise when an inward investor from, say, the US
or south-east Asia wants to bring in more key workers than immigration
officials think may be strictly necessary. About 18 months ago, growing
tensions forced all parties to agree procedures to try to smooth problems.
The rules, however, are unpublished because each case is judged on its
merits. However, they are pragmatic and decisions are at least now made
quickly, where previously people and companies were sometimes kept waiting
for months, much to the frustration of inward investment agencies and
promoters.
Basically, criteria for the start-up phase of an inward investment - when a
high proportion of the workforce may need to be brought in from abroad to
get the operation going and train their locally-recruited successors - are
relaxed. Short-term training or liaison posts also get sympathetic
treatment, even if there is long-term rotation of foreign personnel in them.
However, the proportion of jobs to be held eventually by foreign nationals
on a permanent basis is likely to involve more negotiation, just as it would
be, say, for European companies operating in the US.
The rest of the process of inward investment is straightforward - and
designed to make it as easy as possible for medium-sized or smaller
companies which do not have the in-house expertise, or ready access to
consultancy services, of bigger companies.
The Foreign Office and Department of Trade and Industry operate a global
network of commercial staff attached to British embassies or, in the US or
Japan, in specially set-up trade advice offices.
Some bodies, such as the Welsh Development Agency or some of the English
regional development bodies, also have promotional offices of their own in
prime target markets such as North America and south-east Asia.
In addition, they - and the economic development units of individual
counties, cities and towns - often take stands at big fairs and exhibitions.
However, any company wanting to know where to begin a systematic review of
UK inward investment options is best advised to start with the commercial
section of the British embassy, especially if language is a problem. This
will usually trigger a follow-up visit by a UK consular officer familiar
with the processes and options.
He or she will prepare a brief for the Invest in Britain Bureau, part of the
Department of Trade and Industry. From there, the inquiry will be fed into
the UK's internal network of regional agencies, development corporations and
local authority economic development officers.
Britain has attracted a lot of inward investment in the last 10 years and
those involved have become good at providing the right sort of advice. They
are also salespeople, so all claims should be treated with due caution. But
because there is also competition between the agencies, astute inward
investors can exploit this to their advantage.
Regional agencies, such as Inward, the Northern Development Company in
north-east England and Cumbria, and the Yorkshire and Humberside Development
Association will gracefully give best to each other in the end, but only
after fighting fiercely to win an inward investment project for their own
region.
Each English region has such an agency, partly funded by the Invest in
Britain Bureau and partly by local authorities and private sector
supporters. This spread of support means there will also often be
competition within a region, with local authorities or training and
enterprise councils throwing in discretionary grants, rental holidays or
help with training.
In some areas with declining industries such as coal or steelmaking, or with
endemic problems of economic structure, such as Merseyside, there is
government or EU assistance. Grants will vary according to the numbers of
jobs created, but the inward investor can again exploit competition between
areas in Britain, and, indeed, elsewhere in the EU.
In the UK, every area outside the south-east can rightly offer good quality
of life, access to good infrastructure, and - in most cases - a pool of
adaptable labour. All have glossy brochures to sell their wares, some of
them more objective than others, but all of them reasonably fair in what
they claim.
The warmth of welcome may also make a difference. Three years ago, Crewe
Business Park won Sokkia International - a surveying instrument business -
because the mayor entertained the Japanese company's executives handsomely,
while a rival local authority in Greater Manchester offered a barely
hospitable reception.
Agencies such as Inward, the NDC or YHDA will arrange a programme of visits
to view sites and meet key people. They will also provide critical data,
such as the availability of suitable or adaptable labour, or the ease of
access to a network of component suppliers, or transport links with the rest
of the UK or with the European mainland.
Inward, in north-west England, was the most successful of the regional
agencies in 1993-94, setting a record for the fourth successive year,
despite a drop in general levels of inquiries worldwide because of
recession.
Nearly 3,000 jobs were created by 36 inward investment projects that brought
in Pounds 107m of new capital. This included the MBNA America Bank, which
opted for Chester rather than Harrogate in North Yorkshire. This credit card
marketing operation will eventually create 800 jobs over five years.
A third of the projects were expansions by some of 1,200 foreign companies
already in the region. All the regional agencies operate 'aftercare'
services for inward investors, which are an increasingly important component
of inward investment.
There is also an array of private sector help available at normal
professional prices. These are usually cheaper - though just as good - in
regional financial centres such as Birmingham, Manchester or Leeds because
of lower overheads outside London.
Since property and tax advice - both individual and corporate - are
principal areas where professional help is imperative, many firms of estate
agents and lawyers have full-time specialists in the field.
Small or medium-sized companies may often do better with a comparably-sized
professional firm, rather than the more obvious giants. Campbell Hooper, a
London firm with only 70 staff, has published many articles and booklets on
the subject - the sort of clue to look for. Phoning a few firms in the
nearest financial centre and asking for their promotional literature is a
good start to finding suitable advisers.
Many inward investors also have their own networks and associations of
expatriates. They are also a source for recommending experienced
professionals and explaining the pitfalls of relocating to the UK.
Relocation has been done hundreds of times already in the last decade alone:
it makes sense to learn from others' experiences.

FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares hold steady in nervous trading
session - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A calmer mood prevailed in the UK stock market yesterday as investors came
to terms with the blood-letting of the previous session. Confidence was
challenged again on three occasions when the FT-SE futures contract bounced
on the 3,000 support level, but the stock market closed little changed after
moving narrowly during the session.
At the final reading of 3,019.7, the FT-SE Index showed a fall of only 1
point on the day. The FT-SE Mid 250, on the other hand, fell 13 points to
3,616.4 as the broader market waited for a more convincing lead from the
blue chips.
London opened firmly as a few bargain hunters were encouraged by improvement
in the German bund. For a while, the UK stock market stood up against
further falls in British government bonds, but it proved unable to do so
when the stock index futures turned down.
A gain of 10.5 on the Footsie turned to a fall of 16 within the first hour
of trading, but 3,004.7 proved to be the day's low. For the rest of the
session, the stock market followed the futures market, trying unsuccessfully
to move ahead and dipping very briefly into negative territory again in
mid-afternoon.
The general picture was one of nervousness, and reports of some buying at
lower levels by the big investment institution were not borne out by the
trading volume statistics. However, some analysts believe that UK stocks are
undervalued at current levels.
Seaq-reported business of 613.5m shares compared with 646.1m on the previous
session. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail business on
Wednesday, when the Footsie dropped by 2.2 per cent, was worth Pounds
1.49bn, which was by no means a high volume figure.
At least two trading programmes were identified, only one of which was of
significant size. But for the most part, the London stock market continued
to watch the European markets, which benefited from good inflation figures
in Germany.
Towards the close, shares brightened when Wall Street opened higher but the
pace flagged as the Dow turned less decisive to show a minor fall as London
closed down for the day.
Traders commented that the market was beginning to slow down ahead of the
holiday closure on Monday of markets in London and New York. Today brings
further tests for the markets in the form of important reports on economic
progress on both sides of the Atlantic.
The Confederation of British Industries presents its monthly report on
business trends in the domestic economy. Investors will look carefully for
signs that export volumes are recovering with the improvement in economic
activity in Europe.
In the US, investors will today scan the gdp figures for the first quarter,
and in particular the deflator figure which will give the Federal Reserve
its latest guide to inflation pressure in the US economy.
Traders warned that the equity market remains at the mercy of the bond
markets which, in turn, are dependent upon trends in German and US fixed
interest stocks. With German interest rates now evidently on hold for the
time being, the focus is expected to be on the US markets. An unimpressive
performance by the US dollar since last week's decisive hike in key rates
has left markets fearing that the Fed may feel obliged to act again soon.

FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Derivative dealers reported a volatile session in stock index futures which
saw the June contract recover from the previous day's slide to close above
3,000, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,022 was better than
anticipated by dealers. However, strong selling, attributed to Goldman Sachs
was said to have been the cause of the early retreat in the contract.
Thereafter, June followed the erratic mood in the bond markets, though
occasionally went its own way on dealing by independent traders. At the
day's low, June fell to 2,990 before bouncing to return above the 3,000
level, a move repeated several times. The contract led the cash market for
most of the day.
The firm opening on Wall Street helped steady June and it closed at 3,008,
up 9 on its previous close but at a 13 point discount to cash. Volume was
again good, reaching 15,702 contracts by the close. In the June Mid 250 on
the FT-SE, 165 lots were dealt as the contract closed at 3,597.
In traded options, Volume fell back from Wednesday's high levels and closed
at 31,160 contracts. Of that total, 18378 was traded in the FT-SE 100 option
and 1,925 in the Euro FT-SE.
Prudential Corporation was the most active stock option with a total of
1,064 contracts.

Preliminary profits at the very top end of market estimates saw Cable &amp;
Wireless shares outperform the rest of the market and the telecoms sector to
close a net 2 higher at 450p. Earlier the shares had risen to 457p. Profits
up 18 per cent at Pounds 1.09bn, against Pounds 918m, compared with a
consensus forecast of around Pounds 1.05bn.
'These were good profits numbers,' said one analyst, 'but there was some
disappointment in the market with the dividend.' The dividend total was
increased by 11 per cent to 8.25p; best estimates in the market ranged up to
15 per cent.
Turnover in C &amp; W came out at a healthy 9.2m shares, the highest single
day's business in the stock since March.
The announcement by Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel of its
well-signposted rights issue left the shares trailing 7 at 348p. However,
doubts about the financial position of the group remain and one analyst
pointed out that the rights issue and the the new financing from the group's
creditor banks was still short of the Pounds 1.6bn Eurotunnel had said it
needed.
The electricity companies raced ahead in the wake of recent strong buy notes
from leading brokers, notably Kleinwort Benson. The broker said the recs
offer outstanding value, with huge potential upside from the National Grid,
plus the potential for share buy backs and takeover moves after the expiry
of the golden shares in March 1995.
London Electricity jumped 18 to 573p, and Manweb and Midland 10 apiece to to
706p and 614p.
Enterprise Oil shares suffered badly from the latest shots fired by Lasmo as
part of its defence against the all-paper takeover bid. Sniping about
Enterprise's accounting policies unsettled Enterprise shares which dived 9
to 401p. They have retreated from 451p since Enterprise announced it was
considering making a takeover bid.
Burmah Castrol dipped 9 to 862p as one of the market's optimistic broking
houses was said to have trimmed its numbers for the company following the
presentations to analysts on Wednesday afternoon. 'The presentation was
splendid but obviously someone had overdone their estimates,' said one oil
sector specialist.
Shell slipped 1 1/2 to 710 1/2 p with analysts speculating that much of the
big fall the previous day had anticipated news that the European Commission
had been advised to oppose the chemicals joint-venture with Italy's
Montedison.
The disposal of 450 pubs by Scottish and Newcastle helped the brewer to gain
2 to 519p. The sale was made to a private consortium to satisfy the
company's obligations under the government's industry regulations following
the purchase of 1,600 Chef &amp; Brewer pubs last September.
Disappointing interim results and a discouraging statement hit shares of J
Smart, the Edinburgh-based building contractor and housebuilder, which fell
28 to 195p.
Sharpe &amp; Fisher, the builders merchants jumped 7 to 163p after the chairman
said at the company's annual meeting that profits in the first four months
of the year are 'substantially ahead of 1993.'
A positive agm statement from Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the northern
supermarket group, helped the shares edge forward 2 to 130p.
Solid results from Storehouse were not enough to prevent the shares slipping
back 3 to 212p, although volume was only a moderate 2.1m. Profits were in
line with market expectations, and the increased dividend pleased some
sceptics. However, some concerns were being expressed among stores
specialists about continued margin pressure.
Good results from MacDonald Martin Distillers was further confirmation for
many observers that the upswing in the whisky industry is now well under
way. The shares gained 35 to 480p, and also enlivened Allied Lyons, up 5 at
580p, and Guinness, ahead at 6 at 482p.
Smith New Court was said to be pushing Granada, up 7 at 497p.
Composite insurances held up well with General Accident rallying from an
early 535p to close unchanged on balance at 540p in the wake of a strong buy
recommendation from Hoare Govett. The broker said General Accident 'is at
least 10 per cent undervalued.'
A James Capel recommendation lifted Chubb Securities 8 to 368p.
APV eased 4 1/2 to 119 1/2 with Cazenove, the company's broker, said to be
negative on the stock.
Motor distributor Jessups jumped 28 to 126p, after an agreed offer from BSG
which eased 5 1/2 to 69p.

FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar hit
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover in conglomerate Trafalgar House rose to 17.9m, making it the day's
most heavily traded stock, and the shares fell 9 to 86p, after analysts
rushed to downgrade full year profit expectations following the group's
interim figures.
Profits of Pounds 13.4m fell below market expectations and the group also
cut the dividend.
The list of brokers downgrading included BZW which reduced its full year
forecast by Pounds 31m to Pounds 54m. Mr Mark Cusack at the securities house
said: 'Investors that gave the company the benefit of the doubt have been
badly let down. The potential is still there but recovery now looks another
year out.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy fall for Shoprite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock profits warning from Shoprite sent the shares crashing to end a
tortuous session 54 down at 90p with turnover a hefty 2.5m. Dealers said
they expected more pressure to come as investors, many of who came in at
much lower levels, decide to take profits in one of the sector's best
performing stocks.
Analysts pointed out that the Shoprite tumble followed recent
disappointments from other discounters such as Argyll's Lo-Cost arm, Nurdin
&amp; Peacock and Kwik Save, and reinforced the market view that the discount
end of the market was under severe pressure. Nurdin's was steady at 199p,
while Kwik Save slipped a penny to 540p.
Shoprite shares have climbed steeply since early 1991, when they stood at
20p, as the discount food retailer embarked on a big expansion strategy
centred on southern Scotland. They hit 241p at the beginning of February
since when they have retreated steadily, being particularly weak in recent
sessions.
Yesterday, the company was blaming stiff competition for the downturn in
profits, with brokers halving their forecasts to around the Pounds 4.5m for
the current year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow nudged lower by Philip
Morris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were mixed yesterday but a big loss by Philip Morris nudged the
bellwether blue chip index into negative territory, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.84 lower at 3,753.46, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a scant 0.72 better at 457.06.
Advancing issues led declines by 1,170 to 891 on moderate volume of 255m
shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite added 0.37 to 439.62,
while the Nasdaq composite eased 0.43 to 731.64.
Activity was listless as investors began to square their positions ahead of
the three-day Memorial Day weekend.
The market had only a shred of economic news to guide sentiment. The Labor
Department said that initial claims for state unemployment benefit had
receded by 1,000 last week, against an expected decline of 7,000. The
figures, combined with an upward revision of the total number receiving
jobless benefit, suggested that the labour market was weakening a bit. But
the data was not viewed as compelling evidence of an economic slowdown.
The bond market, meanwhile, offered neither an obstacle nor a source of
encouragement for stocks. Treasury prices were little changed. A flurry of
buying that followed the release of the jobless numbers soon gave way to
profit-taking on the heels of the previous session's late rally.
Among the Dow components, Philip Morris stood as the only impediment to
further improvement by the index, which had followed bonds to a modest gain
during the previous session. On Wednesday, trading in Philip Morris was
halted for the entire session, an unusual move which coincided with a
day-long meeting of the company's board.
During the conference, the directors had considered a proposal to split the
company's tobacco and food businesses into separate entities. After the
markets closed, Philip Morris announced that it had rejected such a move
'for the foreseeable future'.
When the stock resumed trading after a brief delay yesterday morning, it was
quickly marked down Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 amid disappointment over
the board's decision. Breaking the company up has been suggested as a way to
limit the financial impact of future tobacco-related lawsuits.
The stock's downturn partially offset a big gain by Boeing. The aerospace
group's share price jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 46 7/8 on news that it
was nearing completion of a Dollars 5bn deal to deliver more than 50
commercial aircraft to China.
Upjohn climbed steadily during the afternoon amid speculation that the
company would become a takeover target. The stock closed Dollars 3 3/4
higher at Dollars 32 7/8 .
Deere shed Dollars 2 1/4 in heavy trading even though AG Edwards issued a
'buy' recommendation on the issue.
After Wednesday's burst of activity, technology stocks were relatively
quiet. Computer Associates International, however, surged Dollars 6 1/8 to
Dollars 43 1/4 in volume of nearly 4m shares. The software company beat
analysts' forecasts by posting fourth-quarter net income of 93 cents a
share.
Elsewhere, Compaq gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 117 5/8 after a Dollars
3 gain the previous session.
On the Nasdaq, Lotus Development dropped a further Dollars 2 to Dollars 61,
after reaffirming its initial second-quarter earnings estimates of between
42 and 50 cents a share.
Canada
Toronto ended mixed in moderate trade, the TSE 300 Composite index rising
39.34, or 0.92per cent, to 4330.71 in volume of 59.3m shares.
Twelve of the 14 stock groups increased, with transportation stocks
recording the day's biggest rise of 5.55 per cent. Mining and industrial
products were up 1.42 per cent and 1.39 per cent respectively. Consumer
products added 1.24 per cent. Golds were moderately lower.
Toronto-Dominion Bank gained CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 22 1/8 after
reporting much higher second-quarter earnings.
Mexico
Equities closed lower for the first time in seven sessions because of profit
taking and Wall Street's slight decline.
The IPC index closed off 16.71 points at 2,455.45, a loss of 0.68 per cent.
Volume totalled a moderate 1.2bn new pesos on 109.1m shares traded.
Brazil
Sao Paulo fluctuated widely but ended the day almost flat on profit-taking.
The Bovespa index rose 404 points, or 1.8 per cent but only 0.5 per cent in
real terms.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bearish talk persists as
bourses recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley considered European bond and equity markets yesterday and
said that they had further room to fall, writes Our Markets Staff.
Inflationary pressures, the slowdown in German rate cuts and the fact that
investors were still long in Europe after last year's bull market should
keep bonds weak, said Mr Richard Davidson and Mr Brian V. Mullaney.
Equities, they said, still looked expensive at over twice book value and 7.4
times cash flow: 'There may be some earnings momentum, but at these levels
there is little earnings support'.
FRANKFURT applied one extension of these arguments - a switch out of
cyclicals - to its carmakers, which underperformed as the Dax index
incorporated Wednesday's post bourse falls, and slid a fraction further to
close 28.52 lower at 2,130.25. Turnover rose from DM8.2bn to DM8.5bn.
BMW dropped DM26 to DM856, Daimler DM19.50 to DM814.50 and Volkswagen
DM11.50 to DM491.50. At UBS, Mr Stephen Reitman said that, across Europe,
carmakers had been coming back from their highs in reflection of events on
the other side of the Atlantic, where interest rate fears had been reversing
the substantial rise in US auto stocks.
Germany had seen poor registration figures in April, he added, with a fall
of 15 per cent leaving the year so far down 2.2 per cent after a rise of 2.9
per cent in the first quarter; and UBS expected a fall for the year as a
whole.
PARIS majored on banks as the CAC-40 index recovered 7.48 to 2,091.89.
Credit Lyonnais certificates rose FFr32 to FFr582, the outperformance of the
day, while CCF put on FFr4.90 at FFr237.40.
Merrill Lynch said earlier this week that the savage correction in bank
stock prices throughout Europe had opened up a number of value situations;
that recovery plays should return to the fore within the sector, after
quality banks had made the running for six months; and encapsulated Credit
Lyonnais: 'a stock for which fundamental arguments are few, but the chart
suggests a good bounce.'
Eurotunnel shook after its rights issue terms, hitting a low of FFr27.50,
but recovered to end 45 centimes higher on the day at FFr30.95.
MADRID's technical recovery took the general index up 2.07 to 332.52 with
banks leading the way, but there was still more interest in smaller
capitalisation stocks.
The overnight news that Soto Grande's Valderrama golf course had won the
staging of the 1997 Ryder Cup took the shares up another Pta15 to Pta517
after a short-lived, but anticipatory high of Pta536 on Wednesday.
At James Capel, Mr Chris Cooper noted that Soto had outperformed by 75 per
cent this year. The brokers think that the de Benedetti holding company,
Cofir, which owns 42 per cent of Soto, has the greater scope for
outperformance in the next twelve months after nearly three years of
underperformance in 1991-93.
AMSTERDAM recovered from early weakness on news that March industrial
production, up 2.2 per cent on the month, was 2 per cent better than a year
earlier. The AEX index rose 1.24 to 404.74.
Nedlloyd, the shipping and road transport group lost Fl 4.30 or 5.6 per cent
to Fl 72.00 in response to lower than expected first quarter results.
KLM, strong in recent days, rose another 50 cents to Fl 51.80 ahead of next
week's earnings report.
Shares in chemical companies, staging a technical recovery after last week's
weakness, saw DSM add Fl 3.20 to Fl 134.00. Akzo put on Fl 1.80 to Fl 209.80
after it announced that it was to merge its European soda ash operations
with those of France's Rhone-Poulenc.
ZURICH finished higher after interest rate worries had inhibited trading
early in the day before subsequent bargain-hunting helped to reverse the
downward trend. The SMI index rose 16.1 to 2,689.2.
Roche certificates rebounded SFr85 to SFr6,545 on the view that recent falls
had been overdone.
Ascom, the troubled telecommunications group, added SFr55 to SFr1,490 after
it announced that it had avoided an operating loss in the first quarter and
that it continued to expect to break even in 1994 and return to profit in
1995.
The financial sector was subdued by the interest rate outlook. CS Holding
advanced SFr5 to SFr606 as it awaited a decision by the Austrian finance
ministry on its bid for a stake in Creditanstalt-Bankverein, following news
that an Austrian-led consortium had submitted an offer.
ATHENS rebounded, the general index closing 29.64, or 3.7 per cent higher at
836.31 after a drop of about 15 per cent in less than a fortnight during the
drachma crisis, and a fall below 800 yesterday in early trading. After hours
the bourse president, Mr Emmanuel Xanthakis, asked investors to stay cool:
'The decisive stand taken by the monetary authorities,' he said, 'will soon
ease tension and help interest rates return to reasonable levels.'
TEL AVIV recovered 3 per cent, the Mishtanim index closing 5.57 higher at
192.64, but sentiment was still shaky after a fall of some 18 per cent
between May 1 and Wednesday.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Montedison dives after veto threat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News that a key advisory committee had recommended the European Commission
to veto Montedison's planned joint chemicals venture with and Royal
Dutch/Shell left the Italian group's shares adrift in early Milan trading.
Montedison fell almost 9 per cent and was suspended automatically on the
telematic system at L1,230. The share subsequently picked up to finish L21
easier at L1,329 as diplomats noted that the companies could still avoid a
veto by adapting their plans. Montedison was confident that the plan could
be rescued.
The Comit index dropped 18.84, or 2.5 per cent, to 740.95, below the 750
support level, prompting expectations that it was heading for 720.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan commented that domestic investors,
unsettled by political developments, had become more selective after the
euphoria which followed the general election.
Fiat put in a firmer performances after recent falls amid continuing
speculation that the government was preparing measures to boost car sales.
The shares rose L82 to L6,701 as the company called for incentives along the
lines of those already available elsewhere in Europe.
Stet added L53 to L5,484 and Sip was L25 higher at L4,308.
BCI fell L236 or 4.4 per cent to L5,105 in response to its plans to raise
L2,300bn through a series of share issues. Credito Italiano lost L98 to
L2,313 as investors braced themselves for a similar exercise.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo turns easier after
seven days of rises

Profit-taking by domestic institutions and arbitrage selling brought an
extended upward run in Japanese equities to a close in spite of buying by
overseas investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average closed down for the first time in seven trading days,
declining 167.83 to 20,495.80. The index rose to a high of 20,689.64 in the
early afternoon, but fell to a low of 20,489.30 just before the close.
Arbitrage selling was prompted by a fall on the Chicago futures market on
Wednesday, and a decline in Osaka futures. Although the Nikkei temporarily
recouped its losses on overseas investors' purchases of large capital steels
and shipbuilders, large lot selling by financial institutions and corporate
investors finally depressed share prices.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.20 to 1,650.98 and the
Nikkei 300 declined 1.42 to 301.85. Losers led gainers by 609 to 368, with
193 unchanged. Volume fell to 400m shares from 459m, some investors
remaining inactive on the last trading day for May settlements.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.08 to 1,356.88.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y6,000 to Y861,000. Heavy
electricals and issues linked to the multi-media theme lost ground on profit
taking. Hitachi fell Y20 to Y1,010, NEC Y20 to Y1,170 and Fujitsu Y10 to
Y1,050.
Arbitrage selling depressed some bank shares. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell Y20
to Y1,980 and Sumitomo Bank by Y20 to Y2,200.
Drug shares were lower following the release of dull earning for the current
year to March, due to government price cuts and limits on doctors'
consultation fees. Takeda Chemical Industries, the industry leader, which
fell behind Sankyo in pre-tax profit for the past business year, fell Y60 to
Y1,210; Dainippon Pharmaceutical lost Y30 to Y1,180.
Large capital steels and shipbuilders were higher on active buying by
overseas investors. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of
the day, rose Y15 to Y738.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 56.56 to 22,667.48 in volume of 30.7m shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets put in a mixed performance as Morgan Grenfell Asia
Securities unveiled a new Pacific Rim investment strategy which overweights
Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia.
Mr Stuart Cook, chief executive, said the merchant bank was positive on Hong
Kong because of its exposure to Guangdong province which continued to enjoy
very strong economic growth.
Thailand, he said, was the second fastest growth economy in the world after
China and he was positive on Australia because its economy was recovering.
HONG KONG saw sharp early gains erased in late trade on news of lower than
expected of prices paid at a government land auction. The Hang Seng Index
was down 61.54 to 9,459.83, having been more than 100 points ahead earlier
in the afternoon.
Most leading property developers ended lower. Cheung Kong lost HKDollars 1
to HKDollars 37.50, Henderson Land fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 40.25
and New World dipped 40 cents to HKDollars 25.40.
SYDNEY was dragged lower by weakness in Europe and its own banking stocks
although firmer bonds helped the market up from its day's lows.
bourse rally after it tumbled in early trade.
The All Ordinaries index, 21.9 points lower early in the session, ended 9.0
easier at 2096.9.
In the banking sector, NAB closed 16 cents lower at ADollars 11.68 and the
Commonwealth slipped 6 cents to ADollars 8.20.
ANZ dropped another 14 cents to ADollars 4.30 following its 5 per cent fall
on Wednesday after results.
BANGKOK fluctuated throughout the day but ended higher on bargain-hunting,
particularly in the construction materials and banking sectors.
The SET index rose 7.22 to 1,356.02 in turnover of Bt10bn.
Siam Cement was the centre of attention after it reported 107 per cent
growth in consolidated net profit for the first quarter, adding Bt74 to
Bt1,054.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded after four straight days of losses to close broadly
higher but any further advance was expected to be limited by a lack of
foreign buying, brokers said.
The composite index closed up 9.79 at 997.05.
SINGAPORE was firmer although analysts commented that the market was in need
of fresh inspiration from overseas markets. The Straits Times Industrials
index closed 12.34 higher at 2,315.20 in volume of 96.71m shares.
MANILA rebounded after a weak start on foreign demand for some blue chips,
led by PLDT. The composite index jumped 37.86 to 2,917.07, after Wednesday's
24-point fall, in sharply higher volume of 2.7bn shares from Wednesday's
1.42bn. PLDT put on 25 pesos to 1,920 pesos.
SEOUL advanced amid renewed interest in primary blue chips and the composite
stock index added 6.84 to 950.76, above the widely-regarded resistance level
of 950.
Blue chips accounted for about one third of 119 stocks which went limit up.
Both Samsung Electronics and Posco, the steelmaker, went limit up, gaining
Won2,000 and Won2,500 to Won67,400 and Won92,000 respectively.
WELLINGTON was lower, reacting to volatility in overseas markets but finding
no local factors to spark interest. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 15.46 to
2,139.71.
Carter Holt Harvey, the forest products group, fell 7 cents to NZDollars
3.78 after the strong run-up to Wednesday's announcement of a 34 per cent
rise in net profit, which fell short of some expectations.
BOMBAY's mood improved slightly after an ITC associate company, ITC
Bhadrachalam announced plans for a bonus issue. The BSE 30-share index rose
33.67 to 3,738 as ITC improved Rs5 to Rs715.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar woes continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar was stable on foreign exchanges yesterday, but showed no signs of
rallying from recent lows, writes Philip Gawith.
Dealers said persistent bearish sentiment was depressing the dollar, while
preparations for the long weekend made investors wary of taking positions.
The Bank of Japan was seen supporting the US currency during Asian trading.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6438 from DM1.6447. Against the yen it
was slightly weaker at Y104.405 from Y104.455.
The Bank of England was reported to have intervened in the market to support
the Canadian dollar. The North American currency closed in London at
CDollars 1.3862 against the dollar from CDollars 1.3818 on Wednesday.
In Europe the drachma and the escudo remained under pressure. The Bundesbank
left official interest rates unchanged at its council meeting.
Sterling had a quiet day, with the sterling index closing at 79.9 from the
previous close of 80. The pound closed at DM2.4821 from DM2.4848, and was
barely changed at Dollars 1.51.
Looking at the dollar's lacklustre performance, Mr Mark Geddes, treasury
economist at Midland Global Markets, said neither growth nor interest rate
arguments seemed to offer much support to the currency.
'The only thing preventing the dollar from falling further is the threat of
central bank intervention,' said Mr Geddes.
He predicted, though, that central bank intervention would only be seen when
the market was considered to be short of dollars - not the situation at
present.
Mr Geddes argued that support for the dollar can only come from concrete
trade and market-access proposals from the Japanese government that are
acceptable to the US authorities. These would probably be timed to coincide
with the G7 summit in Naples in early July.
This assumes - a big if - that prime minister Mr Tsutomu Hata will have the
requisite authority to deliver substantive change.
Dealers said the Bank of Canada had been seen buying Canadian dollars
through the broker market. Last week the BOC was seen selling Canadian
dollars.
Some analysts attributed the currency's weakness to political uncertainty
ahead of elections in Quebec and overnight rumours that Canadian debt might
be downgraded.
Although the BOC is known for its active involvement in the market to smooth
the dollar, it was also suggested that being seen to sell its own currency
last week had backfired on the central bank.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, disputed this
assessment saying: 'By dealing on both sides of the movement, they have
shown themselves to be extremely professional.' He described the Bank's
intervention as 'well judged, well timed and well conceived.'
Mr Parsons predicted that the dollar would probably be volatile in the
run-up to the Quebec elections, expected in September. He noted that there
had been similar currency volatility ahead of the Meech Lake and
Charlottetown constitutional accords, in June 1990 and October 1992.
In Greece, the prime minister Mr Andreas Papandreou declared victory in the
government's defence of the currency. He said: 'The battle for the drachma
is continuing and is critical, but it has been won ..I think that
essentially the drachma issue is closed.'
He said the issue of high interest rates, necessary in recent weeks to
support the currency, would be over 'within a few days, or a week or two at
most.' Key interbank rates are in three digits, and banks have started to
raise rates to customers.
The prime minister's optimism was not shared in the markets where traders
reported seeing a lot of private individuals trying to get their money out
of Greece. Talk of a 15-20 per cent devaluation, in the air at the end of
last week, has resurfaced.
Dealers said the drachma's woes were spilling over into the escudo. The
Portuguese currency closed at Es104.1 against the D-Mark from Es103.5 on
Wednesday. In fact, the escudo had been under fire in March and early April,
before the drachma.
Some analysts said that the weakness of the escudo, drachma and Italian lira
 -which closed at L970.6 against the D-Mark from L969 - was the result of
investors fleeing the high-yielding Southern European countries for the
safety of the D-Mark.
The futures market had a calmer day after the recent bout of frenetic
trading. The December euromark contract traded 36,000 lots and closed at
94.79, two basis points up on Wednesday. The December eurosterling contract
traded nearly 18,000 lots to finish at 93.83 from 93.80.
In the German money markets, call money eased to 5.15/5.25 per cent from
5.25/5.35 per cent. The Bank of England, meanwhile, cleared a Pounds 800m
shortage in the UK money markets with relative ease. Overnight money traded
between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ narrows Anglo's lead in
mining league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa is still the world's most
important mining company but RTZ Corporation of the UK, in second place, is
closing the gap between them.
This becomes clear from the latest Who Owns Who in Mining, which also shows
that Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, and Freeport
McMoRan of the US are among the fastest-growing big mining companies.
The Raw Materials Group of Sweden, which compiled the data, admits that RTZ
can claim to be the world's largest mining company using many other
criteria.
However, RMG draws up its league table by reference to the value of
non-fuels minerals production controlled by each company. This method of
assessment naturally gives most weight to production of high-value metals
and minerals such as gold and diamonds. Not only is Anglo the world's
biggest gold producer, RMG also counts De Beers, one of the world's big
diamond producers, as an integral part of the Anglo group, not a separate
mining company, even though it is quote separately.
Similarly, RTZ's 49 per cent-owned associated in Australia, CRA, is
considered by RMG to be part of the UK group.
BHP, which in 1990 accounted for only 1.5 per cent of non-fuel minerals
production outside the former eastern bloc countries, now has 2.5 per cent,
mainly because of its huge step-up in copper production caused by its
partly-owned Escondida mine in Chile. Freeport has moved up from 17th in the
1991 league table to 7th because of progressively increased output from its
copper-gold mine in Indonesia.
Meanwhile, problems in the African copper belt, where there has been a lack
of capital for investment for many years, saw Zaire drop from 14th to 25th
position and its share of output from 1.1 to 0.7 per cent.
RMG points out that, in contrast, some of the world's most successful mining
companies are state-controlled. Who Owns Who in Mining 1994: Pounds 150 or
USDollars 310 and Roskill's Metal Databook 1994 Pounds 190 or Dollars 420

FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures sell-off
extended to Dollars 400 a tonne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The coffee market kept up its recent sell-off yesterday as prices for the
July futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange plunged by Dollars
175 to Dollars 2,032 a tonne.
Prices had recovered slightly from a Dollars 200 drop at one stage in the
day, but with hedge funds bailing out of the market, the price could fall
further. It has slipped by over Dollars 400 in the past two days.
The presence of large financial investors and speculators in the coffee
market has exaggerated the dramatic increase in prices over the past couple
of months and this could now work in reverse with prices slipping quickly.
However, the coffee market remains well above its February level of Dollars
1,200 a tonne and traders do not believe it will give up all of its gains as
supplies are still tight.
'It's a healthy correction to what had become an overheated market,' one
trader commented. Some analysts do not rule out a return to higher prices
once the market draws breath. Coffee stocks remain low, they point out.
Fresh coffee supplies are taking a long time to get on to the market with
roasters holding on to stocks and new coffee deliveries being held back in
anticipation of higher prices. Traders reported some disruption to the new
Indonesian crop reaching the market.
The cocoa market was affected by the fall-out from coffee and the July
futures price dropped by another Pounds 14 to 1,010 a tonne.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper saga ends as El
Abra bid is accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Long and painful negotiations for 51 per cent of Chile's El Abra copper
deposit came to a close yesterday when Codelco, the state copper company,
accepted a revised offer of Dollars 330m from Cyprus Minerals of the US.
Cyprus has also agreed to lend the joint venture, to be called Sociedad
Contractual Minera El Abra, Dollars 299m and to guarantee further bank
finance of Dollars 699m to develop the deposit and construct an
oxide-treatment plant.
The original Cyprus offer, in association with Canada's Lac Minerals, which
pulled out in April, had been for Dollars 404m plus up to Dollars 151m in
investment capital. The lower price - and Lac's withdrawal - came after
discovery that the copper grade was 13.4 per cent lower than originally
estimated.
El Abra, which is scheduled to start operating in mid-1997, is nevertheless
expected to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper cathodes a year.
The lower grade means production costs are expected to increase from 45
cents to 48 cents a pound and the life of the mine to be reduced from 19
years to 16.
Mr Villarzu, Codelco president, said a letter of intent, to be accompanied
by a guarantee for 10 per cent of the offer, would be signed soon. Final
contracts would be concluded by June 30.
Mr Villarzu admitted that Codelco should have obtained a letter of intent
when the first offer was made, and that it had prematurely given the
impression that the deal was watertight.
Nevertheless, he stressed that Codelco had earned the Chilean treasury
Dollars 330m plus a 49 per cent stake in profits. In return Codelco would
not need to invest 'a single peso', he said.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes propose two-tier pricing
system for EU milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy farmers in the European Union could produce some of their milk at
world prices and then sell it outside the EU as a way of beating
restrictions imposed by EU milk quotas, according to a suggestion by the
Danish Dairy Federation.
The federation made the proposal to the European Commission in February, but
is now working out details of the plan, which is yet to be debated by
agriculture ministers.
'We are still evaluating the pros and cons, but it would be a way of coping
with the Gatt deal,' said Mr Prebben Mikkelsen, head of the federation's
economics department.
The Danish proposals would operate a two-tier pricing system with farmers
producing the bulk of their milk under an 'A' quota for which they would
receive high EU prices. But 'B' quotas would also be available for farmers
who were able to produce a little extra milk at marginal cost for the export
market.
Producers would be paid for this 'B' milk at world prices, which are up to a
third lower than internal EU prices. The system would also be voluntary for
producers who wanted to add a few cows to supplement their income.
Mr Jens Jakob Jakobsen, a dairy farmer in northern Jutland with 112 cows
echoes the scepticism of other producers when he says he is not sure he
would produce more milk under such a system. 'We could take on more cows but
it depends on the price: I wouldn't do it at prices less than a third of
what we get now,' he says.
Many farmers are also concerned that the system would be difficult to police
and would lead to erosion of prices for the rest of their output.
Denmark needs to secure its export markets as it produces three times more
milk than it consumes. British farmers are sceptical that such a scheme
would benefit them when quotas restrict output to only 85 per cent of the
UK's needs.
Overall, farmers in the EU currently produce 4bn litres or 4 per cent more
milk than is consumed. Some of this finds its way into the manufacture of
dairy products and the EU's intervention system: the controversial butter
mountains.
In addition, the EU pays a subsidy for dairy products to be exported outside
the union. These subsidies must be cut under the terms of the Gatt
settlement, making it hard for European exporters to retain overseas
markets.
Mr Finn Christiansen, executive director of MD Foods, the large Danish dairy
co-operative, says the two-tier system would be one way round the problem of
losing part of the world market.
The EU has to cut subsidised cheese exports from a reference tonnage of
407,000 tonnes to 305,000 tonnes by 2000. But Mr Christiansen says the
problem is more serious and will hit cheese hardest as EU exports to third
countries reached 480,000 tonnes last year so the cuts will be greater.
In addition, the EU must open up its market to provide access for other
dairy exporting nations, meaning it must absorb another 105,000 tonnes of
cheese.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's main market indicator increased again this week, rising just 3
cents to 617 cents a kg. a new record for the season. The small advance
covered sharp rises affecting finer merinos, up by 20 to 40 cents, and a
wide range of small changes, including reductions for one or two crossbred
categories. An erratic market impression is not unprecedented in the final
weeks of selling season, which concludes in Australia at the end of June.
Helping to confirm overall wool market confidence is the progress made in
disposing of Australia's large wool stockpile. From July 1 this will be sold
by fixed schedule, and as the deadline approaches heavier sales are
reported, including sales for deferred delivery which make inroads into the
fixed schedule. The emphasis is on the possibility of lower supplies in
relation to demand during the next few months.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soya mayhem bemuses analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After last summer's devastating US floods, world grain traders are used to
weather stirring up the grain futures markets. However, the mayhem it has
wrought on soyabean prices this is unusual because the crop is only just
planted and will not be particularly weather-sensitive for several weeks.
Prices for soyabean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade climbed 75 cents
per bushel in the six trading days ending Monday, easily topping Dollars 7
per bushel for delivery this summer, and approaching that level for new
harvest delivery. Traders bought soyabean contracts thinking dryness in the
northern plains would inhibit germination in newly-planted seeds. Weather
forecasters fueled bullish speculation by predicting a long-term weather
pattern would keep crop areas dry.
Then, on Monday afternoon rains began to fall in Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois,
flushing the bulls out of the soyabean futures pits. In a heavy-volume rout
on Tuesday and Wednesday, prices skidded more than 54 cents a bushel,
forcing the Chicago Board of Trade to expand its limits on daily price
declines. In late trading yesterday the prompt July position was down
another 5 1/2 cents at Dollars 6.69 1/2 a bushel.
Agronomists are bemused by the market's rollercoaster ride, noting that US
crop conditions are nearly as ideal today as in 1992, when the US had a
bin-busting record maize harvest and excellent soyabean yields. Last
season's rains left ample subsoil moisture in most areas and warm dry
weather this spring allowed early seedings and hence a longer growing
season.
Analysts say two factor are contributing to the volatility of Chicago grain
markets. Firstly, last year's small harvest has left very little room for
error in this season's crop - grain processors and exporters will have very
little cushion if this year's harvest is delayed or smaller than forecast.
Secondly, institutional investors who historically have scorned commodity
markets have discovered their use as inflation hedges just as internal rules
at the commodities exchanges have been adjusted to permit much larger
speculative investments.
At the Chicago Board of Trade for example, a single speculator can now
control as many as 30m bushels of maize and 21m bushels of soyabeans, twice
the size allowable just two months ago.
With the stakes higher, grain markets have entered the world of high
finance, and deep-pocketed fund managers are throwing their bets into the
soyabean ring with unprecedented vigor. The result, traders say, is
exaggerated daily price moves that don't always reflect the long-term
fundamentals of the crop.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: European sector returns to calmer waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's bond markets returned to calmer waters after the recent days'
turbulence, but traders said sentiment was nervous and market participants
were too shell-shocked to take significant positions.
'The market is shaky - it's hanging in a very delicate balance,' said Mr
Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt.
After Wednesday's sell-off, which sent the German bund future plunging to
its year's low, prices clawed back some of their losses, helped by a firmer
tone in the US Treasuries market, but the recovery was without conviction,
traders said. One said dealers at some banks had been instructed not to run
positions overnight, and to keep intra-day positions to a minimum.
The June bund future ended the day some 0.20 points higher at 93.75. It
derived little comfort from preliminary inflation numbers showing western
Germany's cost of living below the 3 per cent level for the first time in
three years at 2.9 per cent. 'After recent regional data, this came as no
surprise,' said a dealer.
Bearish sentiment continued to dominate the UK government bond market
yesterday, although it recovered in later trading - buoyed by the recovery
in US and German markets.
Analysts said traders continued to test new low levels of technical support
but one trader said the weakness, particularly at the long end, was caused
by the release of 'a substantial line, probably in excess of Pounds 200m
nominal, of very long-dated stock on to the market'. Other traders reported
fairly heavy selling of gilts of all types.
After opening slightly higher, gilts slipped back through the levels reached
yesterday to new lows, analysts said. They recovered in late trading, when
the long gilt future was up  1/4 point at 103 9/16 .
Sweden was Europe's only bright patch. Bonds and the currency rallied
smartly after the central bank announced a new system for steering
short-term interest rates based on a repo rate, rather than its current key
marginal rate.
The Riksbank set the repo rate at 6.95 per cent, five basis points below the
previous marginal lending rate, and the floor rate at 6 per cent. At a press
briefing, Riksbank governor Mr Urban Backstrom said the level of the floor,
or deposit, rate indicated that 'the (interest rate) trend is still
downwards'.
'They now have much more scope to cut rates in small dribbling moves,' said
Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers. He expects short
rates to fall by around 50 basis points in coming months, which is likely to
boost bonds and the krona, he said.
US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday as the market failed to build on
gains struck after the previous afternoon's successful supply auction.
Late in the day the 30-year bond dipped  1/8 to 86 23/32 , with the yield
rising to 7.355 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged
at 99 29/32 , to yield 5.909 per cent.
Early in the session, activity was light and sporadic, with many traders on
the sidelines ahead of the holiday weekend.
A flurry of buying followed the announcement that initial claims for
unemployment benefit had slipped by 1,000 last week. Forecasts had centred
on a decline of 7,000, which would have signalled a tighter labour market
and more upward pressure on wages.
But the activity quickly petered out, as the market digested an upturn in
prices following Wednesday's Treasury auction of Dollars 11bn in new
five-year notes. Traders had anticipated difficulty in absorbing the fresh
supply but when those fears proved unfounded, the market rallied.
Yesterday, however, profit-takers came to the fore, even though there was
more favourable news from the Commodity Research Bureau. Its index of 21
commodity prices receded further, after a disconcerting surge late last
week.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: IADB drops borrowing
requirement to Dollars 2.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inter-American Development Bank, the multilateral bank whose purpose is
to further the economic and social development of Latin America and the
Caribbean, plans to raise some Dollars 2.8bn in the international capital
markets this year, significantly less than the Dollars 3.3bn forecast at the
beginning of the year.
The borrowing requirement has been revised downwards due to a slower pace of
loan disbursements, a lack of advantageous redemption opportunities and the
fact that the IADB had less maturing debt than in 1993, when it raised
Dollars 3.9bn, said Mr Charles Sethness, finance manager.
However, the borrowing requirement will return to around Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 4.5bn in 1995, he stressed.
The IADB has raised some Dollars 500m so far this year in four different
currencies. It plans to issue 'one or two significant-size' US dollar deals
and a DM500m deal later this year, but there are no immediate issuance plans
while the bond markets remain volatile. 'Our cash position is quite
comfortable,' Mr Sethness said.
After lending Dollars 5.5bn of funds in 1993, lending was not likely to
exceed Dollars 6bn in 1994.
The IADB's shareholders recently agreed to allow it to lend to the private
sector without government guarantee, limiting this exposure to 5 per cent of
new loans. Although the bank will be exposed to commercial risk for the
first time, Mr Sethness was confident it would not threaten the IADB's
triple-A rating since this lending would be 'at a marginal level and on an
experimental basis'.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's warns on Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's Investors Service, the international rating agency, warns in a
report on sovereign risk that old vices are surfacing once again in Latin
America.
Although Moody's has recognised the fiscal improvement and the success of
economic reform in Latin America through some rating upgrades, it
nevertheless believes that these countries remain highly indebted and
structurally biased towards consumption.
National debt is rising again noticeably and the fiscal balance has
deteriorated in some cases, notably Venezuela, it adds. Although the
potential for growth has improved, the risk of running into debt service
problems remains high.
'After a decade of economic crisis, growth rates have been only moderately
high and the income distribution of these countries has not improved
significantly,' Moody's says. It forecasts problems arising from the
reversal in the rapid inflow of capital in recent years (in Argentina and
Mexico) and says the considerable potential for political change adds a
further degree of uncertainty to the future of the region.
The report, which assesses the credit quality outlook for 45 sovereign
nations, highlights negative factors which could harm the low-risk credit
ratings of advanced industrial nations. These developments, such as high
fiscal deficits, the rapid accumulation of public debt, slow economic growth
and declining international competitiveness will force painful economic
adjustment but in most cases, the adjustment is not expected not be severe
enough to move them into the medium-risk rating categories.
By contrast, Moody's is positive about the outlook for Asian nations, citing
credit strengths, strong export-driven economic growth, high savings and
investment rates and moderate indebtedness in proportion to prospects for
continued strong export earnings. However, upgrades into the low-risk rating
categories will be constrained by the possibility of political instability
and regional conflict and the potential for disruptive social change as
social demands rise.

Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has opened a representative office
in Beijing providing more evidence of the involvement of American financial
houses in China.
Mr Sherman Lewis, Lehman Brothers' vice-chairman, said the company would
involve itself in fund-raising for infrastructure projects, the marketing of
'various debt instruments' and assisting with public offerings for larger
enterprises.
Lehman acted as sole agent for the Construction Bank of China in a private
placement of debt securities in the US last August. It lead-managed last
October's Dollars 300m dragon bond and is assisting a large Chinese
corporation in a public offering.
The US investment house plans to open an office in Shanghai by the end of
the year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National swaps Y30bn deal into
dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issues in the eurobond market were scarce yesterday with Wednesday's
resurgence of volatility in the bond markets scaring off issuers and
investors.
As a result, attention focused on Abbey National's Y30bn offering of
three-year eurobonds, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating-rate
dollars.
When the deal hit the screens, the pricing and the swap rates at the time
led many syndicate managers to believe that the bank had missed its funding
target by a wide margin, fanning talk of a subsidy on the swap.
This was hotly denied both by joint lead manager Merrill Lynch and by Abbey.
Mr Jonathan Nicholls, director, corporate finance and capital markets at
Abbey, said the deal had been in the works since Tuesday and that the
pricing and the swap had been set on Wednesday. 'We are not in the business
of asking for or getting subsidies,' he said.
CCDQ, Quebec's co-operative banking movement, saved at least 15 basis points
by raising CDollars 100m of five-year debt in the eurobond market rather
than the domestic bond market.
Lead manager Wood Gundy said CCDQ has a strong retail following in the
eurobond market and by the end of the day, around one-third of the issue had
been placed. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was largely
unchanged.
The spread on Ford Motor Credit's Dollars 150m offering of three-year debt
launched on Wednesday was steady at around 45 basis points due to ongoing
demand from European retail investors, attracted by the 6 3/4 per cent
coupon.
Bacob Bank, Belgium's eighth-largest credit institution, could well tap the
eurobond market in the near future following the signing yesterday of a
Dollars 1bn multi-currency medium-term note programme, arranged by Morgan
Stanley.
The International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the eurobond
market's trade association, is expected to announce a reduction in the
settlement period for eurobonds at its annual general meeting next Thursday
in New Orleans. From June 1 1995, eurobonds will settle after three working
days rather than the current five days.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Faint glimmer of hope in
electricals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's integrated electrical companies, with products ranging from heavy
electrical machinery to semiconductors and audio-visual goods, have suffered
badly in the depression of recent years. Last year some were forced to
report their third or fourth year of falling profits.
But a glimmer of hope has appeared as they reported still weak but, in some
areas, improving results for the year to last March.
Mixed fortunes have also been evident along sector as well as company lines.
What saved many and enabled some to report better results, was strong demand
in the US for computers - which in turn supported buoyant sales of
semiconductors - firm sales of components in south-east Asia, demand from
domestic public utilities and the companies' own cost-cutting efforts.
With economic slump damaging core business, companies' overseas earnings
have been battered by strong yen. Every Y1 rise of the Japanese currency's
value lops off Y1.5bn off sales at NEC, the company said.
Persistent weakness in domestic private capital spending, slow consumer
demand and fierce price competition put a damper on sales of many mainline
products.
In computers, Fujitsu and NEC, for example, suffered decreases in expensive
items, such as mainframes and minicomputers.
Fujitsu, which is Japan's largest computer manufacturer and the world's
second-largest (after IBM), saw demand for its computers decline by 10 per
cent in the domestic market, under severe price pressure. Orders for
minicomputers were almost half the previous year.
NEC saw shipments of minicomputers drop 26 per cent, with office servers and
mainframes down 9 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.
Consumer electronics was another sector which dragged down earnings. Sales
of air conditioners dropped as a result of Japan's unusually cold summer
last year, while audio-visual equipment suffered intensifying price
competition amid the market slump.
NEC Home Electronics, the company's struggling consumer electronics
division, reported a loss of Y8.7bn - although this was an improvement over
its Y16.7bn loss previously.
Mitsubishi Electric suffered a 12 per cent drop in consumer products, and
Toshiba saw an 8 per cent fall. Fujitsu's car audio division reported an 11
per cent fall in sales, largely the result of the domestic slump in cars.
On the positive side were strong overseas markets and sales of a few
specific products.
In the US, there was a strong rise in sales of semiconductors and liquid
crystal displays (LCDs). The growing popularity of advanced software such as
Windows, which use more memory capacity, meant that demand for
semiconductors rose more than PC sales.
The shift to colour notebooks increased demand for LCDs, a sector dominated
by Japanese manufacturers. Toshiba, which uses colour for more than half its
notebooks, said demand for LCDs was so strong it could not be fully met.
NEC's US subsidiary, which makes electronic devices, saw sales surge more
than 70 per cent.
The US market also pleased Toshiba with strong demand for its notebook and
sub-notebook computers.
Demand for electronic devices from south-east Asia was another positive
factor. Toshiba reported a 9 per cent increase in exports, despite the yen's
appreciation, due largely to strong south-east Asian demand for
semiconductors and other components.
Public utility investment helped support the companies' heavy electrical
machinery divisions, with Mitsubishi Electric seeing sales rise 7 per cent.
Efforts to reduce costs were a significant factor where there was an
improvement. For NEC, which fell into consolidated pre-tax loss the previous
year, a return to profit was achieved partly by cutting selling, general and
administrative costs by 5 per cent.
Prospects for the year ahead are still uncertain. Most companies expect a
slow and gradual recovery in Japan, rather than a strong rebound.
However, there are sectors which promise continuing strength and many
electricals are planning aggressive investment in those areas in the hope of
reaping further benefits.
NEC, for example, is investing a further Y125bn in electronic devices, a
level that is close to the company's 1992 investment peak of Y131bn. Toshiba
is investing Y90bn in semiconductors alone.

Bad loans overshadowing Japan's 11 leading commercial banks are growing
faster than they can be written off, on the evidence of the industry's
annual results, published yesterday.
The 11, which provide just under one third of lending to Japan's sluggish
economy, took drastic action to reduce their non-performing loans last year.
But the signs are that it was not enough to improve their balance sheets.
They wrote off Y2,480bn (Dollars 24bn) of bad loans in the 12 months to
March, two-and-a-half times more than the previous year. On top of this, the
commercial banks made provisions worth Y2,102bn, a 44 per cent rise on last
year's provisions of Y1,459bn, and sold Y1,325bn of bad debts to the
Co-Operative Credit Purchasing Company, a jointly-owned debt buying
organisation set up in January last year. As a result of these hefty
charges, pre-tax profits fell for the fifth year running, by an average of
41.6 per cent.
This collective attempt to clean up their the balance sheets is a belated
response to the central bank's campaign to persuade the industry to break
with its tradition of sitting on bad debts indefinitely.
Yet, despite their efforts, the commercial banks' published bad debts rose
both in absolute terms - from Y8,435bn last year to Y8,948bn by the end of
March - and as a proportion of total lending - from 3.1 per cent to 3.3 per
cent over the same period.
The published bad debt total is down 3 per cent from the balance half-way
through the year, at the end of September, prompting bank officials to
suggest that the worst is over. But as in previous years, the published
figures understate the size of the problem, because they only include loans
to bankrupt companies or loans where no interest has been received for six
months. They exclude restructured loans, where interest has been shaved to
almost nil to keep a weak customer alive, or loans by non-bank affiliates
for which the parents are responsible.
Together, these could nearly double the published figure according to the
most pess-imistic independent est-imates.
The disturbing message behind this is that Japan's deep recession is adding
a new tier of debt problems, loans to ailing small companies, on top of the
dud property-backed loans inherited from the post-bubble collapse in
property prices.
Equally worrying, the commercial banks covered between one third and half of
those write-offs by selling and repurchasing securities, so as to record a
capital gain. This is bound to increase their dependence on low-yielding
assets, warns Ms Alicia Ogawa, equities analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia.
Within this, however, the commercial banks yesterday demonstrated wide
differences in their state of health and the aggressiveness with which they
are tackling their loans.
This is a sign that Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan is
making continued progress in his campaign to persuade the industry to break
with its 'convoy' tradition, whereby banks reported similar results in an
attempt to buoy public confidence.
Mitsubishi Bank, the strongest, revealed non-performing loans worth just
1.84 per cent of total lending, while Hokkaido Takushoku, declared 6.85 per
cent and Sakura Bank 4.03 per cent.
The impression the banks aimed to give yesterday is that they have got to
grips with their weaknesses and that there is light at the end of the
tunnel. In a symbolic act of penitence, board directors of three banks,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Hokkaido Takushoku and Sumitomo, are to forego bonuses
this year because of their institutions' poor earnings.
Most predicted flat profits in the coming year, though again there were
significant differences between banks. Mitsubishi, which surprised the
market with a 15.7 per cent decline in its core business (or operating)
profits - far below than the average 5.3 per cent decline - said it did not
expect profits to rise this year. Sumitomo, with business profits down 11.5
per cent, forecast stable earnings.
Sakura, by contrast, forecast a recovery from its 23.5 per cent profits
decline, to the bafflement of several analysts. 'I just can't see where it's
going to come from,' said Mr Brian Waterhouse, banking analyst at James
Capel in Tokyo.
Generally, the industry outlook is tough. Demand for loans remains very
weak, as shown by a 1.5 per cent in total lending last year. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that the market for creditworthy customers is aggressive.
Salomon's Ms Ogawa estimates that 17 per cent of the commercial banks'
liabilities are linked to the record low official discount rate and pay less
than 1 per cent. If the central bank succumbs to pressure to cut the
official rate, this will hardly help banks' profit margins.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Kubota posts 55% rise in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kubota Corporation, Japan's leading manufacturer of farm equipment and iron
pipes, increased turnover by 4.2 per cent and profits by 55 per cent for the
year to March 31.
Group pre-tax income rose to Y27.3bn (Dollars 261m) on sales up at Y979.5bn.
After taxation and other charges, earnings rose 47 per cent to Y8.2bn.
Domestic turnover grew 5.8 per cent, despite weak private sector demand that
cut sales of industrial castings and pipes.
The loss was more than offset by higher sales for the company's
environmental control equipment and building materials divisions, the result
of an increase in public sector construction projects following successive
government packages to stimulate the economy.
Sales of internal combustion engines were stable despite a cool summer and
the partial liberalisation of rice imports.
Overseas sales were depressed by the sharp appreciation of the yen, falling
by 3.7 per cent to Y155.9bn despite strong growth in the US.
The parent company announced a 6.5 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to
Y28.1bn, on turnover lower by 0.6 per cent at Y744bn. For the current year,
Kubota expects a gradual economic recovery to lift unconsolidated pre-tax
profits by 7 per cent, on sales higher by 2 per cent.

securities subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Yasuda Trust and Banking yesterday announced that it planned to become the
third Japanese trust bank to set up a securities subsidiary, the latest step
in the industry's gradual deregulation.
Yasuda, the fourth-largest trust bank - which traditionally specialise in
managing clients' assets - said it would open the new unit by the end of
June at the earliest.
Under a relaxation in rules made in April last year, trust banks and
long-term credit banks are allowed to launch subsidiaries to issue
convertible and warrant bonds - but not deal in them - and to deal in
straight bonds. This privilege was extended early this year to the powerful
city banks.
So far, the finance ministry has licensed five banks to set up securities
subsidiaries, in line with its strategy of cautious deregulation.

Siam Cement, Thailand's largest domestic conglomerate, reported a 107 per
cent year-on-year rise in first-quarter consolidated net profits to Bt1.44bn
(Dollars 57m).
Parent net profits rose 85 per cent to Bt1.07bn, and earnings per share were
Bt12.1 and Bt8.96 respectively.
Mr Gerard Kruithof, an investment analyst at Peregrine Nithi Finance and
Securities, said: 'Profits were likely to break out. The expansion in 1992
and 1993 depressed the bottom line: the added capacity wasn't running at
full steam and they have an aggressive depreciation policy.'
Siam Cement, which accounts for half the cement sold in Thailand, is
spending Bt5.7bn to expand its Thungsong plant in Saraburi province by 2.1m
tonnes a year to maintain market share.

Y258m

<TEXT>
Minolta Camera, the Japanese camera and precision instrument manufacturer,
returned to the black for the year to March 31, thanks to cost cutting and
an increase in dividends from subsid-iaries.
The company posted unconsolidated pre-tax profits of Y258m (Dollars 2m),
compared to a loss of Y13.6bn the previous year.
Sales fell 6.1 per cent to Y184.3bn, with falling domestic demand due to the
prolonged recession and the appreciation of the yen. After-tax profits were
Y530m.
Sales at Minolta's office automation machinery division fell 10 per cent to
Y115.7bn, but camera sales rose 6.4 per cent to Y68.6bn. Overall exports
declined 5.8 per cent to Y141.6bn due to the higher yen.
The company said it would forego a dividend payment, as in the previous
year, and retain profits for its financial restructuring.
For the current year, the company forecasts a rise in parent pre-tax
earnings to Y1bn, on a 2.7 per cent rise in sales to Y189bn.
Minolta Camera will change its name to Minolta Co from July 1, Reuter
reports from Tokyo. The change would more correctly reflect the company's
current activities, Minolta said.
Minolta was founded in 1937 as a camera maker but has diversified widely
into information equipment.
Its Japanese name would be changed to Minoruta Kabushiki Kaisha from
Minoruta Kamera Kabushiki Kaisha.

Prolonged recession, unstable weather and a strong currency combined to
reduce profits at Mitsubishi Materials, the Japanese metals and cement
manufacturer, in the year to the end of March. Unconsolidated pre-tax
profits slumped 74 per cent to Y2.6bn (Dollars 25m) on turnover down 8.2 per
cent at Y682bn.
The difficult operating climate saw sales of most products tumble, with
particularly sharp declines for copper, cement and processed goods.
Unseasonably cool summer weather hit aluminium can production, while the 14
per cent appreciation of the yen in the period cut exports. Gold was the
only division to increase sales as world demand remained buoyant.
The company is implementing a restructuring programme that will see its
workforce fall by 10 per cent by 1996. Lower capital expenditure and other
economies are expected to reduce costs by about Y10bn over the period.
This reorganisation, together with a gradual recovery in the Japanese
economy, is expected to yield improved results in 1994-95. The company
forecast a 3 per cent increase in turnover and a rise of 16 per cent in
pre-tax profits.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Indian paper backlog almost
cleared
</HEADLINE>

Banks handling the stock market paperwork for foreign portfolio investors in
India have mostly cleared the backlog which threatened to overwhelm the
country's primitive stock settlement and transfer system.
However, the banks, which provide custodial services to overseas fund
managers, are keeping a tight check on the business they handle. Existing
clients are being told to limit purchases; new clients are being asked to
wait until processing capacity is increased over the next few months.
The paperwork problems stem from woefully outmoded procedures geared mainly
toward millions of individuals buying as few as 10 or 100 shares, not
institutions purchasing lots of 100,000. A single large purchase can
generate a trunk-full of share certificates and transfer forms which must be
processed manually.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the biggest provider of custodial
services for foreign clients, says its backlog was cleared at the end of
March; clients who were asked to stop trading are now permitted to resume
with limited amounts. New clients are not yet being accepted.
A foreign fund manager says: 'The custodial problem is the single largest
speed-breaker on foreign institutional investment on the Indian stock market
today. At the end of 1993, custodians imposed limits on clients. Today, they
claim that they have licked the problem, but there has been no public
announcement to this effect and the limit still exists.'
The fund manager estimates the limit to be about USDollars 3m a month per
client. Given that specialised India funds have raised USDollars 100m and
more, this is very tight, although fund managers do have the option of
investing in Indian company euro-issues.
Mr Samir Arora, vice-president of the Indian affiliate of the Alliance
Capital fund management group, says: 'We have earmarked 5 per cent of our
USDollars 1bn Global Privatisation Fund for India. We could, if allowed to,
easily invest USDollars 100m in the next few weeks, but we cannot.'
Partly because of these difficulties, Indian foreign portfolio investment
has slowed in recent months, though fund managers have also been influenced
by the worldwide correction in stock markets.
Net investments by foreign institutions fell from Dollars 398m in January to
Dollars 163m in April. Total cumulative investment at the end of April was
Dollars 1.77bn - up from almost nothing a year ago.
Hongkong Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank are increasing custody
staff to boost capacity. Stock Holding Corporation of India, a company
created by Indian financial institutions, could take on more business but
its capital is too small to satisfy the security needs of most foreign fund
managers.
State Bank of India and ICICI, two leading institutions, are also
establishing custodial services, but foreign fund managers are reluctant to
entrust the work to Indian banks they scarcely know.
The extra capacity will permit only steady increases in trading volumes and
faster growth will require a radical overhaul of the trading system. The
goal is a paper-less trading system, which is under development by Indian
banks but still far from complete.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Lawsuits make US groups
publicity-shy - Patrick Harverson examines the background to a trend in
corporate self-defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US companies are becoming increasingly reluctant to keep investors fully
informed of their prospects because of the threat of costly legal action.
The threat comes in the shape of class-action securities fraud lawsuits
filed by shareholders aggrieved that the value of their stock fell when
information proved inaccurate, and the increasing number of these suits has
caught the eye of the regulators.
A study released last week by the American Stock Exchange found that more
than 75 per cent of the companies surveyed said they had been forced to
curtail the amount of information they provided to investors because of
concern over lawsuits.
Companies which cut back on information to investors often do so following
legal advice. Mr Bob Profusek, head of the corporate department at the law
firm of Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, says: 'Most lawyers now discourage
companies from making anything like traditional projections.'
Fighting class-action lawsuits can also cost companies a lot of money.
The National Economic Research Association says the average cost of settling
such lawsuits has risen in the past three years from Dollars 5.8m to Dollars
7.4m.
Securities Class Action Alert, a New Jersey-based newsletter, recently
estimated that companies paid Dollars 1.55bn last year to settle shareholder
lawsuits, compared with just Dollars 324m in 1988.
Although any company can be the target of a shareholder lawsuit, high-tech
and biotechnology companies are particular vulnerable because they need to
keep investors constantly updated on technological development, patents and
product innovations.
In addition, young, smaller companies are especially at risk, because their
shares are more likely to fall sharply on disappointing financial news, and
because they are more likely to settle rather than fight lawsuits.
In California, where there is a concentration of high-tech industry,
shareholder lawsuits filed under Section 10b-5 of the Securities and
Exchange Act - relating to false or misleading information - are
particularly common.
According to the Coalition to Eliminate Abusive Securities Suits (CEASS), a
business pressure group, Californian companies paid out a total of Dollars
502m between 1990 and 1993 to settle 10b-5 lawsuits.
Public companies are not the only ones affected by such suits. Take the case
of Mr Bob Gilbertson, chief executive of CMX Systems, a small but
fast-growing Connecticut high-tech company eager to raise funds on the
public markets.
Mr Gilbertson says he was recently advised by investment banking firms that
if he took the firm public, he would have to allocate at least Dollars 2m of
the flotation proceeds to cover the almost certain possibility of having to
settle a shareholder lawsuit within 12 to 18 months.
He says: 'The investment bankers effectively told us to write Dollars 2m off
to pay the lawyers to go away.' Mr Gilbertson decided against taking the
company public.
Many chief executives on the wrong end of class-action lawsuits do not blame
the shareholders so much as the lawyers, who know they can force companies
to settle quickly.
In the ASE study, a clear majority of the 17 per cent of the companies which
said they had been sued during the past five years on disclosure issues
settled out of court rather than fight the suit.
Ms Lynn Zempel, a spokeswoman for CEASS, says: 'Companies say that most of
the time their lawyers tell them its cheaper to settle than fight, and (the
shareholders') lawyers know that.'
The financial incentive for the lawyers is considerable: the ASE survey
found that nationally, the plaintiffs lawyers receive 30 cents for every
dollar sought in these lawsuits, compared with just six cents for every
dollar the shareholders themselves receive.
But the growing instances of shareholder lawsuits has attracted the
attention of regulators and legislators.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned that companies may be
shying away from fuller disclosure because of the lawsuits, is considering
bolstering the 'safe harbour' provision of US securities law.
The provision protects companies from fraud claims unless the information
they release is 'without a reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in
good faith'.
In recent years, however, companies claim the safe harbour provision has not
been working effectively. Its weakness is that companies usually have to go
through an expensive and time-consuming pre-trial process before a judge
rules on whether the information is protected by safe harbour. Consequently,
companies can rack up huge legal fees even if the lawsuits are ultimately
dismissed.
While the SEC does not want to deter shareholders from seeking legal redress
if they genuinely believe they have been deceived, it is keen to ensure the
system is quick to weed out meritless cases.
Ms Linda Quinn, director of the SEC's corporation finance division, says:
'We're exploring what can be done so that the type of information intended
to be covered by safe harbour is covered, and that the safe harbour works to
the benefit of companies.
'Right now, what they will argue is that even if the information is
ultimately decided to be within the safe harbour (provision), you have to
litigate through an entire case to get there. The question is: are there
ways to make the rule work so that it could be decided earlier in the case?'
While the SEC reviews the safe harbour provision, legislators in Washington
DC are also seeking ways to give companies more protection. Bills which
would give companies greater help in their defences against frivolous
shareholder lawsuits have been tabled in the Senate and the House of
Representatives.
The bills include measures to allow judges to make quicker decisions on the
merits of individual cases, to halt the use of 'professional plaintiffs'
with only nominal shareholdings and to cut attorney's fees.
Introducing any legislation that protects corporate defendants from lawyers
is always going to be an uphill task in the US, however, and securities
lawyers have vowed to fight the Dodd bill. They claim shareholders need all
the protection they can get from deceptive companies.

Singapore Press Holdings, the owner of the Straits Times, is linking up with
a Thai partner to produce a regional business newspaper called Business Day,
which it plans to launch in Bangkok next January.
The paper's editor and managing director, Mr Chatchai Yenbamroong, said: 'We
expect 70 per cent of our readers to be local. Thai businessmen are not well
equipped with knowledge of regional matters; they are at a disadvantage to
their counterparts in Hong Kong and Singapore.'
The Thai Premier Publishing Group will hold 51 per cent of the paper,
Singapore Press Holdings 35 per cent and United Cinema Holding and
Management, a subsidiary of the Crown Property Bureau, 11 per cent. The
Population and Community Development Association, an independent group run
by the anti-Aids campaigner Mr Mechai Viravaidya, will take a 3 per cent
stake.
The paper, which is in the process of recruiting 60 reporters, mostly Thai,
and about 10 foreign subeditors, will attempt to keep costs low by
contracting out printing.
The falling price of desktop publishing equipment will allow the company to
spend just Bt10m (Dollars 0.4m) in the start-up period. The 16 to 20-page
product, with a target circulation of 15,000 to 20,000, should hit Thailand,
Hongkong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City and Manila next

Logitech, the world market leader in tracking devices (mice) for computers,
continued its strong recovery in the year ended March, writes Ian Rodger
from Zurich.
Net income more than trebled to SFr27.8m (Dollars 19.8m), but was inflated
by a SFr15.9m gain on the sale of shares and options in a Canadian affiliate
and moderated by an exceptional SFr6m depreciation charge and SFr2.6m in
restructuring charges.
Revenues jumped 17.1 per cent to SFr484.2m.

Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth-largest bank, had a strong second
quarter and said the economy was continuing to recover, particularly in
Ontario, its main market.
Net profit for the three months ended April 30 was CDollars 158m (USDollars
114.4m) or 50 cents a share, down slightly from the first quarter, but up
from CDollars 90m or 27 cents a share a year earlier.
Return on assets was 0.69 per cent (0.45 per cent) and on equity 12.7 per
cent (7.5 per cent). Average earning assets rose 11 per cent to CDollars
85.5bn.
Loan quality continued to improve, but the loss estimate remains unchanged
at CDollars 450m for fiscal 1994 - CDollars 112m was charged to the second
quarter.
Other income rose 24 per cent, with strengths in brokerage commissions,
investment management fees, swap trading and foreign exchange revenues.
Non-interest expense was up 13 per cent, mainly because of expansion in the
bank's securities business. Productivity ratio was stable.
First-half net profit was CDollars 326m or CDollars 1.02 a share against
CDollars 170m or 51 cents a share (before a restructuring charge).
Return on assets was 0.71 per cent (0.23 per cent) and on equity 13.1 per
cent (3.4 per cent).
Total assets at April 30 were CDollars 93.4bn, up 13 per cent on the year.

Fairview to CDollars 2.7bn loss

<TEXT>
The main operating subsidiary of Cadillac Fairview, the Toronto-based
property developer which is in the midst of a debt-restructuring, suffered a
CDollars 2.71bn (Dollars 1.96bn) loss in its latest fiscal year.
The loss, the biggest ever reported by a private-sector company in Canada,
was largely due to hefty writedowns of real-estate assets to reflect the
lower of their cost or market value.
As a result of the writedowns and other non-recurring provisions, the book
value of the subsidiary's assets tumbled to CDollars 2.8bn last October 31,
from CDollars 5.3bn a year earlier.
Cadillac Fairview (CF) is a private company owned by about 40 institutional
investors in the US and Canada. Its 73 properties include Toronto's landmark
Eaton Centre.
The parent company does not publish financial results, but its main
subsidiary, Cadillac Fairview Corporation Ltd, has issued publicly-traded
debt securities. CFCL's operating loss was CDollars 195.6m in the 12 months
to October 31, up from a CDollars 162.7m loss a year earlier.
CF's capital-restructuring plan covers debt of about CDollars 3.3bn. The
company is seeking to reduce its debt, raise new equity and sell some
assets. It has segregated its various properties, servicing the debt only of
those with adequate cash flows.
Prospective providers of equity include the Reichmann family, former owners
of Olympia &amp; York Developments; Mr Li Kashing, the Hong Kong tycoon; and US
financier Mr Leon Black.
Mr Doug Sawchuk, analyst at Dominion Bond Rating Service in Toronto, said
CF's debt-restructuring was likely to be simpler and less acrimonious than
the plan negotiated two years ago by O&amp;Y. CF has fewer subsidiaries, fewer
tiers of creditors and fewer cross-default provisions.
However, Mr Sawchuk said that bank lenders, led by Toronto-Dominion Bank,
'are a wild card'. The banks hold the bulk of CF's unsecured debt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Computer Associates, one of the largest software companies, reported record
fourth-quarter results as sales of its programs for mid-range client-server
computer systems increased sharply.
Net income for the quarter ended March 31 rose 60 per cent to Dollars
158.8m, or 93 cents per share, from Dollars 99.1m or 57 cents per share.
Revenues were Dollars 633.7m, an increase of 17 per cent over Dollars 540.1m
in the same period last year.
Earnings were well above Wall Street expectations and the group's share
price gained Dollars 6 1/8 to trade at Dollars 43 1/4 at mid-day in New
York. Costs were essentially flat despite a strong increase in revenues.
For the full year net income grew 63 per cent to Dollars 401.3m or Dollars
2.34 per share, up from Dollars 245.5m or Dollars 1.44 per share last time.
Revenues were Dollars 2.15bn, up 17 per cent from Dollars 1.84bn in the
prior 12 months.
Revenues from software for mid-range computers more than doubled in the
fourth quarter, said Mr Charles Wang, chairman and chief executive. 'In
order to continue building on our mid-range client server foundation, the
company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The ASK Group,
earlier this month,' he noted.
The acquisition is the first big purchase by Computer Associates in two
years, but since the company was formed in 1976 it has bought more than 40
other software companies to put together the broadest portfolio of products
outside the personal computer sector.
Also during the fourth quarter the group announced an agreement with
Electronic Data Systems to settle a lawsuit filed against EDS, alleging that
EDS had distributed CA products without paying proper licensing fees.
Under the terms of the agreement EDS will standardise on Computer
Associates' software worldwide, and will also become a reseller of its
products.
'The CA-EDS agreement was the largest single software licensing transaction
ever completed,' said Mr Wang.
'We look forward to the prospects for fiscal year 1995 with optimism.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Warm reception for Spanish
utility offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applications for the domestic retail tranche of the global share offer in
Endesa, the big Spanish electrical utility, reached a level of 3 1/4 times
the number of shares available, according to initial estimates from advisers
to the issue.
A total of 22.6m shares in Endesa, representing 8.7 per cent of its total
equity, is being sold by Endesa's chief shareholder, Grupo Teneo, which is
part of INI, the public-sector corporation. Prior to the offering, about 24
per cent of Endesa's shares were publicly held.
The size of the retail tranche had already been increased by 23 per cent
earlier this week to 6.1m shares in the light of the strong interest from
retail investors. Of the 500,000 retail investors who had pre-registered to
buy the shares, 200,000 investors subscribed to the offer, in line with
forecasts.
The strength of Spanish retail demand fulfilled Endesa's desire to widen its
shareholder base, which at present is dominated by New York based
institutions. It also fanned speculation that Teneo might exercise the
so-called 'claw back option' to bring additional shares from the
international and US tranches to the Spanish retail tranche. Currently, 5.4m
shares in the form of American depositary shares are earmarked for the US
and 7.5m shares for international investors.
Endesa's share price closed yesterday at Pta6,630, up Pta30. The
subscription period in Spain ended yesterday and pricing of the issue is
expected to take place next week with trading starting on the next day.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday shed
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 50 5/8 as the company dampened stock market hopes
that it was poised to split its tobacco operations from the rest of the
business.
The company issued a terse statement saying: 'It is not anticipated that
this issue will be before the board in the foreseeable future.'
Like other US tobacco manufacturers, Philip Morris has been suffering
downward pressure on its share price because of increasingly intense
opposition to smoking in the US, bringing threats of anti-smoking
legislation and lawsuits seeking damages for smoking-related diseases.
Last month Philip Morris confirmed a Financial Times report that it was
considering splitting off its tobacco operations from the non-tobacco part
of its business as one of several possible options for enhancing the value
of its stock.
On Wednesday the company's shares were suspended all day as directors met to
discuss the possibility of a separation. The length of the meeting, an
unprecedented six-and-a-half hours, suggested that the issue was keenly
debated.
Afterwards, however, the company said the board had decided to take no
action. Instead it appointed Mr Geoffrey Bible, executive vice president for
world tobacco, to the board and promoted him to vice chairman for worldwide
tobacco.
Shareholders voted to defeat a proposal to spin off disparate businesses of
US Shoe, Reuter reports.
The group's directors had recommended shareholders to vote against the
proposal.

<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal opened the second-quarter reporting season of Canada's 'big
six' banks by posting a 9 per cent rise in earnings.
The improvement was attributed largely to higher volumes and a drop in
loan-loss provisions. However, it was partly offset by slimmer margins,
especially in money market operations, and a 6 per cent rise in non-interest
expenses.
Net income grew to CDollars 188m (USDollars 136.2m), or 69 cents a share, in
the three months to April 30, from CDollars 173m, or 63 cents, a year
earlier.
Loan-loss provisions fell to CDollars 157m from CDollars 163m.

Industry sources said the oilfield produces about 15,000 barrels per day.
The spokesman said the planned sale was part of a programme of evaluating

He added that the move was not the start of a wave of divestiture.
Texaco said that it would retain a lubrication/blending operation in

Glaxo India, a subsidiary of Glaxo Holdings of the UK, has sold its family
products division to HJ Heinz of the US for Dollars 70m.
The division contributes 30 per cent to the offshoot's net profits and
generates annual revenues of Rs1.5bn (Dollars 47.8m) from products including
baby foods, health beverages and toiletry products.
The deal involves all brands, a factory at Uttar Pradesh and an undertaking
by Heinz to employ the division's 950 employees.
The sale, which will be put to shareholders next month, is subject to
government approval.
The sale is in line with Glaxo's strategy to concentrate on its mainline
pharmaceutical business which contributes around 65 per cent to total
revenues of Rs6bn.
Last year, Glaxo Holdings invested Rs510m to increase its stake in the
Indian company from 40 per cent to a majority 51 per cent.
Since then steps have been taken to align the Indian subsidiary's businesses
more closely with the parent company's.
In an attempt to overcome constraints imposed by drug price controls
introduced in 1979, Glaxo India had diversified into products such as starch
derivatives, soya bean oil and liquid glucose by setting up joint ventures.
Last year the board decided to move out of these loss-making businesses.
A Glaxo spokesman said that while the division has contributed to the bottom
line, its growth was in question with the entry of multinational food
companies to India.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Daimler chief sees bank stake
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading bank, is likely to reduce its stake in
Daimler-Benz to between 15 and 20 per cent during the next 10 years, Mr
Edzard Reuter, chairman of the German motor and engineering company, said
yesterday.
'My prediction for 10 years from today is that (the stake) will be 15 to 20
per cent - in that direction,' Mr Reuter said in London.
In an industrial-financial partnership established in 1926, Deutsche
currently holds 25 per cent of Daimler's equity. The stake was cut from 28
per cent after a share placement earlier this year.
At a lunch for US correspondents, Mr Reuter said: 'They (Deutsche Bank) are
really trying to withdraw from too heavy industrial engagements, especially
in the field of supervisory boards. I think this a very good and very
positive development.'
Questioned about Daimler's 10 per cent stake in Metallgesellschaft, the
troubled German metals and mining group, Mr Reuter gave the clearest
indication to date that it might eventually be sold.
The stake, taken in 1991 when Daimler saw possibilities of links between the
two groups in environmental technology, was no longer regarded as a
'strategic investment', Mr Reuter said. However, Daimler participated fully
in a rights issue for Metallgesellschaft earlier this year as a 'comradely'
gesture, he said.
Mr Reuter, who has been tipped to take over as the next supervisory board
chairman of Daimler when he steps down from the management board at the end
of next year, elaborated on his strategy of widening the group's equity
base. This was part of his drive to give the company 'a truly international
culture', he said.
The proportion of Daimler shares held in the US could rise to 15 per cent
over the longer term, from between 3 and 5 per cent at present, Mr Reuter
said.
Daimler last October became the first German company to have its shares
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Its one-for-10 rights issue later
this summer would have a strong international element to the share-placing,
Mr Reuter said.
He gave a blunt assessment of the reasons for a record DM1.8bn (Dollars
1.1bn) loss last year. Daimler's business performance, which last year had
been 'dramatically rotten', was now reaching 'turnround', he said.
'No-one denies mistakes were made by management. We made evaluations which
didn't prove viable,' he said. He cited delays in realising the seriousness
of its problems in the business communications field, and in introducing
shorter vehicle model cycles.
As part of a general move towards restructuring throughout German industry,
Mr Reuter said 'nearly a miracle' had taken place since the beginning of
last year. Trade union mentalities were changing fast, he said.
Dramatic productivity improvements had, however, been bought at the price of
high unemployment. 'There was no way we could continue with the old German
tradition of 'take it easy'. We're starting again to fight. But the result
is high unemployment, not just in Germany but all over Europe.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Paribas forecasts recovery
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery at Paribas, one of France's leading banking groups, will accelerate
this year as the economic climate improves, according to Mr Andre Levy-Lang,
chairman.
'The first months of 1994 have confirmed that this year will mark a new step
in the improvement of the group's results,' he told the annual general
meeting in Paris yesterday.
Paribas, like other French banks, came under intense financial pressure in
the early 1990s. It reached its nadir in 1991 when it fell into the red for
the first time, and was then dogged by a scandal over off-balance sheet
share dealings at Ciments Francais, the French cement company in which it
was a substantial investor.
The group returned to the black in 1992 and increased its net profits in
1993, to FFr1.45bn (Dollars 257m) on operating income of FFr32.68bn. It made
substantial profits last year from its currency trading operations, but had
problems in the commercial property sector and was affected by the depressed
state of the retail banking market.
Mr Levy-Lang said Credit du Nord, the group's main retail banking
subsidiary, had continued to experience problems in the opening months of
1994. He warned it was likely to incur an operating loss during the year,
but said there was 'every reason to think' it would move back into the black
in the future.

<TEXT>
MoDo, the Swedish pulp and paper group, yesterday announced its first
quarterly profit since 1991 and upgraded its forecast for the full-year.
The group made a profit of SKr202m (Dollars 26m), after net financial items,
against a year-earlier loss of SKr181m.
It said its full-year profit would be 'well above' SKr1bn, compared to last
year's SKr449m loss. The group's B shares rose SKr7 to SKr318.
Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive, said that although prices were rising, they
had a limited impact. The upturn was mainly due to higher volumes, better
capacity utilisation and cost-cutting. The group also benefited from lower
interest rates and reduced net debt.
Sales rose to SKr4.57bn from SKr4.32bn, while operating profit improved to
SKr433m from SKr131m. The group's Swedish units lifted operating profit to
SKr483m from SKr284m, due to better market conditions and higher capacity
utilisation. Foreign units improved, but were dragged down by the French
operations where losses almost halved to SKr75m from SKr142m.
All the group's divisions improved their operating performance, although
MoDo Paper and MoDo Packaging were still marginally in the red. Iggersund
Paperboard was the biggest contributor, lifting its profit contribution to
SKr174m from SKr104m.
Unitas, the Finnish banking group, yesterday announced an 18 per cent
reduction in operating losses for the first four months to FM358m (Dollars
66m), compared with FM435m in the same 1993 period.
Credit losses rose to FM976m from FM846m reflecting the continuing
difficulties of companies in the Finnish domestic sector.

Kaufhof Holding, the German retailer, yesterday reported 1993 profits of
DM240m (Dollars 145.5m), up 7 per cent from DM222m the year before. The
company also forecast steady earnings for the current year.
Kaufhof is set to take a stake of between 50 and 70 per cent in Horten, a
smaller department store chain. This would increase group turnover to around
DM28bn, comparable to that of Karstadt, Germany's biggest retailer. Final
details of the deal will be announced in about three weeks.
Turnover in the first four months of this year rose 8 per cent, to DM7.6bn.
Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive, predicted retail sales would pick up
throughout the year as Germany pulled out of its worst recession.
The dividend will be raised by DM1.5 to DM13.50 for ordinary shares, and by
the same amount, to DM14.50, for preferential shares.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: BCI share price hit by L2,362bn
issue plans
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW HILL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana, the recently-privatised Italian bank,
fell by 4.4 per cent yesterday on news that the bank wants to raise up to
L2,362bn (Dollars 1.5bn) through an issue of new shares and warrants.
Although the proposal will not be approved by the bank's directors until
June 1, the company decided to make a statement late on Wednesday because of
increasing market speculation about an increase in capital.
According to the statement, the board will also consider plans to seek
shareholder authorisation for further capital increases of up to L2,000bn
over the next five years, through the issue of bonds.
BCI yesterday declined to comment on the reasons for the planned capital
increases, but some of the funds could be used to help strengthen
cross-shareholdings with other European banks.
Earlier this week, the Italian bank announced it was negotiating to buy a 1
per cent stake in Commerzbank of Germany, which already has a stake in BCI
and a seat on the board.
BCI is also part of the consortium which yesterday proposed buying a large
stake in Creditanstalt of Austria. Creditanstalt is represented on the board
of BCI and has been a shareholder since the Italian bank's foundation last
century.
Yesterday, BCI shares fell from L5,341 to L5,105. If the plan is approved,
BCI will issue 525m new shares on the basis of one new share for each pair
already held, at a price of L3,000 a share. A further 262.5m shares will be
issued for the exercise of warrants, convertible into shares at the same
price.
BCI was controlled by IRI, the Italian state holding company, until its
privatisation in March. Since then, Mr Romano Prodi, IRI chairman, has
expressed his disappointment that a few large institutions gained control of
both BCI and Credito Italiano, the other newly-privatised bank.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Statoil valued at up to NKr80bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has been valued at between NKr72bn
and NKr80bn (Dollars 10.1bn-Dollars 11.2bn) by an independent assessment.
The appraisal, commissioned by the government from Goldman Sachs
International, the US investment bank, and Fiba Nordic Securities, a
domestic firm, was designed to assess the group's value and relative
performance within the global petroleum industry.
The valuation could be seen as part of the process in the lead-up to a
part-privatisation of the state-owned group, although the controversial
issue is not on Norway's political agenda.
Should Statoil be privatised, it is widely-expected that the government
would base the move on that of the ownership structure of Norsk Hydro,
Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, in which the state holds a 51 per
cent interest.
Fiba valued Statoil at NKr80bn, or 17 times expected 1995 earnings and three
times book value. Goldman Sachs, which valued the oil group at between
NKr72bn and NKr78bn, ranks it, outside government control, as the seventh
largest independent oil company in the world.
The US bank put Statoil's market capitalisation at between Dollars 5bn and
Dollars 15bn, ranking it as a mid-tier oil company among the top 15 to 20 in
the world, close to the size of Phillips Petroleum, the US group.
In terms of independent oil groups, Statoil's size is closest to that of
Enterprise Oil in the UK, according to Goldman Sachs. Enterprise, however,
has a rising production profile while Statoil's is declining.
Goldman Sachs forecast Statoil's 1994 operating profit at NKr12.43bn,
unchanged from 1993.

FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian consortium bids for
Creditanstalt stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle to privatise Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest
bank, moved into a decisive phase yesterday as a consortium of leading
Austrian financial and industrial companies offered Sch7.2bn (Dollars 622m)
for just over half of the government's 70 per cent voting stake in the bank.
The consortium came together in recent weeks to counter a bid by the Swiss
CS Holding financial group that had the apparent support of Mr Ferdinand
Lacina, the Socialist finance minister.
Mr Lacina has argued that Creditanstalt needs a strong strategic partner.
But politicians and business leaders close to the conservative Austrian
People's Party have reacted angrily to the prospect that the bank that once
bestrode an empire fall into foreign hands.
Mrs Maria Schaumayer, the widely-respected president of the Austrian
National Bank, said in an interview last week that Creditanstalt 'must sail
under the Austrian flag, not the Swiss one'.
The consortium is led by EA-Generali, the insurance group and First
Austrian, a large Vienna savings bank, and includes 18 blue chip industrial
companies, such as Brau-Union, Porsche, Radex, Swarovski and Constantia, as
well as some unidentified private individuals.
The consortium immediately nailed its nationalist colours to the mast,
stating that the presence of several domestic companies 'would guarantee an
essentially Austrian underpinning for the bank's further development'.
It argued that in the light of the increasing openness of the Austrian
economy and the country's plan to join the European Union, 'the presence of
an Austrian bank in the whole of Europe, both in the EU and in eastern
Europe, is necessary'.
The consortium would buy more than half of the government's Creditanstalt
shares at the current market price of about Sch675, and would undertake to
place the rest in financial markets 'as soon as possible'.
Socialists snicker that the 'so-called Austrian consortium' contains several
non-Austrian owned companies, including Generali and Banca Commerciale
Italiana of Italy and the Austrian subsidiary of Siemens and Commerzbank of
Germany.
Terms of the CS offer have not been revealed, but Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of
the group built around Credit Suisse, said in an interview with an Austrian
magazine last week that CS would buy a 20 to 30 per cent stake as a first
step and insist on first refusal on further sales of the finance ministry's
holding. Ideally, Mr Gut said, CS would ultimately want to hold 100 per
cent.
He said Creditanstalt under CS control would retain its own identity but
follow CS strategies. It would also benefit from CS strength in
international financial markets.

provisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant Retail Group announced losses before tax of Pounds 4.83m in the
year ended April 2, after the expected Pounds 3.5m provision for redundancy
costs and stock and equipment write-downs at the Normans food subsidiary.
Mr Eric Kinder, chairman of the retailing group, said the food division had
been through its most difficult year ever. Sales fell by Pounds 5m to Pounds
127m.
Group sales, excluding VAT, declined to Pounds 167.1m, against Pounds 169.7m
when there were pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m.
A valuation of group properties has, as foreshadowed, resulted in a fall by
Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 32.2m.
Gearing rose to 69 per cent at the year end, excluding charge card debt of
Pounds 4.76m.
Losses per share were 6.91p (0.84p). As distributable reserves have now been
eliminated it is not possible to pay a dividend. A total of 0.95p was paid
in the previous year.

ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computing services company, yesterday
continued its programme of disposals with the sale of its computer
maintenance and systems integration arms.
The disposal marks ACT's final retreat from any involvement in the computer
hardware business, following the sale of its Apricot workstation business to
Mitsubishi of Japan three years ago.
ACT Computer Support and ACT Network Si, have been sold for Pounds 14.5m
cash, implying an exit p/e of about 7, to a new company involving the
management of Computer Support together with NatWest Ventures Investments
and Phildrew Ventures Third Fund.
The two companies made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3.5m in the year to
March 31, but operating profitability has been falling sharply. Assuming
current interest rates, earnings this year will be diluted by about 1p a
share, ACT said.
The new company will be called Network Si Group and will be run by Mr Simon
Hunt, chairman, and Mr William Bayly, recruited from Cray Communications.

deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HunterPrint, the specialist printing group, reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 1.42m for the half year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds
330,000.
The preference share dividend is again being omitted because of the negative
revenue reserve.
The company said there had been unexpected cost overruns in the first
quarter associated with the launch of five new titles and the bedding down
of three new presses.
A cost reduction programme had been introduced in the second quarter.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 26.1m and net interest charges
rose to Pounds 767,000 (Pounds 579,000).
Retained losses amounted to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 295,000 profits) and losses
per share were 2.6p (0.76p earnings).
The company said its current trading profile would in future reduce the
group's reliance on the first quarter.

Martin Currie European Investment Trust reported a 38.1 per cent increase in

Mr Andrew Cohen, Betterware's chief executive, saw his total remuneration
drop from Pounds 354,171 to Pounds 190,942 in the year to February 28.
The 46 per cent reduction mainly reflected a sharp cut in performance
related pay which fell from Pounds 124,300 to Pounds 16,408. Performance
related pay is based on the earnings performance of the company.
Mr Cohen's basic pay and benefits increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 143,459

Despite a fall at the interim stage, Cranswick, the integrated supplier of
grain, feed, livestock and meat products, reported record pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.33m for the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 2.2m.
Mr Jim Bloom, chairman, said the current year had also started well with

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin rises 14% - Second half
recovery cheers market but company remains cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Macdonald Martin Distilleries, best known for Glenmorangie single malt
whisky, staged a smart recovery in its second half, helped by a strong
performance in international markets.
After recording a 20 per cent decline in profits before tax at the interim
stage, the Edinburgh-based group rallied to show a net 14 per cent
improvement, from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.97m, during the 12 months to
March 31.
The A shares rose by 35p to 480p.
Despite the improvement, Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director, remained
circumspect on prospects: 'We are expecting another tough, difficult year
with surplus stocks and no improvement in prices.' He was hopeful, however,
of further growth in the malt market.
Overseas sales of Glenmorangie increased by 30 per cent in value last year,
with North America and northern Europe showing good growth. The smaller Glen
Moray brand also improved in most European markets and in the UK duty-free
sector.
Sales of blended products were particularly strong during the fourth
quarter, with the US and Venezuela performing well, he added.
Increased bulk contract sales made a sizeable contribution to a 22 per cent
expansion in group turnover, up from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 29.5m, albeit at
reduced margins. The effect at the pre-tax line, however, was offset by a
Pounds 632,000 write-off for unutilised capacity, reflecting continuing
lower production levels at the malt distilleries.
Capacity was running at 44 per cent, but should improve to 66 per cent
during the current year, Mr McKerrow said.
Crabbie's, the green ginger wine brand acquired in October from United
Distillers for some Pounds 2.1m, increased sales by 6 per cent in a stable
market and made a small contribution to profits.
The year finished with reduced gearing of 27 per cent, down from 30 per cent
at end-March 1993.
Helped by a more normal tax charge, earnings per A share improved by 20 per
cent to 24.47p (20.38p). The total distribution goes up 10 per cent, from
8.8p to 9.68p, via a proposed final of 7.414p.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brewin Dolphin to float with Pounds 31m tag
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brewin Dolphin, one of the UK's largest private client stockbrokers, will be
valued at Pounds 30.9m when it joins the stock market next month.
Mr John Hall, managing director, said the placing price of 150p had been cut
by 10 per cent over the past couple of weeks reflecting the fall in share
prices and the difficult new issues market.
The placing price represents nine times earnings in the year to December 10,
before exceptional costs, while the notional yield is 4.8 per cent. Shares
in the closest comparable quoted company, BWD Securities, trade on an
historic multiple of 10.5 with a yield of 4.3 per cent.
The placing will raise Pounds 5.7m net for the company, most of which will
be used to repay borrowings outstanding from the management buy-out in 1992
and the acquisition of Bell Lawrie last year.
The flotation comprises a placing of 7.28m shares by Charterhouse of which
some 2m are being placed with Brewin Dolphin's own private clients.
Employees are retaining over 85 per cent of their existing shareholdings and
will own 58.9 per cent of the enlarged equity.
Dealings start on June 9.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise shareholders support bid for
Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversial strategy of Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive
of Enterprise Oil, was vindicated by shareholders yesterday as they voted
overwhelmingly in support of his Pounds 1.3bn hostile bid for Lasmo, the
rival oil explorer, at an extraordinary meeting in London.
Mr Hearne, who has been criticised over the logic of the all-paper bid and
accused of megalomania, departed from his prepared text to thank investors
after the vote. 'It is nice to know our shareholders are behind us,' he
said.
Enterprise arrived at the meeting armed with proxies representing
substantially more than 50 per cent of the total equity base. Of those, 99
per cent had voted in favour of the bid, said Mr Hearne.
Investors made it clear, however, that it was the all-paper bid as it
currently stands which they backed. 'I would hate to see Enterprise stumping
up another 10 per cent in cash,' one private shareholder remarked.
Mr Hearne said he stood by the package on offer, which combines Enterprise A
shares and warrants - although the board would have to retain some
flexibility.
It has been widely speculated that Enterprise would have to revise its offer
to win over Lasmo investors, particularly as its shares have fallen from
445p to yesterday's 401p since the bid was launched.
Enterprise has several options - from introducing some form of cash which
could be unpopular with its own shareholders, to revising the paper offer in
the light of its own weaker price to bring the value of the bid back up to
150p a share.
The EGM lasted less than 30 minutes, with investors choosing to ignore
Lasmo's attempts at calling their company's accounting practices into
question.
Mr Hearne was not content to let the matter lie, however. 'Lasmo is trying
to defend itself by publishing a series of increasingly tall stories
designed to distract share-holders from the issues,' he said.
Enterprise remained convinced that the deal would bring value to both sets
of shareholders.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fenchurch meets expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenchurch, the insurance broker which gained a stock market listing in
November, yesterday reported a decline in pro forma pre-tax profits to
Pounds 3.53m for the six months to March 31, compared with Pounds 3.96m in
the same period last year.
But the group stressed that the result was adversely affected by the
transfer of several important insurance contracts from the first six months
to the second half of the year.
Arguing that profits were up on an underlying basis, it declared an interim
dividend of 2.6p, payable from earnings per share of 6.2p (7.4p).
'Our client base continues to expand both here and overseas, where we have
benefited from a higher profile following our public listing,' said Mr Roger
Earl, chief executive.
'The group's trading remains in line with expectations at the time of
flotation,' added Mr Earl.
Turnover for the six months was Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.7m). However, the
decision to delay the placing of several contacts - mainly relating to
aviation, energy and industrial business - led to the loss of some Pounds
1.4m in turnover, virtually all of which would have fed through to pre-tax
profits, according to the group. Expenses increased by 9.8 per cent.
Mr Earl said that the group had decided to defer the contracts because of
tightness in the London market.
Investment income amounted to Pounds 874,000 (Pounds 911,000). Discontinued
operations generated income of Pounds 356,000 (Pounds 1.29m). Interest
payable amounted to Pounds 52,000 (Pounds 48,000). Losses from discontinued
operations amounted to Pounds 7,000 (Pounds 61,000).

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tunstall ahead to Pounds 3.28m and seeks
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tunstall Group, market leader in emergency communication systems for the
elderly, raised pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 3.28m in the six
months to end-March.
Turnover increased from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 23.3m, including Pounds
658,000 from the Dutch subsidiary acquired last October, which contributed
Pounds 84,000 to profit.
Describing the results as 'extremely good', Mr Michael Dawson, chairman,
said prospects for the full year were encouraging with the order book for
the core business 17 per cent up on the same period last year.
The group, which also makes security systems and has a contract electronics
manufacturing arm, increased direct exports from the UK by 42 per cent to
Pounds 1.7m.
The total overseas contribution to sales eased to Pounds 4.4m, held back by
tough trading conditions in Germany.
The profit also included Pounds 63,000 from associates - distribution
companies in Spain, Norway and Australia where the group sees significant
opportunities for expansion.
Capital expenditure at Pounds 2.6m equalled last year and is expected to
have doubled by the end of 1994.
Mr Dawson said that by the end of 1996 the contract electronics division,
known as Mion, would employ 600 people and contribute Pounds 25m to group
turnover.
The damages case against Anchor Line over the 1988 acquisition of
Tann-Synchronome begins next month. Legal costs, which by the end of March
amounted to Pounds 454,000, have been written off as incurred.
Earnings per share rose from 6.6p to 7p. The interim dividend is raised from
1.25p to 1.35p.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: All-round expansion boosts Alba by 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alba, which earlier this month acquired Goodmans Industries, a rival
consumer electronics group, for some Pounds 3.6m, yesterday reported sharply
higher full year profits,
Pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 7.39m in the year to
March 31 from Pounds 5.05m last time when the outcome was reduced by a net
Pounds 791,000 in provisions and closure losses.
Turnover from continuing operations rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 126.3m
against Pounds 109.9m, when discontinued operations added a further Pounds
3.59m.
Mr John Harris, chairman, said the UK companies showed 'strong and
consistent growth, greatly outperforming the pattern of the consumer
electronics market as a whole'.
He said all the businesses made a positive contribution to operating profits
which increased from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 7.39m.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 351,000 (Pounds 467,000) as net borrowings
fell to Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 9.53m), equivalent to gearing of 35.4 per cent.
Total sales of the group's UK brown goods companies, Alba Radio and Bush
Radio, increased by 16 per cent while the Hinari domestic appliance division
continued its rapid growth, lifting sales by 65 per cent to Pounds 16.5m.
Overseas, Alba France increased sales from FFr118m to FFr121m (Pounds 14.1m)
despite the recession, while the small German operations lifted sales from
DM6.3m to DM11.9m (Pounds 4.7m).
In Hong Kong, Harvard Maritime again made a strong contribution to profits
although sales slipped from HKDollars 220m to HKDollars 200m (Pounds 17.2m)
reflecting the discontinuation of certain low margin businesses.
Earnings per share increased from 8.32p to 12.11p and a final dividend of 4p
is recommended for a total of 5p (4.85p).
The shares closed 3p higher at 180p.
Commenting on the Goodmans acquisition, Mr Harris said the product fit was
good and expressed confidence that it would be possible to improve profit
margins.
'We think we can make it as profitable as the rest of the group,' he said.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Atkins falls Pounds 252,000 into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Atkins Group, the Leicestershire-based hosiery manufacturer, swung from
profits of Pounds 448,000 to losses of Pounds 252,000 pre-tax for the 12
months to April 2.
The directors warned in February that the year-end results would be
substantially lower because of a sharp slowdown in trading during the final
quarter.
They said yesterday that the net costs of terminating the fabric operations,
amounting to Pounds 298,000, were an important factor.
Turnover improved from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 19.1m, with the final three
months generating only 1.5 per cent of growth.
Losses per share emerged at 6.6p (earnings 9.81p). However, the final
dividend is maintained at 4.25p, making an 8.1p (7.85p) total.
Capital expenditure of Pounds 1.16m pushed year-end gearing up from 15 per
cent to 38 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Acatos up 9% despite squeeze on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise of more than 50 per cent in the average price of edible oils over the
last 18 months has put increasing pressure on margins at Acatos &amp; Hutcheson,
the edible oils and fats manufacturing group.
For the six months to April 3 the group achieved a 9 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.59m (Pounds 5.14m) on turnover ahead 17 per cent
at Pounds 123.1m (Pounds 105m).
The bulk of the group's business lies in supplying own brand oils and fats
to UK supermarkets. Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said the insistence of some
of the group's customers that prices should be held 'in the face of
unavoidable cost increases reached a level of unrealism we have not
previously experienced'.
Nevertheless, Acatos had managed to maintain its market share.
Earnings per share rose to 11.4p (10.4p). The interim dividend is lifted to
3.5p (3p).
Last November the group announced that it would be closing its edible oils
refinery at Bootle, Merseyside. Yesterday the group said that the 250-strong
workforce had been guaranteed employment to the end of December, and would
work on dismantling and decommissioning the plant when it shuts later this
year.
Mr Hutcheson said that the full benefit of the closure would not be felt
until the next financial year.
Meanwhile, a planned reconstruction of the shareholding of Acatos Limited in
the company has been put on hold. Acatos Limited is private and owns the
shares previously held by Mr Hutcheson, his family and other parties, which
comprise 37.1 per cent of the ordinary capital.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Archer still affected by problems at
Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems of Lloyd's of London continued to adversely affect the results
of Archer Group Holdings, one of two agencies at the market which have a
full stock exchange listing, writes Richard Lapper.
Archer, which administers 15 syndicates and is the fourth largest managing
agency, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 430,000, compared with a
restated Pounds 550,000, for the six months to March 31.
Profit commission earned by the agency in the 1991 year amounted to Pounds
1.1m (restated Pounds 1.4m) but were not received by the group until after
the end of March.
Lloyd's, which reports its results three years in arrears, earlier this
month announced losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year.
Agency fees - earned during the reporting period - fell to Pounds 1.9m
(Pounds 2.5m). Despite an increase in capacity managed, fees were reduced
from 0.6 per cent to 0.5 per cent of Names' capacity.
Expenses rose to Pounds 4.57m (Pounds 3.77m), while underwriting agency
operating losses amounted to Pounds 491,000 (Pounds 713,000). Insurance
services suffered operating losses of Pounds 64,000 (profit of Pounds
18,000).
Mr Bryan Kellett, chairman, said that prospects for the 1992 and 1993
underwriting years, the results of which Lloyd's will report in the next two
years, were improving.
Losses per share were 1p (1.3p) but the group said it was maintaining the
interim dividend at 0.5p in recognition of improving fortunes.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Interest reins in SW Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South West Water yesterday announced pre-tax profits at the lower end of
expectations as the effects of falling interest rates and hefty capital
expenditure began to take their toll.
The utility reported a marginal Pounds 300,000 improvement in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 93m for the year to March 31. Analysts had been expecting
between Pounds 93.6m and Pounds 98m.
Profits were held back by a Pounds 26m swing in the interest line, as the
company began to draw down cash to pay for its Pounds 200m annual investment
programme. Some Pounds 14m was paid in interest, against a Pounds 12m gain
last time.
Turnover rose by 30 per cent to Pounds 252m (Pounds 194m). A 14 per cent
increase achieved by the utility business masked a 3 per cent decline in
commercial demand.
The shares yesterday fell by 15p to 510p.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said costs had been cut by some Pounds 2m
last year by job losses and production efficiencies.
The programme to upgrade sewage treatment along South West's coastline was
two thirds complete or under way. So far the projects had been finished on
budget and on time.
South West has been the hardest hit by coastal clean-up regulations, due to
its long coastline and relatively sparse population. Consequently it has
been allowed to impose the highest charges of the 10 main companies on its
customers.
Mr Hill refused to comment on the draft price increases, delivered to water
and sewage companies by Ofwat, the industry regulator, last weekend.
In the period under review the non-regulated businesses, acquired since
privatisation for a total investment of Pounds 40m, broke even after
interest.
At the operating level, the businesses contributed Pounds 2.4m, on a jump in
sales from Pounds 10m to Pounds 75m. This reflected in part the inclusion
for a full year of Haul Waste and acquisitions.
The final dividend goes up in line with expectations by 7.5 per cent to
17.1p, for an increased total of 25.5p (23.7p).
Earnings per share were 68.5p (67.9p).
COMMENT
The financial strains on South West are beginning to show, in particular on
dividend and interest cover. The company will be forced to find substantial
cost savings in order to protect the dividend, unless the regulator is
feeling generous. It seems clear that in spite of its respectable track
record in the non-regulated business, substantial returns from these
divisions are some way away. Forecasts are for Pounds 100m this year. If the
compulsion to invest in water is irresistible in spite of the price
uncertainty, then there may be better bets than South West in the
short-term.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Shoprite shares tumble 54p on results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Shoprite fell 54p to 90p yesterday as the discount food retailer
brought forward publication of its interim results from mid-June because
profits for the period were substantially below market expectations.
Although turnover for the six months to May 1 increased by 59 per cent, from
Pounds 66m to Pounds 105m, operating profits fell by 17 per cent from Pounds
2.43m to Pounds 2.02m. That was in spite of 20 new store openings, taking
the chain to 83.
The shortfall in operating profit was offset by a Pounds 1.95m surplus on
the disposal of various assets - principally the sale and leaseback of
property in Scotland - and at the pre-tax level profits advanced by 62 per
cent from Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 2.74m.
The results clearly demonstrated the pain caused in some sections of the
grocery market by increasing price competition since late last year, when
superstore chains Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway began to respond to the
growth in the discount market and price initiatives from Asda and Gateway.
Mr Charles Good, managing director, said Shoprite had been forced to cut
gross margins to maintain its price advantage over competitors, which had
hit the bottom line.
Steps had been taken to reduce costs, and marketing initiatives had been
implemented to promote the group's competitive position.
'We are confident that the second half will show some improvement,' he
added.
He said the price reductions were starting to produce higher volumes, and
Shoprite was negotiating better deals with suppliers. It was pressing ahead
with plans to open a further 30 stores in the second half.
One food retailing analyst suggested the company may have over-reacted and
cut gross margins too far.
'They may have shot themselves in the foot by investing too heavily in
price,' he said. 'I think this is a probably a wobble rather than a
structural thing. But it will take them some time to get their halo back
after this.'
Net interest payable increased from Pounds 949,000 to Pounds 1.24m, but by
mid-July, when further property sales were expected to be completed, overall
indebtedness should be reduced to about Pounds 18m, the company said.
Earnings per share came out at 3.05p (1.91p) and the interim dividend is
held at 0.6p.
Shoprite is changing its year end to bring it into line with the calendar
year, so the results for 1994 will be for a 14-month period.

<TEXT>
A new polyurethane condom is set to take London International Group into the
Pounds 430m-a-year Japanese condom market for the first time.
LIG, the world leader in branded condoms, yesterday announced a joint
venture with Okamoto Industries, which has 56 per cent of the Japanese
market.
Japan, with 3.8m condoms sold annually, is second only to the US in the
world market. But the US market is valued at only Pounds 262m a year, partly
because the Japanese are more prepared to pay for quality.
LIG claimed last year that its new Avanti condoms represented a technical
breakthrough. The polyurethane product, to be known as Duron, is twice as
strong as latex, enabling the manufacture of very thin condoms.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dividing in order to multiply - BSG's
latest purchase and its strategic plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSG International opened a new chapter in its history yesterday when it
split its business into two core divisions, opening the way to the break-up
of the group. It also made a recommended Pounds 20m offer for Jessups, the
vehicle distributor.
The splitting of the group into Britax International, which will hold all
BSG's manufacturing operations, and Bristol Street Motors, which hold the
group's vehicle distribution and servicing businesses, is the upshot of a
strategic review which has been taking place since last autumn.
The offer for Jessups is an immediate step to strengthen Bristol Street
Motors, a move which also springs from the review. 'One follows the other,'
says Mr Richard Marton, BSG chief executive.
The shares fell 5 1/2 p to 69p.
The division of BSG opens up the possibility that either of the halves could
be demerged, floated, made the subject of a reverse takeover or sold. But
there is not likely to be any immediate decision.
'What we are doing does not put a For Sale sign up over any of our core
businesses,' says Mr Marton.
A change of course has been in the offing since last summer. Then Mr Tom
Cannon, who had been managing director and expected to become non-executive
chairman, was eased into retirement.
The growth of BSG from a Birmingham car dealer to a significant components
manufacturer and vehicle distributor with turnover approaching Pounds 600m
is associated with Mr Cannon more than with any other individual.
But the growth had been haphazard; it certainly did not follow any tenets of
strategic planning laid down in a business school. Car mirrors and lights,
sunroofs and seat belts, pushchairs and aircraft lavatories, quite apart
from car dealing and leasing - BSG has them all.
Mr Marton, as Mr Cannon's successor and one-time subordinate, has been
seeking to put order into the diversity, to apply 1990s thinking to the
practice of earlier decades. Any thought that this might be a leisurely
process was dispelled in the last quarter of 1993, when BSG saw its
manufacturing markets sliding away and had to give a profits warning.
But the results of the current review come as trading improves. The board is
optimistic 'that a satisfactory recovery in the group's performance compared
with that in 1993 is under way'. Last year BSG had pre-tax profits of Pounds
10.5m, but suffered a 27 per cent fall in operating profits.
'There are two distinctive operations sitting together, but not very well
together,' says Mr Marton.
He talks frequently of 'critical mass' and the need to create more of it.
BSG is spread widely, but it is spread thinly.
It is active in sectors where there has been considerable realignment. In
the automotive components sector, consolidation has been taking place -
hence the recent takeover of Linread by McKechnie.
Britax now 'is not large enough to be a major player', says Mr Marton. It
nearly has the necessary mass to be that in mirrors, it has some way to go
in lighting and a long way to go in sunroofs. The hope at BSG is that
greater independence will stimulate growth.
On the vehicle side, Bristol Street Motors, with Jessups, will be
'reasonably near' to achieving this critical mass. By adding 12 selling
sites in south-east England to BSG's 24 in the Midlands and the north, BSG
thinks that it will be about sixth in the pecking order of the UK's vehicle
distributors.
But Jessups, which last year had pre-tax losses of Pounds 600,000, is not
coming cheaply. BSG's share offer values its ordinary shares at 140p against
an overnight price of 98p. BSG is offering 15 new shares for every eight
Jessups ordinaries and 110.35p cash for every Jessups preference. There is a
cash alternative of 125.625p for the Jessups ordinaries, but that is
dependent on the ordinary offer becoming unconditional.
So far BSG has received undertakings to accept the offer for 27.5 per cent
of the ordinary share capital and 18.1 per cent of the preference.
Through Morgan Grenfell, BSG is issuing 18.7m new shares, about 6.7 per cent
of its enlarged share capital. To the extent that some of these need to be
sold to meet the cash alternative, Morgan Grenfell is underwriting their
sale at 67p.
The immediate financial effect of the takeover on BSG will be to raise its
gearing to more than 45 per cent, compared with 23 per cent at the end of
1993.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G, the fund management group that stresses the importance of companies
paying high dividends, is increasing its own interim dividend by 30 per cent
to 13p as profits continue to surge.
The move partly reflects the intention to reduce the disparity with the
final payment but the company expects total dividends to rise by at least 12
per cent to 28p.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 rose by 37 per cent to Pounds
31.2m (Pounds 22.8m). Funds under management increased by 13 per cent to
Pounds 14.1bn.
Unit trust sales more than doubled to Pounds 574m (Pounds 232m) and net of
redemptions jumped from just Pounds 4m to Pounds 308m. That represented 12.8
per cent of the industry total.
Unit trust Pep sales almost trebled to Pounds 304m, boosted by the removal
of the initial charge on the Managed Income Fund Pep in January.
Mr Paddy Linaker, who retires as group managing director in July, said he
was pleased with the improvement in marketing following personnel changes.
'Last year we were pleased with the investment performance, but a bit
disappointed with sales.'
Life and pension policies also showed strong growth, with sales of single
premium life policies almost trebling to Pounds 120m and single premium
pension policies up 88 per cent to Pounds 49m.
Revenue from institutional clients rose 19 per cent to Pounds 2.99m,
although higher costs reduced profits to Pounds 784,000 (Pounds 1.1m).
Mr Linaker said the investment performance had held up well until the end of
March and that the group was well positioned with a UK equities portfolio
relatively light of highly-rated large companies.
'The relative outperformance of income, recovery and smaller company stocks
has at least another year to go,' he declared.
Earnings rose to 29.1p (21.5p).

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BTR may sell ADS Anker subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday indicated that it was
considering selling ADS Anker, its German-based subsidiary which specialises
in electronic point of sale systems.
In response to a question at the annual meeting in London yesterday on
whether BTR should dispose of the subsidiary, Mr Robert Faircloth, BTR's
chief operating officer, said:
'It is a course that we are currently exploring but at the same time we are
putting management and diligence into getting the best out of the business
that we can.'
According to Mr Faircloth ADS Anker has sales of under Pounds 100m and is
making a small profit.
Mr Norman Ireland, BTR's chairman, said the company's confident view for the
current financial year, first disclosed in March, had not changed.
'America and Australia continue with strong order positions in most of their
markets while in the UK, orders . . . have continued to improve.'
However, overcapacity in a number of sectors was affecting the company's
ability to improve margins.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Seeking the profitable route
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Patrick Ponsolle says he is attracted by difficult challenges.
His appointment yesterday as co-chairman of Eurotunnel, with the task of
helping to steer it to profit, would appear to fit the bill.
In succeeding Mr Andre Benard, who is stepping down from the position at the
age of 71, Mr Ponsolle does, however, have some cards up his sleeve.
'He is well-connected, has a lot of financial experience and is very
ambitious', says a former colleague from Cie de Suez, where Mr Ponsolle, 49,
has spent much of his career.
The first two attributes are largely the result of his time at Suez, the
powerful industrial and financial group where Mr Ponsolle rose to the
position of managing director. But they also reflect a stint in government
administration.
After graduating from the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the
training ground for many of France's top civil servants, he worked in the
economics ministry, serving as an aide to Mr Laurent Fabius, the socialist
budget minister who later became prime minister.
'He is a quintessential product of the French financial establishment', says
one French banker - referring to Mr Ponsolle's track record.
This, along with his connections, is likely to prove an asset in the
financial and commercial negotiations with which he will now be faced. 'It
will be much harder for French banks and institutions to say no to Ponsolle
than to Benard, who was a relative outsider', says one member of the
underwriting syndicate for Eurotunnel's rights issue.
If Mr Ponsolle is widely known, however, he is also widely known for being
ambitious - a factor which helps explain his departure from Suez. One of the
favourites to replace Mr Renaud de la Geniere as chairman of the financial
group in 1990, the appointment of Mr Gerard Worms blocked Mr Ponsolle's path
to the top job. 'He had hoped for the big prize and it is no surprise that
he has looked somewhere else', says one former colleague.
In his new job, which will start in July, Mr Ponsolle says he will work
alongside Sir Alastair Morton, the British co-chairman, and Mr Georges
Christian Chazot, the managing director. 'We will form a trio, sans
problemes', he forecast yesterday.
He has few illusions, however, about the task that awaits him. 'The first
steps have been taken, but there is a lot of hard work to do.' If he
succeeds, he will be fulfilling the ambitions of his former employer.
After the nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1957, Mr Jacques
George-Picot, then head of Suez, declared his determination to build a
tunnel under the channel. Mr Ponsolle inherits a tunnel, he must now make it
pay.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House in the black but gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 13.4m interim pre-tax profit reported by Trafalgar House
yesterday represented the group's first since 1990.
Over-shadowing the results were warnings from both Mr Simon Keswick,
chairman, and Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive. Mr Gormly in particular
cautioned that the recovery would be 'slow and steady, rather than
spectacular'.
Operating profits in the six months were Pounds 25.3m, against Pounds 80.8m
losses when the property operations showed a deficit of Pounds 102.8m.
The engineering business reported lower profits.
Mr Gormly said the recession had particularly affected the group's business
in Europe and the downturn in North Sea work had been rather deeper than
expected. The division managed to maintain its order book at Pounds 2.2bn.
Mr Gormly said further job cuts would be necessary.
Operating profits in the construction division were ahead at Pounds 4.4m
(Pounds 1.1m) on flat turnover of Pounds 378.3m. The overall order book was
maintained at Pounds 1.2bn.
The property division showed operating profits of Pounds 4.2m compared with
a profit of Pounds 200,000 excluding exceptionals in the year-ago period.
COMMENT
Although yesterday's results were lower than most analysts had expected,
what really concerned them was the fact that there seems little prospect of
real improvement for some time. The interim dividend was passed, but this
was for administrative reasons. Similarly, although the group sustained a
cash outflow of Pounds 46m during the first half, this included the
on-balance sheet refinancing of some Pounds 20m of associates' borrowings.
Despite these reassurances analysts were marking down their full year
pre-tax profit forecasts yesterday to about Pounds 50m or Pounds 55m. That
might generate earnings of about 2.2p. Despite yesterday's decline the
shares are still trading on an unjustifiably high multiple close to 40.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Perpetual trebles to Pounds 16.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Perpetual, the unit trust management group, trebled to
Pounds 16.5m for the half year to March 31, compared with Pounds 5.09m.
The company benefited from the good performance of world stock markets in
the last quarter of 1993, accompanied by strong unit trust sales.
Funds under management increased to Pounds 2.87bn, against Pounds 2.03bn,
after an inflow of about Pounds 700m of net new money.
Earnings per share rose from 13.28p to 43.6p, or 39.24p fully diluted, while
the interim dividend is 10p (1.8p) - the total for the full year to
September 1993 was 15p.
'With increased funds under management, fees in the second half will, in the
absence of a serious setback, be significantly higher than in the first
half', said Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman.
Marketing expenditure was increased during the half year, in order to
increase market share, but Mr Arbib said that no further rise in marketing
expenditure was planned. Although this might lead to a downturn in sales
volume, it should be possible to match the first half results in the second
period, he said.
The company, based in Henley-on-Thames, is considering acquiring larger
offices to give space for further development.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse tops Pounds 62m and plans to
expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Storehouse, the fast-recovering owner of the BHS and Mothercare retail
chains, said yesterday it was increasing its spending to expand selling
space, as it reported a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
62.4m.
The figures for the 53 weeks to April 2 compared with Pounds 15.2m last
year, although that was after exceptional losses on disposals of Pounds
31.4m. This year's figure was depressed by an exceptional provision of
Pounds 6.4m against non-repayment of loan notes in connection with the sale
of a US business.
Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits increased 48 per cent from Pounds
46.6m to Pounds 68.8m. However, the shares slipped 3p to 212p.
Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive, said the economy was 'steadily improving'
and current sales were broadly in line with the trend of the past six
months.
He added that priorities now were to increase trading space at both BHS and
Mothercare. The group had identified 60 target locations for BHS on top of
its current 123 stores, and planned three openings this year in Telford,
Rochdale and Cambridge.
The group was also converting 'fallow' space in existing stores into extra
selling space.
At Mothercare, the new format designed to appeal to young children would be
extended from 20 stores to 75 by the year-end.
Capital spending would rise from Pounds 46m to about Pounds 60m.
Another task was to improve supply chain management, and reduce surplus
stock and costs. The group was looking at integrating more closely
distribution at Mothercare and BHS.
Mr Edelman said other priorities were to improve brand awareness and
loyalty, and to restore stability after the reshaping of the group in recent
years.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds 1.05bn, although the figure
for 1993 included Pounds 172m from discontinued businesses. The group
operating margin rose from 5 to 6.4 per cent, in spite of a 1 per cent fall
in gross margins reflecting increased markdowns and discounts at BHS, and
price repositioning at Mothercare.
Sales at BHS increased from Pounds 696m to Pounds 749m, and operating
profits from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 56.2m.
At Mothercare, sales grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 282m, and operating
profit doubled from Pounds 5m to Pounds 10.2m.
Earnings per share increased from 0.1p to 9.7p and a proposed final dividend
of 3p gives a total of 5.5p (5p).

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Argent share price set at 255p for value of
Pounds 140m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argent Group, the property investor and developer, yesterday set its
flotation price at 255p per share, valuing the company at Pounds 140m.
It is offering 13.7m shares through a placing and intermediaries offer,
which represents a discount of 5.2 per cent to its adjusted net asset value.
Argent is raising Pounds 27.1m net, which will be used to fund investments
and developments, although it will initially be to cut debt.
Under the offer, 11.57m shares are being issued and 2.16m shares are being
sold by Warburg Pincus. After the offer, Warburg Pincus will be left with
27.3m shares, representing about 49.8 per cent of the company. The
management team is not selling any shares in the offer.
COMMENT
Argent has a lot to live up to. In a market jaded by the glut of property
companies attempting flotations, Argent's launch stands out because of the
plaudits heaped on its management team, who have a won a reputation for
skilful timing over the past five years. The shares have been keenly priced
and, in a weak market, could fall to a discount when dealings start. In the
short term, asset growth could be held back by the demanding valuations
placed on its properties. However, for long-term investors looking for
capital growth, rather than income, Argent could be one to back.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at McLeod Russel Holdings advanced 10 per cent, from Pounds
1.91m to Pounds 2.11m, in the six months to March 31. Mr Nigel Openshaw,
chairman, said the benefits of reorganising Wheway, acquired in March last
year, were beginning to show.
He added that further improvement from the Wheway companies could be
expected in the second half in addition to the seasonal bias towards the
period.
Turnover for the group, which has interests in surface coatings,
environmental engineering and property investment, more than doubled to
Pounds 55.1m (Pounds 21.5m). Operating profit rose 86 per cent to Pounds
2.79m (Pounds 1.5m) but the pre-tax figure was held back by net interest
costs of Pounds 708,000 against income of Pounds 326,000.
Group earnings per share were lower at 2.81p, against 3.01p, as a result of
shares issued for Wheway. However, the interim dividend is maintained at
2.75p.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Support likely from French investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Christian Cambier, the French head of the association for Eurotunnel
shareholders, expresses resignation on the subject of yesterday's rights
issue. 'We have no choice', he said when asked if individual shareholders
would subscribe to the proposed capital increase.
Mr Cambier, who represents an estimated 1,500 of Eurotunnel's 600,000
shareholders, expressed dismay at the decline in the company's share price
but said that investors in the company were 'a special breed'. The French,
in particular, he claimed, 'have a faith in this kind of grand project. They
have stuck with it and they believe it it will succeed'.
The attitude of Mr Cambier and his compatriots is critical. French investors
hold more than 60 per cent of the shares in Eurotunnel, the majority, like
in Britain, dispersed among individuals. In responding to the rights,
however, their faith will put to the test.
Like their British counterparts, the French underwriters had privately
expressed concerns about the capital increase. 'There was some tough talking
but we think the terms are acceptable and we are quite confident that
investors will respond.'
In the event, a group of French heavyweights have been signed up for the
underwriting. Headed by Banque Indosuez, the lead managers include the
recently privatised Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-owned Credit
Lyonnais and the French arm of SBC. The co-lead managers include Credit
Agricole, Banque Paribas, and the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the
state financing institution which is one of Eurotunnel's largest investors
with about 2 per cent.
Many of their target institutional investors appear ready to grin and bear
the burden of the issue. 'They will face a lot of pressure to support the
issue, including from the French government', said one broker.
He believed that shareholders such as the recently privatised Union des
Assurances de Paris would throw their weight behind the capital increase.
'There is a lot of political capital at stake in this project. I think the
bigger investors, like some of the underwriters, will have been made aware
of this.'
One insurance company said it would be looking at the prospectus very
carefully. 'It may be cheaper to reduce our stake now than later', he said.
What is already clear is that a bumpy and uncertain ride is in prospect.
With so many small shareholders it is hard to predict the outcome. 'The fact
that the value of the shares has fallen so far from the peak in 1989 will
provoke a lot of resentment. There is also a feeling that underwriters have
added to the downward pressure on the shares to increase their returns. But
if shareholders have stuck with it this long, they may see little point in
bailing out now,' argued one analyst.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Completed rights means final hurdle cleared
 -Eurotunnel financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a fortnight before the Queen, Mr John Major and President
Mitterand took the 'inaugural' train ride on May 6 through the Channel
tunnel, a group of leading fund managers and corporate bankers took the
first outsiders' ride.
The fact that the City beat the state through one of the modern world's
greater engineering feats, speaks volumes for the predicament in which
Eurotunnel had found itself.
With its money due to run out in June, it was faced with the logistics of
securing increased loans from a syndicate of 220 banks, and getting support
for a rights issue without having any loyal institutional shareholders.
Surprisingly, the Pounds 858m rights issue went through with little
difficulty, and no evidence of the arm twisting that institutions had
expected from the issue's broker, SG Warburg.
The underwriting group - with UK institutions covering one half of the
transaction and French the other - took all night to complete the agreement,
but once pricing was agreed by the Eurotunnel board at 5pm last night,
success was assured.
The lead-up was not so smooth. The UK stock market had gone against
Eurotunnel from the start. And on Wednesday, when the deal was finalised, it
hit its low point of the year.
Word of Eurotunnel's difficulty in securing bank finance had spread,
creating nervousness among underwriters and potential sub-underwriters, and
encouraging a decline in the share price.
In addition, cynicism remained over the company's financial projections.
This meant that the leading institutions, which would be expected to back
such a stock, were uninvested, and unexcited - more than 60 per cent is held
by French, mainly retail, investors.
In the circumstances, institutions had a professional incentive in talking
down the price of the rights, to make it more attractive. They succeeded.
Eurotunnel had started with a broad spread on pricing, stretching down to a
minimum of 250p, because the company was only mandated to issue 340m new
shares, and it needed to raise Pounds 850m.
By Wednesday, Eurotunnel's expectations had been forced downwards, and the
board was faced with a range from 260p to 275p, and variations on the number
of shares to be issued. Underwriters were satisfied with the decision of
265p.
The UK tranche was led by Morgan Grenfell and the French by Banque Indosuez,
and Swiss Bank took 25 per cent of the underwriting on both tranches.
The format of the syndicates remained unchanged in the final stages and the
underwriting agreement was completed at 6am. The sub-underwriting went
through relatively easily yesterday morning, as the shares recovered from an
initial 20p drop.
Overall, the financial community has cause for celebration. Of the Pounds
858m raised from the rights, an astonishing Pounds 42m, or 5 per cent, has
gone on fees, to cover 2 years of financial advice, more than Pounds 1m for
the lawyers, and the usual underwriting fees.
Meanwhile, Eurotunnel can celebrate having overcome what it claims to be the
final financial hurdle in its struggle to profitability.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Trafalgar omits interim dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
Shares in Trafalgar House fell by almost 10 per cent yesterday after the
UK-based group reported lower than expected interim profits and said margins
would stay under severe pressure in its core engineering business.
Trafalgar's shares closed 9p lower at 86p although the group, whose
interests range from engineering, construction and property to London's Ritz
Hotel and the Cunard liners, reported that it had moved back into profit. It
omitted the interim dividend.
The group posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.4m in the six months to March
31, compared with a Pounds 98.6m loss a year ago when the group made
substantial write-downs in the value of its property portfolio. Turnover was
almost unchanged at Pounds 1.78bn.
Operating profits in the engineering division fell to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds
18.1m) on turnover which slipped to Pounds 1.09bn (Pounds 1.13bn).
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'Economic conditions throughout the world,
whilst slowly improving, remain very competitive, particularly in the
engineering and construction industries, and we do not expect any
significant change in the near term.'
Mr Keswick, also chairman of Hongkong Land Holdings, which holds a 25.3 per
cent stake in Trafalgar, added: 'Against this background we are continuing
our efforts to improve the underlying competitive positions of our
businesses. Achieving a return to profit in the half year, albeit a modest
one, is a first step, following the reconstruction of the group's finances.'
Earnings per share were 0.4p, compared with a loss of 18.2p.

FT  27 MAY 94 / C&amp;W up 19% and launching push into China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, claims to be on the
verge of a breakthrough in its bid to enter the Chinese telecoms services
market.
At yesterday's results meeting Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, said the company
had been designated 'preferred partner' by China's ministry of post and
telecommunications for any joint ventures with overseas companies.
Lord Young said the first ventures could be agreed this year. C&amp;W is using
its 57 per cent stake in Hong Kong Telecom, its largest operation, as a
launch pad for China.
The group announced a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.09bn for the year to March 31. Before an exceptional gain a year-earlier,
pre-tax profits were up 32 per cent, but the weakness of sterling accounted
for about Pounds 95m of the advance.
Lord Young said China was C&amp;W's priority, with the company ready to increase
its gearing sharply from a year-end 12 per cent - on net debt of nearly
Pounds 400m - if suitable opportunities arose. China's target for the year
2000 is to increase its number of phone lines from 40m to 114m - more than
four times the number of lines in the UK.
The most likely openings are expected to be for city-wide or regional
projects, in which C&amp;W would operate with other partners, local and
international.
Lord Young said: 'We believe a gradual relaxation of investment rules will
soon take place.' He and Mr Linus Cheung, chief executive of Hongkong
Telecom, held talks in Beijing in March with telecoms officials and Mr Jiang
Zemin, China's president.
At Pounds 4.7bn, C&amp;W's annual turnover rose 23 per cent. Earnings per share
were 23.6p, against 23.7p (19.4p before exceptionals). A final dividend of
5.65p lifts the total 11 per cent to 8.25p (7.42p).
C&amp;W experienced strong growth in all its main divisions, with turnover up 26
per cent at Hongkong Telecom, to Pounds 2.08bn, up 21 per cent, to Pounds
1.47bn, at Mercury Communications in the UK - in which C&amp;W has an 80 per
cent stake - and 29 per cent up in the Caribbean region, to Pounds 477m.
In the UK, Mercury's traffic grew by 37 per cent on last year. The operator
now has 886,000 residential lines, up from 474,000 a year ago. It claims a
UK market share of nearly 14 per cent, with a 25 per cent share of the large
business market.
Mercury One-2-One, the UK cellular mobile joint venture with US West, now
has nearly 100,000 customers - about 15 per cent of the market within the
M25. C&amp;W blamed slow growth earlier in the year on handset shortages.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said Mercury was held back by
regulatory inequities and the obligation to pay BT a levy for maintaining
the local network. Mercury has taken Oftel, the industry regulator, to court
in a bid to gain a more favourable regulatory regime.
Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, stressed the group's federal strategy.
Despite the poor profitability of Mercury in comparison to C&amp;W's Hong Kong
and Caribbean ventures, he said Europe remained an 'important centre'. 'To
be a serious international operator we must have a strong European
presence.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Ifil plans issue to pay for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ifil, the Italian industrial holding company indirectly controlled by the
Agnelli family, is to raise at least L800bn (Pounds 334m) with a complex
share and bond issue to fund expansion in the retailing and agro-food
busi-ness.
Ifil's board also approved yesterday an investment of about L400bn in
convertible bonds, which will give the holding company a 10-year option to
buy a controlling stake in Unicem, the Agnellis' cement business.
The 50.4 per cent stake currently belongs to Ifil's parent company Ifi, and
the operation prepares the way for a reshuffling of Agnelli interests which
would leave Ifil with most of the family's main industrial activities,
except Fiat, the automotive group.
Mr Umberto Agnelli, chairman of Ifil and deputy chairman and chief executive
of Ifi, said yesterday that the operation had a dual purpose: 'On the one
hand it confirms our interest in development opportunities in our own
country, on the other it accelerates the clarification of the holding
companies' role.'
He added that Ifi would remain the financial holding company, with a 'direct
and indirect institutional presence' in Fiat.
Ifil's holdings include a stake in Gruppo Rinascente, the Italian stores
chain, which is one of the potential buyers of Italy's state-owned retailing
and restaurant interests.
The group's consolidated net profits rose to L231.2bn from L192.8bn in 1993,
the company announced yesterday.

FT  27 MAY 94 / TeleWest set to postpone float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest, the largest cable television operator in the UK, is expected to
announce today that it intends to postpone a flotation that would have
valued the company at Pounds 1.7bn.
The expected decision to postpone will be blamed on deteriorating market
conditions.
The TeleWest reassessment came as General Cable, one of the largest UK cable
communications groups, yesterday became the second cable company on
consecutive days to postpone flotation plans.
The company, a subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, said it had
decided to defer its proposed London listing 'in the light of market
conditions'.
Telewest, a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest cable operator
in the US, and US West, the American telephone company, would only say last
night it was assessing its options with advisers Goldman Sachs and Kleinwort
Benson.
The decision by TeleWest, which was planning a listing on the London Stock
Exchange and a registration of American depository shares on Nasdaq, will
have considerable influence on other cable companies planning to come to
market.
As recently as Wednesday Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive,
suggested the float would go ahead.
On Wednesday, Comcast UK Partners which was planning to raise funds through
a secondary share issue in the US, postponed the sale because of poor
conditions in the market.
Comcast UK, part of Comcast the Philadelphia-based cable communications
company, had planned to sell 11.75m shares for up to Dollars 18 each. When
investors showed little interest at a floor level of Dollars 14 a share, the
offering was postponed.
General Cable holds cable franchises in the UK covering some 1.6m homes in
areas including Windsor in Berkshire, Hillingdon and Hounslow in west
London, and Birmingham, one of the most successful franchises in the UK.
General Cable said yesterday that it remained committed 'to providing an
opportunity for UK and international investors to participate in the
development of the UK cable industry'. It would list in the UK and
internationally when market conditions were favourable.

FT  27 MAY 94 / S&amp;N sells 450 pubs for Pounds 108m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, has sold 450 former
Chef &amp; Brewer pubs for Pounds 108m.
The pubs have been bought by a private company created by Mr Michael Cannon,
the former chairman of JA Devenish, the pub group which was bought by
Greenalls last year for Pounds 214m.
Mr Cannon's new vehicle, the Magic Pub Company, has sold on 168 of the pubs
for about Pounds 30m to Labatt, the Canadian brewing group which has been
expanding in the UK. Labatt now has 526 pubs, making it the UK's fourth
largest independent pub retailer.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle gave an undertaking to sell 450 pubs from the
1,650-strong Chef &amp; Brewer chain when it purchased them from Grand
Metropolitan in November. It still must sell a further 700 pubs within a
year to get below the 2,000 ceiling set by the government's 1989 Beer Order.
Mr Cannon acquired a half-interest in a Bristol pub for Pounds 30,000 in
1974. He went on to float Inn Leisure on the USM in 1982. In 1986 Inn
Leisure's 40 outlets merged with Devenish's 314, and Mr Cannon became
chairman and chief executive of the full group the following year.
Mr Cannon, 52, whose family's stake in Devenish was worth Pounds 26m at the
time of last summer's takeover, said his wife had thought he was going to
retire - but he could not resist this opportunity.
He said: 'This deal creates at a stroke a major new independent force in the
highly-rated free trade pub sector. Over the next few years we will make a
sizeable investment in refurbishing and upgrading the estate and believe we
can enhance its performance significantly.'
Mr Michael Izza, managing director of Labatt UK's retailing said: 'Part of
our plan for growth is to buy pubs in order to own our retail distribution.
We intend to carefully expand our pub retailing interests as quality
locations become available.'
Labatt brands are distributed in more than 10,000 UK pubs and its Canadian
lager is one of the top 10 lager brands.
Mr Cannon and his team were advised by Flemings. The Pounds 100m financing
package includes Pounds 57m of senior debt underwritten by Flemings and
Lloyds Bank. The equity came from management themselves and a Pounds 23m
syndicate led by CINVen.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Divergent traffic forecasts highlight uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traffic forecasting is an uncertain business: yesterday's announcement from
Eurotunnel included not one but three forecasts of passenger and freight
volumes.
The projections come from Eurotunnel, its consultants and the railways, BR
and SNCF. Not surprisingly Eurotunnel's numbers are the most optimistic,
only slightly for passengers but more substantially for freight.
Eurotunnel is now carrying daily about 100 trucks each way through the
tunnel on its freight shuttles. The initial response from lorry drivers has
been positive, and they react far more rapidly to a new service than the
leisure traveller. But with just one week of freight operations behind it,
Eurotunnel is still largely dependent on its traffic forecasts.
The underlying prospects are good. The cross-Channel market for both
passengers and freight has been growing strongly since the mid-1980s,
passenger traffic by 4 per cent a year and roll-on roll-off freight traffic
by more than 7 per cent. Both Eurotunnel and its consultants, TRC, expect
this growth to continue.
It is in the detail that the forecasts differ. Eurotunnel believes it will
take two years to build up to its projected 40 per cent share of the roll-on
roll-off freight market while TRC expects it to take three years.
Eurotunnel's estimates of freight and passenger revenues, Pounds 120m this
year rising to Pounds 737m in 1996, are between 5 and 7 per cent higher than
TRC's.
The railways, which will run passenger and freight trains through the
tunnel, are in rough agreement with Eurotunnel on its passenger forecasts
but Railfreight Distribution, BR's freight arm, makes a lower freight
forecast.
Eurotunnel claims to be closer to the market than TRC as it actually talks
to the freight companies. However, it may not be without significance that
Eurotunnel and railways are still in dispute over the railways' failure to
provide upgraded high-speed lines and new rolling stock on time.
Do the forecasting differences matter? Christopher Garnett, Eurotunnel's
commercial director, believes that the disparity between the projections
will make a difference of 'millions rather tens of millions of pounds'.
Graham Corbett, finance director, said that there was a 17 per cent margin
built into revenue projections before funding problems would arise.
It is also true that independent forecasts of traffic growth have generally
been too low. Analysts yesterday were taking a cautious view. One said that
even if Eurotunnel met its most optimistic projections, it would still have
trouble paying off its debts.
The great unknown in the debate is the extent to which the tunnel will
create new traffic as opposed to stealing passengers from the ferries and
from other longer Channel and North Sea routes.
A second crucial element in Eurotunnel's financial forecasts is the price of
tickets. The company believes it will not be possible for ferry companies to
maintain their present discount offers.
But the omens are not good. Stena Sealink earlier this week cut its prices
by 20 per cent, just five months after promising it would hold them steady
for the year. If the ferries are launching into such cut throat competition
before the tunnel is properly open, analysts ask, what will happen when it
is providing a full service?

fees as City remains unenthusiastic

Eurotunnel yesterday sealed its long-term future by signing up an Pounds
858.3m rights issue and completing Pounds 693m of bank financing, just weeks
before the company's money was due to run out.
After Pounds 42m of fees to advisers and underwriters - with Morgan
Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg Securities as the main
beneficiaries - the company will receive Pounds 816m.
The three-for-five issue at 265p was pitched 25 per cent below Wednesday's
closing price of 355p, reflecting an unenthusiastic response from the City.
The price fell a further 7p yesterday.
It was the most widely expected rights issue since Eurotunnel's Pounds 566m
call in 1990, when the prospectus said that funds raised would be
'sufficient to complete the project and provide the necessary working
capital'.
The latest issue, the largest in the transport sector and one of the largest
in UK history, had to be preceded by the signing up of Pounds 700m of new
senior debt from a 220-bank syndicate. After breaching two deadlines, the
core banks agreed Pounds 693m in financing on Wednesday. An additional
Pounds 50m has been arranged with a separate syndicate.
Sir Alastair Morton, chairman, said the refinancing was a turning point. 'We
are now open for business, and we are funded through to financial
viability.'
The deal was accompanied by the news that Mr Andre Benard is stepping down
as co-chairman to be replaced by Mr Patrick Ponsolle, a Eurotunnel director
and former managing director of Cie de Suez, the French group.
The primary cause of the latest refinancing was the delay in opening the
tunnel, costing an estimated Pounds 610m in lost revenues. There was a
further Pounds 290m increase in construction costs, and the remaining
capital is required to pay interest on the new debt until Eurotunnel breaks
even - scheduled for 1998.
Under its latest financing - which assumes agreement for the Pounds 50m
additional loan and the exercise of 1993 warrants - Eurotunnel has a Pounds
470m cushion against any shortfall in revenues.
It has also suggested that arbitration over the British and French railway
authorities' failure to install agreed infrastructure could give it 'Pounds
100s of millions'. Once it can demonstrate steady cash flows, it may be able
to refinance its Pounds 8bn of debt on more favourable terms.
Concerns remain over the quality of Eurotunnel's projections, which are
based on unknown quantities, but provide a limited margin for error.
Sir Alastair said: 'It is now possible to perceive a period 18 months from
now, where the operations reach cruising speed. This is when the value will
begin to emerge in the company.'
