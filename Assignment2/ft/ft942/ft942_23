FT  24 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Heavy selling after German rate comments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds fell sharply on wire reports of comments made by
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, which were taken to mean that there
would be no more official German interest rate cuts in the near future.
Although most continental European markets were closed for Whit Monday,
London-traded futures contracts fell steeply - albeit on thin volume. Weaker
US Treasuries put a further damper on European bond markets.
According to one news agency, Tietmeyer told a press conference in Helsinki
that 'we are not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the time
being'. He was also reported as saying that signs are increasing that the
western German recession has come to an end and the economic recovery has
begun.
This triggered heavy London selling across the German yield curve. At the
short end, the March three-money interest rate future slid by 0.30 point to
94.51, implying three-month rates of 5.49 per cent by mid-March, well above
the current 5.13 per cent three-month D-Mark deposit rate. At the long end,
the June Bund future fell by 0.96 point to 94.50.
'The short end has overreacted,' said Mr John Hall, European economist at
Swiss Bank Corp. 'Even if official rates are not cut soon, this still leaves
room for the repo rate to fall.' That currently stands at 5.23 per cent,
still well above the 4.5 per cent discount rate which acts as a floor to
money market rates.
He still expects another discount rate cut, but even if that does not
happen, the Bundesbank 'can still lower the repo rate to around 4.75 per
cent' before the end of the cycle.
All eyes are now on tomorrow's repo allocation. 'People will watch it for an
indication of where German monetary policy is going,' said Mr Torsten
Bohler, bond analyst at UBS. A small cut could reinforce fears that the
easing cycle is coming to an end, he said.
Bad M3 money supply numbers could prompt further selling, he said. Although
a figure close to last month's 15.4 per cent rate appears to be discounted,
it could reinforce the market's negative sentiment, traders said.
Europe's few other active markets also took a blow from the German sell-off.
UK government bonds fell sharply, also depressed by concern over the
inflationary impact of rising commodity prices. In late trading, the UK long
gilt future was down almost one point at 105 3/16 .
Analysts said the most important event for gilts this week is likely to be
Wednesday's auction by the Bank of England of the new convertible gilt. They
said interest for the new bond was growing as investors begin to take up
more of a defensive position after the recent rally in gilts, which was
particularly marked at the long end, by switching from longer to
shorter-dated bonds.
Italian bonds posted particularly large losses, with the June bond future on
Liffe falling by 1.40 point to 111.22. Spanish bonds outperformed them
significantly, with the June contract shedding only 0.64 point on the day to
close at 96.77.
US Treasury bonds broke into a retreat yesterday as commodity prices showed
their sharpest one-day gain in nearly a year and the dollar lost more ground
against the D-Mark.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 3/8 lower
at 85 29/32 , with the yield rising to 7.432 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  9/32 to 99 1/4 , to yield 5.896 per cent.
As the afternoon progressed, traders became unnerved by the steady rise in
the Commodity Research Bureau's index. Near the end of the day, the
closely-watched measure of inflation was up 4.49 at 238.18, its biggest rise
since last July.
A second disturbing development was the erosion of the value of the dollar
against the D-Mark, following comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, suggesting the German recession had ended.
With no fresh US economic news released, the market was also looking ahead
to the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes this afternoon,
followed by the issuance of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow.
The last auctions of short-term paper had generated disappointing demand,
and many traders were seeking to protect themselves against the possibility
that the market would not be able to absorb the new supply.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Quiet eurobond day puts focus on future
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a smattering of new issues emerged in the eurobond market yesterday as
continental markets were closed, and attention was focused on forthcoming
offerings.
Among yesterday's issues, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan raised Dollars 75m
through a three-tranche offering of 10-year floating rates while Finnish
Export Credit raised Y5bn of three-year paper.
However, market talk centred on a mooted launch from Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corp (CMHC). Syndicate managers said the government-owned issuer was
likely to offer around Dollars 1bn of debt.
The move was flagged when CMHC last came to the market in November to raise
Dollars 1bn through five-year global bonds yielding 15 basis points over
Canadian government bonds. It said then that the offering was designed to
establish a benchmark for its initiative to lend to social housing and that
it planned to raise CDollars 2bn a year over the next five years.
There was also speculation that KfW, Germany's reconstruction bank, was
considering a Dollars 300m dragon bond. In addition, the placing by the
Taiwanese company, UMC, of a Dollars 160m convertible eurobond offering on
Friday - which was oversubscribed and trading at 104 yesterday against an
issue price of par - raised speculation that it would pave the way for a
Dollars 900m to Dollars 1bn offering from Formosa Plastics.
Nevertheless, dealers said the performance of recent issues showed the
market was vulnerable. They reported the yield spread on the Kingdom of
Spain's FFr6bn issue of seven-year eurobonds had widened to 30 basis points
yesterday from 24 basis points at the launch on Friday, and the Republic of
Finland's FFr10bn of 10-year debt launched a week ago was yielding 36 basis
points against a launch spread of 32.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Low foreign take-up in
Hungarian bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors have taken up less than 1 per cent of eastern Europe's
first domestic-currency state bond, a Hungarian government issue aimed at
international institutions.
Three-year government bonds worth Ft15bn were put on sale but foreign buyers
accounted for just Ft104m of demand. Total subscriptions amounted to
Ft8.75bn, including applications by Hungarian state-owned institutions.
GiroCredit Budapest, the global adviser, said it expected foreign investors
to enter the secondary market and maintained that the issue had successfully
opened the international market in 'paprika bonds'.
Other brokers said that the issue had fallen woefully short of expectations
and privately described the sale to foreigners as a 'flop'.
US investors in particular have been alarmed by the resurgence of the
Hungarian Socialist Party, the former communists, and the prospect of their
return to office after the second and decisive round of voting on Sunday.
At all events, the paprika bond's aggressive 25 per cent coupon has proved
insufficient to offset fears of a devaluation by the next government.
Last year the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank which up to now has
had sole responsibility for nearly all global borrowing, sold Dollars 4.5bn
worth of bonds in dollars, D-marks, yen and other denominations to make
Hungary one of the most active international sovereign borrowers.
The central bank opposed the issue of a forint bond saying that it would
lead to currency speculation. Prior to this issue it blocked the issue of
international certificates of the bond, insisting that trading take place in
Hungary.
The National Bank also changed Hungary's currency basket, giving it a 70 per
cent Ecu and 30 per cent dollar component and increased its repo interest
rate. These moves were instrumental in upsetting investors' calculations,
traders say.

Growing international interest in Danish bonds and equities has prompted
Euroclear, the international clearing and settlement house, to set up a
direct link with Vaerdipapircentralen, Denmark's central securities
depository and settlement system, writes Antonia Sharpe.
The link, which should improve efficiency in the settlement of cross-border
trades in Danish securities, is expected to be operational in early July. It
is the first step to a two-way exchange of data.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Premier Dollars 500m deal for
Hellenic Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece is returning to the syndicated loans market for the first time in
four years with a Dollars 500m syndicated loan - the country's first under
its new sovereign name, the Hellenic Republic.
Although Greece is still discussing the terms with a number of banks, early
indications point to a five-year deal with a three-year grace period, at a
price of around 110 to 112 basis points above the London interbank offered
rate (Libor).
Senior Greek officials are in London this week to discuss the loan, details
of which are expected to be announced within the next week. The deal should
be launched in June.
Mitsubishi Bank and NatWest are tipped as the arrangers. The underwriting
group is likely to include 10 to 15 banks, with each expected to take on an
underwriting commitment of up to Dollars 50m.
Despite the economic problems currently plaguing Greece, it should still be
able to take advantage of the narrowing of spreads in the syndicated loans
market.
'Many banks are now hungry for zero-weighted assets - this represents a good
source of funding for us,' said Mr Spyros Papanicolaou, head of the
international banking department at the Bank of Greece.
Telecom Corporation of New Zealand is launching a Dollars 150m syndicated
loan via arranger Lloyds Bank Capital Markets. The five-year deal pays a
margin of 17.5 basis points over Libor, a facility fee of 12.5 basis points
per annum and a five basis point utilisation fee where utilisation exceeds
50 per cent.

State Bank of New South Wales, the regional Australian bank, returned to the
black in the six months to March after large reductions in doubtful debt
charges and abnormals.
The bank, owned by the New South Wales government but earmarked for sale to
the private sector later this year, turned a ADollars 89.6m (USDollars
64.4m) loss into a ADollars 19.7m net profit on static operating income of
ADollars 314.8m.
Before taxes and charges, earnings eased 9 per cent from ADollars 89.5m to
ADollars 81.7m. Doubtful debt charges fell 53 per cent from ADollars 109.8m
to ADollars 57.7m and total problem loans were down 19.4 per cent from
ADollars 1.2bn to ADollars 964.2m.
Tax took ADollars 10.3m against a ADollars 26.6m credit previously.
The New South Wales government said recently that only one contender,
believed to be Colonial Mutual, the Australian investment group, remained
interested in buying the bank. Sale legislation is scheduled for this
September.

Mitsubishi Estate, one of Japan's leading real estate groups, posted a 32.9
per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y47.4bn (Dollars 451.42m), on turnover
which increased by 26.1 per cent to Y440bn. Post-tax profits rose 3.4 per
cent to Y38.3bn. The dividend was maintained at Y8 per share.
Brokers Baring Securities said the second half of the year had been much
weaker for Mitsubishi than the first six months and that there was little
sign of a turnaround. Mitsubishi predicted pre-tax profits for the current
year down at Y35bn on sales of Y420bn, below analysts expectations.
Mitsui Fudasan, Japan's biggest real estate developer, reported pre-tax
profits down 36.2 per cent at Y16.4bn, on turnover down 5.2 per cent at
Y795bn. The company said it would maintain the dividend at Y9 per share,
even though the business outlook looked severe, with the possibility of
higher interest rates and oversupply in the condominiums market. It
predicted pre-tax profits would fall to Y12bn during the year to March 31
1995 on sales of Y730bn.
Tokyu Land, the property developer, posted pre-tax profits down 16.6 per
cent at Y5.5bn, following a collapse of its building leasing operations,
according to the company. This was the third year profits had fallen, said
Mr Kyuichiro Kinoshita, vice-president. The group also sustained losses on
its golf course and leisure activities, together with a sharp decline in
foreign exchange profits, he said. Turnover increased 3.5 per cent to
Y266bn. The dividend was maintained at Y5 per share.
The group warned margins would come under pressure during the present
financial year because of competition in the housing market and a
deterioration in the building leasing business. The company said it would
sell a building in Shibuya, Tokyo for Y10bn to its do-it-yourself subsidiary
Tokyu Hands.
Pre-tax profits would fall to Y5.3bn on sales of Y280bn during the current
year, the group predicted.

Ayala, the property-based Philippine conglomerate, has reported consolidated

One-time gains, mostly from sales of some holdings in property affiliate
Ayala Land, were behind much of the profits rise, said Mr Jaime Zobel de

Zobel, followed strong demand for an offering made by the

<TEXT>
Kyocera, the Japanese manu-facturer of ceramic semiconductor components,
posted a sharp rise in consolidated profits due to the listing of two
subsidiaries, DDI, the telecommunications company, and Taito, the video
games maker.
The company saw a 39 per cent rise in group pre-tax profits to Y68.4bn
(Dollars 651.42m) for the year to last March due to profits of Y14.3bn from
the two companies' listing and Y7.5bn from share sales.
However, cost-cutting helped the mainline business and operating profits
rose Y10.5 per cent on a 0.9 per cent decline in sales to Y427.7bn.
After-tax profits rose 53.7 per cent to Y36.8bn.
Earnings of its ceramic semiconductor parts division rose 9.9 per cent to
Y44.7bn, but electronic equipment profits fell 22.1 per cent to Y3.4bn. The
optical precision equipment division returned to the black, with earnings of
Y2.4bn against a loss of Y673m a year earlier.
On a non-consolidated basis, Kyocera posted a 7.8 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y35.1bn due to a fall in interest income. Sales were flat at
Y300.6bn but after-tax profits rose 10 per cent thanks to income from share
sales.
For the current year to next March, the company forecasts a 20 per cent
unconsolidated pre-tax rise to Y42.1bn on a 8.9 per cent rise in sales to
Y327.5bn.

DB Group, the New Zealand concern controlled by a joint venture of Heineken
and Singapore Breweries, yesterday reported a loss of NZDollars 98.1m
(USDollars 57.57m) after abnormals for the nine months to March 31. This
included a loss on the sale of Australian pub chain Austotel of NZDollars
86.7m.
Austotel, which was sold to Brierley Investments, was part of a deal which
saw Brierley sell its 27 per cent shareholding in DB Group to Asia Pacific
Breweries, the holding company for Heineken of the Netherlands and Singapore
Breweries.
DB Group is now managed by Heineken.
DB Group reported operating profits before abnormals 24 per cent higher at
NZDollars 17.3m over the year-ago figure. Sales fell 5 per cent to NZDollars
559.8m.
Directors said after the sale of Austotel and various New Zealand hotels and
taverns, net debt fell from NZDollars 158.9m to NZDollars 29.4m at March 31.
In addition the directors had provided a further NZDollars 23.4m for costs
involved in quitting other hotels and liquor outlets. They said they
remained convinced that the strategy of selling non-performing assets was
'the proper approach' to take.
They planned to sell all company-owned hotels by December 31.
No dividend is planned.

for the first time in three years, according to a report by Teikoku Data
Bank, a private research company.
Toyota was followed by Sanwa Bank and NTT, the telecommunications company,
for the calendar year 1993. Declared earnings are based on after-tax profits
adjusted to meet tax regulations.
Toyota's return to the top spot came in spite of a 27 per cent fall in
declared earnings for the car company last year to Y296bn (Dollars 2,819m).
'We did not have a particularly good year. But other companies suffered even
more,' Toyota commented.
The earnings league table compiled by Teikoku Data Bank shows that the
fortunes of companies within the same industries were widely divergent last
year.
Sanwa Bank, for example, climbed to second position from sixth place in 1992
while Mitsubishi Bank rose to seventh place from tenth last year. Sanwa
declared earnings last year of Y262bn which was 19.5 per cent up on 1992.
However, three other banks - Sumitomo, Daiichi Kangyo and Tokai - which had
been among the top 10 in 1992, tumbled below the tenth spot, leaving Sanwa,
Mitsubishi and Fuji Bank, at ninth place.
Likewise, in the car sector, Toyota may have regained its top status but
Nissan, which reported a pre-tax loss of Y26.2bn last year, was not even in
the running while Honda fell from 53rd to 89th place.
Among notable changes in the rankings, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries emerged
in fifth place, returning to the top 10 for the first time in 19 years. The
shipbuilding and heavy machinery company saw a firm rise in earnings due to
strong demand for its motors and ships.
Nintendo, the video games maker, rose to number six from 12th place in 1992
while Matsushita, under pressure from a slump in the consumer electronics
market, fell from seventh to 11th place.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Komatsu plunges 55% in worst
showing for decade

Sluggish growth worldwide saw a slump in consolidated profits at Komatsu,
the world's second largest manufacturer of construction machinery, in the
year to the end of March.
The group's pre-tax profits fell by 55 per cent to Y13.9bn (Dollars
132.38m), the worst performance in a decade. Turnover was down by 2.8 per
cent at Y845.9bn. The parent company's profits dropped by 28 per cent at
Y15.8bn on sales lower by 4.6 per cent.
The company said the year had been marked by a continued sharp decline in
domestic demand for building equipment, its principal activity, as private
sector investment remained flat. Despite the growth in new public works
projects, a full recovery in public sector demand had been held back by
start-up delays. Domestic sales overall declined by 1.8 per cent.
Overseas, sales to the US and south-east Asia were buoyant, despite the
sharp appreciation in the yen. But in the already weakened European markets,
the strong currency had significantly affected demand and total overseas
sales fell by 3.1 per cent.
Non-core activities produced mixed results. Civil engineering contracts were
up slightly on 1993 and sales of electronics products rose almost 7 per
cent. But industrial machinery sales, buffeted by weak domestic demand and
the strong yen, fell 22 per cent.
The company reaffirmed its commitment to long-term growth on a global scale.
For Komatsu, as for many other Japanese manufacturers, this means a
significant reorganisation of its global operations to help it reduce the
adverse impact of the strong currency.
The group is now accelerating the shift of some manufacturing plants abroad
and increasing overseas out-sourcing of its domestic activities.
Komatsu said that it expected the effects of the restructuring combined with
gradual recovery in its major markets to produce a recovery in the next
year.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: US healthcare groups in Dollars
1bn merger
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Columbia/HCA, the US healthcare group which operates the country's largest
chain of hospitals, announced the acquisition of Medical Care America in an
all-stock transaction valued at just over Dollars 1bn.
The deal marks the latest consolidation among US healthcare providers,
prompted equally by cost pressures and the growing power of managed care
organisations.
Medical Care America owns 96 surgery centres which between them have 504
operating rooms. Columbia/HCA, which was formed in a Dollars 6bn merger last
year, already has 196 acute-care and specialty hospitals.
Columbia/HCA, under chief executive Mr Richard Scott, has been more active
than other US healthcare providers in pursuing mergers. By providing a wide
range of healthcare services, the company hopes to sign up large customers
such as Health Maintenance Organisations, which buy healthcare services in
bulk for their individual members.
The two companies also said a merger would save money by enabling them to
negotiate bigger discounts from suppliers and to cut overheads.
Around 60 per cent of Medical Care America's surgery centres is in an area
also served by one of Columbia/HCA's hospitals. This overlap would help to
reduce costs and make the combined service more attractive to customers, the
two companies said.
The deal follows discussions between the two companies about ways of
strengthening an alliance that was already in place. Earlier this year,
Medical Care America sold its Critical Care America home infusion unit, just
18 months after those two companies merged. That deal proved a failure as
the home infusion business came under pricing pressures, slashing Medical
Care's earnings per share from Dollars 1.87 in 1992 to Dollars 1.29 last
year.
Medical Care America's shareholders will receive stock worth Dollars 29 for
each of their existing shares, if Columbia/HCA's stock stays close to its
current price.
The value of the deal would be subject to a sliding scale if Columbia's
share price moved above Dollars 40 or below Dollars 36, with the maximum
price for the acquisition set at Dollars 1.1bn. On Friday, the company's
shares closed at Dollars 39 3/4 .
The all-stock deal, which was approved by both companies' boards yesterday,
is subject to approval by Medical Care America's shareholders, and
regulatory clearance.

return

<TEXT>
Rothmans Holdings, the Australian cigarette group 50 per cent owned by
Rothmans International, announced a ADollars 60.9m (USDollars 44.3m) capital
return following a rise in earnings for the year to last March.
Net profit jumped 82 per cent to ADollars 73.7m from ADollars 40.5m on a 5
per cent sales rise to ADollars 1.56bn from ADollars 1.48bn, and the annual
dividend is to be raised to 40 cents a share from 33 cents.
The improved bottom line mainly reflected a clean slate on abnormals,
following a ADollars 29.9m abnormal loss the previous year. Profit before
charges was almost static at ADollars 132.3m.
The latest result excluded a ADollars 12.6m extraordinary loss on withdrawal
of operations from the Philippines.
Directors said the decision to make a capital return, which will halve the
par value of the company's shares to 50 cents, reflected three main factors:
the Philippines closure, high cash balances and low interest rates. Net cash
held jumped by ADollars 67m to ADollars 186.5m in the year.
Directors said future earnings would not be affected by the capital return.
But earnings would be boosted following removal of the Philippines
operations, which lost ADollars 18.1m in the latest year, compared to an
ADollars 32.5m loss previously. The company would continue its concentration
on operating efficiencies to help offset new tobacco marketing restrictions.
The result followed tax provision of ADollars 54.8m (ADollars 53.5m
previously) and depreciation ADollars 29.5m (ADollars 30.9m). Interest
expense fell from ADollars 11.9m to ADollars 4.5m.

<TEXT>
Shinawatra Computer and Communications, the parent company of the Thai
communications and broadcasting group controlled by Mr Thaksin Shinawatra,
yesterday reported sharply higher net profits for the first quarter of the
current year, writes William Barnes in Bangkok.
Unconsolidated net profits were Bt712.6m (Dollars 28.29m) in the three
months to end-March, compared with Bt276.4m a year earlier. Earnings per
share rose to Bt7.29 from Bt3.94. Consolidated profits for the quarter were
Bt722m; no comparable figure was provided for last year.
The sale of a 17.5 per cent stake in International Engineering to its
communications rival UCOM produced profits of Bt290m.
Shinawatra's profits were also lifted by a successful promotional campaign
by its 60 per cent-owned subsidiary, Advanced Info Services, which already
accounts for half the country's lucrative portable telephone and pager
market. Advanced's consolidated quarterly profits climbed 150 per cent to
Bt383.72m from Bt153m a year ago .
Investment analysts generally think that Mr Thaksin's decision to step back
from operational control of his businesses recently to enter politics has
had little effect on the direction of the ambitious group because 'he's
essentially still in charge'.
Brokers generally reckon that the Shinawatra parent company will report
profits of around Bt1.8bn this year.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Billion-dollar changes for YPF -
The oil group is undergoing a transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, is to transform its domestic
operations and back a cautious expansion into neighbouring markets with a
Dollars 100m a month investment programme.
The expansion of exploration and production and the revamping of its retail
business is the company's largest investment programme, and the most evident
sign of YPF's transformation from a corrupt, money-losing state corporation
to a profit-oriented, private company.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, says he now has 'one firm commitment:
profits. Our investors have become the most important part of our corporate
life'.
He claims YPF's investment plans are proof that this is no cheap corporate
hype. More than Dollars 1bn is budgeted for next year and a further Dollars
1bn in 1996.
Argentina's biggest company is now 20 per cent owned by the federal
government, with the rest held by the employees and provincial governments.
The government, which once owned the company outright, sold 45 per cent last
June in a Dollars 3.04bn local and international initial public offering.
Last year, YPF raised profits 176 per cent to Dollars 706m, despite lower
oil prices and an increase of just 2 per cent in sales to Dollars 3.96bn.
However, profits and revenues both declined in the first quarter as oil
prices continued falling.
YPF is to sink 720 new production wells this year, at a cost of Dollars
700m. Mr Estenssoro wants to raise output by one-fifth to 450,000 barrels
per day by the end of 1995, and then maintain production at this level.
'Argentina's wells are small producers, so (we need to do) a lot of
drilling,' he says.
Mr Estenssoro wants to maintain YPF's oil reserves at the equivalent of 10
years' production through a big exploration effort. This year YPF is
spending Dollars 300m to drill 180 exploration wells as part of a Dollars
3bn, 10-year exploration programme.
Argentina is self-sufficient in oil, although it does not come close the
volumes of Mexico or Venezuela, Latin America's big oil producers. But it
does have considerable potential: Mr Estenssoro says only five of its 19
identified oil-bearing basins have been explored and are in production.
The country does have much more natural gas than oil. YPF and joint-venture
partners Ampolex of Australia and Petrobras of Brazil are investing Dollars
250m over four years to explore a potentially giant gas field in north
western Argentina.
Mr Estenssoro is spending a further Dollars 250m this year to upgrade YPF's
downstream business, where profitability is low. In August 1990, when he
took over at YPF, the downstream business lost Dollars 400m. It is now
returning 5 per cent on assets, and Mr Estenssoro wants to double
profitability by next year. In comparison, the upstream production business
returns about 20 per cent a year.
YPF has also started a Dollars 500m, five-year project to bring its
operations - particularly its refineries - into line with world
environmental standards.
Finally, YPF is spending Dollars 300m between 1993-96 to renovate its retail
network. The company has 2,800 petrol stations, many more than its
competitors, but its stations are a byword for bad service.
YPF is financing the investment programme with a mix of bank borrowing,
retained earnings and overseas bond sales. Mr Estenssoro announced earlier
this year a Dollars 350m Yankee bond issue and a Dollars 500m medium-term
note issue.
Analysts praise the company for reducing production and administrative costs
to compensate for falling oil prices. Some, however, criticise Mr Estenssoro
for not hedging oil prices and thus exposing YPF's growing exports to
dwindling prices.
Mr Estenssoro has continued cutting the work force - which stood at 51,000
when he took over and now numbers only 6,500 - leading to growing criticism
from the unions. However, many former employees still work for the company
as subcontractors, often on excessively generous terms, say some analysts.
Competitors and economists also complain that YPF abuses its dominant market
position. It produces over half Argentina's oil, has over half its refinery
capacity and controls half the retail market.
Mr Estenssoro rejects accusations that YPF plays dirty. 'The market works,
it is very competitive and if YPF did not exist, or was not as big as it is,
its market would be split among the multinationals,' he says.
YPF, which has always focused on its domestic market, is gradually expanding
into neighbouring countries. It has just opened a 270-mile pipeline over the
Andes to Chile, allowing it to raise exports by Dollars 300m a year.
Mr Estenssoro says: 'We are looking to our neighbours as a natural place to
expand.' He has started small exploration projects in Bolivia, Uruguay and
Paraguay and is negotiating exploration contracts in Chile and Peru. YPF may
bid for the Peruvian and Bolivian state oil companies when they are offered
for privatisation.
It seems appropriate that YPF, the world's first state oil company and Latin
America's first privatised oil company, should make a stab at becoming the
region's first private oil multinational.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Barlow posts 6% rise to R273m

<TEXT>
Barlow, the South African conglomerate formed last year after the
restructuring of South Africa's Barlow Rand group, reported a 6 per cent
rise in operating profit before interest to R273m (Dollars 74m), from a pro
forma total of R256m for the same period last year.
After-tax profit, which includes R23m abnormal profit from the sale of the
group's investment in Randgold and Exploration and R68m in investment
income, rose 40 per cent to R194m from R139m.
However, this did not include an extraordinary loss of R62m resulting
largely from the sale of the agricultural interests of lossmaking subsidiary
Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar dealer, for R189m, which was taken below
the line in accordance with the company's accounting procedure.
The higher overall earnings were the result of improved operating margins
and the group's strong cash position, which helped reduce the interest bill
by 36 per cent to R63m, while increasing investment income by 30 per cent.
Turnover, which was distorted by some asset sales during the six months,
rose 5 per cent to R6.13bn from R5.86bn and a dividend of 18 cents was
declared.
Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said that it was Barlow's aim to have three
times cover for its future dividends.
As expected, the largest contributor to earnings was Pretoria Portland
Cement, which was responsible for 37 per cent of taxed profit. Other
companies in the industrial division, encompassing Barlow's wholly-owned
subsidiaries, also performed well. Paint manufacturer Plascon and Barlows
Equipment, which benefited from improved mine and construction demand for
machinery, both showed strong growth.
Barlow said second-half results were likely to be 'at least equal' to those
for the first six months. In the longer term Mr Clewlow was confident the
South African economy had begun to improve and that the company would be
able to take particular advantage of the new government's planned
reconstruction and development programme.
'Barlow is well positioned to meet the demand expected,' Mr Clewlow said.

Banca Commerciale Italiana, the recently privatised Italian bank, is
planning to strengthen cross-shareholdings with Commerzbank of Germany and
Creditanstalt of Austria.
The BCI board yesterday authorised negotiations for the purchase of a 1 per
cent stake in Commerzbank, which already owns just under 3 per cent of the
Italian bank and is represented on the board.
BCI said talks were already under way with the German bank.
BCI also said last night that it was interested in buying 3 per cent of the
voting shares of Creditanstalt, a holding equivalent to 2 per cent of the
overall capital of the Vienna-based institution, which is being privatised.
Creditanstalt, which also has a representative on the BCI board, has been a
BCI shareholder since the Italian bank was founded last century.
BCI's name had already been mentioned in rumours about the formation of a
consortium to buy into the capital of the Austrian bank to prevent control
falling into unfriendly hands. BCI said last night that it had simply
declared its willingness to buy shares, and it would be up to the Austrians
to decide how such an operation should be carried out.

Oporto Stock Exchange is to close on June 1 before reopening in January as a
national futures and options market, officials said. The Lisbon Stock
Exchange will take over all Portugal's spot market trading from the same
date.
The decision follows a proposal made in February by Portugal's stock
exchange commission (CMVM) to replace the spot market in Oporto with a
derivatives exchange and develop a national spot market in Lisbon.
Oporto and Lisbon currently act as separate trading floors for a national
spot market on which 118 shares and bonds are listed. A total of 12 shares
and bonds listed only on Oporto's second market for smaller companies will
be transferred to Lisbon.
The Lisbon stock exchange will pay Oporto Es2.4bn (Dollars 14m) over three
years as compensation for the loss of the spot market. The CMVM proposal was
made to end what it considers unnecessary rivalry between the two exchanges

Analysts said a futures and options market was needed to increase the
liquidity and efficiency of Portugal's capital markets and improve
conditions for corporate financing.
The measure follows the announcement of a radical reform package for the

CS First Boston, the only western institution with a Russian securities
licence, has bought 2.87 per cent of Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil producer,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Bank officials said the stake was bought at a nationwide auction in April
when Lukoil offered 7.42 per cent of its shares to the public in exchange
for privatisation vouchers.
The Lukoil conglomerate, based in Western Siberia, consists of three oil
production enterprises which together account for about 15 per cent of total
Russian crude out-put.
It also has two oil refineries in Perm and Volgograd, marketing outlets,
banking and other financial units and is talking to a number of foreign oil
firms including Italy's Agip to set up oil production ventures abroad.
The 45 per cent state-owned company has announced plans to sell more shares
for cash at investment tenders later this year. Foreign investors can hold
no more than 15 per cent of shares in big Russian oil companies.
CSFB has already bought shares in over 30 Russian companies, bank officials
say. They estimate that the bank has invested more than Dollars 300m in
Russia's emerging equities and debt markets so far this year.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Talisman Energy discovers
independence pays off - The Canadian oil company has concentrated on its
upstream activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Buckee's career has taken some surprising turns since he arrived in
Calgary in September 1991 as president of British Petroleum's Canadian
subsidiary. Mr Buckee's job was to get rid of BP Canada's mining interests
and narrow its focus to the upstream business of oil and gas exploration and
production.
Less than a year after his arrival, the UK-based oil and gas group decided
to spin off its 57 per cent stake in BP Canada to public investors. One
condition of the deal, however, was that Mr Buckee, after 15 years service
with BP, would remain in Calgary at the helm of the newly independent
company, which was renamed Talisman Energy.
Mr Buckee, who has a doctorate in astrophysics from Oxford, has stuck to his
original mandate of confining the company to upstream activities.
At the same time, he has spearheaded a spectacular burst of growth, which
culminated in Talisman's proposal this week to pay about CDollars 1.8bn
(USDollars 1.3bn) in cash and shares for Bow Valley Energy, also based in
Calgary. British Gas, which owns 53 per cent of Bow Valley's shares, has
approved the deal.
The Bow Valley acquisition will catapult Talisman into the top ranks of the
world's purely upstream energy companies. It is now more than treble the
size - measured by oil and gas output - of the old BP Canada.
Operating cashflows soared by 88 per cent in the first quarter to CDollars
82.5m, due to last year's purchase of Encor, another western Canadian oil
and gas producer, as well as higher gas prices and a weaker Canadian dollar.
First-quarter earnings climbed by almost 70 per cent to CDollars 13.3m, with
revenues more than doubling to CDollars 110m.
Bow Valley and Talisman together produced a total of 500m cubic feet of gas
a day last year. Their combined oil output was 53,000 barrels a day.
These figures will rise substantially this year, as production rises from
the North Sea East Brae field, in which Bow Valley has a 13.3 per cent
interest. Its share of production from East Brae will rise to about 14,000
barrels of liquids plus 38m cubic ft of gas a day by the end of the year.
Mr Buckee has no qualms about Talisman's rapid growth at a time when many
integrated oil and gas producers are shedding assets. 'Investors prefer a
purer play than the integrated companies can provide,' he says, adding that
'my expertise is in upstream only. I don't wish to fiddle in things that I
don't understand'.
Mr Craig Langpap, energy analyst at Nesbitt Thomson in Calgary, describes
Talisman's management as 'very astute and very skilled in finding oil and
gas'. It has succeeded in fully replacing its liquids and natural gas
production with new reserves for the past three years in a row.
According to Mr Langpap, the Bow Valley acquisition has two big benefits.
First, it will boost Talisman's exposure to oil, giving it a roughly 50-50
balance between oil and gas. Second, Bow Valley's properties are
concentrated in the North Sea and two areas of Alberta. Talisman expects
that by combining the two companies, it will save CDollars 10-CDollars 15m a
year in operating costs.
Mr Buckee says Talisman will continue to stick mainly to gas exploration in
western Canada and to oil in other parts of the world. Capital spending this
year (excluding Bow Valley) is expected to reach CDollars 225m, about 50 per
cent higher than 1993.
According to Talisman's latest annual report, 'even in the event that lower
oil prices persist for a substantial part of 1994, we intend to maintain an
aggressive capital investment programme'.
But Mr Buckee eschews anything too adventurous. 'I'm not in the elephant
hunting business and I don't particularly like deep water,' he says. 'I want
relatively proven but less mature basins.'
The gas exploration programme is especially geared towards deep and
relatively unexplored reservoirs in western Canada, centred on the Rockies
foothills in north-east British Columbia.
Offshore oil activities have so far focused on Cuba and Algeria. But the Bow
Valley acquisition will broaden Talisman's reach to the North Sea and
Indonesia. Bow Valley and its partners are working out marketing
arrangements for a sizeable gas field in the Corridor area of South Sumatra,
from which the Canadian company's share would reach 100m cubic ft per day.
Under the terms of the Bow Valley deal, British Gas will acquire enough
Talisman shares to make it the Canadian company's biggest single shareholder
with a stake of between 8 per cent and 16 per cent. But British Gas will not
seek board representation, and it will come as no surprise if it also puts
these shares on the block in the not-too-distant future.
After spending the first 20 years of his career with big integrated oil
companies, Mr Buckee clearly relishes his independence. 'Control blocks are
often seen as security, but patently in the case of BP Canada and Bow
Valley, they've been completely the opposite,' he observes.

<TEXT>
Desjardins Laurentian Financial, the financial services group controlled by
the Desjardins credit union movement, reported first-quarter profits of
CDollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.66m) or 18 cents a share, after a CDollars 9.5m
reorganisation charge, on revenues of CDollars 983m.
It was the first reporting period since the December 1993 takeover of the
Laurentian Group by Desjardins to form a financial services and banking
group with corporate assets of CDollars 55bn.
Desjardins Laurentian, with CDollars 22bn assets, brings together life
insurance, general insurance, trust operations, investment banking and
consumer banking with subsidiaries in Canada, the US and Britain. It is 7.7
per cent held by La Victoire of France and its shares are publicly traded in
Toronto and Montreal.
Imperial Life, one of its biggest units, earned CDollars 59,000 in the first
quarter after a CDollars 2.5m special charge by its British subsidiary. This
compares with CDollars 5.6m a year earlier. Performance was also affected by
the north American property market collapse, but overall Canadian and US
operations were still profitable.
Desjardins Laurentian will set aside CDollars 40m this year to cover
reorganisation costs. 'The full benefits will be felt in 1996,' said Mr
Humberto Santos, president.
Two life units may be merged but asset sales are unlikely, he added.

<TEXT>
The Limited, the US stores group, is considering international expansion of
its fast-growing Bath &amp; Bodyworks division, with stores to open overseas,
possibly within the next year, AP-DJ reports from Columbus, Ohio.
Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive, said after the annual
meeting that the company also planned to add a net 400 new stores in 1994
across the various divisions.
The group, however, will continue to reduce the total number of stores in
some of its biggest divisions, such as Lerner New York, and its flagship
Limited Stores.
It plans to add more than 100 Structure menswear stores and more than 100
Bath &amp; Bodyworks stores, as well as adding more Victoria's Secrets stores.
The Limited, Limited Inc's large but troubled ladies clothing retailer, will
reduce its total stores by 40 during 1994, the company added.
Mr Michael Weiss, vice-chairman of Limited Inc, has taken personal control
of The Limited Stores, and said the company was redefining its customer.
'We've defined it more closely for the woman who wants fashion but isn't
trendy and is concerned about price.'
Limited, which has successfully launched spin-off catalogues from businesses
such as Victoria's Secrets swimsuit catalogue, said this autumn it would
'test' a catalogue for its Structure menswear stores.
By the end of 1994, Limited will be operating more than 5,000 stores,
including Henri Bendel, Lane Bryant and Express stores.
Mr Wexner said that while the company had been and remained cautious about
international expansion, he believed some of their brands had international
potential.
The possible international expansion of Bath &amp; Bodyworks has been under
study by the company for the past year and the company could make
announcements on expansions within the next month.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Yen's strength hits Nintendo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Weak consumer spending and the sharp appreciation of the yen brought an
abrupt end to the spectacular rise of Nintendo, the Japanese video games
maker, which yesterday reported a sharp drop in sales and pre-tax profits.
Consolidated sales fell 24 per cent in the year to March 1994, to Y485.6bn
(Dollars 4.7bn) from Y634.7bn. Pre-tax profits plunged 44 per cent to
Y92.8bn from Y166.2bn a year ago.
This is the first drop in sales and pre-tax profits suffered by Nintendo
since 1990, when it reported lower results because of a change in its
year-end. Last year, Nintendo's pre-tax profits overtook those of
Matsushita, a company several times its size.
Part of Nintendo's difficulty last year stemmed from its heavy reliance on
one product - video games - at a time when its main market in Japan was
depressed and fierce competition made life difficult in Europe and the US.
At the same time, it is also heavily dependent on exports - but the yen's
sharp rise against foreign currencies has cut deeply into repatriated
profits.
Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, president, said the yen's strength had been so damaging
on overseas business, it would be nice to be able to pull out of all foreign
markets.
Nintendo's parent sales fell 17 per cent, to Y467.1bn, with pre-tax profits
falling 30 per cent to Y115.1bn. The company forecasts that parent sales
will fall again this year, to Y410bn, and pre-tax profits will rise to
Y123bn. However, it expects after-tax profits to decline to Y62bn from
Y65bn.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Enichem reveals record net loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enichem, the chemicals subsidiary of Italy's state-controlled Eni group,
yesterday announced a record net loss for 1993, after deliberately taking
into account heavy extraordinary charges to prepare for a four-year
restructuring programme.
In 1993, the group lost L2,668bn (Dollars 1.7bn) - even higher than the
L2,200bn loss Enichem itself predicted last November - compared with
L1,560bn in 1992. Charges relating to research and plant maintenance, the
reduction of fixed costs, the closure of the least-efficient factories, and
redundancies amounted to L1,013bn.
Enichem forecast a 'drastic reduction of losses for 1994', and said it could
begin to break even in 1995 or 1996. Much depends on the health of the core
markets of base chemicals, polyethylene and elastomers, which will be left
over once asset sales are completed.
To help Enichem through the worst, its parent company is expected to back a
large increase in capital - possibly as much as L3,000bn - at a shareholder
assembly at the end of next month. Any such cash injection will be carefully
analysed by the European Commission for possible state aids.
Enichem's revenue fell to L10,643bn in 1993, although that figure was
roughly in line with 1992 when adjusted for disposals.
The group has already embarked on a four-year programme of restructuring and
L2,500bn of asset sales in an attempt to bring down its debt. Net financial
debt stood at L8,252bn at the end of last year, compared with L7,391bn a
year earlier. The company said it wanted to bring debt down to around 1.5 or
1.6 times shareholders' funds, instead of the present 3.4 times.
Servicing the debt cost Enichem L805bn last year, although that was L88bn
less than in 1992. Even before financial charges, the operating loss was 86
per cent higher than in 1992 at L572bn compared with L308bn.

Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, has suggested that the
government's bank disposals programme could be revised.
'The first question which we will be answering by the end of next month will
be whether we consolidate the state-owned banks or privatise them,' he said
in a newspaper interview.
The finance ministry has been planning to sell several more state-owned
banks, including the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH) which was
due for privatisation by the middle of this year. It then planned to
consider merging the remaining state banks, either with those already
privatised or with each other, before privatisation.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia ripe for state
sell-off - The Swedish drug group is in form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steering one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals companies through
Sweden's largest privatisation would have seemed a remote prospect indeed to
Mr Jan Ekberg eight years ago. The Pharmacia chief executive was more
concerned with saving his loss-making Nordic-orientated company from
extinction.
The company survived, thanks to restructuring and a spectacular acquisition
programme which has taken annual sales to SKr27bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in 1993
from SKr1.5bn in 1986. 'This company has done more deals than some merchant
banks,' jokes one observer. The result is that the group has become the true
multinational of Mr Ekberg's aspirations, ranking as Sweden's fifth-biggest
company by market capitalisation.
The SKr10bn privatisation gets under way today with the launch of the
prospectus. The state plans to sell up to 82.2m A shares in the group - 47.4
per cent of the votes - to retail investors and international institutions.
It will, however, hang on to a 10.1 per cent voting stake to ensure
ownership stability and prevent a hostile takeover. This is an important
consideration, given that Pharmacia's second-largest shareholder, the
vehicle group Volvo, plans to sell its 28 per cent stake in 1996.
In terms of sales, Pharmacia is even bigger than Astra, Sweden's high-flying
drugs company, although the two companies are very different. Astra has
achieved its growth organically, whereas Pharmacia has depended heavily on
acquisitions. While Astra's fortunes have soared on the back of several
blockbusters, Pharmacia has relied on dominant market positions in niche
areas.
This dominance is reflected in the fact that in no fewer than five areas -
cataract surgery, allergies, growth hormones, nutrition and smoking
cessation - the group has the leading world position.
Because of this profile, Mr Ekberg does not appear unduly worried about the
company's exposure to government efforts to reduce healthcare spending. Its
broad product spread lessens the impact of a clampdown in any particular
area. However, it also benefits by having a relatively high exposure to the
hospital sector, rather than the retail market where many of the cuts have
been focused.
A good example is Italy, Pharmacia's third-largest market. Pharmaceuticals
sales there are estimated to have fallen by around 20 per cent in the first
quarter - yet Pharmacia's sales were down just 1 per cent.
Following its extensive acquisition programme, culminating last year in the
Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the Italian pharmaceuticals group Farmitalia Carlo
Erba (Fice), Pharmacia's immediate focus is cost-cutting. It aims to achieve
annual savings of SKr1.2bn by 1996 as part of a drive to lift its operating
margin, to 20 per cent from 13.5 per cent at the end of last year. The group
has already merged its marketing companies with Fice's: now the main task is
to reduce production capacity, spread over 46 plants in 15 countries, by as
much as 50 per cent over the next five years.
Cost-cutting was the main reason for the company's unexpectedly-strong
first-quarter performance. The operating margin rose to 16 per cent, despite
a sluggish 3 per cent increase in volumes and lower sales of the company's
two main drugs, Genotropin (growth hormones) and Healon (cataract surgery).
Longer-term, Mr Ekberg's target is to grow at least as fast as the market.
For this, he is pinning his hopes on a much greater presence in the US
market, which accounts for just 14 per cent of sales, and on a range of
products in the company's R &amp; D pipeline. The US effort will be assisted in
late 1995, when the group will be free to market Genotropin, a drug jointly
developed with Genentech, for the first time.
Pharmacia's R &amp; D pipeline includes seven drugs in phase III of clinical
trials and six in phase II. The most promising of the former group are
Latanoprost (for the eye disorder glaucoma), Eltanolone (an anaesthetic),
Factor VIII (a blood-clotting agent) and Cabergoline (for Parkinson's
Disease.) Each of the drugs is expected to have annual sales of at least
SKr500m.
Some analysts grumble that Pharmacia hasn't got a billion-dollar blockbuster
up its sleeve. 'We'll never get one. We're not even aiming for one,' says Mr
Ekberg only half-jokingly. It is part of the niche strategy that the group
avoids over-dependence on one or two drugs.
The danger is that as competition intensifies in the big therapeutical
areas, some of the world's leading drugs groups will begin to target the
niche areas in which Pharmacia operates. Mr Ekberg, however, does not seem
to be worried by this.
'These fairly limited areas might not be of core interest for the big
companies. If you are a company with sales of SKr50bn looking to grow by
five to 10 per cent, you must go for huge market areas.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Foreign investors block Hungary
telecoms float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, the German and US telecoms companies, have
blocked the Hungarian government's plans to float Matav, the national
telecoms utility, on the Budapest stock market.
Hungary's state holding company, AV RT, sold 30 per cent of Matav to
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech in December, in eastern Europe's largest
single privatisation. The AV RT, with its residual shareholding of 67 per
cent, hoped to sell a further tranche of shares to the Hungarian public this
autumn.
The public offering was to have been the centre piece of the conservative
government's mass privatisation programme. Its delay is another severe blow
to the scheme.
In any case, the Hungarian Socialist Party is likely to form the next
government after the second and decisive round of elections on May 29, and
the former communists have vowed to end the small-shareholder programme.
Under local law, approval from shareholders with at least 75 per cent of the
capital is required before a listing can be sought, so the foreign groups
have been able to block an immediate float.
A Matav committee investigating possible timing for the flotation is
expected to recommend holding off until 1995 or even 1996.
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech believe Matav should go to the stock market
once their revamp of the utility becomes visible to the market. Matav, which
is at the start of a Dollars 4bn investment programme, last week reported
after-tax profits of Ft1.6bn (Dollars 16m) for 1993 and expects only to
break even this year.
Moreover, an early flotation of Matav, one of Hungary's largest companies,
runs the risk of overwhelming the Budapest stock exchange, the least active
of the three main east European bourses.
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech fear a public offering this autumn could only
succeed if it were priced below the level investors paid at the end of last
year: Dollars 875m for a 30 per cent stake.
While it would be the AV RT that bears the direct loss, US regulations would
force Ameritech to value its investment at the prevailing market price and
make a write-off.
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech have little incentive to use a premature
flotation to increase their shareholdings, because their consortium has
effective control of Matav's operating committee and day-to-day management.
The Matav case exemplifies the difficulties inherent in the Hungarian
authorities' efforts to combine the sale of controlling stakes in state
companies to industry investors with later public offerings of its residual
shareholdings. French hotel group, Accor, has held back the flotation of the
Hungarian hotel chain Pannonia Hotels.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poor fund trading puts BK Vision
into the red
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK Vision, the investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group, tumbled into a SFr30.1m (Dollars 21.42m) loss in the first four
months of 1994 compared with a SFr9.9m profit in the same period last year.
The loss was mainly due to a severe turnround in the fund's trading
performance, from a SFr40.4m profit to a SFr3.9m loss.
The fund sold all of its shares in CS Holding, the financial group built
around Credit Suisse, during the period, apparently at a loss.
The CS Holding stake, consisting of 350,000 bearer shares, was acquired last
November in exchange for shares in CS subsidiary Leu Holding. Its market
value was SFr258m at the end of 1993, but the CS share price fell 18 per
cent in the first four months of 1994. Mr Ebner, BK chairman, signalled in
January that the fund would run down its CS holding. 'The tasks of an owner
shareholder cannot be credibly performed at two big Swiss banks
simultaneously,' he said.
BK Vision is the largest single shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland
with 5.6 per cent of the capital worth SFr1.95bn at the end of April.
The CS sale left BK Vision's SFr2.5bn portfolio at the end of April holding
securities of only two financial companies, UBS and Zurich Insurance.
The other factor in the fund's loss was a SFr20.1m charge for
administration. Substantially all of this was a performance-related fee to
BZ Trust, the fund's manager, for the fourth quarter of 1993. These fees
have been spectacularly high in recent years, reaching SFr250m in 1993.
However, since the end of January, the share price and net asset value of BK
Vision have been declining.
Mr Ebner pointed out that they were now substantially below the threshold
value of SFr1,758 on which future fees would be calculated. This means that
no fees are likely to be payable for some time.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Hobson has 53% take-up of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hobson, the vehicle for 28-year-old Mr Andrew Regan, yesterday reported the
take-up of 52.7 per cent of the shares available in last month's public and
open offer.
Shareholders yesterday also gave the go-ahead at an extraordinary general
meeting for the company's plan to buy the food manufacturing division of
Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited for Pounds 111m.
Swiss Bank Corporation, which fully placed shares worth Pounds 26.6m with
institutions on April 28, underwrote the public offer.
Mr Regan became chief executive after reversing Cadismark, his household
products business, into Hobson at the end of 1992. The shares, traded on the
USM, were suspended on February 10 at 27p pending the announcement of the
CWS deal. The acquisition is expected to be completed on Friday when
dealings in the new shares are expected to begin.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Racal pays Pounds 12.3m for Air Group
division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal Electronics has paid Pounds 12.3m for the information technology and
security division of Air Group, the multimedia and wireless communications
concern. Payment comprised Pounds 11.9m in cash and Pounds 376,854 in
shares.
The division, which includes three Airtech businesses, made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 8m last year. Racal said it intended to
combine the companies with its own IT security operations in Europe and the
US to create a new force in the business.
The new group, to be called Racal-Airtech, will be run by Mr Alan Lamb,
Airtech's existing managing director. It will have initial sales of Pounds
18m a year.
Racal expects revenues to double in three years. IT security has become an
important issue as the dangers of hacking, fraud, accidental damage and
operator errors in large computer networks have become apparent. The
worldwide business is estimated at Pounds 1bn and growing rapidly.
Mr Nick Randall, Air Group managing director, said the company would use the
proceeds of the sale to develop its interests in multimedia software, where
sales had grown from nil to Pounds 4m over four years, and the
communications industry.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Celtic Gold have been suspended at the company's request on news
that Claddagh Gold, its main shareholder, intends to sell its 54 per cent
stake to English Trust.
At the same time Celtic, the mineral and exploration company, announced a
rise in 1993 pre-tax losses from IPounds 160,321 to IPounds 302,002 (Pounds
298,980), after exceptional charges of IPounds 266,493 (IPounds 129,953)
relating mainly to gold exploration properties written off.
Mr Herb Stanley, executive chairman, said English Trust, an investment
management and corporate finance group, had indicated that it planned board
changes once the sale was completed.
In addition, English Trust would arrange a share placing in Celtic to raise
IPounds 520,000 at 17p per share on a 1-for-6 basis.
The company planned to dispose of Clare Calcite, its wholly owned
subsidiary, and also contemplated entering into talks for the acquisition of
a substantial financial services company.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exports help Kenwood rise 14% to Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher sales, continued cost control and improved results from overseas
subsidiaries were behind a 14.5 per cent rise in annual profits at Kenwood
Appliances, the household appliance maker which was floated in June 1992.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March rose from a pro forma Pounds 9.6m
to Pounds 11m, after Pounds 700,000 of exceptional charges. Turnover
increased by 19 per cent from Pounds 101.6m to Pounds 120.4m.
'We see these as very good results,' said Mr Tim Parker, chief executive,
adding: 'We can't see how things can be anything but better this year.'
Sales in the UK, its single biggest market, rose by 17 per cent to Pounds
41.2m. The company had 94 per cent of the UK tabletop food mixer market.
Waymaster, the water filter and kitchen scales maker acquired for Pounds
4.3m last October, contributed Pounds 524,000 to profits in the last five
months of the year, and is expected to bring in Pounds 1.5m this time.
The Hampshire-based group, which last month won a Queen's Award for Exports,
increased sales to continental Europe from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 44m, and
to the rest of the world from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 35.1m.
Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 6.6m, and is expected to
reach a total of Pounds 9m this year.
Mr Parker said the group was continuing to look for further opportunities to
expand.
Earnings rose to 20.8p (17.8p). A final dividend of 6p brings the total to
9p (7.8p). The shares rose 3p to 348p.
COMMENT
The results show solid progress on the back of sound acquisitions, and there
seems no reason why the maker of the Kenwood Chef mixer should not continue
to grow. It needs to be careful to protect the quality image of its single
brand when selling lower margin goods like kettles and toasters, where
competition is intense. Overseas distribution is being sorted out,
particularly in Germany, where the group has been severely underexposed.
With profits of Pounds 13.5m pencilled in for this year, the shares look
good value on a p/e of 13.5.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 275m provision warning in the air -
USAir's financial problems overshadow 'impressive' BA results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acute financial problems of USAir yesterday overshadowed the
announcement by British Airways of another set of impressive figures,
including pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m in its latest financial year.
In the worst case scenario, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, conceded that
BA may be forced to write-off its Pounds 275.3m investment in its 24.6 per
cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
However, he also said the partnership with USAir, a centrepiece in BA's
strategy of global alliances, was bringing benefits through the ticket
code-sharing agreement between the two carriers, the joint frequent flier
programme and cost saving opportunities.
These benefits totalled about Pounds 10m last year and were expected to rise
to Pounds 70m this year.
Even if USAir was forced to file under the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules,
the code-sharing and other co-operative ventures between the two carriers
would continue and so would the benefits from the increasing traffic feed
from USAir's domestic services into BA's international network.
However, should BA be forced to make heavy provisions to cover its USAir
investment, it would represent a significant setback for the carrier, both
financially and psychologically since it would raise fundamental questions
about the UK carrier's ambitious global strategy.
Sir Colin said USAir had been severely hit by increasing competition from
low-cost, low-fare airlines in its principal market in the north-east of the
US.
USAir incurred losses of Dollars 196.7m (Pounds 131m) in its first quarter
to March 31 1994 and the deficit for the whole year is now expected to
exceed last year's Dollars 349.4m.
The future of the airline now hinges on a restructuring programme aimed at
eliminating Dollars 1bn of costs a year.
Sir Colin explained that about Dollars 500m of the cost savings and revenue
enhancement measures would come from USAir management actions including the
quicker turnround of aircraft at airports.
The other Dollars 500m savings would have to come from union concessions on
work practices and salaries.
Sir Colin said there was 'a sense of urgency' to reach these agreements with
the unions during the next 90 days. He warned that if these negotiations
were not successful then BA would have to make a provision on its USAir
investment.
If USAir were forced to file for Chapter 11, it would hit the current Pounds
16m to Pounds 18m BA earns in annual dividends from its preferred stock in
USAir.
So far, BA has been cushioned from USAir's financial problems because its
24.6 per cent stake in the US carrier involves preferred shares.
BA sounded the first alarm bells about its USAir investment in March when it
announced it would not make any additional investments in the airline until
it had been reassured of the ongoing viability of the business.
In contrast to the problems facing its investment, BA said yesterday that
its partnerships with European airlines and Qantas of Australia were showing
encouraging signs.
Although both TAT, its French affiliate, and Deutsche BA, its German
partner, continued to lose money last year, the two carriers were improving
and would help strengthen BA's overall position in the newly-liberalised
European aviation market.
Qantas, for its part, was profitable and Sir Colin said he expected 'real
benefits' from BA's 25 per cent stake in the Australian carrier due to be
fully privatised over the next 13 months.
However, should the USAir restructuring and recovery programme fail, BA
risks being left with a gaping hole in its overall global airline strategy,
since the US market still accounts for about 40 per cent of world air
travel.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Right connection for European expansion -
Andrew Bolger on a US purchase that changed the horizons of Senior
Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flexible couplings and expansion joints may sound unglamorous, but these
products have transformed the strategy and prospects of Senior Engineering
Group.
Until recently, Senior was best known as a solid if rather unexciting
supplier of boilers and ductwork.
Yet the last two years have seen it withdraw from the mining equipment
business due to the shrinking of the UK coal industry. It has also stopped
competing for large turnkey power projects because of the consequent
reduction in coal-fired power generation.
More significantly, Senior has acquired a US business with a commanding
position in the US automotive market - a base from which the UK group has
started to expand into the European motors market through heavy investment.
Flexonics, which Senior bought for Pounds 28m in 1992, has a dominant
position in the US automotive market for flexible couplings and expansion
joints, used to reduce exhaust vibration and cut emissions. It will invest a
further Pounds 28m over the next two years in this business, which is
benefiting from tougher pollution controls.
Senior has won a contract which will be worth Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) over
four years to supply General Motors' fleet of light trucks with exhaust gas
returns (EGRs), pipes which reduce vehicle emissions by channeling fumes
back into the engine to be reburned.
Encouraged by Ford, one of its main customers, Senior has invested Pounds 8m
in building a factory in south Wales. The chart shows Senior Flexonic's
planned growth in production of exhaust connectors and EGRs, which is
expected to triple between 1993 and 1996.
Mr John Bell, who became Senior's chief executive in 1992, said: 'Flexonics
is the thing that has changed our horizons over the last two years. We need
to be influential in the markets we are in. We also need to be international
 -the world today requires that.'
Senior now has three divisions:
Engineered products, which includes Flexonics, made operating profits of
Pounds 10.6m on sales of Pounds 168m last year;
Thermal engineering, which made Pounds 8.5m on sales of Pounds 160m;
Construction services, which made Pounds 6.2m on sales of Pounds 63m.
The thermal engineering division supplies boilers and heat transfer
components for main power generation contracts. Mr Bell says the group 'has
stopped pretending' it is big enough to compete as a turnkey contractor with
the likes of Asea Brown Boveri and GEC Alsthom. Instead, 'we will
concentrate on components, and on being thermal engineering experts.'
Mr Bell says construction services is wrongly named - it really should be
called engineered air services. The business cannot be international in the
same way as Flexonics and thermal engineering, not least because it faces
huge international players at the smaller end of the air-conditioning
market. He says: 'We have niche businesses, tailor-making big thermal
systems for customers such as hospitals. We need to find sustainable
niches.'
It is, however, the opportunity that Flexonics has brought to the engineered
products division which mainly accounts for the outperformance by Senior's
shares against the market.
Flexonics, based near Chicago, was the creation of a single entrepreneur. Mr
Bell said of the owner: 'The reasons for the sale are now becoming clearer -
there is no way he would have been able to invest in the business in the way
we are now doing. There is luck in things. The opportunities have turned out
to be even greater than when we first bought it.'
One such opportunity was the close relationship which Flexonics had already
forged with Ford. When the US motors giant decided it was going to use
exhaust connectors in Europe, it wanted a partner to work on the design.
Ford talked to German and Japanese competitors but chose Flexonics, which is
sole supplier of connectors in the US to Ford and GM.
The Pounds 8m factory which Senior has built in south Wales was due to begin
production in 1995, but Senior opened it earlier than intended principally
to supply Ford's Mondeo. Senior can supply other manufacturers from the
plant, and Volvo and Saab are currently talking to the group - Volvo's
connectors are currently made by Flexonics in the US.
One advantage which Senior found from being a truly international player was
that the factory's location in Europe was genuinely 'mobile'  - so the group
attracted competing offers of investment aid from Ireland and the UK. The
Welsh plant opened early last year and now employs 60 people. By the time it
reaches its maximum employment level of 250 jobs in 1996, Senior will have
received a grant of Pounds 2m from the Welsh Development Agency - a quarter
of the total cost.
Senior emphasises that Flexonics has a broader product base than automotive,
even although that sector has grown from nothing to 36 per cent of its
output in the last five years.
Mr Bell said: 'Flexonics' roots are many and varied and our strength is
because of our expertise in pipework and connective services. That is what
gave us our opportunity.'
Senior Flexonics, which now includes the group'existing UK hose and flexible
tube businesses, also supplies the industrial, aerospace and medical
sectors. Mr Bell said recent acquisitions were designed to maintain the
balance of the group, even although automotive was forecast to grow so
rapidly.
In March, Senior launched a Pounds 65m rights issue to fund the expansion of
Flexonics and two simultaneously announced purchases. The group paid Pounds
10m for Metal Bellows, a US maker of welded diaphragm metal bellows for the
aerospace, semiconductor, medical and industrial markets. It also acquired
Christian Berghofer, a German manufacturer of flexible hoses and expansion
joints for Pounds 8m.
Senior is also on course to achieve another strategic aim: decreasing its
dependence on the UK market. Albert E Sharp, the stockbroker, estimates that
by 1995 only 50 per cent of the group's sales will be UK by origin - down
from 71 per cent in 1991.
The acquisition of Flexonics has given the group a great opportunity - not
only domination of the US automotive market, but pole position in the race
for the European market, where stricter environmental legislation is likely
to increase demand for similar products.
Mr Bell says: 'We are not short of opportunities. You do have to be
courageous - but you also have to keep your eye on where you are going.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Seton rises 39% as UK healthcare side grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seton Healthcare, the medical products and sports equipment group, said it
would concentrate for the next few years on the UK healthcare market, where
it was enjoying strong organic growth.
The Oldham-based company reported a 39 per cent increase in pre-tax profits,
from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.45m, in the year to February 28.
Sales rose by 28 per cent, from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 49.4m. Of that,
Pounds 1.7m came from acquisitions and Pounds 8m was contributed by the
Cupal businesses, bought at the end of 1992.
Mr Ian Cater, chief executive, said the contribution to group sales from
healthcare had risen from 61 per cent to 67 per cent.
Seton's concentration on community care and the over-the-counter products
was paying off in UK healthcare, which showed organic growth of 11 per cent.
Healthcare's operating profits rose from Pounds 5.99m to Pounds 7.86m.
Trading conditions were difficult in continental Europe, with sales to
Germany and Italy adversely affected by healthcare reforms. The focus of
European activity was being moved into community care and the OTC sectors.
The much smaller sports and leisure division increased sales by 9 per cent
to Pounds 5.5m. It increased market share and improved margins, lifting
operating profit by 16 per cent to Pounds 703,000.
During the year Seton spent Pounds 5.25m on OTC brands, including Waspeze,
an insect bite remedy, and Burneze, a burns treatment. Since the year-end, a
further Pounds 6.25m has been spent on dietary supplements and a range of
antacid products.
Gearing increased from 3 per cent to 36 per cent during the year, although
interest cover was a comfortable 28 times.
A new Pounds 5.4m distribution centre at Oldham has been completed on budget
and will become operational later this year.
Earnings per share rose by 17 per cent to 19.1p (16.3p).
A final dividend of 4.6p (4.1p) gives a total for the year of 6.5p (5.74p),
a rise of 13 per cent.
COMMENT
Seton's focus on OTC brands and community care through its sales force of
former nurses seems well suited to the prevailing trends, at least in the
UK. Self-medication now accounts for more than 30 per cent of sales. The
group has integrated the Cupal acquisitions smoothly and and marketing of
new brands has also paid off. The shares, up 6p to 318p yesterday, rose
swiftly after being floated at 130p in 1990. However, since peaking at 360p
last year, they have underperformed the market by more than 20 per cent as
healthcare stocks fell out of favour. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds
9.7m put Seton's shares on a prospective multiple of about 14 - which seems
undemanding for a group with such a timely focus.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Richards loss deepens to Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Richards, the Aberdeen-based textile manufacturer, widened from
Pounds 326,000 to Pounds 1.62m pre-tax for the six months ended March 31
1994.
The figure included provisions totalling Pounds 1.61m for the period. Before

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone halts launch due to demand
doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone is postponing the launch of a smaller company investment
trust because of doubts over the level of investor demand.
The Murray Acorn Trust earlier this month announced plans to raise up to
Pounds 60m to invest in small companies capitalised at up to Pounds 50m, and
some venture capital projects, such as management buy-ins.
But yesterday Mr Alastair Stewart, one of the intended managers of the fund,
said that after presentations to potential investors, the company decided
not to proceed.
'We did not have enough indications of institutional support to give us
confidence to continue with the public offer,' he said.
Plans for the launch could be revived at a later stage if market conditions
changed.
Mr Philip Middleton, investment trust analyst with Smith New Court, said he
was surprised at the development.
'Murray Johnstone is a capable management house,' he said.
However, he added that the current state of the market made it difficult to
launch new trusts. 'You are pushing water uphill to get an investment trust
away just with institutions, and the retail market has been very slack
recently. There have been a number of issues which have not been able to
raise the amount they wanted.'
Records were set earlier this year for the amount of money raised by new
investment trust issues, but since the first rise in US interest rates in
February, investors have been much more cautious.
The oversupply of funds in the smaller company and venture capital area may
also have been a factor.
Several new and established smaller company and venture capital trusts have
raised new funds recently, and the proposed Acorn launch was overshadowed by
the imminent flotation of 3i, the venture capital fund. 'A number of people
looked forward to the 3i issue and felt they might keep their powder dry for
that,' Mr Stewart said.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Steiner resigns from Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Steiner, Amstrad's sales and marketing director, yesterday
resigned from the consumer electronic group run by Mr Alan Sugar 'to persue
other interests.'
The company gave no other explanation for Mr Steiner's sudden departure
which was said to be 'amicable.'
Mr Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, originally recruited Mr Steiner
from Sansui Electronics in 1991 to take charge of Amstrad's sales and
marketing in mainland Europe and Australia.
Mr Steiner, an Italian in his late-40s, was formerly managing director of
Sansui Europe. During a long career in the electronics business, he has
worked for Olivetti of Italy, where he was concerned with the Acorn and
Triumph Adler business, and for Sony's German subsidiary.
He is the latest in a series of resignations from Amstrad in recent years,
and these include Mr Peter Thoms, the former finance director, who resigned
in July 1992, and Mr Robert Watkins, technical director, who resigned in
January 1993.
Mr Watkins, who left to join Binatone, the rival electronics group,
subsequently returned to take charge of Dancall Radio which Amstrad acquired
last September.
Amstrad, has been looking for a chief executive for the past 18 months, and
is expected to announce an appointment shortly.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: US expansion behind 46% rise at Domino
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Domino Printing Sciences yesterday rose 27p to 517p following a
sharp advance at the interim stage. The Cambridge-based printer manufacturer
is benefiting from heavy investment in the US where sales grew 49 per cent
in all sectors.
The group also announced the acquisition of certain assets and intellectual
property rights of Directed Energy for Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m), to be
satisfied by shares and up to Dollars 1.8m cash. The Californian company has
developed digital laser technology for use in the coding and marking market.
Profits before tax jumped 46 per cent from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 5.44m.
Earnings per share rose by the same percentage to 13.65p (9.35p). An interim
dividend of 3.2p is declared, 20 per cent ahead of last year's 2.65p.
Sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 37.6m). In the Americas,
where Domino's chief competition is Videojet, owned by GEC of the UK, sales
rose from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 14.2m. In Europe, however, they fell 10 per
cent to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 18.5m) while the UK was flat at Pounds 5.8m
(Pounds 5.7m).
There was an encouraging 22 per cent rise in the rest of the world from
Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 4.76m. The group performed particularly well in
Saudia Arabia, Dubai and Singapore.
PackTrack, the diversification into mimeographic printing, is near to break
even with sales in the first half of Pounds 674,000.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said his prediction at the end of last year that
the group would return to its traditional rates of growth and profitability
had been fulfilled.
The forward order book, worth Pounds 6m, was the best the group had
achieved, he added. 'We are confident that we will continue to grow profits
through the second half,' he said.
Domino traditionally makes most of its sales in the second six months of the
year and full year profits could be almost three times the interim figure.
The group is one of a small number of mainly UK-owned companies which
dominate the continuous ink-jet printing market. Continuous ink jet printers
are able to print on a variety of surfaces using different kinds of ink and
are able to withstand the rigours of the factory floor.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Growth report gives Celsis shares a fillip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celsis, the biotechnology company which was valued at Pounds 60m when it
came to the stock market in July 1993, saw a sharp rise in costs and sales
in the year to March 31.
Spending on research and development rose from Pounds 156,000 to Pounds
984,000 while a rise in the number of employees from 15 to 48 and the
associated costs of growth, took overheads from Pounds 349,000 to Pounds
1.3m.
The flotation proceeds lifted net current assets - an important figure for a
low-sales, high investment biotechnology company - to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds
770,000).
A pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.58m compared with a deficit of Pounds 460,000 for
the six months to end-March 1993.
The shares rose 4p to 91p compared with the flotation price of 100p that
gave a market capitalisation of Pounds 54.6m.
Mr John Precious, chairman, said the new financial year had started well.
New products were well on track.
For 1993-94, sales of the company's one product, a contamination detection
kit, increased by 46 per cent to Pounds 172,000. Fee income brought total
turnover to Pounds 274,000.
The contamination kit is used by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods
company and the Thames Water and Severn Trent water companies. Each kit
costs about Pounds 500 and is good for 500 tests, said Mr Chris Evans, the
company's founder and 26 per cent stakeholder.
What the company regards as potentially its biggest seller, the Digital kit
for detecting and quantifying low levels of contamination, is scheduled for
launch in the last quarter of 1994.
The company said that it had signed a collaborative deal with Wellcome, the
pharmaceuticals company, to determine the feasibility of using Celsis
technology in hygiene monitoring. It also launched a new product yesterday,
the Colony Counter, which automates part of the laboratory testing for
microbes.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Betterware makes Pounds 14m but warns on
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betterware, the direct home shopping group, yesterday reported a 3 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits held back by lower interest receipts
and the absence of a large exceptional gain in the year-ago period.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 14.1m in the year to 26th February, up
from Pounds 13.7m the previous year. This was broadly in line with forecasts
which had been sharply reduced during the year after the founding family
sold some of its stake and interim results showed a marked slowing of its UK
sales growth.
Turnover grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 56.3m) underpinned by a
14 per cent increase in UK sales which grew to Pounds 50.5m and a fourfold
increase of sales in France to Pounds 2.8m.
The pre-tax figure was struck after net interest receipts of Pounds 823,000,
down from Pounds 1.14m in the year-ago period. Profits in the year-ago
period were inflated by an exceptional Pounds 1.53m VAT credit.
Earnings per share increased to 9.4p (8.4p) helped by a lower tax charge of
Pounds 4.39m (Pounds 5.14m.) A proposed final dividend of 1.95p (1.5p) makes
a total for the year of up 30 per cent to 2.6p (2p.) The shares closed 5p
lower at 123p.
Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said it had been 'a challenging year' but
that Betterware had emerged stronger as a result of a series of steps
including the opening of a new Pounds 10m distribution centre near
Birmingham, the strengthening of the senior management and further expansion
in Continental Europe.
Operating profits increased by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 12.5m),
but excluding the VAT refunds, underlying operating profits grew by 19 per
cent. UK margins were higher helped by a greater emphasis on product
development.
The UK average order level held steady at around Pounds 8 compared with
Pounds 13 in the French operations which were started two years ago and made
around Pounds 300,000 in profits last year, and Pounds 10 in Spain where
Betterware began door-to-door sales in September. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief
executive, said the group plans to begin operations in Germany and will
invest about Pounds 1m.
COMMENT
The group has a twin strategy for maintaining margins and growing sales in
the maturing UK market. It is driving down costs by designing more efficient
tools for its outsourced manufacturing while trying to encourage its
customers to spend more by offering free give-aways with larger orders. The
real engine for growth should be continental Europe. Pre-tax profits are
likely to edge up to about Pounds 14.5m this year, producing flat earnings
of some 9.5p. A year ago Betterware was a soaraway stock trading on a
forward multiple of 24, but the shares have fallen sharply in the past 12
months as the reality of slower UK growth sunk in and the Cohens sold some
of their shares. They are now trading on a mundane prospective p/e of 12.9,
a cautious rating reflecting challenges at home and abroad.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 61m buy for Tops Estates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tops Estates, which in January paid Pounds 14m for two shopping centres in
Lancashire, yesterday announced the acquisition of the Bond Street shopping
centre in Leeds from Guardian Properties for Pounds 61m.
It also reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 2.37m in the
year to March 31. Rental income expanded to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 10.6m),
while property outgoings rose to Pounds 720,000 (Pounds 499,000).
The centre was opened in 1977 and occupies a 2.5 acre site in the centre of
the city. The consideration is to be financed initially through new bank
facilities 'negotiated for the purpose', the company said.
Most of the centre will be retained for investment giving a current rental
income of about Pounds 3.5m but a part, valued at about Pounds 12m and
providing income of Pounds 680,000, will be sold.
The pre-tax figure included Pounds 494,000 of profits from the sale of a
property acquired during the year for disposal. Interest took Pounds 10.7m
(Pounds 7.49m).
Earnings per share rose to 4.53p (4.4p) and the final dividend is lifted to
a proposed 1.6p (1.5225p) for a total of 2.2064p (2.1p), a rise of 5 per
cent.
The group's investment portfolio was independently valued at Pounds 234m at
the period end, compared with a valuation of Pounds 191m 12 months earlier.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Slow start hits Ladbroke shares - Decrease
in large bets on credit leaves gaming division lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of significant bets on credit made by high spending customers
with Ladbroke fell in the first few months of the year hitting profits in
its betting and gaming division.
Shares in the hotels, betting and DIY group fell 16 1/2 p yesterday to close
at 182 1/2 p after Mr John Jackson, chairman, told the annual meeting that
overall group profits were 'currently below last year's level'.
Credit betting 'had a poor start to the year', he said, and the division's
profits were lower than last year.
Credit betting is thought to account for about a quarter of the division's
turnover. The peaks and troughs of credit gambling are similar to those
faced by top casinos, which can rely on a tiny number of high spending
customers for a large proportion of their profits.
Mr Jackson said that the UK retail betting business had performed reasonably
well, helped by the successful running of the 1994 Grand National. Both the
average amount staked and the number of bets were ahead in the first four
months, lifting turnover by 5 per cent.
The shares hit 208p shortly after the announcement of the preliminary
results in early March, before retreating to 181p in early May. They started
to climb to Friday's close of 199p in the hope of some good news from the
AGM.
However, the chairman's statement at the London Hilton yesterday morning
proved to be disappointing.
Mr Jackson warned that while Texas Homecare sales were 3.5 per cent higher
compared with the first four months of last year, profits were significantly
lower.
Operating profits at Hilton International were slightly ahead, with overall
occupancy similar to last year and better average room rates.
The property division experienced reduced rental income following disposals.
Negotiation on further sales continue, and the group would be making further
progress in reducing its investment in commercial property for the rest of
this year.
Ladbroke was emerging from a period of considerable change, Mr Jackson said.
While profits were below last year's levels, 'they are in line with the
board's expectations. The board continues to look forward to the future with
confidence'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NHL in the black and to resume lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, yesterday announced it
would resume residential mortgage lending after a three-year absence,
following its return to profitability.
The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m for the six months ended
March 31, against losses of Pounds 26.1m.
Mr Jonathan Perry, executive chairman, said the company had seen
'substantial reductions in provisions, repossessions and bad debts' and that
a resumption of lending was now 'an obvious step'.
NHL's mortgage portfolio has fallen from a peak of more than Pounds 3bn to
Pounds 1.8bn, and consequently net interest income was down at Pounds 32.1m
(Pounds 35.8m).
However, operating expenses fell from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 11.8m, helped
by disposals, while provisions for losses fell by almost Pounds 30m to
Pounds 20.5m.
Accounts that are more than 3 months in arrears have fallen by more than
half to 1,516. With the mortgage book under control and being rapidly
depleted, the company has decided to make a push for new business.
It has signed a long-term lending facility with Abbey National, which will
provide initial funding for its mortgage portfolio, but this will be
refinanced through securitisation.
Intermediaries are still estimated to account for more than one third of the
mortgage market and NHL is confident it can regain access to this network.
Mr Perry said NHL could compete with the building societies because their
cost of capital had increased with competition for deposits, while NHL had
the advantage of lower costs through the absence of a retail network.
Renewed lending represents the second leg of NHL's strategy for recovery,
and the third leg, a financial restructuring, is promised this year.
The company still has negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 32m and
preference share dividends are Pounds 20.3m in arrears.
A rights issue is also considered likely.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.4p (29.1p losses). The shares rose 1/2p to
23 1/2p.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kunick expects to resume dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kunick, the fruit machine company which earlier this year floated its
nursing homes division, expects to return to the dividend list after a
three-year absence.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said he was 'confident we will pay a
dividend at the year-end', barring unforeseen circumstances. Kunick
suspended payments in 1992 when recession and the restructuring of the UK
pubs industry hit profits in the leisure division.
Mr Burnett was speaking at the company's interim results announcement, which
showed a 50 per cent increase in profits before tax and exceptional gains to
Pounds 3.1m. There was an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.9m, after goodwill
write-offs, on the flotation of Goldsborough Healthcare in March.
Sales fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 47.8m in the six months to March 31.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 5m (Pounds 2.1m) and earnings per share came
through at 1.07p (0.26p losses).
Mr Burnett said the group had begun to see some recovery in its core leisure
business, while plans for Kunick's future strategy were well advanced.
Kunick is thought to be planning to develop its trial games arcade operation
in Leeds along theme park lines, using proceeds from the Goldsborough
flotation. Mr Burnett said Kunick would announce details of its commercially
sensitive strategy in the second half.
He reiterated that the group's efforts to refocus on its core amusement
machine business had begun to pay off.
The amusement machines division had increased operating profits by 10 per
cent to Pounds 2.5m in spite of the fact that consumers were not spending
any more in pubs. Cost-cutting and new types of machines helped profits in
the UK, he said.
The discount retail business in France survived a severe price war to report
a 6 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 731,000.
The four remaining nursing homes in France increased profits by 54 per cent
to Pounds 522,000, with occupancy levels running at 97 per cent. Mr Burnett
said that business would be sold at some stage.
The Goldsborough disposal also left the group with a strengthened balance
sheet. Kunick raised Pounds 25.6m from its share of the nursing homes
business, jointly owned with NatWest Ventures. Net cash was Pounds 6.9m at
the half-year, against debt of Pounds 17m last time.

7.59m. Turnover fell from Pounds 84.4m to Pounds 80.9m, including Pounds
17.8m from discontinued activities.
The result benefited from lower interest charges of Pounds 4.6m (Pounds

The figures took account of the disposal of the lighting activities of the
film and television section and the cessation of trading by D Pavis.
There was a pre-interest profit on continuing activities of Pounds 1.92m.

<TEXT>
For the nine months to December 31, Kelt Energy, the oil and gas exploration
and production company, achieved net profits of Pounds 4.43m, equivalent to
earnings per share of 3p.
The company has changed its year end; profits in the previous 12 months were
Pounds 4.77m for earnings of 3.3p.
On turnover of Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 21.4m) operating profits were Pounds
5.78m (Pounds 6.56m). The pre-tax result was Pounds 5.05m (Pounds 5.68m).
A 1p dividend is recommended with an enhanced scrip alternative.
Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said that Kelt's profile had changed
considerable over the past two years with an expansion of its activities
overseas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The closure of its County Down trouser factory left Albion, the
Belfast-based men's wear company, with pre-tax profits substantially lower
at Pounds 291,673 in the six months to March 31, against Pounds 507,940.
There was a charge of Pounds 250,000 relating to the closure. The shares
fell 17p to 96p.
Turnover advanced 47 per cent to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 9.14m), mainly
reflecting the acquisition of Maitland Menswear. However, with margins cut
to maintain market share, operating profits were only 7 per cent higher at
Pounds 541,673 (Pounds 507,940).
Earnings per share were 5.6p (9.6p) and the interim dividend is maintained
at 1.6p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in S Daniels yesterday fell 10p to 64p as the supplier to the food
manufacturing and baking industries warned of a loss for the first half of
the current year.
The group had returned to profit of Pounds 63,000 in 1993 after incurring a
succession of losses.
Mr Paul Daniels, chairman and chief executive, said pressure on margins
remained intense as competition intensified. Several group development
projects were under way but these would not impact on the interim result, he
said.
As a result of this setback Mr Daniels was reviewing operations and had
started looking for a group chief executive.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Manchester United scores in VCI's Pounds
28m flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VCI, the videos and pre-recorded music publisher, yesterday marked the
publication of its flotation pathfinder document by launching 10 titles
devoted to aspects of Manchester United's league and cup double.
Mr Steve Ayres, chief executive, who hopes the company will be capitalised
at more than Pounds 60m, cited the launch of the football titles 10 days
after the cup final as the example of VCI's speed and flexibility.
'We will probably sell about 200,000 Manchester United videos across the 10
titles,' said Mr Ayres, who pioneered the video sell-through - sale rather
than rental - market in the UK.
The company hopes to raise a net Pounds 28m through a placing and
intermediaries offer to repay debt incurred in the management buy-out with
directors selling 30 per cent of their 17 per cent stake in the company.
Mr Ayres has a 4.9 per cent stake which should be worth Pounds 1.5m to
Pounds 2m as a result of the float.
In the year to December 31 1993, VCI made operating profits of Pounds 5.9m
before exceptional items on turnover of Pounds 59.8m. However, operating
profit for 1992 was Pounds 2.3m, down from Pounds 5.2m.
Mr Ayres blamed the 1992 fall on problems at Strand Magnetics, its
manufacturing arm, and the write-offs on childrens' programming following
the entry of Disney into the market.
Strand was closed and its business sold to Rank. VCI videos aimed at
children concentrate on pre-school titles such as Thomas the Tank Engine and
Sooty.
'The publishing businesses have a fantastic track record and it's the
publishing businesses we are floating. The rest have long since gone,' said
Mr Ayres, who added he had decided that now was the right timing for a
float.
VCI was set up in 1985 and is one of the largest of the independent
publishers. It has sold a total of 44m video cassettes in the UK alone.
Next month, coinciding with the float, VCI will begin its move into personal
computer software for the first time with games and educational titles.
The offer is being sponsored by Samuel Montagu with James Capel acting as
brokers.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Betterware makes Pounds 14mbut warns on
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betterware, the direct home shopping group, yesterday reported a 3 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits held back by lower interest receipts
and the absence of a large exceptional gain which bolstered the previous
year's figures.
Profits for the year to February 26 increased from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds
14.1m on turnover which grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 63.2m (Pounds 56.3m).
The growth in turnover was underpinned by a 14 per cent increase in UK sales
which rose to Pounds 50.5m and a fourfold increase of sales in France to
Pounds 2.8m.
The pre-tax result included net interest receipts of Pounds 823,000 (Pounds
1.14m) while the comparable profit figure was inflated by an exceptional
Pounds 1.53m VAT credit.
Earnings increased to 9.4p (8.4p) helped by a lower tax charge of Pounds
4.39m (Pounds 5.14m). A proposed final dividend of 1.95p makes a 2.6p (2p)
total. The shares closed 5p lower at 123p.
Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said it had been 'a challenging year' but
that Betterware had emerged stronger as a result of a series of steps
including the opening of a new Pounds 10m distribution centre near
Birmingham, the strengthening of senior management and further expansion in
continental Europe.
Operating profits increased by 5.5 per cent to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 12.5m).
However, excluding the VAT refund underlying operating profits grew by 19
per cent.
UK margins were higher, helped by a greater emphasis on product development.
The UK average order level held steady at about Pounds 8. That compared with
Pounds 13 in the French operations, which were started two years ago and
made about Pounds 300,000 in profits last year, and Pounds 10 in Spain where
Betterware began door-to-door sales in September.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said the group plans to begin operations
in Germany in the current financial year and will invest about Pounds 1m in
the start-up.
Commenting on the outlook Mr Goldsmith cautioned that sales in the first
quarter had been held back by start-up problems at the new distribution
centre, although he said these had now been resolved. He added that sales
were also affected by 'the consumer uncertainty' of recent weeks but said
sales were now showing 'a distinctly more positive picture'.
COMMENT
The years of strong growth in the maturing UK market are probably over but
the group plans to maintain UK margins by encouraging customers to increase
their average spend and by cutting its purchase costs. However, the real
engine for future growth should be the new operations in continental Europe.
Against this, teething problems at Birmingham and other factors have hit
sales and orders at the start of the current year. Overall, pre-tax profits
are likely to edge higher to about Pounds 14.5m this year producing earnings
of 9.5p. The shares have fallen sharply over the past year and are now
trading on a reasonable prospective p/e of 12.9.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Fox builds base in US TV via Dollars 500m New World deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's plan to challenge the supremacy of the big three US
television networks took a big step forward yesterday. His Fox television
unit announced an alliance with the entertainment group New World
Communications that will provide Fox with up to 12 new local television
stations across the US.
Mr Murdoch trumpeted the deal as the 'greatest realignment of television
station affiliations in the 60-year history of American broadcasting'. Fox
is investing Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) in New World in return for a 20-25
per cent stake and an agreement that 12 New World stations will change their
affiliations to Fox from ABC, CBS and NBC. Although Fox already has
relationships with television stations in the cities where the New World
affiliates operate, it said the 12 New World stations all had larger shares
of their local markets. Once the deal is completed, Fox will have 184
affiliate stations in the US. ABC, CBS and NBC have more than 200 each.
The other networks reacted stoically to the news that Fox had lured 12 of
their affiliates into its camp.
Mr Robert Wright, president of NBC, admitted that the Fox-New World alliance
would 'change the landscape', but Mr Robert Iger, president of ABC
Television, said that it was too soon the gauge the implications of the
'significant change' wrought by the deal.
The New World deal is the latest move in Mr Rupert Murdoch's battle to build
Fox into a nationwide network. When he set up Fox in 1987 with only a
handful of affiliate stations, observers doubted whether Fox would seriously
challenge established networks. But Fox has expanded rapidly and now claims
coverage of 95 per cent of the national television market. Although Fox's
ratings share of the national market began to decline in 1992, the network
has continued to pursue growth. Last December it outbid two of the three
networks to win the rights to broadcast the National Football Conference of
American football, the country's most popular televised sport.

FT  24 MAY 94 / BA surges but warns on USAir: Pre-tax profits up 63% -
Return of business traffic. Further gains expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday reported a 63 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
more than Pounds 300m for the year to March, but warned it may have to make
provisions on a Pounds 275.3m investment in USAir, its troubled US partner.
The future of BA's 24.6 per cent stake in USAir remains the biggest cloud
over the UK carrier's short-term prospects. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chairman, said USAir's future hinged on it negotiating concessions from its
labour force. If this was not achieved, BA directors believed a provision
for permanent diminution in the book value of the investment would be
necessary.
Sir Colin described the airline's overall performance as a 'significant
improvement' in a highly competitive market. He added that BA expected to
show a 'further recovery in earnings' this year.
Annual pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 301m, compared with Pounds 185m in
1992-93. In the last quarter, BA made a Pounds 1m pre-tax profit, turning
around a Pounds 62m loss, with operating profits of Pounds 55m against a
Pounds 25m loss.
Sir Colin said BA's performance contrasted with the rest of the airline
industry, which last year lost Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.7bn) on international
scheduled services.
BA's progress reflected its cost-cutting drive, increased revenues and a 6
per cent recovery in first and business class traffic.
Turnover rose 13.2 per cent to Pounds 6.3bn, while operating profits
increased 60 per cent to Pounds 496m.
BA carried 30.6m passengers last year, up 8.9 per cent. Gains were made
across all its routes, with European services showing a Pounds 69m operating
profit; the Americas Pounds 129m; Africa, the Middle East and Indian
sub-continent Pounds 203m; and the Far East and Australasia Pounds 95m.
However, disruption caused by the IRA terrorist attacks on Heathrow airport
in March cost the airline about Pounds 10m.
Among its global alliances, only Qantas, the Australian airline, was making
any money. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's managing director, said improvements were
expected at the French affiliate TAT, following the launch of a
restructuring and job cutting programme, and at the German affiliate
Deutsche BA.
Overall, losses from associates declined by Pounds 6m to Pounds 11m last
year. The losses at TAT and Deutsche BA were offset by BA's share of profits
from Qantas and by preferred dividends from USAir amounting to Pounds 16m.
USAir's losses are not consolidated.
Earnings per share totalled 31.3p, against 23.1p. A final dividend of 7.92p
gives a total of 11.10p, up 9.3 per cent.
BA employees will receive a share of the profits equal to 1.08 weeks' basic
pay in cash or shares, or a total of Pounds 21m. The last profit-sharing was
for 1991-92 when employees received two weeks' pay.

FT  24 MAY 94 / A grown-up step into the baby food market: Sandoz sees its
purchase of Gerber as a chance to balance its pharmaceuticals activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives of Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, were at
pains yesterday to emphasise that splashing out Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn)
for a baby foods company did not mean that they were downgrading their
commitment to drugs. 'If a good opportunity to take over a pharma company
came along, we would do that too,' it said.
But Sandoz's purchase of Gerber Food Products suggests it is not as
confident as its Basle neighbour Roche in the future of the increasingly
turbulent pharmaceuticals business. Roche made a Dollars 5.3bn offer for
Syntex, a US drugs company, three weeks ago, and Mr Fritz Gerber, Roche
chairman, reaffirmed his conviction that the research-based pharmaceutical
business would continue to offer excellent profit potential.
By contrast, Mr Marc Moret, Sandoz chairman, spoke of 'achieving a better
balance of our activities,' at his group's annual meeting three weeks ago.
Sandoz officials pointed out yesterday that the nutrition business, in
contrast with drugs, was not capital intensive and was free from the sharp
cyclical swings of the group's existing agricultural and industrial
chemicals businesses.
Assuming the acquisition goes through, the drugs arm's share of Sandoz sales
will decline from 49 to 44 per cent while nutrition's share will rise from
11 to 20 per cent, surpassing the industrial chemicals division to become
the group's second largest division.
The nutrition business includes special diets and feeding systems for the
ill and the aged, performance foods and drinks for athletes, and baby foods.
Each product line has its own manufac-turing process and is likely to go
through a different distribution channel. The only common factor is the
perception of quality that enables suppliers to charge high prices. 'The
important thing is to be in segments where you do not have to compete with
the food giants,' says Mr Raymund Breu, Sandoz finance director.
Sandoz got into nutrition in 1967 with the acquisition of Wander, the maker
of Ovaltine. Today, about 40 per cent of the division's sales come from
clinical nutrition and health foods, 22 per cent from Ovaltine and other
food drinks, 26 per cent from baked goods and 5 per cent from sports drinks.
Until last year, it looked as if the group was going to concentrate on the
high specification 'nutriceutical' sectors, taking advantage of its
pharmaceutical research and development skills. However, it then moved to
build up consumer products, acquiring the Dutch Reforma group, Holland's
largest producer of rice crackers and other cereal products with annual
sales of Fl 42.4m (Pounds 15m). Sandoz also entered into a joint venture
with Gazzoni, an Italian producer of health foods with annual sales
equivalent to SFr180m (Pounds 85m).
The Gerber takeover would be a giant step further in this direction,
providing Sandoz with a strong US platform for its own nutrition products.
However, as with Roche's bid for Syntex, questions will be asked about the
53 per cent premium over market value being offered for Gerber.
Gerber commands more than 70 per cent of the US baby food market and usually
achieves a very high return on its capital. Recently, however, it has been
struggling to maintain sales. Yesterday it reported a decline in turnover
from Dollars 1.27bn to Dollars 1.17bn for the year to March. Net profits
fell from Dollars 132.8m to Dollars 113.6m.
The company's main difficulty has been a decline in the number of American
babies. Gerber has attempted to counter the impact of this trend by
introducing products such as foods that bridge the gap between infant gruel
and grown-up food. Its Gerber Graduates, introduced in 1991, are small
microwave dishes such as chicken stew with noodles.
It has also tried to target groups with higher birth rates. The Tropical
line, for example - made with fruits such as papayas and mangoes - is aimed
at Hispanics, who also tend to buy more ready-made baby food than other
groups.
Neither effort, however, has enjoyed much success and Gerber has had to
contend with battles for US market share with its two main competitors,
Ralston Purina's Beech-Nut division and HJ Heinz, leading to price cuts and
higher marketing costs.
To analysts like Mr Les Pugh of Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street securities
house, it has long seemed that Gerber's best opportunities for growth lay in
developing countries where birth rates are still high.
Gerber itself has belatedly realised this, and now sells its products in at
least 30 countries. But it has also realised that it would take many years
to build up an adequate international distribution infrastructure.
Both Gerber and Sandoz hope that the Swiss company will be able to provide
that infrastructure quickly, and so restore growth. But existing suppliers
in those markets, such as Nestle, are unlikely to give up their positions
easily.

FT  24 MAY 94 / BAT puts new shape on Eagle Star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries yesterday announced the departure of Mr John Bishop as
chairman of its Eagle Star Insurance subsidiary, in a management
reorganisation which signals a shift in its approach to the increasingly
competitive general and life insurance markets.
Mr Stephen Melcher, currently chairman of Eagle Star Life, becomes chief
executive of Eagle Star, taking control of both life and general insurance
businesses. Alongside other management changes, the aim is to strengthen the
Eagle Star 'brand', increase control over distribution and raise the profile
of Far East and other international operations.
Mr George Greener, chairman of Eagle Star, said customers were looking for a
powerful brand to meet all their insurance needs, 'so it is logical for us
to respond by restructuring our organisation and appointing a chief
executive'. Mr Melcher would be a 'brand manager' for the whole of Eagle
Star.
Mr Paul Swinburn, director of corporate communications, said: 'We went down
the road of trying to build different companies. There is a sense in which
these companies need some independence, but frankly it had gone too far.
People picked up the ball and ran off the field with it.'
Eagle Star said it aimed to tighten links with the intermediaries - or
retailers - who sell its products, increasing speculation that BAT may take
over a building society. 'The idea that you can abdicate control over
distribution to a third party is fundamentally flawed,' said Mr Swinburn.
It will also give a higher profile to its telephone motor insurance
operation, Eagle Star Direct.
Mr Greener said the restructuring recognised growing similarities between
businesses in the EU, and developments by the company in fast growing
insurance markets in the Far East.
Mr Pierre Chartrand is to become managing director of the Far East life and
general business - in Hong Kong, Singapore, China and Taiwan - reporting
directly to Mr Greener.
Mr Clive Coates, finance director, becomes deputy chairman, and chairman of
the South African subsidiary.
Mr Bishop joined Eagle Star from Sun Alliance about three years ago.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Exco float shows leap in value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco, the fixed-income and money broking arm of British &amp; Commonwealth
Holdings, is to return to the stock market almost eight years after it was
bought by the finance group which collapsed in 1990.
Exco is expected to carry a stock market value of more than Pounds 200m,
enabling B&amp;C's administrators to raise at least Pounds 80m from the
flotation. This compares with the Pounds 75m value attached to the business
in June 1992, when 60 per cent was sold to institutions and senior staff
after flotation plans were scrapped. One analyst said: 'The big profits have
already been made by the investors who bought in during 1992.' But the
company argues a push into emerging markets, combined with new products,
should enhance profitability.
Exco has seen profits surge in the past two years, spurred on by increased
activity in the foreign exchange and debt markets in which it operates.
Pre-tax profits rose 52 per cent to Pounds 41.5m in 1993.
Subject to pricing, B&amp;C will sell its entire 40 per cent holding. Other
shareholders - senior employees own 15 per cent and Caledonia Investments
owns 27.4 per cent - have yet to decide.
Exco operates a 24-hour global business, with offices in Tokyo, London and
New York - the last accounted for more than half of last year's profits.
Moneybroking operations, which include spot foreign exchange, money markets
and derivatives, all increased profits last year but have been affected by
fierce competition.
The fixed interest operations had an excellent year against a background of
declining interest rates and high levels of government deficit funding.
Exco's profits are reliant on market volatility to generate the turnover on
which it earns commission. It is a cyclical business and profits fell from
1987 to 1991. However, it remained profitable throughout the recession and
its global diversification helps cushion earnings.
Salaries account for around 65 per cent of operating costs and these grew 26
per cent to Pounds 109m last year. Intense competition in the industry is
likely to put further pressure on profit margins.
NM Rothschild is sponsor to the issue, while Kleinwort Benson Securities has
been appointed as brokers. The flotation will be priced before the end of
June.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Russia and Ukraine struggle to resolve crisis in Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers yesterday failed to
resolve the gathering crisis in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, but were due
to resume today with the participation of a senior official from Crimea
itself.
The talks in Moscow, prompted by fears that constitutional changes made by
the Crimean regional parliament last week could draw Russia and Ukraine into
conflict, had apparently made little headway. Ukraine sees growing
secessionist sentiment in the pro-Russian Crimean parliament as a direct
challenge to its sovereignty over the peninsula.
Mr Mykhalo Mykhalchenko, domestic policy adviser to the Ukrainian president
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, said last night that there was no possibility that the
Ukrainian government would agree even to a federal arrangement with Crimea,
let alone the near-independent status it voted for itself last week.
'We are not a federal state like Russia - we are a unitary state. We do not
sign treaties with our regions,' he said.
However, there was a concession to Crimea's status implicit in it being
represented in the talks today.
The move appeared to show the relative weakness of Ukraine in the talks,
which are attempting to settle the contested ownership of the Crimea-based
Black Sea naval fleet.
The agenda also includes economic co-operation between Crimea and Russia,
and the decision last Friday by the Crimean parliament to adopt a virtually
independent constitution, creating a Crimean citizenship and deciding to
conduct relations with Kiev by treaty.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who is in Moscow for talks
with the country's leaders, said last night he had been assured by Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, that Crimea's status as part of Ukraine
was not in doubt.
A report that some 20 Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers had been sent to
a position near the Crimean capital of Simferopol was confirmed yesterday by
the Crimean authorities - though they said it was a 'normal' movement of
armour.
At the same time, a spokesman for the extreme Ukrainian nationalist UNA-Unso
group in Lviv, in western Ukraine, said that some 200 volunteers were being
despatched to Crimea to help secure it as part of Ukraine.
Parallel to the prime ministerial talks in Moscow, negotiations will start
today in Kiev between senior parliamentarians from Crimea and their opposite
numbers in the Ukrainian parliament. The prospects for agreement are poor.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Herzog to be German president: Victory will boost Christian
Democrats' election prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roman Herzog, president of the German constitutional court, was yesterday
elected as the next president of Germany, in spite of a split within the
ranks of the ruling coalition.
After three rounds of voting in the 1,320-strong federal assembly, Mr
Herzog, 60, the country's most senior judge and a member of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, emerged with a clear victory over
Mr Johannes Rau, the Social Democrat prime minister of the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia.
The final count of 696 votes to 605 in the German Reichstag building in
Berlin cleared the way for Mr Herzog to succeed President Richard von
Weizsacker in the largely ceremonial, but very visible and symbolic post of
head of state on July 1.
His victory will give an important boost to the electoral hopes of the CDU,
and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union, its conservative sister party,
for the coming European and national elections, as well as 14 other state
and local polls.
However, it only came about after a split within the ranks of the Free
Democratic party, the minority liberal party in the ruling coalition, which
saw two-thirds of the party voting for Mr Herzog, and one-third for Mr Rau.
Mr Herzog, a Bavarian Protestant with a reputation as an independently
minded conservative, both as a constitutional lawyer and former interior
minister, gave a tearful acceptance speech after becoming the first German
president to be elected in a united federal assembly.
'We never thought that such a moment would have been possible again in our
lives,' he said, reminding his audience that when the last west German
president was elected in Berlin, in 1969, the East German communist
government closed the border in protest.
He appealed to both east and west Germans to overcome the barriers between
them in the process of unification.
'I will do everything possible to be the federal president of all Germans,'
he said. 'There are many barriers in our state and our society which we must
overcome. But there is an enormous amount in common which binds us all.' He
called on west Germans to make further material sacrifices for the sake of
unification, saying they amounted to 'compensation for the injustice of
world history' which left Germany divided at the river Elbe.
The way ahead was less certain than it had been five or 10 years ago, he
said, 'but we Germans have the strength, we Europeans have the strength, to
find this way and follow it'.
The key to the outcome of the election was the way in which the FDP would
vote, between Mr Herzog and the left-of-centre Mr Rau. Leading liberal
members of the FDP had expressed the fear that Mr Herzog would present too
conservative a face of Germany to the outside world.
Mr Herzog's victory was not in doubt once the division in the ranks of the
FDP became clear. The 109-strong party group split 69 to 40 in favour of Mr
Herzog. The CDU/CSU candidate had a clear lead in all three rounds of
voting, but lacked the absolute majority needed to be elected in the first
two rounds.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Immigration rules changed for wealthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign millionaires willing to invest in Britain will be allowed to bypass
the usual immigration rules to enter the UK, the government announced last
night.
Mr Charles Wardle, home office minister, said the government planned to
create a new category for 'entrepreneurial investors' to boost investment in
the UK.
Overseas investors who prove they have Pounds 1m at their disposal and agree
to invest Pounds 750,000 in government bonds, shares or corporate bonds will
be allowed to enter the UK for a year.
They will have the opportunity of extending their stay for three years, and
then indefinitely, if they can prove they have invested the necessary funds.
Investors and their dependants must also be able to live in the UK without
taking employment, other than in their own businesses, or seeking public
funds.
A Home Office spokesman said: 'Wealthy potential immigrants willing to
invest in Britain will be allowed to bypass usual immigration rules because
it will be of direct benefit to the economy.'
However, the changes, which come into force in October, were attacked by the
Labour party which said they would benefit millionaires to the detriment of
ordinary people.
Mr Graham Allen, Labour's shadow home office minister, said: 'Under these
arrangements, if you are a millionaire, you will get in. If you are an
ordinary person, a husband trying to reunite with his wife, for instance, it
is a lot tougher.
'I would like to know who these millionaires are. Who will be granted access
to the UK? Will they include the drug barons . . . and those involved in
financial scandals?'
Minsters accused Labour of being 'fundamentally anti-business' in opposing
the measures which they said were designed to promote investment.
However, some Tory backbenchers privately voiced 'strong reservations' about
the changes and said they would ask the Home Office for guarantees that it
would not allow any millionaire to enter the UK irrespective of his or her
background.
The Home Office also denied accusations that the changes were aimed at
allowing 'rich Hong Kong businessmen' a fast entry into the UK after 1997.
It said wealthy Hong Kong businessmen would be able to take advantage of the
new rules like anyone else.

FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Exco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco's management must be hoping that its second coming as a quoted company
will be less hair-raising than the first. Having been swallowed up by
British &amp; Commonwealth in 1986, the money broker was left in limbo when B&amp;C
collapsed. While the question of ownership was partially resolved by a
placing of shares with institutions two years ago, B&amp;C's administrators are
keen to cash in their remaining chips. Since Exco increased earnings by more
than half last year, the timing for a flotation looks auspicious.
Investors will have to decide whether the company is being offered at a
cyclical profits peak or near the start of a prolonged recovery. Exco
delivered steady growth through the 1980s, but that was an era of expansion.
Growth opportunities are now less obvious. While money market turnover
should continue to grow, commissions are being squeezed. Yet Exco's spread
across time zones and financial markets should help iron out the worst of
the volatility in earnings. If management can keep a grip on costs, there
must be a fair chance that profits will rise from here.
Without much segmental information or an idea of what dividend Exco will
pay, valuation is difficult. Assuming the company will use its strong cash
flow to support a decent yield, though, a multiple of at least 10 times last
year's earnings or a market value a shade more than Pounds 200m would look
fair value.
Caledonia Investments, the Cayzer family vehicle which sold out of B&amp;C while
the going was good, would then again have shown impeccable timing. The 27
per cent stake it bought from the administrators two years ago would have
trebled in value.

FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Sandoz/Gerber
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong currency, cheap money and virtually non-existent gearing have made
foreign acquisitions irresistible to the Swiss. Sandoz's Dollars 3.7bn
agreed purchase of US baby food manufacturer Gerber is only the latest
example. This month has also seen fellow pharmaceuticals group Roche bid
Dollars 5.3bn for Syntex as well as foreign moves by Nestle and Holderbank.
Though Gerber may not look expensive when viewed through Swiss lenses, the
acquisition seems thin on industrial logic. Sandoz's own nutrition business
mainly sells to health-conscious adults through specialist health food
stores, while Gerber sells baby food through supermarkets. So there seems
little scope for pumping Gerber products down Sandoz distribution channels
or vice versa.
It may be possible to add value by capitalising on Gerber's strong brand
name. Sandoz products may gain wider acceptance in the US if rebranded with
the Gerber logo. But all this will not be easy. Given that, the purchase
price of almost 30 times 1993-94 earnings is hardly cheap.

FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gratifying though the improvement in Ladbroke's disclosure is, it obviously
has not improved enough. Otherwise the market would have been less confused
by the disconcerting news on credit betting in yesterday's trading
statement. At first glance, the 8 per cent fall in the shares suggests a
need to reassess the quality of Ladbroke's earnings from betting. If a few
high spenders can more than wipe out the increase in profits from retail
betting during the first four months of a year - when the Grand National
actually ran - then perhaps the earnings stream is not worth so much after
all. Crockfords, which has a concentration of big spending customers, trades
on a historic multiple of less than 10. Even after yesterday's fall
Ladbroke's multiple is in the mid-20s.
It would help if Ladbroke were to break down the contribution from credit
betting to its operating profits. The danger is that investors will conclude
that it is bigger than it really is. It seems unlikely that credit betting
normally contributes more than 10 per cent. If so, it is big enough to
produce the occasional short-term glitch, which is only conspicuous now
because progress elsewhere, in hotels for example, remains pedestrian.
That does not warrant a wholesale re-rating of the shares. Rather it is the
realisation that Ladbroke's new management cannot transform the company
overnight which ought to justify yesterday's sharp correction. The shares
are now back where they were in early May. The run they had enjoyed looked
odd for a company whose newly-cut dividend is still barely covered by
adjusted earnings.

FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BA's American dream
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways' acknowledgment that it may have to write down its Pounds
275m investment in USAir is welcome. Prospects for the troubled US carrier
look bleak. It would take monumental efforts to achieve the Dollars 1bn a
year in cost savings that USAir management has set its sights on. Chapter 11
is a real possibility. BA's preference dividends are vulnerable.
But all this is not disastrous. For a start, the benefits from the
partnership with USAir - through code-sharing, merged frequent flyer
programmes and cost savings - should continue even if the US carrier files
for bankruptcy. These benefits, expected by BA to reach Pounds 70m this
year, dwarf the Pounds 16m the company receives from its preference shares.
Chapter 11 might even present BA with the opportunity to increase its stake
in USAir on the cheap, while simultaneously avoiding many of the regulatory
hassles the company has hitherto experienced in its US expansion strategy.
The Clinton administration could find it harder to turn down BA if it was
rescuing a bankrupt company.
Meanwhile, the rest of BA's business performs strongly. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 301m in 1993-94 contrast sharply with the red ink staining most
rivals' accounts. In the current year, traffic will continue to grow as the
airline market's recovery gathers pace, though prices will be held back by
continuing overcapacity in the industry. The management is also maintaining
pressure on costs, with another Pounds 150m in cuts promised this year.
In the longer run, BA's continental European operations should add to
earnings. Deutsche BA and TAT will soon move into profit. And much as BA
screams blue murder about state aid to rival European airlines, it seems
likely that one way or another the British carrier will come out of the row
with increased market share.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Third way to the top of the pile: David Goodhart weighs the
debate on UK competitiveness in the light of disparate global economic
models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely can the UK's industrial shortcomings have come under such scrutiny.
Today, six months of analysis and debate culminates in the publication of
the government's white paper on competitiveness.
It follows a multitude of other reports on how to sharpen economic
performance from government departments, the Labour party, two parliamentary
select committees, countless think-tanks and academics, and most employers'
associations.
Various factors help to explain the timing of this stock-taking, the most
important being the continuing long-term weakness of UK economic
performance. The improvements in the 1980s in industrial relations,
productivity growth and manufacturing exports helped to narrow the
performance gap with several of the UK's closest economic rivals such as
France and Germany. But after a long recession the gap still looks
stubbornly wide from manufacturing productivity to income per head (see
charts).
The reports may also express a deeper change of mood among business leaders
and policy makers. Mr Ken Mayhew, a former economist at the now defunct
research body, the National Economic Development Office, says: 'When I
joined Nedo in 1988 most leading business people I met thought we had
cracked the UK's economic problems.
'When I left in 1991 it was quite different. The recession came as a deep
shock to many people, but on top of that it appeared that sacking workers
and improving productivity had been the easy part, and that moving on from
there was much more difficult.'
Many of the analysts concentrate on apparent failures in external economic
performance - such as trade and the value of sterling  - which they fear
could deteriorate further in the face of increasing competition from
developing countries. They point to the forced exit of the UK from the
European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 and the UK's persistent current
account deficit even during recession.
Much of the evidence comes from the pro-manufacturing lobby which has been
given a new lease of life in the post-Thatcher era. This has been
underscored by the arrival of Mr Michael Heseltine as Department of Trade
and Industry secretary, and by the perception that the manufacturing sector
is now too small to sustain a strong recovery.
It is the performance of manufacturing and services and the growth rate of
overall productivity which is the key determinant of national economic
welfare. Performance in world markets is only part of the picture, says
Professor Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But the growth in UK living standards has been 'disappointing', according to
the government, with the country slipping to 18th place in gross domestic
product per head among the main industrial countries. And the UK had a
misery index (annual unemployment and inflation rates combined) which was
second only to Italy in the Group of Seven main industrial nations over the
period 1971 to 1992.
The individuals and committees seeking to diagnose and reverse these trends
are easy to mock with their grandiose ambitions and long wish-lists. But it
is not enough to dismiss them by saying that companies and not countries
compete, says Dr Ann Robinson of the free-market Institute of Directors.
'The national framework of laws and regulations is important in helping or
hindering companies,' she says.
Further, the manner in which the problems are being discussed provides some
grounds for optimism. 'There is a consensus about the nature of the problems
which would have been unthinkable even a few years ago,' says Sir Geoffrey
Owen, a director of the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic
Performance and a former editor of the Financial Times.
There is widespread concern about education and vocational training; about
the relationship between finance and business and the 'short-termism' this
is said to generate; about the failure of innovation; and about the lack of
a layer of thriving medium-sized businesses comparable with those in
Germany.
There is also a long-standing belief that 'change happens less easily in the
UK than in comparable countries, because we are less well structured', as Mr
Geoff Robinson, an IBM executive and former adviser at the DTI, puts it.
These 'decline of Britain' themes generate a sense of deja vu. But there is
a hard-headed tone and an attention to detail which would not have been
apparent 10 years ago.
The variety of academic, government and business reports acknowledge
strengths where they exist - in pharmaceuticals and financial services, for
example - and puzzle over the 'long tail' problem: if some companies can do
it, why do so many fail? The old industrial policy agenda of government
support for industry and 'picking winners' is noticeable by its absence. The
Labour party document scarcely mentions the unions, much to the chagrin of
some union leaders.
There is even some agreement on the measures required to create more of the
high-performance companies of which the UK has too few. Several reports
recommend reforms to the tax system to encourage more investment and
training. Less straightforwardly, there is broad interest in establishing a
more supportive financial framework for large companies by making contested
takeovers more difficult and dividend payments more closely aligned with
profitability.
For smaller companies, there is a lobby for the creation of a development
bank able to provide long- term loans to growing businesses at subsidised
rates. There is also interest in fostering more corporate collaboration on
technology transfer.
But behind this apparent consensus, a scarcely articulated argument is being
conducted over the kind of economic model to which Britain should aspire.
The battle is between those who think that many of the problems are endemic
and can be solved only through a regulatory and institutional overhaul, and
those who believe that the existing liberal system, buttressed by powerful
anti-monopoly laws, needs no more than discreet policy reforms and
intelligent exhortation.
Informing many of the supporters of overhaul are the Germanic and Japanese
models of 'organised' capitalism. These are said to comprise corporate
institutions which enhance wealth creation through fostering stable,
long-term relationships between key economic groups.
Liberal critics regard these corporate rules - such as life-time employment
and company cross-ownership in Japan, or compulsory worker consultation in
Germany - as belonging to an earlier corporatist era. That approach, now
under threat in the latter two countries, is one from which Britain is
fortunate to be free, they add. If they have a model it is the free-market
US, which still has the highest average productivity (and GDP per head) in
the world and is the world leader in high-technology industries.
The Labour party is happy to embrace the Germanic 'stakeholder' company
model, in which workers influence decision-making, and financiers and
suppliers are locked in. 'We want to reform the architecture of our company
structures to encourage committed owners,' says Mr Robin Cook, Labour's
trade and industry spokesman.
The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce,
in its a recent report on reforming the UK company, Tomorrow's Company, also
embraces the stakeholder approach, but without proposing new regulation.
'There's a lot of nervousness about taking the regulatory path,' says Mr
Neil Hartley, the society's research head.
The trade and industry select committee is similarly sympathetic to
'committed' capitalism, but it is wary about institutional reform and
explicitly rejects the German-style supervisory board. 'Lessons learnt
overseas cannot usually be transferred to the UK,' says the select
committee's report. But where other countries have 'competitive advantage',
for example in relationships with financial institutions, the UK must
replicate them in its own way.
Mr Heseltine takes a tantalisingly ambiguous position in this debate. In his
1987 book, Where There's a Will, he praises German institutions such as
employee representation on supervisory boards. He also backs a system of
compulsory-membership employer organisations such as chambers of commerce,
which help to ensure that almost all employers train to a high standard.
But in office this agenda has been scarcely visible. His main accomplishment
has been to deliver a reorganisation of government support for industry both
at regional and Whitehall level.
Judging by the tone of the DTI's own contributions to the trade and industry
select committee, and the deregulatory agenda of the Conservative party,
today's white paper will not return to the themes of Where There's a Will.
Indeed, few new initiatives are expected.
At least for public consumption, the DTI admits of no endemic problems
except in education and training. Mr Bob Dobbie, head of the new
competitiveness division set up by Mr Heseltine in 1992, says that 'there is
no conclusive evidence that short-termism is a general problem'; and he
denies there is a 'financing gap' for small business.
The government, and observers such as Mr Dobbie, believe that as far as
there is a short-termism problem, it is one of business judgment rather than
market structure. The only role for government is to ensure better
information flows. The market, the government might add, is correcting
itself; financial institutions are taking a more active interest in the
companies they own. Even Hanson, the conglomerate often accused of ruthless
short-termism, has decided to lengthen its target payback period on
investments.
But to economists such as Mr Ewart Keep and Mr Ken Mayhew, this minimalist
policy contradicts the government's objectives. They told the select
committee: 'On the one hand ministers and civil servants have painted the
vision of a high-wage, high-tech, high-skill future . . . the only one that
advanced economies can sustain in the long run. On the other hand actual
policy has sought to emphasise low wage costs and a deregulated labour
market.'
If there is a tension here, it does not adversely affect high-technology
sectors of the US economy, for example. It is, in any case, a tension in
many analyses of competitiveness, including that by Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, entitled Growth, Competitiveness and
Employment.
Management theorists such as Professor John Kay also seem unsure which side
of the argument they are on. Prof Kay talked to the select committee about
creating high-trust, high-commitment relationships within companies. But
under questioning he said that countries should play to their competitive
strengths which, in the case of Britain, may mean nurturing US-style high
flexibility and low cost.
Even Labour-sympathising academics, such as Mr David Soskice, have concluded
the UK will not be able to create the conditions for a high-skill
manufacturing economy. Policy should concentrate instead on copying US mass
higher education to equip young people for the high value-added end of the
service industries on which most national wealth will depend.
Mr Keith Hampson, a leading member of the trade and industry select
committee and a confidant of Mr Heseltine, believes that the German-Japanese
and the US models are converging. He also believes that the UK can forge a
coherent 'middle way' between them, and that the country's low-cost,
deregulatory attractions 'give us a breathing space to get our act
together'. Today's white paper will be the testament of that British way.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is not some trivial opinion poll,' said Mr John Major yesterday,
launching his party's manifesto for the European elections on June 9.
He is right. The European Parliament, especially since the entry into force
of the Maastricht treaty last November, is in a position to exert
significant influence on the destinies of the European Union if it finds the
sense of purpose to do so. It does not have the full powers to grant or
withhold taxation, or to pass legislation, that are traditionally those of
parliaments in sovereign states; and, largely for that reason, there is no
European executive which depends on a disciplined majority in the parliament
to carry on its business.
But, precisely for that reason, individual MEPs have greater freedom than
most of their national counterparts, and those who are prepared to work can
have a great deal of influence on the detail of European law. Under
Maastricht their influence on other aspects of EU policy, such as foreign
relations, should be expected to grow as well.
Yet none of the manifestos published in the UK yesterday focuses primarily
on the role of the parliament or on how the candidates of the parties
concerned would speak and vote if they were elected to it. All three of the
main British parties behave as if this were in fact a mammoth opinion poll.
The Conservatives defend their record as a government in upholding British
interests in Europe. Labour and the Liberal Democrats blame the
Conservatives for everything that is wrong in Britain today - whether or not
there is a European connection - and attempt to seduce the voter by
promising to behave differently if and when they gain power at Westminster.
Direct experience
About the specific role of the parliament they have rather little - in the
Liberal Democrat case, almost nothing - to say. The Liberal Democrats may be
partly excused by the fact that up to now the majoritarian electoral system,
which Britain alone uses for these elections, has denied them any direct
experience of EP membership. Still, since they alone are prepared to
advocate 'a federal Europe', one might have expected them to present
themselves as members of a Europe-wide movement with a single programme.
This they fail conspicuously to do, perhaps because on many social and
economic issues continental liberals are closer to British conservatives,
while British liberals are closer to continental socialists. The
Conservatives, too, have problems in this area. You will search their
manifesto in vain for a reference to the European People's party, the
alliance of Christian Democrat parties to whose parliamentary group the
Conservative MEPs have belonged since 1992. Only the Labour party can
proudly proclaim its intention of 'co-operating with our allies across the
continent' to press for a list of economic objectives.
Socialist group
That list deserves some attention, because the socialist group, already the
largest, is the one most likely to find itself in or close to a majority
after the elections. Ironically this outcome is made much more likely by the
British electoral system, which the Conservative government has insisted on
retaining. The main argument for this system  - that it tends to produce a
stable governing majority - has no relevance to this election. All it
achieves in this context is to distort the overall political composition of
the parliament by exaggerating the swings of the British pendulum (usually
against the party in power at Westminster).
This phenomenon will be particularly unfortunate in the present instance, if
it helps the Labour party and its continental allies to impose their agenda
on the EU. The list of objectives may sound benign, but its main premise is
that public spending at European level can and should be used to 'promote',
'boost' or 'generate' new jobs. It also includes 'an industrial policy', and
'the effective application of regulations in all countries in order to
ensure that industry is not disadvantaged by unfair competition'.
The application of this philosophy across the EU could virtually be
guaranteed to ensure that Europe as a whole remains a high-cost,
over-regulated region, whose enterprises would indeed be 'disadvantaged' in
competition with those from other parts of the world.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Leading Article: On the brink over Crimea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With its vote for de facto independence on Friday, the Crimean government
raised the stakes in Europe's most dangerous political game. The alarming
possibility is that the local power struggle in Crimea could drag Ukraine
and Russia into all-out war.
Kiev has consistently valued an increasingly threadbare sovereignty over the
more painstaking process of economic transformation. For the Ukrainian
government, Crimea is more a symbol than a piece of territory to which it
has any strong attachment for its own sake, but that is precisely why
Crimea's declaration of sovereignty last week provoked such a hostile
reaction in Kiev. Ukraine has been tolerant of the pro-Russian Crimean
government's demand for local self-rule over the past few months, but has
drawn a line at outright secession. Kiev's disastrously ineffective leaders
believe, probably correctly, that Ukraine might collapse altogether, if
Crimea were to be allowed to secede.
For Moscow, the escalating tensions on the Black Sea peninsula pose
different problems. Ukrainian leaders complain that Russians have never
fully accepted their nation's independent existence. That is quite true, but
the Kremlin's current leadership does at least appear content to wait for
Ukraine's disintegration. Even though President Boris Yeltsin has acted with
commendable restraint over Crimea, he faces a powerful hard-line lobby,
inside and outside his own government.
Russian role
If Crimea's war of words were to degenerate into a fight, it would be
politically difficult for Russia to remain on the side-lines. Worse still,
perceived success in Crimea could embolden Russian nationalists to gather
lands from other republics, such as Kazakhstan and the Baltics.
But the real gunpowder, both literally and figuratively, is on the contested
peninsula itself. Both Ukraine, with its security forces and national guard,
and Russia, which effectively controls the Black Sea Fleet, have a military
presence in Crimea. The man who has recently appeared determined to ignite
the explosion is Mr Yuri Meshkov, the maverick president of Crimea.
Mr Meshkov, elected in January, appeared initially placated by a deal with
Kiev that gave Crimea independence in everything but name. Over the past
week, however, Mr Meshkov has been pushing further. The danger is that
Kiev's adamant insistence on sovereignty and territorial integrity will be
forced into a collision with the pressure on the government in Moscow to
champion ethnic Russians beyond its borders.
West's response
How should the west respond? The first step, which is to recognise that
Crimea is not a minor local irritant, has been taken. Beyond that, the best
the west, and most of all the US, can do is serve as honest broker. With the
help of western mediation, Kiev and Moscow might be able to negotiate a
joint sovereignty arrangement, which would allow Ukrainians to feel they
have not surrendered their territory, while giving Crimeans the connection
with Russia that they apparently want.
Simply lecturing Russia on the inviolability of Ukraine's borders - a
particularly touchy issue, because Ukraine's renunciation of its nuclear
weapons was made in return for a Russian pledge to respect Ukrainian
territory - will not be enough. Russia exerts considerable influence on the
Crimean government. Moscow should be asked to urge caution on its kinsmen
and be warned that a war between Ukraine and Russia would make western
assistance to either country, including membership of the Partnership for
Peace, impossible.
The Ukrainian government is seriously at fault, not so much in its handling
of the Crimean issue as in its egregious mishandling of the economy. Kiev
can have little hope of holding on to reluctant territories, so long as the
economy continues its collapse. Terrified as it is of a Bosnia writ large,
the west is ready to help Ukraine in substantial ways. But first, the
Ukrainians must show that they want not only to keep their flag and their
borders, but to begin the reforms that just might make Crimeans tolerate
remaining Ukrainian citizens.

Everyone knows Whisky deserves more attention than Soda, so Chris Patten's
Norfolk terrier decided to take matters into its own paws. Still smarting
from the star treatment accorded to fellow pooch Soda when it went awol
nearly two years ago, Whisky decided to bite back. Unfortunately, sinking
your teeth into a 21-year-old workman has consequences in Hong Kong, even if
you chew bones with the governor nightly. Whisky was unceremoniously carted

attention in a place where canine criminals have been known to incur the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, doesn't seem too keen on
chartered surveyors.
Why was it, he asked a property conference yesterday, that the surveyors
employed by Boots had to be trained from first principles in almost every
area of commercial life from the rudiments of marketing to constructing a
business plan? And why was it, he continued, that while so many Boots
managers work in jobs remote from their professional training, all the
surveyors in the company are in positions directly associated with property?
Surely, he argued, surveyors should be capable of pursuing broader business
careers.
Could this view have anything to do with the fact that Boots' outgoing
chairman, Sir Christopher Benson, is a well-known chartered surveyor?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No secret that John Patten's job at the Department for Education is one of
the least secure in the cabinet. Perhaps a bit more surprising is the press
of hopefuls jockeying to succeed him.
In addition to the likes of Michael Portillo, Steven Dorrell and Virginia
Bottomley, it emerges that social security secretary Peter Lilley, the
ex-Greenwell's oil analyst, also fancies exchanging the never-ending
headaches of the Child Support Agency for worries about a different facet of
youngsters' development.
Lilley has been surprisingly successful over the past two years, but with
more cuts expected in his Pounds 80bn budget it may be time to get out while
he is still ahead. A suspiciously large chunk of his recent Spectator
lecture was devoted to the subject of education.
However, while Lilley is regarded as one of the most intellectually able in
the cabinet, the prime minister may be disinclined to make changes in an
area as sensitive as social security just at the moment. And would it be a
promotion for him anyway?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever happened to John Moore, or Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, to give him
his proper title? He maintains such a low profile these days that it's hard
to believe that only seven years ago he was being canvassed as a future
prime minister of Britain.
Take the growing row about the financing of the new Energy Saving Trust,
which he chairs. It is a central plank of the government's energy efficiency
campaign but its very survival is already being threatened by Clare
Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator.
Without her backing, the trust can raise only a small fraction of the Pounds
400m a year it needs to spend to meet government targets. However, in this
increasingly heated debate, it is the trust's capable but little known chief
executive, Eoin Lees, who has been left to fight its corner.
Lord Moore's recent public pronouncements have been limited to a short
introduction to the trust's latest annual report, which talked of 'an
encouraging start'. His deeper views of the trust's predicament are hard to
establish since he doesn't seem to like being quizzed by the press.
His sensitivity to press comment, dating back to his unlucky time as
secretary of state for social security, may explain his shyness. But at this
vulnerable stage in the trust's fortunes, it surely needs a chairman who is
more preoccupied with saving energy than his face.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Of the three political games in play in Britain the most important is the
contest for the succession to Mr John Smith. Next, a long way behind, comes
the struggle by the prime minister to avoid a challenge to his leadership of
the Conservative party. We must tune in to that ancient soap, although it is
running out of plausible plot lines. Third, as significant as an
afterthought, we have the elections to the European Parliament.
It is not wholly parochial to picture this summer's political goings-on in
so Anglo-centric a manner. The victory or defeat of Labour in a British
general election in 1996 or 1997 may be of greater importance in the
counsels of the European Union in the subsequent years than the precise
party balance after next month's low-key contest. On present form, the
Conservatives will before long find themselves hovering between a European
strategy that is merely obstructive of further development and one that
nears the brink of advocating withdrawal from the EU. Labour is subject to
all the doubts about continental involvement inherent in the British
character, but it would at least start with harmonious intent.
This puts the summer games in perspective. The question before the voters on
June 9 is merely whether the Strasbourg assembly is to be predominantly
socialist. It was put with particular force by the Conservatives yesterday.
Ho hum. The forthcoming poll will determine the answer on the basis of
national votes which are heavily influenced by the popularity or otherwise
of national governments. That is the nub of what Labour and the Liberal
Democrats had to say yesterday. So what else is new? Most European socialist
parties are expected to do well, the British Labour party best of all. A
beneficiary of the first-past-the-post voting system, it may be the largest
single grouping. No one expects the Tory contingent to increase; the only
question is the number by which it will fall.
It is a minor question. The Strasbourg parliament is still a remote body
whose effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. The Maastricht treaty gives
it powers to negotiate amendments to legislation, or block bills it does not
like. It will be asked to approve the new commission before it takes office
in January. These powers are of great potential importance, but the
parliament's tradition is consensual, not adversarial. The other day, it
huffed and puffed before approving the admission of new members, but it did
not blow the house down.
What really matters is whether Labour wins the next general election. As
Europeans know from bitter experience, in a Europe of nations a negative
stance adopted by the government of one of the larger member states can
block or at least slow down future development. Whether this is beneficial
or not depends upon how you regard the evolution of the European enterprise.
The proposition I am advancing would be most starkly apparent if, say,
Labour was led by Mr Tony Blair and the Tories by Mr Michael Portillo - the
moderate Europhile vs the immoderate Europhobe.
The EU would have a decided interest in the outcome of such a contest. The
contrast would be less sharply drawn if the opposing party leaders were,
say, Mr Robin Cook and Mr John Major. Yet the prime minister will doubtless
continue to be pushed in a Portillo direction by the chauvinistic wing of
his party. We may be sure that Mr Cook would try his best to be a good
European. What matters in either case is the nature of the party behind the
leader.
This is why the previously entrancing political mystery - will Mr Major last
and who will succeed him? - has become stale. It is evident that the problem
is the Conservative party, not its leader. Tory divisions are stultifying
Britain's government. They can only be healed by a period of reflection, or
angry argument, an exercise best undertaken in opposition. Even yesterday's
manifesto, so seamless in appearance, was fought over to the comma,
passionately, with all hatreds showing. The primary purpose of its text, I
am assured, is to keep the cabinet in one piece. If it wins votes, that will
be a surprising bonus. It might, if incipient Euroscepticism begins to
outweigh the anger many detached Tories feel about their usual party.
The big question is, what is to become of Labour? If it returns to its old
form, Mr Major may yet enjoy more years in office than most people now
envisage. If it seizes its chance, the Tory era that began in 1979 will end.
Some of us regard Mr Blair as the most convincing representative of what a
wholly reformed, late-20th century party of the centre-left should be. We
should not be carried away by this. There has been talk of skimping on the
cumbersome procedures for the selection of a new leader. If members of
parliament nominated only one candidate, there would be no need for the
constituency parties and trade union members to exercise their
one-member-one-vote muscle.
That would be a mistake. The Labour party needs to show its colours,
unreconstructed or modernised as they may be. Mr Blair should be put to the
test in internal electoral combat. He has his first chance this morning,
when he is due to make a speech. He could fluff it, by taking as his text
the list of demands made by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB union, on
Sunday. Some of the Edmonds proposals, such as the promotion of full
employment, constitute traditional goals for a Labour leader. That is beside
the point. Mr Edmonds, once the darling of the modernisers, is becoming a
walking disservice to the Labour party. He appears to hanker after the
status of a 1960s union boss. A victory won by public pandering to one of
such pretensions would not be a prize worth having.
The great game of the moment is exquisitely complicated. Politicians win
favour in the old Labour party by sounding Neanderthal, or nostalgically
socialist. Mr Gordon Brown attempted both noises at the weekend. A campaign
like that could produce a leader of the opposition destined to stay in that
post until succeeded by another leader of the opposition. Alternatively, Mr
Blair or another of his ilk, if there is one, might risk all. He or she
might try to carry the party into the changes it has to make to achieve
victory where it counts - at the next general election. That would make a
difference.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Bella figura of the north: Berlusconi's home city of Milan
is centre-stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milan knows all about operatic coincidence. But even at La Scala, the city's
world-famous opera house, the Milanese have rarely been asked to believe in
a combination of political, economic and athletic good fortune as
extravagant as that achieved by their city over the past three months.
The first act of this drama reached its climax last Wednesday night as AC
Milan, Italy's most successful soccer team, humiliated the Spanish champions
Barcelona in the European Cup final. Somehow it seemed only right that Milan
should score the decisive second goal moments before Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the team's owner and Italy's new prime minister, won a crucial vote of
confidence in the senate.
It is the rise to power of Mr Berlusconi, Milan-born media magnate, that has
led the press to dub his home town the unofficial capital of Italy's second
republic. This is quite a transformation for a city which was notorious only
two years ago as the hub of the country's Tangentopoli ('bribesville')
scandal - the nationwide network of bribes and political favours which
undermined the old political regime.
Milan is certainly well-represented in the political life of the new Italy.
Forza Italia, Mr Berlusconi's four-month-old political movement, was
conceived in Milan and the federalist Northern League, one of its two main
government partners, has its headquarters there. The interior minister and
the speakers and deputy speakers of both chambers of the Italian parliament
are also Milanese.
Mr Marco Formentini, a senior League politician and the city's mayor for the
past year, says Milan is now reaping the fruit of a decade of struggle,
particularly by his own movement. The League pressed for an end to the old
centralised and corrupt political regime. The process was then
'accelerated', Mr Formentini claims, by Mr Berlusconi's decision to enter
politics earlier this year.
Now in power nationally, the League's separatist strategy - which would have
made Milan capital of the 'Republic of the North' - seems to have been toned
down. Mr Formentini now talks about the possibility of greater autonomy for
other Italian cities, be they in the north, centre or south. But he adds:
'Milan will be the beneficiary of these changes, because we have always been
a city with enormous potential, crushed under the weight of central state
control.'
Economic recovery may help realise that potential, the northern city's
business leaders claim. Since the March election, the number of shares
traded on the Milan stock exchange has occasionally exceeded that of Wall
Street. Mr Michele Porcelli, general manager of Assolombarda, the federation
of Milanese companies, says his members have noted a gradual upturn over the
past four months, but remain cautious. He interprets this as a welcome sign
that the short-lived boom of the early 1980s will not be repeated. 'The
downturn has changed the lifestyle (of the Milanese),' he says, adding that
good economic news for the city would also be good for the country.
As for the corruption scandal, the city's shame has turned into pride in its
magistrates, who are tracking down and prosecuting the corruptors and the
corrupted. The charismatic courtroom performance of Mr Antonio Di Pietro as
prosecutor in the first big Tangentopoli trial, which finished in Milan
three weeks ago, was watched by millions on national television. 'Milan is
proud to be the centre of the mani pulite (clean hands) investigations,'
beams Mr Formentini. The mayor has also demonstrated his pride in the
political prominence of his fellow citizens; he put up posters around the
city welcoming the election of Milanese speakers in the two chambers of
parliament last month.
But there are plenty in Milan who dislike the fact that the city is
identifying itself with the right-wing national government. On April 25,
300,000 people took to Milan's streets to commemorate the liberation of
Italy from fascism in 1945. The demonstration was dominated by the defeated
left. Mr Alex Iriondo, Milan secretary of the opposition Democratic Party of
the Left (PDS), is critical of the city's council and the new government,
which he believes could hold back recovery. 'The relaunch of the city
doesn't depend on our citizens holding high offices of state,' he says.
Indeed the legacy of the Milanese former prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi,
who is facing corruption charges, suggests that occupying high office can
create even deeper problems. The former socialist leader's network of
political patronage is held responsible by many Milanese for hampering the
city's economic and political development over the past decade. Ironically,
Mr Berlusconi thrived under this environment, when he was building his
Fininvest empire in Milan during the 1980s.
Mr Berlusconi may now be prepared to reward the city with real institutional
power to add to its economic and financial importance and reinforce top
politicians' sentimental links with the city. For example, last week Mr Vito
Gnutti, industry minister, fuelled speculation that parts of the budget,
industry and finance ministries might decamp to Milan.
That would fit in with the hopes of some respected Milanese commentators,
who have long urged the government to move certain institutions - for
example, the Consob financial watchdog or even the central bank - to the
Lombard capital. Such moves would underpin rather than undermine national
identity, according to Professor Mario Monti, rector of the private Bocconi
University. 'It would be easier to keep national unity if we could avoid a
Rome-centred concept, which generates so much anti-Roman sentiment
throughout the country,' he says.
But Mr Attilio Ventura, president of the Milan stock exchange, believes
changes in the institutional balance of power are unnecessary. The fact that
the central bank and Consob are in Rome has little impact on Milan's
position as the dominant financial centre, he points out. Mr Sandro
Molinari, chairman of Milan-based Cariplo, one of Italy's biggest banks, is
similarly sceptical, claiming that an institutional reshuffle is unlikely.
'Milan is the central motor of the economy, and Rome is the motor of
political life,' he adds.
If Mr Gnutti's hints are fulfilled, other Italian cities and regions may
also start demanding a slice of the institutional cake. But for the time
being the question of Milanese pre-eminence does not seem to worry the rest
of Italy. Milan's pretentions are watched with a certain disdainful
amusement by Romans, traditionally dismissive of their stress-prone northern
compatriots. The rest of the country may simply be waiting to see if Milan's
luck holds: as opera lovers know, the coincidence by which our hero receives
riches in act one is often offset by a blow of fate before the final
curtain.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bulgaria - the worst starting point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN ZAIMOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on Bulgaria ('Bulgarian capitalism boosts ex-communists',
May 10) states that it is difficult to come across dynamic professional
Bulgarians without a communist background. This is hardly surprising in a
country that had more than 1m communist party members only a few years ago.
It is also true that foreigners regard the Bulgarian commercial environment
as hostile and the local business community as unreliable.
The two business 'scams' you have described, however, are hardly particular
to Bulgaria. 'Overcharging and buying cheaply from state companies' is a
worldwide phenomenon and one of the strongest arguments for privatisation,
while minimising tax exposure in a country with an underdeveloped tax regime
is obviously easier than in the west, where it is called tax optimisation
and is the speciality of an army of consultants.
Your story would have gained in credibility if the name of the principal
protagonist had not been mistakenly given as Ivan, not Ilya. This is rather
like a Bulgarian daily publishing an article on 'Tony' Rowland.
The disappearance of most foreign markets, the large foreign debt and the
unfavourable (both in terms of access and resources) geographical position
are significantly more important and explain much better the difficulties of
privatisation and the low level of foreign investment. John Wilton, head of
the World Bank mission in Sofia, calls this the worst starting point of all
the countries in eastern Europe.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not fair on efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL R HOFFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your article, 'Ofwat outlines flow of price
increases' (May 20), I do not accept your comment 'unimpressive performance
on efficiency' so far as Thames Water is concerned.
Statistics produced by Ofwat on cost per unit of service provided to
customers confirm Thames Water as the best of the big 10 water and sewerage
companies.
It is total costs that matter since this is what concerns customers, that is
the bill that they receive. This point has been confirmed to Thames Water on
several occasions by Ofwat. Drawing conclusions on company efficiency from
an analysis of operating costs only is positively misleading.
I am proud that in 1994, yet again, Thames Water customers have the lowest
combined water and sewerage bill.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right route to employee shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM HURLSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Vishvas Kanji told only part of the story when he noted that the number
of employee share ownership plans (Esops) drawn up in the UK under the 1989
legislation could be counted on the fingers of one hand (Letters, May 18).
There are currently well in excess of 60 companies with Esops which make use
of case law to achieve tax efficiency. This figure excludes companies which
had Esops but have floated or bought out and thus made thousands of pounds
for employees. Yorkshire Rider is a good example of the latter case. Workers
at the bus company have received an average of Pounds 6,000 for shares they
received for free.
The success of British Esops can be seen from the fact that a party of
Russian business people arrived in Britain at the beginning of last week in
order to learn what role Esops can play in the Russian privatisation
programme.
Furthermore, this year's Finance Act relaxed some key restrictions on
setting up an Esop using the 1989 legislation. Although the statutory Esop
is still not perfect, these changes mean that this route to employee share
ownership can no longer be ignored.
The Esop Centre will continue its successful lobbying for changes in Esop
law until Britain mirrors the US, where there are more than 10,000 companies
with Esops.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, It does not require, as you state in your leading article, 'Revisionism
on pensions' (May 17), ingenuity from the City 'to reduce the capital market
threat to the value of the (defined contribution) pension on the date of
retirement'.
That ingenuity has already been displayed by the production of equity-based
annuities. What is required is a swift decision by the Inland Revenue to
allow pensioners to benefit immediately.
In the longer term the requirement to liquidate a personal pension and buy
an annuity should be removed and replaced by simple rules on the withdrawal
of income and capital from the fund.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Union financially viable and aiming
to strengthen organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Taylor's apocalyptic vision of my union's finances ('Civil
service union in cash crisis', May 17) is misleading and partial in its
presentation of the facts. Although there were no factual inaccuracies in
the article, it failed to paint the full picture.
Far from 'only' a quarter of our members having re-authorised their
subscription deductions, it is more appropriate to say that 'already' a
quarter have done so. Even though the first forms only went to branches six
weeks ago, sign-up rates are already hitting 49 per cent (Scottish Office),
45 per cent (Home Office), 44 per cent (Land Registry) and 38 per cent
(Customs).
Second, we have not blamed payroll and personnel managers for delays. They
have been very helpful and co-operative. Delays in agreeing the mechanics of
the operation may or may not be politically inspired, but are certainly the
result of decisions taken at a much higher level - Treasury and Department
of Employment ministers.
Third, no mention is made that we project a surplus of Pounds 100,000 for
1994 and a subscription income of Pounds 10.4m.
Fourth, highlighting the response among our members in Employment
illustrates little, as the forms were only sent out just before our
conference a fortnight ago, and we would not expect any completed returns
until 14-21 days after dispatch. The overall response is good and getting
better - to such an extent that extra staff are being drafted in to open the
post. More than 2,000 forms were processed on one day alone recently.
Fifth, a misleading impression is provided by selective quotation from our
financial report. We have total assets of Pounds 8.2m, of which Pounds 6m
are fixed assets. 'Lack of liquid assets' refers only to cash in hand or in
bank accounts.
Sixth, reference to conference decisions are irrelevant, as our 1994
estimates are not based on possible savings from conference proposals.
Seventh, we are one of the few unions actually to have increased membership
over the last year - a very encouraging base for the check-off campaign.
Surely this is relevant.
Unions are not savings accounts but organisations that collectively
represent workers' interests. Our financial health is important and is taken
seriously, but it is only a means to an end, and not the end in itself. Our
membership increase is a result of campaigning on issues of direct relevance
to our members - pay, jobs and quality of services. We are financially
viable and will show that, like the political fund ballots, the unions will
turn a legislative attack into a means of strength-ening our organisation
and increasing our membership.
Finally, the article appeared on the day that our proposed partners in a new
union, the IRSF, debated merger at their conference. Despite exaggerated
reports of our financial demise, they voted to move forward with us towards
a powerful new public services union.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Master of mystery - Alastair Macaulay reports on the
final week of the Dublin Pinter festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You might think that a 'Pinter Festival' was a contradiction in terms . . .
And you would be wrong. The festival of six Pinter plays that Dublin's Gate
Theatre has just presented was full of laughter, mystery, emotion, and,
above, all, humanity. There is talk of another, larger, Pinter festival at
the Gate in the future; and it is obvious that England should have one too.
All six Gate stagings are first-class and would adorn the London stage.
One reason that a Pinter Festival is timely is that, with last year's
Moonlight, we have stopped talking of Pinter the playwright in the past
tense (as we were doing at the time of his 60th birthday celebrations in
1990). The Dublin Festival ended with Moonlight (performances continue this
week). Watching it again was a pleasure, not least because it was often the
most hilarious play of the festival. In it Pinter is clearly entering new
terrain: with the family divided into three separate stage areas, with death
treated from two contrasting angles (the daughter's in the past, the
father's approaching) and with the very intense irony of much of the talk.
Possibly Pinter has pared too much away from Moonlight; it does not gather
in impact or significance as do his greatest plays. But its tragicomic
ambivalence is masterly.
That Pinter is a master becomes obvious with a festival of his work. How
often he deals in mystery] - and leaves us like detectives. We are plunged
straight into bewildering scenes whose import is never fully clear; but his
language is so haunting, and his characters so full of feeling, that it
becomes important to work out the play's hidden implications.
Landscape (1968) was to me the greatest revelation of the festival. Seldom
if ever performed since it was played by Peggy Ashcroft (Beth's original
interpreter), it shows a couple locked into a painful dichotomy. He, facing
her and often talking to her but never hearing her, talks of mundane matters
in the present and recent past. She, facing away, hearing him (probably),
but speaking as if in her own head, reflects only of long ago sensual
experience.
In several ways, Landscape was a turning-point in Pinter's art: it turned
away from the menace which often enters into his earlier work, introduced a
new lyricism - and it showed a new kind of feminism in his writing. Beth is
so much more lyrical, tactile and imaginative than Duff; and her thoughts
elude him.
Pinter himself directed Landscape; Penelope Wilton and Ian Holm played Duff
and Beth. Sublimely eloquent performances, in which the least nuance took on
a wealth of meaning. He spends almost the whole play seated in profile; at
the end, he sits there locked in a spasm of rage that gradually becomes
suffused by anguish. She looks out front, calmly, as if through the window
whose shadow we see on her. Sometimes her eyelids beat through the pauses as
if she is close to tears; once she gazes firmly out without blinking, and we
sense time differently, and know how different an emotion is now in her
heart.
She speaks in utter quiet, and the beauty of her diction - pellucid without
elaboration - turns every line into poetry. The play's most famous line is
her ending 'Oh my true love I said', but Wilton makes equally telling effect
in talking of the nature of shadow. As she speaks, so softly, 'Shadow is
deprivation of light . . . Sometimes the cause of the shadow cannot be
found', she lets the full metaphorical sense of her lines strike home. A
most beautiful performance.
In Moonlight, Holm repeats the marvellously scathing, ironic, panicky
performance of the dying Andy with which last year he returned to the stage.
Wilton, excellent as his wife Bel, is slightly warmer than the original Bel,
Anna Massey. Karel Reisz, directing, achieves many fresh nuances between the
characters; but there are connections and undertones to this play that still
have yet to emerge. It takes a long time for a Pinter play to disclose all
its meanings. Which is a sure sign of mastery.
Moonlight continues at the Gate Theatre until May 28

FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Self-indulgent attitude - William Packer finds Spanish
conceptualism in Manchester all too familiar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To enter the exhibition, Ideas &amp; Attitudes, at Manchester's Cornerhouse, is
to go back in time. The work may have come from the far-away-and-long-ago of
Spain in the 1970s and General Franco's declining years, yet how familiar it
all seems, and how comfortably old-fashioned. Switch a few names, English
for Spanish - Keith Arnatt, John Hilliard, Tony Carter, Stuart Brisley, Rita
Donagh or Michael Craig-Martin for Josefina Miralles, Antoni Muntadas,
Carles Pujol, Jordi Benito, Pere Noguera or Benet Rossell - and would we
notice a difference? Not much.
Those were the days, as though Dada and Surrealism had yet to be dreamt of,
Duchamp yet to rip the bowl from the lavatory wall. Ideas &amp; Attitudes
catches exactly the lost, earnest innocence of the times, for the Idea was
most certainly the thing. Art assuredly had to be about something, that
wonderfully empty phrase still the mantra of the more advanced of our art
schools.
It was all so simple. Take an idea, any idea, and strike an attitude about
it, and the form, the realisation, would look after itself. Thus at last was
the tyranny of technique broken. All one needed were a few snaps for
illustration, or some plastic bags to fill with nail-clippings or pubic
hair, or, as we have here, rubber bands, tooth-picks, post-cards, postage
stamps . . . (Eugenia Balcells).
Or what about putting some notices in the papers, to see what response we
get (Grup de Treball)? Or filling in a map with mud (Pere Noguera)? Or
throwing oneself against a brick wall and bouncing off again, with
photographs to prove it (Jordi Benito)? Or floating the letters SCULPTURA in
a tank of water (Damien, I mean Francesc Torres)?
A number of the ideas are bright enough. Josefina Miralles, who solemnly
shows herself standing thigh-high in the earth, or turning by simple stages
into a woman of straw, has also made herself a pair of shoes that prints her
name as she walks along. Francesc Abad goes through his 'Actions with Air,
Fire and Water' with dead-pan simplicity, breathing into a glass, lighting a
cigarette, having a drink. Jordi Pablo's stone has a handle by which to pick
it up, his bread a hinge by which to break it. 'What goes through the head?'
asks Jordi Cerda, with headshots to show us, and a motor-bike, a rubber
glove, a basket, the Tower of Pisa, variously sprouting from his cranium.
Ferran Garcia Sevilla has a rubber stamp which reads 'Art Es Just Un Mot'.
Indeed it is.
In the lower gallery, Catalonia Incognita is a small show of conventional
modern painting and sculpture from around the city of Girona. Only when we
read in the publicity that 'perhaps (its) most fascinating aspect is its
faith in traditional disciplines; painting, drawing and sculpture', do the
eyebrows rise a notch or two.
There are several rather good abstract paintings that are yet redolent of
landscape, and among the sculpture a piece cast in aluminium, by Xicu
Cabanyes, that besides being deeply in Moore's debt, was clearly modelled in
the old way. But as for tradition, of drawing there is nothing at all,
unless some linear gestures in a few paintings count as drawing. And while
the thick impasto surfaces of Patxe are entirely acceptable, and Montserrat
Costa's thinner washes rather lovely and effective, such works are
traditional only in the sense that the paint is still being laid on a flat
surface, and with some competence. Reference to the external and visible
world? The critical measuring of the thing seen against the mark made, and
the mark made against the mark intended? Forget it.
For the mark made we go on to Antoni Tapies at the City Art Galleries, and a
show of his Profound Certainties of 1991. And again of critical
self-measurement there is nothing, but only self-indulgence. It is sad to
have to say as much, for Tapies remains a serious and significant artist on
the strength of his work of the 1950s and 60s, bleak and physical
abstraction, heavy with ambiguous symbolism.
All we have now, it seems, are these vacuous graphic exercises on
unstretched and grubby sheets of synthetic fabric, curling off the wall.
Even these evince still a certain natural painterly delicacy and an educated
hand, but such qualities, alone and unwitting, are not enough. The mystery
is only how it is that an artist of such proven quality should now imagine
his every move, his every gesture, take it or leave it, to be fraught with
significance. His dealers and curators, perhaps, have told him so.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Sinfonietta Response Weekend - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The response to the first, on Saturday, of the two concerts of the London
Sinfonietta's 'Response Weekend' at the Barbican was lamentable: a trickle
of regulars at the back of the hall. Conductor Elgar Howarth played without
fire; the overly spacious acoustic left the more delicate, single-note
moments in Conlon Nancarrow's Piece No. 2 for Chamber Orchestra (1986)
sounding lost and remote, though a fair impression of its polyrhythmic
complexities and plucky simulation of jazz was nonetheless conveyed.
Jazz influence - the underlying theme of the weekend, whose extramural
events included a concert of student jazz pieces played by Sinfonietta
members in the foyer - was overt in Mark-Anthony Turnage's Kai of 1990. This
is a sort of pocket requiem for solo cello (Christopher van Kampen) and an
ensemble permeated by the svelte and mournful tones of muted trumpets and
longing melodies for saxophone, with bass guitar and drum kit to add plenty
of stomp and violence. But an early work, Etwas ruhiger im Ausdruck (1967),
by Franco Donatoni, scored for the instrumental quintet of Schoenberg's
Pierrot Lunaire and derived (we were told) from one bar of a Schoenberg
piano piece (Op. 23, No. 2), was, though skittish, almost the opposite of
jazz: studiously quiet, fragmentary, glistening phrases circling round and
round; while The City of Threads (1994), for 10 players, commissioned from
the Dane Anders Nordentoft was a chaste, attractive and brief display of
melody. Hans-Jurgen von Bose's Scene (1991) for large ensemble and two
synthesisers, on the other hand, was long and turgid.
Sunday evening's concert - also under Howarth - was better attended and had
a more cohesive and interesting programme, embracing a wacky piece, Marching
to a Different Song (1991), by Jonathan Lloyd; the electrifying simulation
of advanced jazz afforded by a more recent Donatoni work, Hot (1989), and
featuring John Harle's saxophone; a rare and quaint Sinfonietta (1928) by
the American experimentalist Henry Cowell; and the senior Dane Per Norgard's
colourful but meandering Night Symphonies, Day Breaks of 1992.
Nancarrow - a living link (born 1912) between the ragtime send-ups of
Charles Ives and the metrical abstractionism of Elliott Carter - was further
represented by No. 7 of his Sixty Studies for Player Piano and by its deft
chamber orchestration by the late Yvar Mikhashoff. The main point of these
extraordinary studies, composed directly on to punched piano rolls, is to
render different speeds and rhythms at once in a way that is dazzlingly
unplayable by hands on a keyboard; but an ensemble can, just, manage the
music. Mikhashoff's favouring of pungent timbres such as amplified
harpsichord does much to bring out the intricately interwoven strands; but
it was only after hearing the original roll, as realised on the pianola by
Rex Lawson, that one had to gasp 'Masterpiece]'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Cunningham's 'Ocean' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The brand new Brussels Arts Festival is much concerned with new theatre and
new dance. Or new-ish, one must say, given that its choreographic coup is a
creation from the 75 year old Merce Cunningham. Ocean, whose first
performance I saw last Wednesday, is the realisation of a work planned by
Cunningham and his long-time associate, the composer John Cage.
Conceived a year before Cage's death in 1992, Ocean is a 90 minute piece
whose structure had fascinated Cage and Cunningham: dance in a circular
arena, surrounded by its audience who are in turn surrounded by musicians
whose sounds wash - ocean-like - over public and performers.
What better locale then for this experiment than Brussels' Cirque Royal? It
is a setting exactly suited to the Cunningham/Cage demands. It is, even so,
an inimical spot. Alps have dreamed of being as steep and unyielding as its
seating, and 90 minutes spent in this vertiginous Little-ease are no
inducement to sympathy with what is going on below.
The event was certainly curious because of the forces involved and their
deployment, but I cannot, hand on heart, declare them to have been of much
interest. The sound-track combined 112 musicians skied on the outer rim of
the Cirque's top seating, playing a score by Andrew Culver, its droning
ostinato interspersed with recordings of whales, dolphins and other denizens
of the deep, who contribute the whistlings and borborygmi of what must be
marine gastro-enteritis of a particularly virulent kind. Down below, on the
central area of the Cirque, Cunningham's dancers meet up with the score in
the usual degage fashion. (We have learned to view Cunningham's titles as
mere conveniences rather than as guides to anything that happens.)
Aleatory procedures, the I Ching, and chance in all its unpredictability -
though with Cunningham chance is the one predictable fact - shape the dance.
There are interminable notes in the programme-book to justify and extol the
style, but what it amounts to is that Cunningham, armed nowadays with
computer-generated ideas, will fill the arena with arbitrary motion. In
1987, the Cage/Cunningham Roaratorio was very similarly shown at the Albert
Hall as part of a memorable Prom: the dance was cogent in effect,
exhilarating. Movement blossomed in this setting, as it often has in
Cunningham's Events, where choreography is given in unexpected combination.
Ocean, in which 15 dancers come and go in various groupings, variously
costumed and lit, seemed to me diffuse, arid, formulaic. I suspect that it
will benefit from the focus and direction given by a proscenium, and its
performers will then look less blank. Yet viewed from above - and it surely
matters not where you see it from if Cunningham's rule applies to audience
as well as to dance - it lacked even the stimulation one may get from
watching a crowd. Red digital clocks at the dancers' entry-points marked the
passing of 90 minutes. How slowly time passes when the avant-garde is having
fun.
Ocean will be shown at the Holland Festival from June 27 - 30 at the
Muziektheater, Amsterdam.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
For the past 25 years or so broadcasters in general and the BBC in
particular have gone to great lengths to ensure that we were all aware when
black people were being harmed in South Africa. Today in Assignment George
Alagiah reports how 150,000 people in Ethiopia died at the hands of Col.
Mengistu's government in the mid 1970s. In promoting the programme the BBC
blithely announces that this 'reign of terror' has been hidden until now. So
who has been hiding it? And why? It could not be, could it, that the South
African regime, perhaps responsible for a handful of black deaths, was white
while the Ethiopian regime, perhaps responsible for 150,000, was black?
Perish the thought (7.45 BBC2). Life Stories tells of the dreadful effects
of Alzheimer's disease, in this case on a man of only 49. Today Colin Winter
is 53 and can hardly speak, and often fails to recognise his family (8.00
BBC1). Omnibus is devoted to Robert Stephens who, after an absence from the
stage in the 1970s and 80s, returned triumphantly in 1992 with a magnificent
Falstaff (10.50 BBC1).

FT  24 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Waste of an opportunity - The UK
stance on market dominance has come in for criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer the UK government backed away from making radical changes to the
rules on abuses of market power by dominant companies. Its decision to do
little more than tinker with the present regime was a victory for the
Confederation of British Industry and the industry lobby which had opposed
the prospect of heavy fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods
too cheaply or refusing to supply certain outlets.
Not all companies were pleased, however - particularly those operating in a
market dominated by one organisation. They feared that the government's
decision would send the wrong messages.
In the UK's animal waste market, for instance, such fears are strong. Last
week three small independent companies went to the Office of Fair Trading to
protest at the lack of action on recommendations made last July by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to curb abuses of market power by Prosper
de Mulder (PDM), the UK's leading animal waste rendering company.
Last year's MMC inquiry marked the third time in a decade that the UK
competition authorities had probed the animal waste trade.
In 1985, the MMC found that PDM's strategy of growth by acquisition had been
harmful to abattoirs (the main source of red meat waste), and that PDM had
used its market power to respond aggressively to competitors seeking to
capture its raw material sources. It found PDM's pricing policy was designed
to exploit or maintain its monopoly. PDM gave undertakings that included an
agreement to notify the OFT before it bought any further animal waste
companies.
In 1991, PDM's purchase of the animal waste interests of Croda was referred
to the MMC. The commission found the merger would have an adverse effect on
competition, but cleared it on the grounds that Croda was a declining
competitive force and the deal would improve PDM's efficiency.
By autumn 1992, when the industry was again referred to the MMC, PDM had
bought several small animal waste collection businesses without notifying
the OFT, and mothballed the waste rendering plant at Market Harborough,
Leicestershire, bought from Croda.
Last year's MMC report found serious breaches by PDM of the 1986
undertakings and widespread discriminatory pricing. The MMC recommended that
PDM should be required to publish weekly a representative sample of prices
and charges from October, dispose of its Market Harborough plant within six
months, and be prohibited from making further acquisitions without OFT
approval, and that the 1986 undertakings be tightened.
Ten months later, PDM is not publishing weekly prices and has not disposed
of the Market Harborough plant. The three companies that complained to the
OFT last week say competition in the industry could be wiped out.
The OFT's official response is that consultations with PDM are continuing
and that 'there is no reason to suspect that consultation should not be
concluded satisfactorily'. PDM said yesterday it could not comment, as the
matter was under discussion with the OFT. But it denied it was in any way
responsible for the delay in implementing the MMC's recommendations.
Wherever the blame lies, competition lawyers say the failure of the
authorities to ensure effective competition in the animal waste industry
underlines the weakness of the UK system for tackling anti-competitive
behaviour by dominant companies. As one lawyer close to the case says: 'It's
a classic example of why the government was wrong in rejecting a tougher law
on abuse of market power.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / People: No Rathbones left on Rathbone board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Management changes after the Rathbone Brothers agm have left the private
client and asset management group with a new post of managing director and
without a Rathbone on the board.
Roy Morris, 52, who has been managing director of the group's Liverpool
operation, becomes group managing director. In a separate move, Sebastian
Rathbone, 61, has resigned from his post as vice-chairman of the group,
though he will remain a non-executive director of the main trading
subsidiary which deals with investment banking and fund management.
Morris says his new role would involve spending more time in the London
office, but reflected the importance of the Liverpool operation, which
contributed more than half the group's profits last year.
One of his tasks, he said, would be to achieve more integration between the
two UK offices. He joined Rathbones 37 years ago and has been based in
Liverpool ever since; he is 'looking forward to expanding my horizons'.
Rathbones' yet-to-be-appointed vice-chairman will probably be non-executive.
As for keeping the family connection, Morris commented: 'We're looking to
have younger Rathbones in the group in the near future.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / People: David Gelber joins the 'enemy'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives broker Intercapital has always had the reputation of throwing
some of the best parties in the business. David Gelber, at that time chief
operating officer of Midland Global Markets, walked into last year's thrash,
which had the Wild West as its theme, to find a poster on the wall: 'Grisly
Gelber - wanted for cutting brokerage'.
Gelber, 45, acknowledges the irony that he, once the scourge of the
brokerage business because of his attempts to force down commission levels,
should be joining the 'enemy'. He has just been appointed group managing
director of Intercapital, reporting to chairman and founder Michael Spencer.
A veteran of Citibank and Chemical, and Hong Kong Bank before its merger
with Midland, Gelber left Midland Global Markets in April. 'My first love is
derivatives,' says Gelber, who, despite his managerial role at Midland, is
basically a trader through and through, and sees himself as one of the
pioneers of the swaps market. 'I've had it with huge organisations.'
When Midland and Hong Kong Bank merged, he says he accepted the chief
operating officer slot because it was 'a big position. I guess I had more
grey hairs than most people. Someone needed to do the job.' But after a
while he appears to have fallen out with Guy Heald, a colleague from
Chemical days, and now head of Midland Global Markets. 'One grows apart -
like a marriage,' is all Gelber will say.
He admits that the Intercapital job came as rather a bolt from the blue. But
the entrepreneurial challenge fits the bill. He points out that he has
always been attracted to a variety of growing businesses; he was, for
instance, a founder director of Cafe Flo, the London brasserie chain.
'Intercapital has grown beyond anyone's expectations,' Gelber says,
explaining the need for the new position at the 8-year-old company. Between
its offices in London, New York and Tokyo, it now employs more than 200
people. 'I was brought in to lend some management expertise to a growing
organisation.'
Asked whether he had injected capital into the venture, Gelber refused to
comment.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on car quotas queried -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A European Commission decision not to investigate a complaint by consumers
against an agreement restricting imports of Japanese cars into the UK was
overturned last week by the European Court of First Instance.
The complaint concerned an agreement between the British Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association (JAMA) restricting the export of Japanese cars to the UK to 11
per cent of the total annual UK car sales.
The European Consumers Association (BEUC) and the National Consumer Council
(NCC) argued the agreement was contrary to the Rome treaty's ban on
restrictive agreements. They also alleged restrictions on access to the
market resulting from the agreement constituted an unlawful abuse of a
dominant position by SMMT.
The Commission took the view that there was not a sufficient Community
interest in opening a formal investigation procedure since the agreement
would be terminated soon by the EC/Japan consensus on car exports. Under
this, the EC committed itself to abolishing national restrictions of any
kind by January 1 1993, while Japan accepted a transitional period until
December 31 1999 to facilitate the adjustment of Community manufacturers to
adequate international competitiveness.
The Court treated the Commission's letter to the consumer groups as a
definitive rejection of their complaints. The Commission's letter stated
three grounds. Each justified the way the Commission exercised its
discretion on competition complaints as recognised by the CFI in the Automec
II case (T-24/90).
The CFI confirmed the Commission was not bound to investigate a formal
competition complaint. But it reiterated the Commission was obliged to
consider carefully the factual and legal issues brought to its attention by
a complainant, to assess whether those issues indicated conduct liable to
distort competition within the common market and affect trade between member
states.
Where the Commission rejected a complaint without an investigation, the
purpose of judicial review by the CFI was to ensure that the challenged
decision was based on a correct assessment of the facts and was not
invalidated by any error of law, manifest error of assessment, or abuse of
power.
The court held all three grounds invalid. The first and main ground was
undermined by a manifest error of assessment. The main reason given for not
investigating the past and present SMMT-JAMA arrangements was that there was
no reason to doubt that the arrangements would end by January 1 1993 because
of the commercial consensus on car exports.
None of the documentary evidence relied on by the Commission established
this would necessarily happen. In particular, the Commission failed to
explain why the transitional regime to December 31 1999 would be based on
anything other than the agreement. It was not impossible, therefore, that
the arrangements for implementing the transitional regime were incompatible
with EC competition law.
The second ground was wrong in law. The Commission wrongly treated the
agreement as if it were a national measure of commercial policy by relying
on its past approval by the UK, when it merely involved private economic
operators. The fact that the agreement was known, permitted or even
encouraged by national authorities did not exclude the competition rules.
The Commission's third ground for rejecting the complaint, namely that the
alleged infringement did not significantly affect trade between member
countries, was also wrong in law and insufficiently reasoned.
It could not be justified solely by asserting that the infringement did not
primarily concern trade between member countries. The CFI considered the
arrangements, by their very nature, were liable to impair the functioning of
the common market and the natural movement of trade because they restricted
imports into the Community and affected the entire territory of a member
country.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Cairns is to retire as secretary general of the International
Accounting Standards Committee next March, after ten years in the job.
His departure, which came as a surprise to many within the accounting world,
will coincide with a period of great change for the organisation.
Cairns, 47, said yesterday that he had decided he wanted to try a different
job after a decade and to leave while he was still enjoying his work.
He said he had no specific plans on what he would be doing next, although he
hoped to use the skills gained in international accounting, perhaps as a
consultant to a firm or multinational company.
By the time of his departure, the committee will have completed both a
restructuring and its comparability and improvements project which was
designed to reduce the number of alternative types of financial reporting.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Measure for measure - The Inland
Revenue has its eye on partners who plan to exploit tax changes, warns
Robert Rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough measures against tax avoidance, designed to limit the scope for the
UK's 9m self-employed people to exploit changes in personal taxation, have
been outlined by the Inland Revenue.
Many accountants had described the changes in personal taxation for the
self-employed, announced in the 1994 Finance Bill, as a significant,
one-off, tax-planning opportunity for UK partnerships. The bill covers the
introduction of self-assessment, and the changeover from taxation on a
preceding-year basis to a current-year basis from the 1997-98 tax year.
But the Inland Revenue's announcement has made this opportunity less
attractive.
Mrs Denise Catterall, a tax partner of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, had
said that transitional rules, while the changes were being introduced, would
enable partnerships to plan their tax payments. For partnerships in
existence on April 5 this year, 1996-97 will be a transitional year. Under
the transitional provisions, tax paid in 1996-97 will be a 12 months'
average of the tax payable on the profits arising in the two years to April
5 1996.
Thus for a partnership with a year end of April 30, the relevant accounts on
which tax will be assessed for the transitional year 1996-97 will be for the
periods May 1 1994 to April 30 1995 and May 1 1995 to April 30 1996. Tax
will be payable on 12/24ths, or half, of those results.
To take advantage of the transitional rules, partnerships anticipating any
large or unusual items of income were advised to try to ensure payment would
be made during the transitional assessment period, as it would effectively
be halved for tax averaging purposes. Equally, large one-off items of
expenditure, such as refurbishment or redundancy costs, ought to be kept out
of the assessment period, because a firm would effectively get tax relief on
only half.
Some partnerships may have already followed this advice. Firms with 1993-94
financial year ends which have passed may have brought forward exceptional
items of expenditure into the 1993-94 tax year or delayed receipt of
exceptional income to place it in the 1994-95 tax year. Partnerships which
have not yet reached their financial year end could still take advantage of
the tax-planning opportunity.
But their efforts may have been in vain. When details of the new system were
announced, the Inland Revenue also made it clear that it would bring forward
a narrowly targeted anti-avoidance measure. Details of how this will work in
practice will not be known until next year's finance bill is published, but
the Revenue has now published guidelines.
The Revenue identifies four 'triggers' which may bring the anti-avoidance
rules into play. Two of them - transactions with persons with whom the
taxpayer has a family or proprietorial link, and arrangements with
unconnected persons which are wholly or partly reciprocal or self-cancelling
 -are fairly straightforward. But the other two - a change or modification
of an accounting policy, and any changes in business behaviour - could
present problems.
Mrs Catterall says, as presently envisaged, the last trigger is very widely
drawn. It appears to mean that any change in a settled practice of a
partnership in relation to the timing of things such as the invoicing of
customers and the collection of debts, or the purchase of goods and
services, the incurring of business expenses and the settlement of debts,
could trigger the anti-avoidance rules.
This could catch a law firm which, in an effort to become more efficient,
decides to speed up its billing procedures. 'The last trigger effectively
gives the Revenue wide-reaching powers to allege that higher profits in the
affected transitional periods constitute avoidance of tax,' she says.
There are defences to a charge of tax avoidance, but they are narrowly drawn
and the onus will be on the taxpayer to prove the Revenue does not have a
case.
Once the Revenue has challenged a change in accounting policy or business
behaviour, it will be satisfied that avoidance has not taken place only if
the taxpayer can show:
that obtaining a tax advantage was not the main benefit, or one of the main
benefits, expected to arise from the change;
or that the change was undertaken solely for bona fide commercial reasons.
Obtaining a tax advantage will not be regarded as a bona fide commercial
reason. However, as obtaining a tax advantage is always likely to be at the
back of the mind of the well-advised taxpayer as 'one of the main benefits'
arising from a change of business behaviour, it will not be easy to satisfy
either of these defences, Mrs Catterall says.
But the real sting of the anti-avoidance proposals is in the tail. If the
taxpayer tries but fails to convince the Revenue that one of the defences is
satisfied, the penalties are heavy.
Where, for example, it is shown that profits have been moved into the
transitional period, then those profits will be taxed in full (at 40 per
cent in the case of a higher rate taxpayer) in addition to being taxed as
part of the averaged profits for the two years to 1996.
In other words, the profits caught by the anti-avoidance rules will
effectively be taxed one and a half times, or at an equivalent rate of 60
per cent.
There is time to try to persuade the Revenue to water down the penalties
before the finance bill is published early next year. In the meantime, with
further guidance from the Revenue as to how the anti-avoidance rules will
work in practice unlikely, partnerships still contemplating taking advantage
of the tax-planning opportunity must tread carefully.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Unusual means to a happy
end - A novel financing deal helped in the rescue of Standard Platforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week the London stock market witnessed one of its more unusual
corporate rescues. Standard Platforms, a supplier of optical imaging
systems, raised Pounds 450,000 through a share issue made necessary by a
disastrous expansion into the US.
It was not the size of the issue that was unusual, although raising such a
small amount would tend to be too small to justify the corporate finance
fee.
Nor was the reason for the rescue abnormal - the US has been a graveyard for
many UK companies which have thought North America was like their home
market, only bigger.
What distinguished the deal was that 30 private individuals subscribed an
average Pounds 17,000 in a rare, if not unique, example of a business angel
rescue.
To make the deal fly, IDJ, the corporate finance company that brought the
investors together, took its fee in shares. And 3i, the investment capital
supplier, agreed to convert Pounds 300,000 of loan stock into equity.
Standard Platforms had enjoyed a short and eventful public existence. With
the Pounds 1.6m raised when it came to the Unlisted Securities Market in
1990, it had tried to push into the US with a new product.
In the UK it had established a sound customer base supplying bespoke systems
to enable the likes of DHL and Securicor to store and retrieve optically the
records of thousands of documents they receive daily.
In the US the company had hoped to produce an off-the-shelf version of the
software it could sell to hospitals and clinics. Sales never materialised as
expected, losses mounted and the US subsidiary was sold.
The shares were suspended in March 1994 at 36p, valuing the group at Pounds
1.4m, when at their peak they had traded at more than 200p. In the 18 months
to September 1993 Standard Platforms had made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m
and had net liabilities of Pounds 574,000.
'The company was not exactly thriving but it was not bleeding,' says Peter
Dicks, who has joined as non-executive chairman. 'It was dead in the water,
not sinking,' says John Incledon, chairman of IDJ and the largest new
investor in Standard Platforms.
To sell the refinancing to new investors IDJ needed a manager respected in
the field. They found Iain Bowles who was, until the week before last, sales
and marketing director for the European operation of Fujitsu, the second
largest computer company in the world.
It then needed to convince 3i to convert its debt into equity, a move the
institution agreed to make if IDJ could get the share issue fully
underwritten by business angels.
'Getting the money was relatively simple,' says Mr Dicks. IDJ went on a
series of roadshows and sent 55 people an information package.
IDJ took a week to put the underwriting in place - all 30 investors were
required to sign a 'hold harmless' letter saying effectively that they were
aware their shareholding might prove to be valueless. It pulled off what
Dicks calls a 'typical US-style wipe-out financing' that diluted existing
shareholders to a 22 per cent stake but left the reconstructed balance sheet
with net cash of more than Pounds 200,000.
Could such an angel-backed financing be repeated? First, the group
organising such an underwriting needs a well-heeled list of investors who
have invested in private companies and know they may be saying goodbye to
their capital for a long time, if not for ever.
Of equal importance is the need to bring in good management without which no
investors would have been tempted. In the case of Standard Platforms, it
remains for Bowles to justify that faith in his abilities.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): The view from Bournemouth
 -Former Midland Bank chief Sir Brian Pearse talks to Richard Gourlay about
lending to small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this month Sir Brian Pearse spent an uncomfortable few hours in
Bournemouth, southern England. Speaking to an invited audience of 250
businessmen, Sir Brian was shocked to hear that antagonism towards the banks
was quite so pronounced.
'I thought things were getting better but I am beginning to wonder,' says
the man who retired as chief executive of Midland Bank, the UK high street
bank, in March. 'The strength of anti-bank feeling was quite strong. The
relationship is still disappointingly adversarial.'
This continuing tension between banks and their customers is something Sir
Brian believes has to be addressed if Britain's unemployment problem is to
be tackled.
Smaller businesses, which will be creating the jobs in future, cannot do
without the banks. And the banks, which he says have probably only broken
even servicing smaller companies over the last 10 years, have to find a way
to make this business profitable.
Sir Brian, who is sometimes seen as a traditionalist, believes this cause
will be best served by better implementation of old-fashioned banking
principles - getting closer to customers, understanding their businesses,
plans and management.
But he says there is also a place for banks to look at other sources of
income - such as taking equity stakes or equity options in customers'
businesses as part of a normal banking relationship.
Sir Brian's desire 'to do something about unemployment' was one reason he
has just accepted the post of chairman of the Housing Corporation. The
largest government quango, the corporation supervises the non-profit-making
housing associations which own and manage 700,000 rented homes.
But he has long believed that smaller companies should play a central role
in creating jobs.
He became particularly alarmed by the way relationships were developing
between the banks, smaller businesses and the government at the end of 1992.
It was a time when banks were being accused of benefiting most from base
rate cuts. 'The prime minister even said in a Guildhall speech that he just
hoped an interest rate cut would get passed on to the customers,' Sir Brian
says.
Until last week's Bournemouth meeting, Sir Brian thought things had been
improving.
The government, he says, had largely delivered what it promised, improving
the loan guarantee scheme, replacing the Business Expansion Scheme and
taking some action on late payment of debts.
From the other side of the fence, banks were encouraging businesses to
recognise they were too dependent on overdrafts and should look at longer
term forms of finance.
He accepts that the banks have made mistakes. They should, for example,
never have moved decision makers to big banking centres from the field,
where they could maintain strong links with their customers. Midland is now
reversing this and has put 208 senior head office bankers back into the
field after retraining because, as Sir Brian says, 'some have lost the
ability to lend'.
But Sir Brian believes the people who run smaller businesses are partly to
blame for poor relationships with the banks. There is, for example, a
'startling lack of training' among businessmen and women.
He compares the ease with which people can set up in business in Britain
with the German experience, where overall training levels are monitored and
approved by local chambers of commerce. 'Far too many people have gone into
business who should not have gone into business,' he says.
Too many businesses are under-capitalised, he says. And too many businessmen
are unrealistic about what they should pay the banks for overdrafts, a form
of finance which is often effectively risk capital. Too many businessmen
'expect equity on debt prices and quite cheap debt prices', he says.
'Customers don't think: 'how much of my own money can I get into my own
business', but, 'how much can I borrow', a startling difference with
Germany.'
Sir Brian is not overly-enthusiastic about banks taking equity stakes in
their customers' businesses,
but believes there is a case for taking options and 'phantom options' -
instruments that allow the bank a share of any up-side in the business in
addition to their regular loan margin. 'Options and phantom shares allow you
to lend slightly more generously,' he says. They also mean bankers would
have to become more involved in the way the businesses were running.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Small steps to an equity
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How close are we to the day when banks regularly take equity stakes in the
businesses to which they lend?
Among the UK high street banks, Midland is one of the closest to making such
a move part of every day banking.
Among others, only Royal Bank of Scotland is developing equity products
along similar lines through its specialised lending services division.
Midland's starting point is the recognition that the returns banks have made
from smaller businesses have been poor.
Too often banks have been lending what is effectively risk capital but have
only earned a debt return.
'The boards of all the banks must be very disappointed by the returns they
have made from this sector over the whole business cycle,' says David
McMeekin, corporate finance director of Midland Bank.
Midland's response is modest but a pointer to where small business banking
may be going:
At the smallest level, Midland is developing a product that would allow
business banking managers to make relatively small but unsecured loans to
well-managed companies with inadequate security but robust cash flows. The
bank would take equity options or a form of 'phantom options' - instruments
that carry rights to some up-side reward - which the owner-managers will be
encouraged to buy back from the bank. Midland accepts that it will need to
continue training bankers to recognise when equity could be useful and
relevant.
Since 1990 Midland, in common with some other banks, has adopted just this
approach for bigger customers with the same characteristics. For private
companies and smaller quoted companies, the bank will consider taking equity
options. With middle-sized family controlled companies, where a float is
unlikely, it will consider lending unsecured but will take phantom options.
Nearer to conventional venture capital but targeted at companies requiring
as little as Pounds 5,000-Pounds 150,000, there are 10 independently managed
Midland Enterprise Funds. An 11th office is to open in Wales on June 21.
They look at start-up and early-stage finance. To cut the set-up costs,
Midland has introduced standardised documents. By many accounts this is
proving a labour-intensive slog.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Technology: High price to pay for games at work -
Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey conducted last year by the US magazine Information Week found that
90 per cent of the executives questioned said computer games were available
in their office. Sixty per cent said they were played several times weekly
within their company.
California-based accountancy company SBT estimates that US businesses lose
as much as Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) a year in non-work related use of
computers.
Clearly, computer games should not be played for fun at work. There are
enough problems over determining what productivity benefits work-related
computer use delivers.
While business applications are often described by their creators as
'productivity packages', computer games could just as easily be described as
productivity killers. Yet the same leading vendors of business software
often distribute games with their software. The most popular game in US
offices is the card game Solitaire, distributed free with the Microsoft
Windows user interface. And US software mail order companies sometimes
package special promotional deals that include business software with free
games.
Games are also clogging the Internet international network, hampering its
use for commercial purposes. The culprit seems to be Netrek, a space
exploration game that involves two teams of eight players exploring a
computer-generated universe and interacting with each other. It is designed
to be played on networks and players say the game is addictive - so much so
that at least one US company is trying to work out a way of charging the
public to play it.
Computer game developers are well aware that many people play their games in
the office. As a result, several games have a feature that flashes a dummy
spreadsheet on to the computer display at a touch of a button; this is
useful for when the boss walks by.
However, certain games can be beneficial if used to educate staff and allow
companies to explore different business scenarios. California-based Maxis,
best known for its Sim series of computer games, uses its game software
technology to create applications that model business operations. It has
developed a package for Pacific Gas and Electric, called SimPower, that
allows management to simulate the impact of their decisions on power
consumption.
Banning computer games from work altogether would be difficult. But several
large corporations in the US such as Sears Roebuck, Coca-Cola Foods and Ford
Motor already have restrictions on game playing. Ford uses special software
that scans worker's computer systems to make sure there are no games.
However, some smaller companies, especially in the US, approve of game
playing as long as it is out in the open. Those which actually encourage
game playing at work - mostly in the US  - have properbudgets for game
purchasing. At some companies, staff at all levels will play games against
each other while connected to the office network. This is said to encourage
an esprit de corps. Even so, its value in increasing company productivity is
still questionable.
Anyone who has played computer games knows how easy it is to lose an hour or
more without realising it.
So while a policy to ban computer games at work will certainly be unpopular,
it may be a necessary step. If staff want to relax, a short walk outside
will certainly be more beneficial.
Studies have shown that computer game players often experience high stress
levels during play. And now that computers are so cheap, there are plenty of
opportunities for playing the games at home.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Technology: Russian banking jumps the queue - Getting money
out in Moscow can be a more high-tech experience than in the west / Software
at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a regional bank in Moscow, a woman of 84 - old enough to remember the
last tsar - is examining her plastic card. She approaches a manager who,
with charm and patience, explains what it is. She then guides the woman
through the process of withdrawing cash at the counter and shows her the
gleaming ATM (automatic teller machine) in the corner.
This versatile machine puts western versions to shame. Using colour
graphics, and a choice of languages to interrogate users, it zips out
bundles of roubles at the touch of a few buttons. For security reasons, its
screen can only be read from the appropriate angle by one user at a time:
bystanders and others in the queue cannot peek. Unlike more elderly western
counterparts, the cash withdrawn will be reflected immediately in the
balance shown on the next balance inquiry.
At the counter, people request various transactions using their cash-cards,
keying a secret Personal Identification Number into a big keypad. This
summons a database record which appears immediately on the cashier's screen
behind the counter. The cashier checks the transaction, matching the
signature on the printout slip with a facsimile on her screen. She approves
it with one keystroke, and out comes the cash, delivered through an
automatic chute: ready counted, in the requested denominations.
This is banking in real-time. As with the ATM, the withdrawal will show
immediately on the account balance. Supporting this sophisticated service is
a roomful of PCs and a tiny box of hard disks, known as Raid (Redundant
Array of Inexpensive Disks). The Raid boxes, manufactured by US storage
specialist Micropolis, replace the racks of paper files which were
previously the Moscow Savings Bank's only customer records.
All this suggests that Russia might actually be ahead of the west in some
banking services. A greenfield site in technology terms, and with very
little to spend, it has leapfrogged its more privileged counterparts in the
west by running real-time banking on a network of personal computers.
This branch of the Moscow Savings Bank was automated by Intermicro Business
Systems. This Russian-grown systems integrator has built up remarkable
expertise in banking solutions over the last few years.
The background to Russian banking is explained by Leonid Zabezhinsky, IBS's
director of banking. 'There is a traditional philosophy that it is best to
save. Enterprises and factories paid salaries through the bank, and they
managed all pensions. Inflation was unheard of and bankruptcy unthinkable.
'In any new suburb, the first building was the bakery. Next came the
laundry, the school, the nursery, and then the bank: it was an integral part
of common life.'
The average customer is not yet used to a 'choice' of bank, and simply goes
to the local branch, as does everyone else in the suburb. This branch of the
Moscow Savings Bank is one of 40 in the region, employing 2,000 staff and
running 500,000 accounts each, which in turn will support between 20 and 40
sub-branches (730 in all). In Moscow's 35 boroughs live 15m people: everyone
has an account. The branches answer to a regional head bank, of which there
are 87 (including Kiev and St Petersburg) at national level.
Unwieldy paper systems are difficult and expensive to service and do not
allow the user to visit any other branch. Like paper-based medical records
at a surgery, they belong in one place, and stay there. Their effect is easy
to see at an old-style branch of the same bank, where customers queue
repeatedly for different stages of the transaction.
In the last three years, banks have become anxious to enter the 20th
century, says Zabezhinsky. 'Five years ago, the first commercial banks
started to grow. Eventually, all the people heading them are bankers not by
education, but by mentality. In the last two years banks have grown from 12
to 1,000.
'Today the situation is similar to the west: stringent competition using the
highest technology. We're using cards with magnetic strips, some smartcards
with embedded chips and the customer's picture and signature on the front.
We have grasped this technology at the moment of its birth.'
Because the customer belongs to the branch, rather than the bank, it made
more sense for the Moscow Savings Bank to start locally, automating from the
bottom up, rather than the top down. 'In effect, with no centralised
technology, it's only possible to have a client of the sub-branch, not of
the entire bank,' explains Zabezhinsky.
'It was very hard to change the mentality. We see ourselves as business
people first and technologists second, whereas many of our programmers still
share the old separatist IT mentality.'
In making such a leap from the old to the new, the bank met head on the
problems of change management. The old woman probably could not have chosen
a better person to approach than Helen Taganova, manager of the automation
department. She has great sympathy for end-users but also a firm grasp of
the new real-time way of banking.
'Our bank doesn't look like most in Moscow. We would never have this system
today without our manager, who really drove the project. Practically all the
managers of sub-branches were replaced by people who shared the vision.'
The IBS solution was chosen as the only 'self-supporting' system that could
grow as banking changed, rather than reflecting outdated techniques adapted
from the west. There were some traumatic staff changes and training was long
and thorough for bank staff. 'Our task was to work out the technology,' says
Taganova.
'It is working well, but we have had many changes in implementation. The
system checks itself daily, and fulfils all routine standing orders and so
on. Audit trails are built in. But sometimes a special request comes up from
a client of one of the sub-branches. This has concentrated our attention on
special needs. We have created a large menu, and it's easy to add new
options.
'I can say that the skills in this department are highly developed enough to
solve any banking problem. If we understand the problem, we can find a
solution: we're not afraid of any application task,' says Taganova.
The ATMs provide a good example of forward planning. 'Currently, there are
only 10 ATM 'bankomats', and all of them are inside because we had to be
sure of reliability and acceptance tests. But eventually they will be
everywhere, not just in banks.'
There is a Novell network of around 50 PCs inside each branch, connected to
sub-branches, all of which have their own local area network. For the head
office, the paperwork produced by the computer has to comply with the
old-style paper systems. Nevertheless staffing levels have fallen in
automated branches, especially in checking and auditing. Errors are rare,
and a mere three accountants now oversee 18 sub-branches. Checking for
accuracy and logic is done by two people instead of 18.
Telecommunications are the rogue factor in building such networks. They are
patchy in Russia: telephone exchanges can date anywhere from the 1940s, so
IBS supplies its own channels.
Banks in the UK could make a lot more use of Raid technology in
counteracting fraud, for such process-heavy tasks as fingerprinting,
according to Trevor Duplock, managing director of Micropolis UK, which
supplies IBS with Raid technology.
Anatoly Karachinsky, IBS's founder, saw bank automation as a window of
opportunity seven years ago, and has made sure IBS is able to support every
area. This means not just tying together the elements of the hardware system
but in some cases providing the networking and telecommunications. Analyst
Esther Dyson, president of EDventure, a venture capital investor in eastern
computer markets, sees IBS as one of the few Russian computer companies that
might set its sights beyond Russia. 'Karachinsky is a remarkable
entrepreneur,' she says. 'IBS could help make the East become part of a
wider world.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / Shake-up of electricity pool backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest companies in England and Wales are hoping for a cut in
electricity prices after senior power-industry executives agreed to back a
campaign to allow electricity to be bought and sold outside the wholesale
trading pool.
Companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries have long complained that by
being forced to trade through the pool, rather than conclude simpler
bilateral agreements with electricity generators, they have paid higher
prices for power than are justified.
The power industry, including the generators, has been sceptical of moves to
allow pool bypass arrangements, arguing that it might lead to companies
trading outside the pool to avoid paying a share of costs needed to run the
electricity system.
However, pressure for a change of stance has grown in recent months after
Offer, the industry's regulator, asked the industry to give the matter
urgent consideration.
It is partly in response to this that the majority of a pool strategy group,
made up of senior executives representing all parts of the industry, is
recommending that arrangements be developed for non-pool trading.
Representatives of the large generating companies, which previously were
among the most sceptical about change, now support themove.
However, about a third of the strategy group, mainly representatives of
regional electricity companies, oppose it. They argue that hedging
instruments, known as contracts for differences, already in effect allow for
non-pool trading.
Opponents fear that setting up bypass arrangements might be expensive but
would produce little benefit for either the industry or its customers. It
might also make the system less transparent.
Mr Ken Green, utilities buyer at ICI, yesterday welcomed the view of the
group majority. Yet he warned that any bypass arrangements would have to
include incentives to encourage generators to make non-pool deals.
'If they do, then there is a real chance that prices can drop for large
users,' he said.
The pool strategy group in its report commissioned by the pool executive on
reform has also rejected wholesale changes to the way in which prices are
determined.
Offer last year asked the pool to consider a system through which generators
would be paid the price they offered for each generating unit, rather than
the 'marginal price', which is determined by the most expensive generated
unit needed to run the system.
Some large users considered this to be a fairer, more logical system. But
several have changed their minds after considering the issue; one fear is
that it would lead to even more complication in a highly complex trading
system.
It is understood Offer has received a hostile response to the bidding
changes and is unlikely to push for reform.
In another recommendation, the pool strategy group has said permanent
arrangements should be set up to transfer responsibility for some of the
'uplift', or administration costs, of running the pool to the National Grid
company.
The committee suggests a more refined system than the temporary one put in
place earlier this year.
Under this, various cost elements would be separated and National Grid would
only be given control of those parts where its management could make a
difference. The rest would stay with the pool.
The pool intends to reach conclusions by September.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Motor trade and BT to create data 'highway'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications and two retail motor-trade associations have
joined forces to create what they hope will become an electronic data
interchange 'highway' for the motor industry.
The project, which links BT with the Retail Motor Industry Federation and
the Automotive Distribution Federation, is designed to allow low-cost
communications and the undertaking of a wide range of transactions between
all parties involved in selling, financing and maintaining vehicles.
To start with transmissions will relate to vehicle servicing and invoicing
between dealers and customers. However, 'it will develop to encompass
product and parts ordering, service information and advice, finance,
insurance and much more', said Mr Trevor Parkerson, business development
manager of the RMI, which represents most sections of the retail motor trade
including about 7,000 franchised car dealers.
None of the main carmakers and importers however, has been directly involved
in creating the network. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the
main trade voice of the manufacturers and component producers, has been
developing a separate data highway - although this is concerned more with
manufacturer-supplier relationships than with retailing. But both the RMI
and SMMT agreed yesterday that the systems could be 'very compatible'.
As for manufacturers of cars and commercial vehicles, each has developed its
own data interchange systems with dealers. Mr Alan Pulham, head of the RMI's
National Franchised Dealers Association, agreed its members would need
persuading to adopt the planned highway's protocols for their own
transactions.
Called the Automotive Transactions Highway, the RMI-initiated venture can
use existing dealer-management systems hardware.
The first 'Fleetlink' enables motor retailers to exchange purchase and
service orders with fleet customers with a start-up cost of Pounds 300 and
running costs of about Pounds 50 a month.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Challengers set pace in City telecoms war: Andrew Adonis
examines a hothouse for phone-line competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the City of London is a foretaste of things to come in telecoms, British
Telecommunications should be worried. One of the stronger rivals threatening
the huge organisation in the Square Mile has been operating for only a few
months and has fewer than 50 employees.
Tomorrow another rival enters the lists. MFS, a US carrier providing
services in 23 US cities, will launch the City's fourth telecoms network;
and about a dozen other operators are offering competing services over
leased lines.
In the UK as a whole BT still carries nearly 90 per cent of telecoms
traffic, in spite of the abolition of its monopoly in 1984. In the US,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the long-distance carrier which had its
stranglehold on the US market broken in the same year, has had its share
pushed well below 70 per cent.
Yet in the City it is the competitors to BT that boast about 70 per cent of
the total market for telecoms services. Mr Michael Hepher, managing director
of BT, concedes that the company has lost 'more than half' of City business;
most analysts put the figure far higher. Nearly all of that business has
gone to Mercury.
A strict contrast with the US is problematic, since local telephony in the
US is mostly in the hands of the 'Baby Bells' - the seven regional Bell
companies created by the 1984 break-up of AT&amp;T. In some cities - including
New York, where MFS is a significant force - the Baby Bells are on the
defensive, but in few if any have they received the battering BT has
experienced in the Square Mile.
Competitive pressures are weaker still in continental Europe. The monopolies
of state operators are still largely intact in the rest of the European
Union; nowhere are rivals allowed to provide public infrastructure as in the
UK.
The attraction of the City is obvious: its concentration of large corporate
users, with multi-million pound telecoms bills and telecoms managers eager
for new opportunities.
Mercury, established 10 years ago, has built up its business by undercutting
BT tariffs by 10 per cent or more, and offering special discounts for volume
customers.
Ironically, Mercury may be the victim of its own success. 'For us the first
move was the most difficult to contemplate,' said the telecoms manager of
one of the City's leading banks. 'But Mercury taught us two lessons: first,
to keep to short contracts; and second, that you can cope with more than one
carrier fairly easily, providing they are competent.' The bank in question
now has four suppliers: BT, Mercury, Colt - a US company serving only the
City, which has its own 37km fibre network which is being expanded fast -
and Worldcom, another US company, which re-sells time on national and
international lines leased from other operators.
Worldcom and Colt have developed strong City reputations - over two years in
the first case and in a matter of months in the case of Colt. Both are
products of the liberalisation of telecommunications carried through by the
government three years ago, when the post-privatisation duopoly of BT and
Mercury was broken.
Both also give the lie to the idea that a modern telecoms company needs a
cast of thousands to be plausible. Colt has fewer than 50 staff, mostly in
marketing and account management. It has contracted out the laying of its
fibre network. 'We may seem small,' said Mr Paul Chisholm, Colt's managing
director. 'But because we are focused on the City market, we can give more
individual attention to customers than they get from BT and Mercury.'
The new competitors claim to be cheaper than BT and Mercury, although
general comparisons are difficult because companies quote for specific
requirements. They are also focusing on differentiated services, such as
dedicated corporate networks.
Mr Michael Storey, MFS managing director, said: 'The ability to mobilise new
services with the right back-up support is going to be the key.'
Not all the new operators are competing against each other. Colt, for
instance, is concerned only with carrying local traffic and its capacity is
being leased by long-distance and international re-sellers such as Worldcom
and Esprit. These want a local network to connect to their customers and say
they get a quicker and cheaper service from Colt than from BT. Colt is also
in talks with Energis - a new long-distance carrier that is erecting its own
local network on National Grid pylons - about providing 'last-mile'
connections.
BT and Mercury are fighting hard to retain and increase their City business.
Most of BT's traffic from the City now goes through one of the company's
five discount schemes for large users, offering savings of up to 16 per cent
on standard tariffs.
BT has also set up teams to recapture lost corporate clients. It claims to
have recouped about Pounds 200m of business from Mercury, with Citibank, the
Prudential and National Power among them.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Court rejects criminal injuries plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday rejected an application by 11 unions to declare
unlawful the government's plan to reform the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Scheme, replacing individual assessments with a fixed tariff from April 1.
Two judges rejected the union claims that Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
had acted 'in a constitutionally outrageous way' by introducing a different
tariff scheme.
The challenge was brought by the Trades Union Congress and unions
representing nurses, firefighters, train drivers, teachers, local authority
workers and bank staff concerned that the new scheme would leave members
worse off when they are seriously injured at work by criminal assault.
They had argued that Mr Howard abused his powers when he blocked the old,
more generous scheme from being given statutory effect under the 1988
Criminal Justice Act, even though it had received parliamentary approval.
Lord Justice Staughton, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, ruled that the home
secretary had acted within his powers and had not been legally obliged to do
what the unions wished.
The judge said: 'Once one reaches the conclusion that the home secretary was
not obliged to bring the statutory provisions into force, I cannot see there
is anything irrational or improper in his deciding not to do so, or in
bringing in another scheme under common law.'
The court gave the unions leave to appeal.
Mr Andrew Dismore, the unions' solicitor, said they were 'actively
considering' whether to appeal - parliament had yet to have the opportunity
to 'properly scrutinise the new arrangements'.
The Home Office said last night that 60 per cent of those affected would
receive the same or more compensation than under the old scheme. There was
no statutory requirement for parliamentary approval in changing the
compensation terms.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'Innocent victims of crime are
the latest unfortunate people targeted to endure the heartlessness of this
government's obsessive cost-cutting.'
The court's judgment meant in effect that 'workers who suffer injury as a
result of criminal activities can no longer expect to receive recompense for
loss of earnings - even if they are away from work for prolonged periods due
to their injury'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / British Council theft linked to gang behind Pounds 1/2m
fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A gang responsible for defrauding the British Council of more than Pounds
500,000 appears to be behind a cheque theft that has cost the
government-funded body more than Pounds 70,000, the Treasury has admitted.
In its response to a critical report from the Commons public accounts
committee on the original fraud, the Treasury said subsequent police
inquiries uncovered the theft of two blank cheques from the council, the
body which promotes UK cultural interests overseas.
One was used to draw Pounds 70,104.60 in April 1992. The other, which has
not been presented, has been cancelled.
Police have concluded that the theft was carried out by the same gang that
stole Pounds 520,072 by transferring funds electronically into the overseas
bank accounts of bogus suppliers in December 1992.
A British Council employee has been arrested on suspicion of involvement in
the theft, and has been suspended pending the outcome of police and council
inquiries.
Police believe that the discovery of the cheque theft has established an
internal connection between the gang that committed the earlier fraud and
the council, the Treasury said.
Mr John Hanson, the council's director-general, told the public accounts
committee in December that the gang had access to 'insider information'.
In its report on the fraud published in March, the committee criticised the
failure to identify the source of the information.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Ashdown puts poll at heart of platform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday put the pledge of a referendum on further moves
towards European integration at the centre of the Liberal Democrats'
European election platform.
Launching a manifesto designed to appeal to disaffected Tory voters, the
Liberal Democrat leader underlined his party's support for the goal of a
single European currency and increased integration on defence.
But he said Britain should retain a veto over executive decisions on
monetary and strategic defence policy by the Council of Ministers. This
would be in the context of an extension of qualified majority voting to
areas such as troop deployments and Common Agricultural Policy reform.
At an upbeat press conference Mr Ashdown was at pains to adopt a balanced
stance, saying a single currency would have disadvantages as well as
advantages and insisting that Britain would retain its right not to have
soldiers committed to specific conflicts.
Commenting on the manifesto's pledge to seek 'popular assent' if the 1996
intergovernmental conference proposed 'fundamental changes', he said there
were 'nine chances in 10' that a referendum would be the appropriate
mechanism.
Yesterday's 28-page document called for an independent central bank but
mentions a single currency only once, saying the party would 'move in step
with Britain's European partners' towards this goal.
It takes a similarly measured tone on employee rights. It says: 'We want to
see an effective framework of individual employment rights throughout
Europe, while rejecting the centralised straitjacket of a European-wide
minimum wage or maximum 35-hour week.'
On the reform of EU institutions, it calls for cuts in the size of the
European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European parliament.
But it says the parliament should be given equal legislative rights to the
council.
The manifesto insists that Britain's right not to have defence forces
committed to combat must be maintained, but makes clear that, even if it
exercised this right, Britain would have to help pay for its EU partners to
deploy their troops. What the document has to say on defence will be
scrutinised particularly carefully by the Tories in light of the strong
Liberal Democrat challenge anticipated in south-west England, which is
highly dependent on defence.
On the environment, the party would seek to enforce the principle that
polluters should pay for the damage they cause, as well as extending the
powers of the European Environment Agency. It would phase out existing
nuclear power stations by the year 2020 and 'rapidly develop' alternative
power sources, such as wind, wave and tidal power.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Conservatives enter the fray with a balancing act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The balancing act is encapsulated in the manifesto's title: A strong Britain
in a strong Europe.
The Conservatives will be positive about Europe before the June 9 poll for
the Strasbourg assembly. But the party will be more positive still about its
determination to get Britain's way in Europe.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and author of the manifesto, has
managed to exclude from the text the more extreme demands of colleagues on
the anti-European right of the party. The doors are not slammed completely
on the possibility of an eventual return to the European exchange rate
mechanism - or of participation in a single European currency. There is no
promise of the referendum sought by the Euro-sceptics on the next stage of
European integration.
As Mr John Major says in the document's foreword, the argument it advances
is not framed in terms of Europe Right or Wrong but Europe Right or Left. It
is the ambitions of the socialist centralisers for Europe's institutions
that the government abhors, not the institutions themselves.
But the manifesto's tone reflects the mood of a party willing to accept,
even embrace, Europe if that can be done on Britain's terms; but quick to
reject it if anyone else threatens to set the agenda. It is as defensive as
it is positive.
First the positive. Mr Major dismisses at the outset the idea floated by
some on the Conservative right that Britain might in the next few years have
to reassess whether it should belong to the EU.
Its opening words state baldly: 'Our membership of the European Union is
vital to Britain.' Mr Major reinforced that point at yesterday's launch when
he ridiculed the notion of a repeat of the 1975 referendum on membership.
A lengthy section on the European economy makes the same point. Britain's
trade, its inward investment and its employment prospects are all linked
inextricably to the EU.
The manifesto argues that the government is winning the debate over the need
for a new focus on competitiveness, flexible labour markets and
de-regulation. Pledging the government's determination to promote free trade
and the completion of the single market, it adds: 'Open markets are the
Oxygen of Growth.' To that end Britain will press for further liberalisation
of the telecommunications, transport and energy sectors.
The manifesto is replete with examples of where the government has set the
agenda for the rest of Europe: in the push for subsidiarity; in the
promotion of intergovernmental co-operation at Maastricht; and in the
acceleration of enlargement.
But for every positive idea there is a plan or ambition that the
Conservatives will thwart - and a charge that Labour and the Liberal
Democrats would sell Britain's interests short. Conservatives will resist
any move to increase the present limits on EU spending or any threat to the
rebate Britain receives on its contribution to Brussels.
The government will defend implacably the British veto. As Mr Major puts it
in his foreword: 'We want less interference from Brussels not more.'
The prime minister has been told by opinion pollsters that this negative
message has the best hope of persuading disgruntled supporters to vote
Conservative on June 9. The odds are that it will quickly drown out the
positive.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Apology sought from MP over bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lady Olga Maitland, the Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam, came under
further pressure yesterday to apologise for her role in wrecking the
backbench bill which sought to establish new rights for the disabled.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, told the Commons she had made
representations to Lady Olga.
The MP has recently returned to Westminster after a visit with a
parliamentary delegation to Malawi.
Ms Liz Lynne, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on health, asked whether
Lady Olga was prepared to apologise for 'misleading the House about the
drafting of amendments tabled in her name' to the disability (civil rights)
bill.
Lady Olga, who was not in her place in the Commons chamber when the issue
was raised yesterday, had insisted in earlier exchanges that she was
responsible for the amendments. She said: 'I sought consultation, but it
would be totally unfair to suggest that they came from any other source.'
Opposition MPs claim that her amendments were among those drafted by
parliamentary counsel referred to by Mr Nicholas Scott, minister responsible
for the disabled, when he apologised for misleading the House during the
controversy over the bill.
Referring to a demonstration staged earlier in the day, Miss Boothroyd said
some disabled people were 'unfortunately encouraged by some members of the
House to crawl up the steps at St Stephen's entrance for the benefit of the
media'.
She reaffirmed that the disabled were able to gain access to the House
through New Palace Yard.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Labour seeks to combat 'lies' of opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the promises and read between the lines.
Labour's priority was clear yesterday as the party's leaders launched their
European manifesto, Make Europe Work for You. The aim, as Mrs Joyce Quin,
European affairs spokeswoman, put it, was simple: to combat Conservative
'lies' about Labour's policies.
The manifesto makes it clear that, contrary to Conservative claims, Labour
wants to retain the British veto on European directives in areas of key
national interest such as fiscal and budgetary policy, foreign and security
issues, and changes to the Treaty of Rome.
A Labour government would sign up 'immediately' to the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty, from which Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured a
controversial opt-out.
But the manifesto rejects the Tory claim that the party has signed up to a
compulsory 35-hour working week - even though such a directive is canvassed
in the manifesto of the European Socialist Group, to which Labour is
affiliated.
It says shorter working hours are one of 'many possible approaches', but
this is 'a matter primarily for agreement between employers and employees,
taking care to protect people at work from exploitation'.
There are plenty of other policy pledges: reform of the 'wasteful' Common
Agricultural Policy; enlargement of the European Union to include all
democratic states with good human rights records and independent courts.
The manifesto also urges more powers for the EU in relatively
uncontroversial areas such as control of cross-border environmental
pollution; and institutional reforms to open the Council of Ministers to the
public and force it to record and publish its votes.
But there will be more interest in what the party leaders left out.
The manifesto leaves many questions unanswered about Labour's long-term
approach to the key issues which must be settled if European integration is
to continue.
For example, the manifesto repeats Labour's established support for a
managed system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates as part of a movement
towards economic and monetary union.
It makes clear such a step could be taken only after convergence of both the
real and the monetary economies of member states. But it also urges the EU
to take 'further steps to promote such convergence' at the next
inter-governmental conference of member states in 1996.
The manifesto does not say what those steps should be, or whether the system
of managed exchange rates means a return to the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System, from which the UK withdrew in disarray in
1992, or to some other system.
The manifesto also ignores the crucial question of how to reform the
qualified majority voting system in the Council of Ministers.
Labour leaders say the issue - how to prevent groups of small countries from
out voting big countries on important issues - is still under consideration.
There is also no hint on whether the party thinks moves towards a single
currency or other fundamental steps towards European integration should be
approved in a referendum.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting party leader, said a referendum had not
been ruled out, but no such commitment appears in the manifesto.
In the meantime, Labour seeks to rely on co-operation between member states
to implement co-ordinated monetary and fiscal policies.
The mechanism for this would include co-ordinated interest rate cuts,
creation of a Europe-wide 'recovery fund' to generate jobs, and incentives
to encourage investment in manufacturing and infrastructure projects.
Mrs Beckett claimed that Labour offered a balance between the Conservatives'
'confusion and disunity' on Europe and the Liberal Democrats'
'unconditional, unquestioning support' for Brussels.
'With Labour, you get the right balance. A party committed to Europe and to
Britain's place at the centre of Europe. But equally determined to use that
strength and authority in the interests of Britain and its people,' she
said.

FT  24 MAY 94 / PM plays nationalist card in Euro campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vote Conservative if you want to preserve British jobs and British
sovereignty. That was the message Mr John Major gave the voters of Bristol
last night.
The prime minister used his first mass rally of the European election
campaign to tell a hand-picked audience of 600 Tory activists in this
affluent but recession-touched south-western city that Conservative policies
would produce 'a strong Britain in a strong Europe'.
This was quite different from the federal European superstate that the
'Liberals' and 'socialists' wanted to see.
'A Labour or Liberal vote would be a vote for a weak Britain in a federal
European superstate,' Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, told the faithful
while they awaited the arrival of the man of 'principle' and 'integrity'
they had come to see.
The two men were preaching to the converted, although the standing ovation
the prime minister's speech generated was polite rather than ecstatic. The
verdict was that Mr Major's pragmatic vision had struck a good balance
between underlining the importance of Britain's relationship with Europe and
standing up for its interests.
'I thought he outlined a good vision of Europe from the British point of
view: we don't want to lose our sovereignty but we cannot afford to be
isolationist,' said Ms Ann Armstrong, a local party worker.
Mr Geoff Gollop, another Tory activist, said: 'John Major's points on the
fact that we can be European and British are just so important; I believe he
epitomises that view.'
The only discordant note was struck by a small bunch of demonstrators
brandishing a sign saying 'Honk if you hate Major' in the street outside.
The majority of drivers duly obliged.
The west country is a vital electoral battleground. From Doone country to
Hardy country, Tory incumbents are under threat from Liberal Democrats on a
roll after their local election successes.
The Tory party must prevent this rebellion from spreading too far east if it
is to stave off its second electoral embarrassment in two months.
Much of what Mr Major said - and his catchiest slogans  - were aimed at the
Liberal Democrats. 'Think before voting Liberal,' he urged his audience.
'And if you think before voting Liberal, you will find it unthinkable to
vote Liberal.'
When he appeared on the stage, serenaded by his familiar Purcell theme tune,
Mr Major was in relaxed mood, pledging not to resort to party political
slogans. But it was not long before he played the nationalist card, arguing
it was essential that Britain retained its veto in the European Council of
Ministers if it was not to lose all manner of things, including an
independent foreign policy and its own rules on immigration.
He devoted a long passage to the need to open markets and cut red tape in
order to tackle unemployment. To seek to regulate was folly. Europeans were
unable to find jobs 'precisely because of bureaucracy'.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The manifestos: three pitches on Europe

FT  24 MAY 94 / Fight for riverboat inquest renewed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The mothers of two victims of the 1989 Marchioness riverboat disaster on the
Thames yesterday renewed their legal bid to force the reopening of an
inquest into the tragedy before a new coroner.
Lawyers for the women accused Dr Paul Knapman, the coroner who conducted the
basic inquest into the incident in which 51 people died, of being
unreasonable in refusing to conduct a fuller inquiry.
He was also accused of showing 'apparent bias' to the extent that he should
disqualify himself from any further hearing.
The Court of Appeal was told that Dr Knapman had described one of the
mothers to a newspaper as being 'unhinged'. He had written in a letter that
others among the bereaved were mentally unwell, said Mr Daniel Brennan QC
for the two women.
Mr Brennan said the collision between the pleasure boat and a dredger was
unique among recent catastrophes in that there had been no public inquiry or
full inquest.
The hearing was adjourned until today.

within the European Union.'
The manifesto is replete with examples of where the government has set the

promotion of intergovernmental co-operation at Maastricht; and in the
acceleration of enlargement.
It calls on the union to build on co-operation in home-affairs policies to
launch a concerted drive against crime and acknowledges the need for a more
coherent European approach to defence.
The manifesto says the process of enlargement should include the creation of
a free-trade area stretching eastwards as far as Russia as well as the
accession of the four Visegrad countries - Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Poland.
But for every positive idea there is plan or ambition that the Conservatives
will thwart - and a charge that Labour and the Liberal Democrats would sell
Britain's interests short. Labour is said to have signed up for 'a lethal
concoction of high taxation, high borrowing, bureaucratic meddling and extra
burdens on business'.
Conservatives will resist any move to increase the present limits on EU
spending or any threat to the rebate Britain receives on its contribution to
Brussels.
The government will defend implacably the British veto. It will oppose the
interventionist, bureaucratic instincts of Brussels in favour of minimum
interference in national affairs.
There will be no advance commitment on a single currency. The successor
treaty to Maastricht, due for negotiation at the 1996 intergovernmental
conference, must continue the process of decentralisation.
As Mr Major puts it in his foreword: 'We want less interference from
Brussels not more.'
The prime minister has been told by opinion pollsters that this negative
message has the best hope of persuading disgruntled supporters to vote
Conservative on June 9. The odds are that it will quickly drown out the
positive.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Non-EU trade deficit narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A jump in oil exports helped to narrow the UK's visible trade deficit with
countries outside the European Union to Pounds 566m in April, compared with
Pounds 686m in March, according to figures published by the Central
Statistical Office yesterday.
Increased North Sea oil production helped produce a Pounds 55m surplus on
the oil account, the highest surplus since May 1988. Oil exports in the
three months to April were 33 per cent higher than in the previous three
months.
If oil and erratic items, such as precious stones, are excluded, the visible
trade deficit in April was Pounds 686m, almost unchanged from the Pounds
690m recorded in February and March.
In value terms, exports rose 3.6 per cent between March and April, while
imports increased only 1 per cent. The CSO estimates that the value of
exports and imports is growing by 0.5 per cent a month.
In volume terms, exports were 5.5 per cent higher in the three months to
April than in the previous three months, while imports fell by 0.5 per cent.
But if oil and erratics are excluded, the pattern is less favourable: export
volumes were 1.5 per cent higher in the three months to April than in the
previous three months, while import volumes were 1 per cent higher over the
same period.
Strong growth was noted in exports of food, beverage and tobacco and of
semi-manufactures.
However, imports of finished manufactures continued to grow more strongly
than exports in volume terms.
There is some sign in the figures that the rate of increase in export prices
is slowing. Export prices in the three months to April were only 1.5 per
cent higher than in the previous three months, while import prices rose 4.5
per cent.
'This is encouraging,' said Mr Jonathan Loynes, an analyst at Midland Global
Markets. 'And (it) suggests UK exporters have finally realised they were
losing competitiveness in pursuit of higher prices and margins.'
UBS, the securities house, is pessimistic about the trade outlook. It said:
'While export volumes are proving to be more buoyant, we also expect a
significant deterioration in the import bill. Surging domestic demand should
ultimately inflate the trade deficit.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / 'Undemocratic' moves to cut red tape spark anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's de-regulation bill was given a third reading amid backbench
protests that sweeping new powers for ministers to cut red tape were
undemocratic.
The measure, which was passed by 291 votes to 242, will give ministers the
ability to repeal or amend de-regulation laws through orders, which can be
dealt with on a single Commons vote rather than through the more lengthy
legislative process.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said: 'The order-making power is needed
for the timely removal of laws imposing burdens on business. We need an
effective mechanism to deal with these burdens both now and in the future.'
He rejected Labour-led calls for a five-year limit on ministers' new powers
and for an annual de-regulation bill, saying a time limit would not be
appropriate.
Some Tory backbenchers opposed the new powers. Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for
Aldridge Brownhills, intervened to ask Mr Sainsbury: 'Why is it necessary to
have these extraordinary powers that contradict our constitution?' He
accused the government of trying to bring an administrative device to govern
England, Scotland and Wales as it governs Ulster.
Mr Gary Waller, MP for Keighley, said: 'A general power to create or amend
the law, even with limitations, is a power which should certainly give us as
parliamentarians pause for thought, and we should at the very least set a
time limit on its application.
'I am afraid that at the end of the day to place untrammelled power in the
hands of ministers, not of this government but of any government, is
something which I have to reject.'
Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's industry spokesman, said no Labour government
would use the powers, which he described as 'an abuse of the House of
Commons'.
Earlier, Labour had attacked plans to reduce regulations governing standards
for operators of heavy trucks, fearing the move would harm road safety.
Mr Fatchett said: 'All the evidence points to the need for the current
system to be maintained or toughened up - not weakened.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / Consumer gloom on finances lessens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
April's tax rises appear to be losing their power to shock, with consumers
less pessimistic about their own finances and the nation's economic
prospects, a survey from Gallup indicated yesterday.
The survey, conducted this month for the European Commission, found a marked
decline in the number of people predicting a worsening of their financial
situation during the next 12 months compared with April's survey when the
assessment of household finances appeared close to historic lows. People
were also less worried about the UK's general economic situation.
The May results were still negative and pointed to a 'rather bearish view of
the economic situation in general', said Gallup. But the findings showed 'a
welcome reversal of the very rapid decline in confidence that has been
witnessed since the beginning of the year. Confidence may have reached its
nadir in April.'
Gallup said its poll of 1,991 adults between May 5 and May 17 showed that 17
per cent expected their household finances to improve while 39 per cent
predicted a deterioration. The resulting balance of minus 22 was 'a cause
for concern' but an improvement on balances of minus 30 per cent in April.
The survey found that 27 per cent of people polled thought the economy would
improve while 37 per cent took the opposite view. The resulting balance of
minus 10 per cent was much smaller than last month's minus 22 per cent
balance.
Less than half of those surveyed - 45 per cent  - expected unemployment to
rise over the next 12 months, although only 19 per cent expected a fall. The
resulting balance of 26 per cent expecting higher unemployment was 11 per
cent lower than the April outcome.
A fifth of those polled expected price rises to accelerate against 19 per
cent expecting a slowdown. The small positive balance of 1 per cent
expecting higher inflation was the lowest since February last year.
Nearly 40 per cent of British businesses polled by Trade Indemnity, the
credit insurer, were operating at 75 per cent to 99 per cent of their
optimum rate in the first quarter of this year, the company said yesterday.
Only 3 per cent were operating at less than 50 per cent of optimum, while 22
per cent were at optimum and 6 per cent said they were 'overstretched'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Outsider to run accounts firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robson Rhodes, the UK's 15th-largest accountancy firm, yesterday appointed a
businessman as its chief operating officer.
Mr Peter Turnbull, former managing director of Lex Service, the largest UK
car distribution and leasing group, will be operational head of the firm.
The move is a highly unusual example of the appointment of an outsider to
help manage the running of a professional practice. Although Mr Turnbull
qualified as an accountant, most senior positions in accountancy firms are
filled from within by accountants who have spent their careers in public
practice.
A number of firms have hired specialist outsiders in areas such as marketing
and human resources, but few have made appointments at such a senior level.
Robson Rhodes itself hired Mr Ray Pierce, former head of the Mortgage
Corporation, as chief executive two years ago. He left last September when
he was headhunted to become managing director of Guardian Direct, an
insurance subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange.
Mr Turnbull qualified as a chartered accountant in 1967 and spent 20 years
working for Lex Service as group finance director and chief executive of
Volvo Concessionaires before becoming chief executive of APA Group, an
automotive consultancy.
Robson Rhodes said that Mr Turnbull would be responsible for implementing
the firm's strategy to meet its goals.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Plea against working on Sunday fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British workers have no protection under European law against being forced
to work on Sundays, the Employment Appeals Tribunal ruled yesterday.
Dismissing the appeal of a shopworker sacked for refusing to work on a
Sunday, Mr Justice Mummery, president of the tribunal, said there was no
mention in European law of a right to say 'no' to Sunday work.
The decision will stand as a precedent on the rights of Sunday workers
unless overturned by the Court of Appeal.
The judge refused Mrs Louise Steadman, 30, from Nottingham, leave to appeal,
but said she could apply directly to the Court of Appeal for leave.
Her case was supported by Keep Sunday Special, the lobby group campaigning
against de-regulation of Sunday trading laws in England and Wales. Last
night it said it was uncertain whether it could afford a further appeal.
Mrs Steadman had worked for Hogg Robinson Travel for only 22 months when she
was dismissed for refusing to work on Sundays which she wanted to devote to
family, social and religious activities.
She was not protected from unfair dismissal by UK employment laws because
she had not been continuously employed by Hogg Robinson for two years.
If she had been, she would almost certainly have won her claim for unfair
dismissal on the basis that she was being asked to do something unlawful
under present Sunday trading laws, the lobby group said.
Mr Paul Diamond, the group's legal adviser, argued that the two-year
qualification for employment protection rights was contrary to European law.
He said the European Court of Justice should be able to decide the rights of
Sunday workers as it had last year for retailers such as the DIY chain B&amp;Q,
irrespective of whether they had worked for an employer continuously for two
years.
The European Court gives direct effect to fundamental human rights
guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, he said.
Mrs Steadman was relying on rights under the convention protecting family
life and religious freedom and on the 1961 European Social Charter which
protects Sunday working. The lobby group said if the European Court ruled in
favour of Mrs Steadman it would have significant implications for UK
employment rights.
The Sunday trading bill is currently going through parliament.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Joint venture to bid for coalfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition for ownership of the coal industry intensified yesterday when
Wimpey, the construction group, and Powell Duffryn, the engineering and
distribution company, said they plan to bid for British Coal's south Wales
operations.
They are to form a joint venture to combine their wholly owned coal
operations employing 820 people. They said they had not ruled out an
interest in other regional companies, which are predominantly opencast
operations.
It is understood that the venture is still considering its options for the
north-east area, but has ruled out bids for the other regions - Scotland,
and central north and central south in England.
The venture will seek to prequalify as bidders for south Wales and the
north-east by tomorrow, the closing date for applications under the
privatisation process.
In Wales the venture is facing competition from a management buyout team,
from Ryan Group, the coal company, and possibly from others.
Wimpey has contracts to operate eight opencast sites in Britain including
three in south Wales accounting for about half the region's output.
Powell Duffryn's coal business generated about 6 per cent of the company's
Pounds 28.6m pre-tax profit in the year to March 31 1993. The company sells
about 500,000 tonnes of coal a year as well as operating washing, screening
and grading facilities under contract to British Coal. It operates three out
of six process plants in south Wales taking coal from four opencast sites.
RJB Mining, the coal company, yesterday concluded negotiations to open its
third former British Coal mine under licence. Calverton is the company's
second deep mine in Nottinghamshire, the other being Clipstone.
RJB also operates Rossington colliery, near Doncaster.
British Coal has now completed negotiations with the private sector for the
re-opening of seven pits closed during the last 18 months and talks on
another two are continuing.
Another six mines which closed this year are being offered for sale to the
private sector.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Miners reject weekend shifts deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2,500 British Coal pit employees have missed out on a Pounds 6,000
one-off bonus after accepting the advice of their unions to refuse an
agreement which would commit them to working at weekends for the first time.
Failure to accept the deal also means they will receive less in severance
pay should future employers make them redundant.
They will receive the statutory minimum of Pounds 6,150 rather than the
Pounds 27,000 maximum available under the agreement signed by 9,200 of their
colleagues.
Most of those who refused to sign the working hours and redundancy pay
package are in the Yorkshire region, the heartland of Mr Arthur Scargill's
National Union of Mineworkers. Some 44 per cent of miners there accepted the
deal, whereas 90 per cent of miners in the Midlands, where the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers is predominant, took the package.
The imbalance is likely to hit the attractions of British Coal's central
north region. Potential bidders have been put off because of the perceived
militancy of the NUM.
British Coal said yesterday that it had warned miners they would not be
eligible for the increased pay-off unless they had signed up by last Friday.
However, there is likely to be pressure from prospective bidders for British
Coal to extend the deadline. They are unlikely to want to inherit a group of
workers who are working on varied contracts.
The UDM said that some of its members had tried to sign up on Monday but
were turned away. Mr Mick Stephens, a union official, said some miners had
been given less notice than others about the terms of the offer.

<TEXT>
The Republic of Ireland is to review security after a failed bomb attack in
Dublin at the weekend, which the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster
Volunteer Force, claimed responsibility for.
At the formal reopening of the Shannon-Erne waterway on the Northern Irish
border yesterday, Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, announced a
security review and said that efforts would be made to restart political
talks in the north.
Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, said there was concern
about possible further attacks after the Dublin bomb.
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday blamed
the 'ambiguity and uncertainty' of the British government over Northern
Ireland for encouraging loyalist paramilitaries 'to achieve a balance of
terror'. Yet he said he was encouraged by reports that the combined
leadership of the loyalist paramilitaries was planning to meet this week to
consider his recent call for a ceasefire.
The Rev Roy Magee, a Presbyterian minister, met leaders of the UVF and UFF
in Belfast yesterday. He said he believed the Dublin attack was a 'warning
shot', not the start of an continuing campaign south of the border.
He said the lack of an IRA response to the joint declaration meant the
loyalist paramilitaries considered themselves in a 'state of war' and were
making the point that they must be dealt with.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Subsidies for farming attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arable farmers in England are receiving Pounds 759m a year in subsidies from
taxpayers which bring virtually no environmental benefits, the Council for
the Protection of Rural England said yesterday.
Publishing a regional and county breakdown of Common Agricultural Policy
subsidies to arable farmers, Mr Paul Wynne, the council's land use officer,
said: 'The public is getting a bad deal. This expenditure compensates
farmers for reduced price support but bears no relationship to environmental
quality or management and asks remarkably little of them in return.'
By contrast, he said, schemes which actively encouraged English farmers to
adopt environmentally friendly practices received just Pounds 27.1m in the
past financial year.
The survey highlights how the largest subsidy payments go to farmers in the
country's most intensive cereal-growing regions, where wild plant and animal
life are especially vulnerable.
The government's Countryside Survey last year showed that the number of
plant species had fallen 30 per cent in arable fields between 1978 and 1990.
Lincolnshire arable farmers received the biggest payments last year,
totalling nearly Pounds 68m, of which Pounds 55m was for growing crops and
Pounds 12m was for leaving part of their land idle as 'set-aside'.
Humberside ranked second in the survey, with its arable farmers receiving
Pounds 40m, of which Pounds 7.4m was for set-aside, and Norfolk came third.
English farmers were paid Pounds 253 a hectare for the 15 per cent of their
land they were required to set aside in order to cut grain surpluses. They
received Pounds 140 a hectare for growing cereals, and Pounds 400 a hectare
for oilseeds such as rape.
The council pointed out that only the set-aside payments, which make up
Pounds 125m of the total, have environmental conditions attached to them.
Mr Wynne urged the government to make all arable compensation payments
conditional on farmers adopting 'positive management' of the environment.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Accidents at work 'going unreported'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many thousands of accidents at work each year go unreported, and most could
be prevented, Labour said yesterday, citing a Health and Safety Executive
estimate.
Mr Kevin Barron, Labour frontbench spokesman on health and safety, said
143,244 serious accidents were reported at work in 1992-93. There were 368
deaths as a result of accidents at work and a further 22,807 serious

FT  24 MAY 94 / University pay deal of 2.85% accepted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of the Association of University Teachers have voted to
accept a 2.85 per cent pay deal for its members, made up of a 2.5 per cent
wage increase plus a one-off cash payment worth 0.35 per cent of salary.
Starting salaries rise from Pounds 13,601 a year to Pounds 14,690. 'There is
nothing generous about this settlement,' said Mr David Triesman, the AUT's
general secretary. 'In broadly accepting the settlement we must renew our
insistence on a review of academic pay.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / BBC white paper promised soon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, told the Commons yesterday
that a white paper on the future of the BBC would be published 'fairly
shortly'.
He referred MPs to the recent announcement of the BBC's partnership with
Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times,
when questioned about the type of services in which it might engage in in
the future.
The BBC announced a 'global strategic alliance' with Pearson this month to
develop a range of satellite television channels around the world.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Safeguards urged for right to silence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, last night called for
improved safeguards for defendants whose refusal to respond to police
questioning is pointed out to the jury at their subsequent trial.
He urged the government to give further thought to the provisions in the
criminal justice and public order bill allowing inferences to be drawn from
a defendant exercising the right to silence.
The government secured a majority of 62 (176-114) in favour of the clause in
the bill authorising the introduction of the new procedures.
Lord Taylor said the clause was too widely drawn. He said additional
safeguards should embody suggestions by Viscount Runciman, the crossbench
peer, who headed the royal commission whose majority recommendations opposed
change in the existing law on right to silence.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Esso puts 1p on a litre of petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Esso yesterday announced a 1p a litre increase in the maximum recommended
price of petrol sold at its 2,250 stations in the UK, blaming increases in
the wholesale price of petrol on the Rotterdam market for refined products,
Robert Corzine writes.
Other big retailers, including British Petroleum and Shell, said they were
watching the markets closely but had not made a decision to follow Esso's
lead.
From today the maximum recommended prices at Esso petrol stations will be
60.9p a litre for four star and 55.9p a litre for unleaded. The price of
diesel is unchanged.
The Rotterdam petrol price serves as the marker for retail prices in the UK
and much of the rest of Europe. Prices for unleaded petrol have edged
upwards over the past month, from Dollars 179 a tonne at the end of April to
the present level of Dollars 183 a tonne.
But wholesale prices have experienced a sharp increase since the end of
March, when unleaded fuel was trading in Rotterdam at Dollars 154 a tonne.
The recent increases in refined product prices reflect in part the rise in
crude oil prices over the past few months.
Although Esso's price increase applies to all stations in its network, many
oil companies acknowledge that a large number of their stations are selling
fuel at a level below the recommended maximum, particularly where
competition is especially fierce.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Treasury guided over the rapids: Peter Marsh on why Sir
Terry Burns called in a management consultant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Treasury she is known as Sir Terry Burns's right-hand woman. Ms Wendy
Pritchard, a management consultant, was called in by Sir Terry, Treasury
permanent secretary, about a year ago.
Her brief is to facilitate management changes and encourage officials to
open up more to the outside world.
The Treasury, the most powerful government department, is undergoing a
period of restructuring to reduce the number of officials in its top layer
and to involve more junior staff in decision-making.
Sir Terry, permanent secretary since 1991, has also called in Sir Colin
Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI and one of Britain's most highly regarded
industrialists, to supervise a detailed review of the way top managers
operate.
While Sir Colin has a specific remit which will last until the autumn and is
tied to a formal scrutiny of Treasury operations announced in the last
Budget, Ms Pritchard has a more fluid role.
During the past year she has come to the Treasury every few weeks to talk to
top officials and advise on how they link with outsiders and their own
departments. She has also participated in three special meetings of the
Treasury's management board - a group of eight senior civil servants - to
review how the department operates.
In an interview, Ms Pritchard was keen to elaborate on her general approach
to consultancy but refused to talk about her specific role at the Treasury
because she said this would breach confidences.
She described her work in big organisations as 'rather like having to drill
down through layers of sediment to find out about the way things were done
years ago and which often influence how things are done now. The process of
change is often about unpicking these past practices and suggesting
something new'.
When working with big organisations, she says she tries to stand back and
appreciate the pressures on top managers and the way they make decisions.
She said part of her job with clients was to identify the 'antibodies to
change'.
'Managers have to try to find time to react not just to the events of today
but longer-term strategies,' said Ms Pritchard. 'That can be difficult when
external changes (in political events and business practice) are taking
place at such a huge rate. In the past, managers used to have to cope with
the occasional burst of rapids while now it is white water all the way.'
Ms Pritchard has been a freelance management consultant for five years. She
has won general respect for her approach in the Treasury, where morale has
suffered because of criticism for underestimating the extent of the early
1990s recession and for mistakes linked to Britain's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
One person close to the Treasury said: 'She is operating in the way you
would expect of a counsellor, talking to officials about their relationship
with each other and with their more junior staff. She is very interested in
the process of management rather than being driven by the need to implement
solutions.'
Another person knowledgeable about her role said: 'Occasionally I have the
feeling she has been over-deferential to top officials and has been too keen
to listen to them rather than impose new ideas. She's very anxious to see
the Treasury take on a more participative approach to management which
carries everyone along with it, rather than the normal Treasury style which
is to form a small group to tackle a specific policy area and crack on with
the job by involving as few people as possible.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / Jailed executives cleared over exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two executives jailed three years ago for exporting parts capable of being
used in Iraq's nuclear programme were cleared by the Court of Appeal
yesterday.
The judges will give reasons for their ruling tomorrow but their decision
came after defence lawyers argued that a misdirection to the jury by the
trial judge had led to a miscarriage of justice.
During the trial at the Old Bailey in June 1991 the Crown claimed that Mr
Ali Ashour Daghir and Ms Jeanine Speckman, directors of the Surrey-based
company Euromac, conspired to export electrical capacitors which could be
used as triggers for nuclear bombs.
Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Daghir and Ms Speckman, argued that trial
judge Mr Neil Denison gave jurors the impression they could still convict if
they found the electrical capacitors were for non-nuclear military use.
This was a 'material defect' in the summing up because the prosecution had
'nailed its case to the nuclear mast', the Court of Appeal heard.
Yesterday's decision was a big setback for UK and US Customs officials who
had claimed after the conviction of the two executives that their 18-month
joint investigation had foiled Iraq's attempts to build up its nuclear
programme.
In recent weeks UK Customs investigators have been subjected to intense
scrutiny at the arms-for-Iraq inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Scott.
One senior UK Customs investigator involved in the case said last night:
'This is a body blow. Let's not make any bones about it.'
Investigators claimed to be taking some comfort that the decision appeared
to hinge on a narrow judicial argument. But lawyers for Mr Daghir and Ms
Speckman said the case raised serious questions about high-level political
involvement, and the extent to which the arrest and publicity surrounding
the trial had served political interests.
The investigation into Euromac involved an elaborate undercover operation,
with Customs officers posing as willing agents in the smuggling effort.
The operation - code-named Argus  - employed some controversial techniques
used in US 'sting' operations which are not usually approved by the UK
government.
Mr Daghir was jailed for five years but bailed pending appeal after serving
15 months. Ms Speckman served an 18-month sentence. Both are planning to
claim compensation.
In evidence to the Scott inquiry last December, former prime minister
Baroness Thatcher said she had taken a 'particular interest' in nuclear
capacitors. She told the inquiry that 'Customs had, in fact, done a very
skilled piece of work' in the Euromac case.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Heseltine vows sell-offs will go on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday vowed to carry
on the government's privatisation programme as he pushes forward the partial
sale of the Post Office.
He said the Conservatives would continue with the 'privatisation revolution'
and carry it to completion.
Mr Heseltine is determined to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and
Parcelforce, after publishing a green paper on the future of the Post
Office.
A number of backbenchers have warned the government that a flotation of the
Royal Mail will be 'a privatisation too far'. But Mr Heseltine said
dismissed such fears, saying there was no such thing.
Mr Heseltine's comments were designed to promote the Conservative Political
Centre pamphlet on privatisation, which seeks to commit the party to further
privatisations.
The centre says that the sale of British Gas was described as the first
privatisation too far, but has 'turned into a great success for customers'.
Ministers plan to continue the privatisation programme by selling Railtrack,
the railway infrastructure company, before the next general election, in a
public flotation which could be worth Pounds 3.5bn.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, described the planned
privatisation of Railtrack as 'a splendid admission of failure'.
He said: 'The Tories were only floating the idea of selling off the tracks
and signalling because of their conspicuous failure in arousing investment
interest in the passenger rail franchises.'
Mr Wilson predicted a flotation of Railtrack would prove controversial.
'Everyone would realise that Railtrack would immediately try and screw its
profits out of the passenger train companies.'
However, Mr Heseltine said the privatisation programme was irreversible and
would continue, irrespective of opposition from Labour and Liberal
Democrats.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Pressure grows for car-boot sale laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car-boot sales, which are attended by more than 1m people a week during the
summer, were yesterday described as a free-for-all for traders of faulty,
unsafe and illegal goods. The criticism came from East Sussex County Council
as it launched a campaign calling for their regulation.
Unofficial traders posing as private sellers were offloading defective,
counterfeit and stolen goods, the council said.
Organisers of such sales were not obliged to keep records of traders' names
and addresses, traders were not required to document the source of goods,
and buyers' statutory rights to safe goods did not extend to private sales.
Mr Terry Randell, chairman of the council's public protection committee,
said: 'We have plenty of regulations to protect the consumer, but unless we
can prove that someone is in the business of trading, none of them apply.'
East Sussex is backing the Association of County Councils in calling for
national legislation on car-boot sales, based on the system in place in
North Yorkshire.
In 1991 North Yorkshire secured a local act of parliament to regulate such
sales through obligatory registration and records of traders as well as the
goods sold and their source.
However, each similar local act would cost taxpayers about Pounds 50,000.
'Multiplied by every county council in the country, we're talking millions
of pounds - just to get the law on the statute books,' said Mr Randell.
Meanwhile, in a single swoop on a car-boot sale at Eastbourne at the
weekend, East Sussex County Council found a wide range of unsafe household
items, including:
An electric cooking ring with no protective guard over the element, frayed
wiring and silver foil wedged into the plug instead of a fuse.
An iron with a broken thermostat which would have overheated on use.
A damaged motorcycle crash helmet.
A faulty child's car-safety seat.
The council also found unchecked sales of electric blankets, notorious for
causing household fires.
The council says that traders are also using boot fairs to launder money, as
takings are without receipts or records, and to evade tax and duty - some
traders resell duty-free goods brought into the country supposedly for
private consumption.
'Traders are even stealing to order,' said Mr Randell. 'Car radios, portable
TVs - no records are needed and people will buy them, no questions asked.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / Warning of higher share charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors are likely to face higher charges for share dealing as a
result of shorter settlement periods for equity trades, says Fidelity
Brokerage, a leading broker for individual investors.
However, shorter settlement periods and ultimately a system of paperless
share trading would bring benefits to private investors, Mr Mark Collier,
chief executive of Fidelity Brokerage, said.
From July 18 the London Stock Exchange will abandon its two-week or
three-week account settlement periods and shares will have to be paid for or
delivered to buyers 10 business days after each bargain is struck.
By the middle of next year it is intended that the settlement period will be
cut to five days.
The Bank of England has called for the City to shorten the period for
equities settlement to reduce risks for participants and to bring London in
line with other leading financial centres.
It has been developing its Crest project for paper-less share trading, a key
step in reducing settlement periods, since the collapse of the Stock
Exchange's Taurus project for paperless share trading.
Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, said on Saturday that paperless share
settlement alone should not raise costs for private investors.
Speaking at a conference of the Association of Private Clients and
Investment Managers, Mr George said that Crest would allow private investors
to continue to settle transactions in paper. He added: 'There is no reason
that I can think of why this should be any more expensive than it is now.'
Paper-based settlement, however, was not likely to be as cheap as electronic
share settlement.
Mr George said: 'It follows from the voluntary nature of the system that a
'two-dated' market is likely to develop.' Paper-based trades under this
system would be settled within a longer period than electronic trades.

FT  24 MAY 94 / SFO probes Pounds 60m 'options fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation are
investigating a suspected commodities option fraud which may have resulted
in a loss of more than Dollars 90m (Pounds 59.7m) to investors.
The investigation is expected to be cited in the fraud office's annual
report, due to be published this week, as one of the biggest cases of the
past year.
The report is expected to confirm that the number of big investigations
based in the City is declining, but that the number of smaller
provincial-based cases is growing.
Investigators believe that the recession, combined with a tighter regulatory
regime, has diminished the possibilities for major fraud.
The investigation is focused on the activities of Mr William C. Dunn, a
US-based commodities broker; his company, Delta Consultants; and an offshore
business based in the Bahamas.
It is thought to have been sparked by a complaint from an individual
investor received late last year by the fraud office.
Investigators say that losses occurred in trading between 1991 and 1993,
mainly on the US markets. It involved hundreds of individual investors based
worldwide. Money is thought to have been deposited in a number of US banks.
The fraud office has since been working closely with US officials, with the
FBI now taking the lead on the policing side. The FBI is understood to have
questioned Mr Dunn in connection with the alleged fraud.
Mr Dunn and Delta Consultants were named in a complaint filed recently in a
New York Federal court by the US Commodity Future Trading Commission.
The commission alleged that Delta, Mr Dunn and two offshore companies made
'false, deceptive and misleading representations of material facts in
connection with soliciting and accepting funds from customers and
prospective customers'.
The precise nature of the alleged fraud remains unclear with investigators
still trying to establish whether the funds have been lost or whether they
have been diverted.

The cross-Channel ferry price war intensified yesterday as Stena Sealink,
one of the two main operators on short sea routes across the Channel,
announced 20 per cent price cuts in services to France.
The move was in response to the decision last month by P&amp;O European Ferries
to offer a 10 per cent reduction on its Dover to Calais services.
Eurotunnel dismissed the price war as 'a matter between the ferries', but
the price cuts represent an increased threat to the viability of the Channel

FT  24 MAY 94 / Food poisoning 'hits 5% of adults'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor storage and handling of fresh produce has led to one in 20 adults
suffering from food poisoning in the past year, the Food and Drink
Federation said yesterday. The figure was slightly down on the previous
year.
It said just 61 per cent of those questioned in a survey by MORI, the
research organisation, knew that food should be refrigerated to prevent it
going off. The survey of 2,082 people found that 81 per cent always or
usually looked at 'best before' or 'use by' dates, but 20 per cent said they
did not tend to follow manufacturers' instructions for storage, preparation
or cooking.
The most frequent causes of food poisoning was food not cooked or heated
properly, poor personal hygiene and the storing of produce at the wrong
temperature.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Visit lifts hopes on Malaysia trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is speculation that a Malaysian ban on giving government contracts to
British companies might be lifted soon following a surprise visit to
Malaysia by Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, Kieran Cooke writes.
Mr Needham arrived yesterday and was scheduled to have a meeting with Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
Mr Needham said he was carrying a letter from Mr John Major to Dr Mahathir
and expressed the hope that the ban would be lifted soon. He added: 'We have
so many things to do in common, not only in business but in education,
health care and so on.'
Malaysia imposed its ban at the end of February after critical comments
about the government in the British press. In particular Kuala Lumpur
reacted angrily to a report in The Sunday Times which alleged that a British
company was prepared to offer bribes to Dr Mahathir in exchange for a
contract.
The ban is believed to have cost British companies many millions of pounds
of business. Mr Needham has been among the more vocal critics of what he has
considered to be irresponsible reporting about Malaysia in the British
media.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Move to cut truck red tape attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to reduce regulations governing standards for operators of
heavy trucks were attacked by Labour in the Commons yesterday.
Fears that the move would harm road safety were voiced during the report
stage debate on the deregulation and contracting-out bill, which the
government says is aimed at cutting red tape and reducing the bureaucratic
burden on business.
The bill provides that operators of heavy lorries would no longer have to
reapply for their licences every five years.
Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said: 'All the
evidence points to the need for the current system to be maintained or
toughened up - not weakened. Our concern is that the government will be
giving a wink and a nod to those who may take short cuts with safety.'
Mr Steven Norris, junior transport minister, accused Labour MPs of 'quite
deliberately confusing the issues of safety and regulation'. They had
assumed deregulation automatically compromised safety. He said the bill did
not affect the power of a licensing authority to take vehicles off the road
and bring legal action against operators for sub-standard practices.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Blair to set out his policy approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, front-runner for the succession to the Labour leadership,
will today set out some of the central planks of his political philosophy in
his first significant speech since the death of John Smith, the former
leader.
In an address to a conference organised by the Institute of Economic
Affairs, the free-market think-tank, Mr Blair is expected to spell out the
case of Labour's modernisers for a new relationship between the individual
and the community.
Mr Blair's friends insisted last night that the speech - addressing the
links between crime and family breakdown - had been planned since last
November and did not mark the opening shot in his leadership campaign.
The shadow cabinet decided last week that none of the contenders should
stake their claims until after the European elections on June 9.
But the shadow home secretary is expected to develop some of the main themes
that have distinguished his approach to Labour's policymaking from that of
the traditionalists on the left of the party.
Mr Blair will stress that Labour's call for much greater social cohesion
does not imply a drive to re-impose uniform state controls. Instead,
restoring the country's social fabric would be the route to individual
self-improvement.
He is likely to emphasise also that his party's commitment to extending the
rights of individuals is accompanied by a clear appreciation of individual
responsibility.

<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has made a strong appeal for
the US to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status.
Addressing more than 1,000 representatives of businesses in the Asia-Pacific
region, Dr Mahathir said nations of the Pacific must not quarrel and fight.
'Our Pacific Era will be stillborn if we divide the Pacific, if we create
discriminatory trading blocs, if we draw a line down the Pacific, if we are
unwilling to extend to each other the normal rules and regulations - like
most favoured nation status - that are norms between trading economies,'
said Dr Mahathir.
In recent weeks Dr Mahathir has had talks with both President Bill Clinton
and with China's leaders.
'Now China needs the world just as much as the world needs China,' said Dr
Mahathir.
'That's a great departure from the old days when China regarded itself as
the centre of the world.'
Dr Mahathir also said that Malaysia was keen to see both Vietnam and
Cambodia join the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) as soon as
possible.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Thai government warned on underground
railway cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tanayong, the Bangkok-based property developer, has warned the Thai
government that moving its planned 23km elevated railway underground will be
expensive, disruptive and throw its scheme three years behind schedule.
The Thai cabinet last week strongly requested contractors for all three
overhead rail projects to consider moving underground within the 25 sq km of
the city centre. This followed growing public concern that an obtrusive
infrastructure spaghetti would wreck the environment and exacerbate the
already appalling traffic jams.
The government has promised to defray the extra costs of going underground.
But it will not force Tanayong, nor the Hong Kong group Hopewell Holdings,
which plans an ambitious 60km network, even partially underground because
30-year build-and-operate franchises have already been signed. The property
company Bangkok Land is still negotiating for the franchise to a third
railway.
Mr Kasame Chatikavanij, chairman of Tanayong's wholly owned subsidiary,
Bangkok Transit System Corporation, said subterranean railways were two or
three times more expensive than their elevated equivalents; certainly much
more than the 30 per cent premium frequently quoted in the local press.
He challenged anyone able to build an underground at no more than a 30 per
cent premium - Dollars 26m (Pounds 17m) a kilometre - to identify
themselves. 'BTSC,' he said, 'is ready to sign a contract with them.'
Mr Colin Weir, Hopewell's operations manager in Bangkok, said the government
may not have 'thought through' the implications of trying to run any of its
planned elevated 'sandwich' of roads, railways and property underground.
'If they want the whole thing underground (in the city centre), then that is
a huge thing they are asking for,' he said.
Tanayong has so far failed to reach agreement with its 'preferred
contractor' - a consortium led by the Anglo-French group GEC Alsthom and the
Bangkok developer Italian-Thai - probably perhaps because it is difficult to
show how it can generate sufficient revenues from a privately run railway
alone.
Mr Bob Kevorkian, managing director of Metro 2000, a consortium led by
Germany's Philipp Holzmann, which has campaigned for an underground as 'the
only real solution,' yesterday reiterated that 'we stand firm - we can build
an underground for a total cost, excluding financing, of Bt1.5bn (Pounds
39.5m) per kilometre. That's not so very different from BTSC's figures of
Bt1.05bn for costs excluding financing.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Hopes rise in US-Japan trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Japanese officials yesterday went into their fifth day of trade talks
in Washington amid expectations they were headed towards agreement on at
least some of their disputes.
Tokyo's Ministry of Finance yesterday unexpectedly sent to Washington an
official responsible for bilateral negotiations on opening up Japan's
insurance market - Mr Eisuke Sakakibara, vice-chief of the International
Financial Bureau - in an apparent move to help push the talks forward.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday did not deny a
press report that this set of talks soon could be nearing a conclusion. He
has been denying that the US is in retreat from its original intention to
negotiate a series of strong 'results-oriented' agreements.
'My impression is we are really backing off,' said Mr Alan Tonelson,
research director of the Economic Strategy Institute, which has close ties
with the administration.
Mr Kantor, he said, might have lost control of the negotiations to the State
Department, where there is concern that US-Japan trade disputes are
threatening the broader relationship and the administration's Asia trade
policy.
This created the impression in Washington that the negotiators were ready to
'harvest the gains' of previous talks and reach deals on those sectors the
Japanese government can most influence: government procurement of medical
equipment and telecommunications and insurance liberalisation. Vehicles and
vehicle parts could be set aside for the time.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister, yesterday summoned his chief cabinet
secretary, Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, who was until recently trade minister, as
well as officials from the key ministries of trade, foreign affairs and
finance, to his official residence to discuss how the trade talks could be
taken forward before the Group of Seven meeting in July.
He told the bureaucrats to try to ensure that yesterday's negotiations on
the groundwork for resuming the talks were a success.
'We are negotiating very extensively. The talks are at a very delicate stage
now,' Mr Hata told a group of reporters.
Japanese officials played down speculation in the press that a breakthrough
might be possible because of a softer US stance, but were clearly doing
their best to keep the momentum going.
'There are talks scheduled this week on global co-operation, so officials
are scheduled to be in Washington anyway,' one foreign ministry official
said. The hope is that the unofficial talks aimed at resuming the more
contentious parts of the framework talks, which began last week, could take
advantage of that coincidence and be made official, he said.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Need for Dollars 980bn of new airliners
seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft, yesterday
forecast demand for new airliners worth Dollars 980bn (Pounds 650bn) in the
next 20 years to meet the growth in air travel and the need by airlines to
replace older jets.
In its annual civil aircraft market outlook, the US manufacturer said that
Dollars 731bn worth of new aircraft would be needed to accommodate future
air traffic growth and Dollars 249bn would be required to replace older
aircraft.
The relatively optimistic forecast also notes that the civil aircraft market
is becoming increasingly competitive.
'There are only 600 airlines in the world. Only 125 of those airlines buy
new airplanes. And the 20 largest airlines buy 60 per cent of all new
commercial airplanes,' said Mr Richard James, Boeing's vice president of
marketing.
'In such a concentrated market, you can't afford to miss a single strategic
sale.'
Although the market continued to suffer from the four - year - long slump in
civil aircraft demand caused by airline losses, the recession and the impact
of the Gulf war, Mr James said the second half of the 1990s looked more
promising for the industry.
'The recovery is already well under way in the US, and the widely held
expectation is that Europe is in the road to recovery,' he said.
He added that while the Japanese economy was still struggling, the rest of
Asia was experiencing robust growth.
Boeing expects the biggest growth in air travel to come from the Asian
markets during the next 20 years.
Overall, Boeing is forecasting passenger air travel growth of around 5.2 per
cent a year over the next 20 years.
International traffic is also expected to continue providing a greater share
of overall world air transport. It accounted for 44 per cent of all revenue
passenger miles 20 years ago and the figure now is nearly half. Boeing
expects it to account for 54 per cent of all travel in 20 years time, with
domestic traffic making up the other 46 per cent.
Although Boeing said it was difficult to predict how many older 70- to
170-seat aircraft would be retired in the next two years, it predicted that
about 1,200 would have to be retired by 1999 because they would be more than
30 years old.
By the year 2000, the number of total replacement aircraft would probably
rise to 3,000 because of airlines' need to comply with stricter noise
regulations from the beginning of the next century.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Japanese buying more foreign cars -
Michiyo Nakamoto reports on changes in taste and value-for-money marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The streets of Otemachi, Tokyo's business district where leading Japanese
companies are based, is something of a showroom of the chosen cars of
Japan's corporate establishment.
Recently, a larger number of foreign cars, from Volvo estates to Cadillac
Sevilles, can be spotted among the Toyotas and Nissans that have long
dominated Otemachi's avenues.
Imported cars are enjoying an unprecedented surge of interest in the
Japanese market, which has often been criticised as unreceptive to foreign
vehicles.
While domestic car makers continue to suffer weak demand, with registrations
down nearly 4 per cent to 1.5m units in the first four months of 1994,
imported passenger car registrations rose 28 per cent year-on-year to 78,825
units.
In the fiscal year between April 1993 and March this year, imported vehicles
saw registrations increase 14 per cent to a record of over 217,774,
according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. Imported passenger
cars rose 10 per cent to 206,633 in the same period.
That record compares with a drop in demand of 7 per cent to 6.4m for
vehicles manufactured in Japan and a 6 per cent decline in domestically made
cars to 4.15m units
The increasing globalisation of the motor industry and the need to cultivate
global markets is finding more foreign car makers keen to expand in Japan.
Opel, the German car maker owned by GM, sold 17,000 cars in the first year
of a distribution deal with Yanase, Japan's largest foreign car importer and
retailer. Volvo, the Swedish car maker, has carried out an active marketing
campaign in Japan and saw record registrations last year.
Globalisation has also meant that car makers, including the Japanese, are
making different cars in different countries.
Honda, for example, only manufactures the Accord Wagon and Coupe in the US,
where those two models were developed, and imports them into Japan. The
popularity of Honda's US-made models has made the company, with 27,245
registrations, the second-largest car importer in 1993 after Mercedes-Benz,
which had 29,693 cars registered.
The yen's strength against leading currencies has also been a boost to
imports, making them far more affordable. Rover, the UK-based car maker, for
example reduced its Japanese prices last year by an average 13 per cent to
reflect the yen's rise. 'The prices of our cars are not that different any
more from those of domestic cars,' says a Rover representative.
The general suspicion of the quality and reliability of foreign cars that
pervaded Japanese consumer attitudes for decades is also gradually being
replaced by interest in the different styles that foreign cars offer.
'As the generation changes, consumption patterns are freer than in the past
and the attitude toward foreign products has changed,' says Mr Shoji
Sugimoto, a director of Yanase. 'The nationality of foreign products no
longer has that much influence,' he points out.
Japanese consumers have long been concerned about the lack of service and
maintenance facilities for imported cars. But more foreign car makers are
following the lead of the most successful German motor companies in Japan
and addressing such concerns.
In addition, foreign car makers are adjusting their marketing strategies to
the growing mood in Japan that favours value for money rather than luxury,
and with the help of the yen's appreciation have offered value-for-money
packages and low interest loans.
Earlier this year Volvo offered loans at just 3 per cent while BMW, the
German car maker, launched a programme that offers free maintenance for
three years at a moderate price.
Even luxury car makers which have long guarded their image of exclusivity
have moved to accommodate the growing quest for value for money. BMW reduced
prices last autumn by up to 7 per cent and Mercedes-Benz lowered its loan
rates.
Slow but steady changes in Japanese industry practices and government
regulations, which have been criticised as hindering market access, are also
taking place to the benefit of imported cars.
Tokyo Nissan, a dealer affiliated with the car maker, has started to sell
Ford cars, for example, in a move that is unusual in Japan where most
dealers are tied to one manufacturer.
Meanwhile, in its deregulation package to be finalised next month the
government has proposed adjusting Japanese standards and testing methods to
international levels and easing the process of acquiring official approval
for imported cars, two factors which have been cited as obstacles to greater
imports.
'The consumer attitude is changing, but in addition the total environment
will support growth in imports,' says Mr Siegfried Richter, president of BMW
Japan. Mr Richter is certain that 'efforts for deregulation will, of course,
support both physical and mental openness'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / US groups face ban by aid banks

<TEXT>
European countries are threatening to bar US companies from bidding for
contracts financed by the multinational development banks in reprisal for
the US's repeated failure to honour its funding pledges to these
institutions.
Mr Rene Legrand, a director representing Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and
Switzerland at the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, warned recently that
the countries he represents might seek measures to prevent countries in
significant arrears of payments, principally the US, from bidding on ADB
projects.
'One might say that bearing the moral burden of one contributor is beginning
to exhaust the patience of some of the others,' Mr Legrand said.
The US has accumulated a total of Dollars 847m (Pounds 562m) of arrears on
money it has promised to the World Bank and the regional development banks,
with the Asian Development Bank accounting for a large portion of the total,
as Congress has often proved reluctant to fund the promises made by the
administration.
But at the same time, the US is usually the most vociferous member in
calling for management reforms and greater transparency at the multilateral
development banks.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has complained repeatedly of the
embarrassment of being so far in arrears.
'You know, we go into these meetings and we bang our fists on the desk and
insist that we are a major stockholder and we think our policies should be
put into effect. But we don't even keep up with the rent. We have a past-due
notice on the door,' Mr Bentsen said yesterday.
The treasury had proposed an allocation of Dollars 87m in this year's budget
towards paying off past arrears, but the House of Representatives
appropriations committee has trimmed that to around Dollars 20m.
The House also eliminated a promised Dollars 100m contribution to the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, through which the International
Monetary Fund lends money at subsidised rates to the very poorest countries.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Court rejects base closure challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court yesterday rejected a challenge to the complex procedure
for agreeing military base closures, saying it had no authority to review
the president's decision on the issue, writes George Graham.
The challenge, brought by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, threatened
to upset the delicate base-closing mechanism, under which the defence
secretary presents recommendations for the closure of military bases to an
independent commission, which holds public hearings and then draws up its
own list. That list is then sent to the president, who may reject it in its
entirety but not pick and choose among its recommendations.
Congress, too, may reject the whole list, but again, may not pick and
choose.
The whole procedure was designed to stop members of Congress blocking the
closure of military bases within their districts.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UN to monitor Haiti sanctions efforts by Dominican Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A team of United Nations observers has arrived in the Dominican Republic to
monitor the country's adherence to tighter economic sanctions against
neighbouring Haiti which went into force at the weekend.
Their arrival coincides with reports that the US will consider imposing
trade penalties on the Dominican Republic if the government fails to curb
smuggling across the border in violation of the sanctions.
Increasing numbers of small boats have been moving a range of goods,
especially fuel, along the coast from the Dominican Republic to Haiti,
evading detection by ships policing the embargo. The US is the Dominican
Republic's main trading partner, and the Caribbean nation benefits from
duty-free access to the US market for a wide range of products.
The willingness and ability of the Dominican government to tighten sanctions
has been affected by political confusion. A recount will begin tomorrow of
votes cast in last week's presidential elections, amid repeated claims that
extensive fraud had favoured Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the incumbent.
'With the confused political situation here, and the political tension
generated by the presidential election, not many people expect the
government to be able to pay much attention to the border,' said a diplomat
in Santo Domingo.
President Balaguer has publicly questioned the usefulness of the sanctions
against Haiti, and is known to be far from enthusiastic about the return of
Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president, whose reinstatement is
being demanded by the United Nations.
Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, Mr Balaguer's main challenger in the race for
the presidency, has sent officials from his social democrat Dominican
Revolutionary party to seek support for his claims that he was denied
victory through irregularities perpetrated by Mr Balaguer's conservative
Social Christian Reform party.
With 97 per cent of the votes declared by the Elections Board, Mr Balaguer
led by about 30,000.
Mr Pena Gomez, backed by foreign observers, claims that most of the
estimated 200,000 people who could not vote last week were Revolutionary
party supporters.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Cherry auction fetches Dollars 13.7m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Furniture and works of art collected by the late Wendell Cherry, co-founder
of Humana, one of the world's largest providers of healthcare services,
realised Dollars 13.7m (Pounds 9.1m) at Sotheby's New York auction house at
the weekend.
The sale was a great success, and was almost 95 per cent sold by value. The
top price, Dollars 2.2m, was paid for an elaborate desk, mounted by a clock,
confidently attributed to Boulle, the leading French furniture maker of the
early 18th century. It was part of the grandiose furnishings of Cherry's 5th
Avenue apartment.
A 17th century Florentine bronze of Hercules wrestling with a bull,
attributed to Tacca and once owned by King Louis XIV, sold, above estimate,
at Dollars 1.43m, while a George II giltwood 12-light chandelier, attributed
to Mathias Lock, fetched Dollars 827,500.
In contrast Sotheby's auction of Old Masters had a mixed response. It
totalled Dollars 13.145m., but was less than 60 per cent sold by value.

FT  24 MAY 94 / House urged to end Bosnia arms ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Representatives today debates a resolution requiring the US to
stop enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia
and to supply weapons to the Bosnian Moslem government.
The debate comes two weeks after the Senate voted to require the
administration to breach the arms embargo, and a House vote could further
complicate the White House's efforts to avoid getting dragged into the
Bosnian war.
President Bill Clinton has said he favours lifting the arms embargo on
Bosnia-Hercegovina but does not want to act unilaterally, in defiance of the
wishes of the European countries which make up the bulk of the UN
peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, has been leading the drive to block
the measure, warning members that lifting the embargo would probably lead to
the withdrawal of UN forces from Bosnia and threaten supplies to Sarajevo
and other cities held by the Bosnian government.
'The US might have no choice but to intervene massively in the conflict or
acquiesce in a humanitarian and political disaster,' Mr Perry cautioned.
The resolution, sponsored by Congressman Frank McCloskey of Indiana and
Congressman Benjamin Gilman of New York, requires the president to
'terminate the US arms embargo of the government of Bosnia and Hercegovina
upon receipt from that government of a request for assistance in exercising
its right of self-defence.' It directs the president to provide 'appropriate
military assistance' and authorises the transfer of up to Dollars 200m
(Pounds 133m) of military equipment and training services to the Bosnian
government.
Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the House foreign affairs
committee, will propose a substitute version which would direct the
president to consider lifting the arms embargo, but would not require him to
act unilaterally. The tougher McCloskey-Gilman version, however, is believed
to have attracted considerable support.

FT  24 MAY 94 / North-east limps behind rest of Brazil: Poor government puts
the brakes on development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sitting amid peeling paint and regular power cuts, the secretary of health
for Brazil's north-eastern state of Maranhao is remarkably good humoured. Mr
Marival Pinherio Lobao even laughs when asked how many people work under
him. 'It's too disorganised to know. And people often get moved around each
month for political reasons,' he says.
Mr Lobao is one of many frustrated but largely powerless government
officials in the north east, a poor and extremely underdeveloped region.
Social indicators in the region contrast sharply with Brazil's rich south.
North-easterners are likely to live 10 years less than the 69-year average
in the southern state of Sao Paulo.
The illiteracy rate of 43 per cent is more than twice the national average.
Of the 42m people in the region, 1m have no income and a further 11m survive
on the minimum salary of about Dollars 65 a month. Diseases such as cholera
and leprosy, once on the wane, are increasing in several states. 'These
diseases are not really health issues, but signs of poverty,' according to
Mr Lobao.
The north-east's backwardness stems from a mixture of bad government, both
at local and national level, and corruption. But the problems are hard to
tackle because of an ingrained aversion to change and the lack of education.
Some states, notably Ceara, are trying to reform but it will take years to
solve even basic problems like education and health.
The difficulty lies in the political system. Most states are controlled by a
handful of ruling families who share the political and economic spoils to
maintain power and prevent modernisation. In Maranhao, for example, former
president Jose Sarney controls the largest TV broadcaster and the main
newspaper. His daughter Roseana is expected to win the race for governor in
October.
Mr Gastao Dias Vieira, a local politician critical of the ruling classes
says attempts to modernise the state have failed because of the elite's grip
on power. Two companies, mining group Vale do Rio Doce and aluminium
producer Alcoa, recently invested about Dollars 4bn in the local economy.
But the government, instead of using the revenues from these investments to
improve education or attack hunger, spent it instead on construction
projects to benefit their political backers, including the construction
companies themselves.
The elite's grip on power is reinforced by the region's backward education
standards and a patron-client tradition stemming from nearly 400 years of a
slave-based economy. In rural areas of some states, more than half the
population is illiterate. In states like Alagoas, whence Mr Fernando Collor
rose to the presidency before resigning amid corruption charges, there have
been complaints of unqualified people being given jobs as teachers in return
for votes.
Mr Mario Mamede, a Workers party politician in Ceara state, says: 'Voters
here don't want to know your record but whether you can help them get a job.
It makes buying votes very easy.'
Despite ingrained forces against change, there is a small but growing list
of states and cities benefiting from good government and reduced levels of
corruption. Slowly, change is coming from individual members of the elites,
often educated abroad, who are prepared to fight for change.
In Ceara, still one of the poorest states in the north-east, an enlightened
businessman won the post of governor in 1987 and decided to take on the
ruling class. One of Mr Tasso Jereissati's first acts was to dismiss 48,000
'teachers' who had been recruited in just one week before a previous
election campaign.
'People said I would never win another election because they thought
politicians needed to control all the jobs to be strong. But you need to
confront this,' he says.
Ceara was one of the first states to balance its budget and has enjoyed
economic growth above the national average. The state's reputation for clean
government is also attracting multilateral agencies such as the World Bank,
which are often reluctant to lend to other nearby states.
In Sao Luis, the capital of Maranhao, attempts are also under way to
dislodge the elites. Mayoress Conceicao Andrade, of the Brazilian Socialist
party, inherited a government which employed one in four of its population
and spent 96 per cent of its tax revenues on salaries. She has cut the
payroll by a fifth and introduced the strange - in Brazilian terms - concept
of fiscal thrift. 'We never spend all we collect from taxes. Instead, we
hold back a bit for investment,' she says.
But even the mayoress is pessimistic about the pace of reform in the
north-east, especially in the rural areas, where poor levels of education
and resistance to change are a brake to reform. And it is still extremely
rare for individuals or groups to join together as citizens or trade unions
and demand change. 'Most people are hungry a lot of the time. It's difficult
for people like that to feel like citizens and demand their rights,' she
says.

A Scud missile exploded yesterday in a densely populated neighbourhood of
the Yemeni capital as northern troops pushed into southern oil fields, AP
reports from Sanaa.
Reporters who got to the Al-Qaa area of Sanaa before soldiers sealed it off
saw five demolished houses. At least one body was seen being pulled from
under debris. The missile landed close to the city's Jumhouriya Hospital.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the northern leader, has a residence about 800
meters from the scene.
International relief agencies prepared to move up to 5,000 Somali refugees
from a camp on the front lines in the civil war. Refugees say at least 175
Somalis have been killed in cross fire.
Yemen collapsed into all-out war between northern and southern forces on May
5. The conservative north had united with the formerly Marxist south on May
22 1990, to form the first multi-party democracy on the Arabian peninsula.
In a broadcast on Sanaa radio, a military official said northern troops had
on Sunday seized a key military base in Ataq, the capital of oil-producing
Shabwa province.
The south on Friday announced it was seceding, a declaration rejected by the
north. Ali Salem al-Beidh, who was vice president of unified Yemen, was
named president of the south's newly declared Democratic Republic of Yemen.
In Washington, Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, said: 'The
United States does not believe the critical issues which will shape the
future of Yemen should be decided in the heat of battle. We will therefore
not respond to the al-Beidh declaration.'

A partial boycott and widespread public apathy led to a low turnout
yesterday in Nigerian elections for delegates to next month's constitutional
conference, which is to be the basis of the military government's political
programme.
It followed the annulment of a presidential election last June after it had
become clear that Mr Moshood Abiola, a businessman from the south-west, had
won.
Political parties and associations have been banned since Gen Sani Abacha
became head of state last November and no campaigning by contestants was
allowed before yesterday's vote. The 270 elected delegates to the
constitutional conference will be joined by 90 government nominees.
Those who voted said that unless they took part they could not influence the
constitutional conference. But senior politicians around Nigeria say there
is no need for the conference because Nigeria's political problems lies not
with the constitution but the military elite who obstruct it. The Campaign
for Democracy has called the conference a ruse to buy time for a regime
which lacks direction.
In the Yoruba homeland of Mr Abiola in the south-west, a coalition of
politicians led by two former state governors told its members not to stand
as delegates for the conference and called for a boycott of the polls.
Elsewhere two powerful groups have boycotted the whole process: leaders of
the large Ijaw tribe in the south-east, and a powerful alliance of retired
military officers from the central region.

India's budget deficit, which sharply exceeded its target in the last fiscal
year, is on course for steady reduction over the next few years, Mr Manmohan
Singh, finance minister, said yesterday.
Mr Singh told a meeting of finance and business executives in London that
last year's overshoot - to more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product,
compared with a 4.7 per cent target - had been partly caused by unexpectedly
low receipts from import duties.
Customs duties account for about 40 per cent of government revenues.
Cuts in import duty rates had not produced a sufficient rise in import
volumes to compensate for the revenue lost. But Mr Singh expected revenues
to bounce back this year. The budget deficit should drop by about 1 per cent
of gross domestic product each year, bringing it down to 3 per cent in three
to four years, he said.
The rise in inflation, which has recently been nudging into double figures,
was a temporary phenomenon, he said. The rate should drop back down when
this year's crops come in.
Economic growth should be at a minimum of 5 per cent this year and at much
higher rates in the later half of the decade, he said.
Mr Singh restated the government's commitment to reform of the economy,
saying that 'any impression that we have lost our enthusiasm or slowed down
would be erroneous'. By correctly sequencing reforms, he said, 'we have
avoided the aberrations which have proved the undoing of the reform process
in many other developing countries'.
Meanwhile, a broad consensus of support for economic reform had developed
throughout the country so that reform was now irreversible, he said.
Although enough political support had not yet developed for full-scale
privatisation, the government had opened up virtually all sectors to private
competition, so the public sector's share of the economy was bound to
shrink.
Stefan Wagstyl adds from New Delhi: Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao
yesterday urged foreign companies to invest in India, saying: 'It is a free
market now. There are no shackles anywhere. Invest in anything in India.' Mr
Rao was speaking at a power industry conference, attended by Indian and
foreign businessmen. It was his first meeting with a business audience since
returning from a trip to the US, where investment promotion topped his
agenda.

The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, which boasts 3,550 corporate
members and which has been seen as adopting an increasingly pro-Beijing
slant, has told the government it opposes a key plank of the constitutional
reform bill of Governor Chris Patten.
The bill, the second stage of which was submitted to the Legislative Council
on March 9, aims to broaden the franchise by creating nine new 'jumbo'
electorates and replacing corporate with individual voting in the functional
constituencies, which represent business and professional groups.
The chamber, which now holds a seat in LegCo and thus has a vested interest
in preserving the status quo, claims the new functional constituencies
should retain the essential features - to represent specific sectoral
interests with a limited electorate - of the existing 21 functional
constituencies.

<TEXT>
The Australian Liberal party, the main federal opposition party, yesterday
voted for a change of leader, with Mr Alexander Downer replacing Mr John
Hewson. Mr Peter Costello, joining Mr Downer on a joint 'youth' ticket, will
act as Mr Downer's deputy.
The change was achieved at a 15-minute party meeting in Canberra called by
Mr Hewson to face up to the challenge. Mr Downer won 43 votes against Mr
Hewson's 36. The build-up to his overthrow began with the opposition's
surprise loss in elections just over a year ago to Mr Paul Keating's
incumbent Labor party. Although Mr Hewson's fortunes revived last summer
when the government's budget was stalled in parliament for two months, his
opinion poll rating then dropped very sharply.
Mr Downer, aged 42, comes from an Adelaide establishment family which has
been involved in federal politics for several generations. His father was
immigration minister in the Menzies government. Such a background has often
been viewed as a liability but Mr Downer has attempted to combat this image
 -partly through astute handling of the shadow treasurer's job, and partly
by conscious efforts to portray a down-to-earth, family image.
Mr Costello, six years younger than Mr Downer, is a Melbourne lawyer who has
been in federal politics for only four years.

The Bank of Israel, the country's central bank, announced yesterday it would

rise this month.

FT  24 MAY 94 / UN envoy calls off Kigali visit

<TEXT>
Mr Iqbal Riza, a United Nations special envoy, yesterday called off a trip
to the Rwandan capital Kigali, saying warring parties could not guarantee
his safety, Reuter reports from Mulindi, Rwanda.
'Both sides seem to have difficulty in securing our security. So we cannot
go along the route into Kigali,' he told reporters before driving back into
Uganda. He said he hoped to try and fly into Kigali from Uganda today.
Mr Riza was to have travelled from northern Rwanda by road to Kigali to meet
the government side after talks with rebels on ending seven weeks of
violence in Rwanda in which an estimated half a million people have died.
Fighting appeared to have resumed in Kigali in earnest after combatants
agreed a truce to allow the envoy to visit.
The talks with the rebels failed to agree on the key issue of the number of
UN troops needed in Rwanda. Mr Riza said he had no mandate to alter the UN
force figure of up to 5,500 authorised by the Security Council last week.
The Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels insist on at most 2,500.
A rebel spokesman said the RPF turned down Mr Riza's appeal that it enter
talks with the interim government, which took over after President Juvenal
Habyarimana was killed along with his Burundi counterpart in a rocket attack
on their aircraft on April 6.
That tragedy sparked the current massacres in Rwanda, blamed largely on Mr
Habyarimana's troops and militias from his majority Hutu tribe.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Call to improve aid programmes: Report criticises assistance
'tied' to purchases from donor countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An independent evaluation of international aid published yesterday sharply
criticises tied aid, expresses concern that donors are failing to meet
commitments to increase assistance, and says only 6.5 per cent of aid is
spent on meeting the needs of the poorest.
Official development assistance (ODA) worth Dollars 60.4bn (Pounds 40bn)
represented just over a third of the net flow of resources from the
countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) to developing
countries in 1992, said the report, The Reality of Aid. Aid flows were
critical in sub-Saharan Africa, where aid averages more than 13 per cent of
gross national product.
The study, published by the London-based charity Actionaid, was edited by
Development Initiatives, an independent consultancy specialising in aid and
development policy.
The era of slowly growing aid is coming to an end, says the report, with the
increase in real terms in aid from DAC donors of only 0.5 per cent between
1991 and 1992.
The share of humanitarian relief and peacekeeping has gone up from 2.3 per
cent in 1988 to more than 7 per cent in 1991.
Business interests are becoming more assertive and their influence in the
shape of aid and the countries it goes to appears to be increasing. This is
not being matched by any coherent attempt to serve the needs of the poor.
However, the report notes that DAC measures introduced in 1992 to improve
the quality of tied aid 'appear to be increasing accountability and having
some impact'.
Around Dollars 15bn each year has been tied to the purchase of goods and
services from individual DAC members, says the report. In 1991 this rose to
nearly Dollars 18bn.
'This results in developing countries paying above the market rate,' says
the report, adding that estimates vary between 10 and 20 per cent.
'This excess price is a direct subsidy to exporters in OECD countries
amounting to more than Dollars 2bn a year - nearly 4 per cent of DAC aid.'
The volume of untied aid is unduly inflated by relief for bad debts arising
out of export credit agreements which have originated from export promotion
for domestic industry - Dollars 1.3bn in 1991 or 2.2 per cent of total ODA.
The aid available for sustainable development is being hit by a combination
of declining public expenditure budgets in the OECD and the increasing use
of ODA to meet costs formerly borne by other government departments. The
costs of asylum seekers and forgiveness for bad debts arising from
commercial export credits accounted for 5 per cent of total ODA in 1992, it
says.
Public suport still far outstrips criticism of aid and its effectiveness,
the report adds, 'and the universal picture of aid fatigue is not borne out
by opinion poills which continue to show that public support is founded on
humanitarian concern'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Zhu eases credit restrictions on state enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice premier in charge of the economy, has
signalled an easing of tight credit restrictions on lending to ailing state
enterprises and has also appealed for greater efforts to increase grain and
cotton production.
Mr Zhu's remarks, published on the front pages yesterday of main Chinese
newspapers, indicate growing official anxiety over labour unrest in
cash-starved state factories and also worries about a serious shortfall in
cotton production accompanied by signs of growing agitation among peasants.
Addressing two separate economic forums in the past two weeks attended by
provincial leaders from China's central and southern provinces, Mr Zhu
called on economic departments and banks to 'help' failing enterprises.
He was quoted as saying that government bodies including financial
institutions should 'make surveys and help enterprises to resume production
and get out of these predicaments'.
The State Statistical Bureau reported that in the first quarter nearly half
the state enterprises were lossmaking. Some estimates put 'triangular debt'
 -enterprises owing money to each other for raw materials and finished
products - at Yn300bn (Pounds 23bn).
Mr Zhu, who is also governor of the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, has been under considerable pressure from the powerful state
enterprise lobby to ease credit to save state-run factories from bankruptcy
and avoid the spectre of thousands of workers losing their jobs.
His appeal to officials to 'fully arouse' farmers' enthusiasm for cotton
production reflects deepening government concern over sharp rises in the
cotton price. Textile factories throughout China - the industry is one of
the country's biggest employers - are facing difficulties securing supplies
and some have been obliged to stop production.
Mr Zhu, who has made curtailing inflation a main priority, has been
insisting on continued tight credit policies, but banking statistics for
April showing an increase in the funds of state enterprises indicates an
easing of restrictions is already taking place.
Western economists in Beijing say it is likely the government will continue
to be selective in providing credit. They contrast the latest cautious
easing with the panicky steps taken last September and October to provide
additional funding to loss-making enterprises.
A slight lessening of inflationary pressures - the April and March figures
were down on the rate of growth registered in the first two months of the
year - suggests the government may have some scope for a limited relaxation
of credit.
Mr Zhu's call for an improvement in handling what he called 'relations
between reform, development and stability' coincides with official alarm
about growing unrest among peasants whose returns from their tiny plots are
being squeezed by higher production costs. Farmers are also angry about a
widening gap between country and city, inland and coastal regions. Inflation
has also been rising faster in rural areas than in the city, according to
the latest State Statistical Bureau review, adding to peasant unhappiness.
Mr Ren Jianxin, a senior party official, was quoted at the weekend in the
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, as saying at a meeting on
rural instability that the 'security management situation remains extremely
grim nationwide this year'.
Mr Ren called on the security apparatus to 'strengthen the force of their
blows and mercilessly attack serious criminal activities and serious
economic crimes'. He was referring to widespread rural lawlessness,
including banditry, clan feuds, and violent protests against local
officials.
People's Daily also reflected official concerns about stability in a
commentary published yesterday which called for sensitive handling of the
present difficult reform phase, especially rationalisation of state
enterprises and threats to employment.
'When an old balance is broken,' the paper said, 'conflict is unavoidable,
such as the conflict between the centre and the localities, between local
governments and enterprises and between enterprises and their employees.'
China's leaders have, since an important meeting of the Communist party
central committee last November approved a new package of reforms, been
putting heavy emphasis on stability. This has coincided with a crackdown on
any sign of political opposition.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Hebron observers left watching from their window: Julian
Ozanne reports on an Israeli curfew that shut the international force of 117
inside its compound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Norwegian member of the international observer force in Hebron pointed to
the stretch of tarmac outside the force's compound: 'We are not allowed to
move beyond that point. We can't patrol the town. We don't know what is
going on beyond our front door.'
As he spoke last week, the West Bank flashpoint of Arab-Jewish violence was
under a 24-hour military curfew. Israeli soldiers were conducting
house-to-house searches looking for Palestinian guerrillas who killed two
Israelis in revenge for an attack on Palestinians the day before.
Israel has since lifted the curfew but the incident has left doubts among
Palestinians about the credibility of the observer force which was deployed
two weeks ago.
'This was the most significant test so far of the force but they did
nothing,' said Mr Awny Sughyer, deputy mayor of Hebron. 'The Israelis made
the whole area a closed military zone and the observers were not even
allowed to enter any of the places of violence.
'People feel angry and sad about the force. There were high expectations
when they first came here but now people say they can't do anything to
protect Palestinians.'
The observer force has a three-month mission to reduce tension between
Hebron's 110,000 Arab residents and militant Jewish settlers after the
February 25 Hebron mosque massacre of 30 Palestinians.
They were deployed in the wake of a United Nations Security Council
resolution and weeks of difficult negotiations between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation. After fierce arguments about the size of
the force and whether its members should be armed, the two sides eventually
agreed to a 160-strong force from Italy, Denmark and Norway, of whom 60
should carry arms 'for their personal protection'.
The force quickly ran into problems. First, it was unable to recruit enough
suitable people and settled for 117. Second, despite the hard PLO bargaining
for light weapons, the observers decided against being armed. This left the
force under the protection of the Israeli army.
Last, a clause in the Israel-PLO agreement specified that observers would be
denied entry to any area which Israel declared a closed military zone.
Israel's declaration of the whole of Hebron as a closed zone 'was a funny
interpretation of the agreement that we did not expect', said Mr Bjarno
Sorenson, spokesman for the force. He said the force had filed a complaint
but could do little else. In response to Palestinian criticism that the
force had been unable to prevent Israeli soldiers and settlers wounding 19
Palestinians last Monday and had been denied access to the site, Mr Sorenson
said: 'People here want us to be a shield but the word protection for us
means to report an impartial view of what is going on here.'
Criticism is also emerging about the financing of the force. One observer
said it had no fixed budget but had been told to spend as much money as
possible and had been given a blank cheque by Denmark, Norway and Italy.
The compound, which has been off-limits to outsiders, is reportedly stacked
full of new computers, fax machines and furniture and the force is lavishly
equipped with Israeli radios, mobile telephones and rented cars. According
to the agreement, all equipment bought by the force will be handed over to
the PLO once the mission is completed.
The real problem remains the conflict between Palestinians and militant
Jewish settlers in Hebron, a town sacred to both Moslem and Jew. 'There is a
contradiction between settlements in the town and peace. Together they are
impossible,' said Mr Khaled Osaily, a local businessman. 'The force clearly
can do nothing about that. For us Palestinians the worst thing is that by
being here maybe they will legitimise the presence of the settlers.'

China's top legal newspaper yesterday published a risky call for judicial
independence, saying Communist party officials still tipped the scales of
justice, Reuter reports from Beijing. The Legal Daily's front-page editorial
said free courts were essential to developing a market economy - and added
that China's supposedly independent judiciary was far from free. 'The courts
have become administrative tools of the government,' the editorial quoted
one unnamed court official as saying, in a direct attack on Beijing's
long-standing position that it allows judicial freedom.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Japanese reduce capital outflows
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's role as a supplier of international capital is waning as domestic
institutions have pared down overseas investment and fund flows from the US
have risen sharply, according to a report by the Bank of Japan, the
country's central bank.
While Japanese financial institutions were leading providers of capital
during the late 1980s, this has changed because of the burst of the economic
'bubble' in 1990. And although Japanese investors again turned buyers of
overseas securities last year, the recent rise in US interest rates has
prompted a sell-off.
The report provides some explanation of the strength in the yen. Part of the
recent upward pressure on the yen has come from the decline in Japanese
demand for dollars and the rise in demand for yen. According to the Bank of
Japan, overseas investment in the Tokyo stock market totalled a record
Dollars 34.5bn (Pounds 22.9bn) during the first quarter of this year.
During the late 1980s, Japanese investment in overseas assets including
securities and property prompted a large capital outflow. Between 1985 and
1989, annual net outflow of long-term capital averaged Dollars 110bn.
However, this has since fallen sharply and in 1992 Japan saw a total Dollars
28.5bn outflow in long-term capital and an outflow of Dollars 78.3bn last
year.
Securities investment by Japanese investors last year rose 50 per cent from
the previous year to Dollars 51.6bn because of the rally in US and European
stock and bond markets. Investors bought a net Dollars 21.9bn in US
securities, up 2.5 times from the previous year, and Dollars 17.4bn in
German securities, up 2.1 times. Net purchases of French securities rose
five times to Dollars 10bn, but buying of UK securities fell 1.8 per cent to
Dollars 16.8bn.
Downward pressure on the dollar has stemmed from US overseas investments.
The report says overseas securities investment by US investors last year
totalled 2.5 times that of Japan's at Dollars 125.4bn.

One of Slovakia's main opposition parties, the Party of the Democratic Left
(SDL), moved yesterday to broaden its electoral appeal ahead of elections
due in September by forming a left-wing alliance with three smaller parties.
The SDL, which has 28 seats in the current parliament, is joining forces
with the Green party, the Social Democratic party and the Slovak Farmers'
Movement, and has pledged to make reviving the ailing Slovak arms industry a
central part of its election campaign. Mr Peter Weiss, SDL chairman, said
cuts in arms production since 1989 had contributed to Slovakia's growing
unemployment rate. The country was one of the largest producers of weapons
for the Warsaw pact countries before 1989. Mr Weiss said the new political
alliance favoured maintaining Slovakia's conversion to a market economy but
not one 'that will ruin the environment or make the average individual
suffer'.

Five Swiss Nobel prize-winning scientists have urged the Swiss government to
reduce its contributions to European Union research projects, which they
consider politically motivated and a waste of money. The demand, in an open
letter, could hardly come at a worse time for Berne, which is desperately
trying to restart negotiations with the EU on reciprocal airline rights
among other delicate issues. The Swiss parliament is to debate a SFr554m
(Pounds 258.8m) contribution to EU research, some of it for a new three-year
programme, later this week. 'We view the planned joining of this new EU
research programme as primarily politically motivated,' the scientists said.
Mr Richard Ernst, Nobel laureate for chemistry in 1991 for his work on
magnetic nuclear resonance and one of the signatories of the letter, was
quoted as saying that Brussels-led research programmes were often amateurish
and suffered from excessive administration costs.

The head of Portugal's main intelligence service, the SIS, resigned after it
emerged his agents illegally reported on politicians and investigated
corruption on the island of Madeira, the government said yesterday. The
interior minister, Mr Manuel Dias Loureiro, also said that the head of SIS
operations in the autonomous island off the coast of Morocco had also been
sacked.
Mr Dias Loureiro told a news conference that an inquiry by a parliamentary
commission showed the SIS in Madeira had become involved in activities
beyond its charter. Mr Dias Loureiro said the head of SIS, Mr Ramiro Ladeiro
Monteiro, had resigned in the light of these findings, even though he was
not directly responsible for the illegal activities in Madeira. Mr Joao
Evangilista, the head of SIS operations in Madeira, had been sacked, he
added. Portugal has been swept by rumours of spying since police found a
hidden microphone in the office of Mr Jose Cunha Rodrigues, the chief state
prosecutor in Lisbon. Mr Dias Loureiro said police were still investigating
that incident.

<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday failed to honour their pledge to withdraw 150
Serb fighters from the UN's 3km exclusion zone around Gorazde, the
south-eastern Moslem enclave. Despite this breach of the UN-brokered
agreement, Bosnian Serb leaders matched defiance on the battlefield with
another diplomatic offensive, saying UN sanctions must be lifted before they
would rejoin international peace talks on Bosnia.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government has refused to return to the bargaining
table before its Serb foes withdraw from the Gorazde exclusion zone.
According to Major Rob Annink, UN spokesman in Sarajevo, Serb forces
yesterday even improved their positions within the exclusion zone. Renewed
Serb demands for the lifting of sanctions made the prospects for an
all-party meeting even bleaker. Mr Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the
self-styled Serb state which covers about 70 per cent of Bosnia, said: 'We
will seek equal conditions. All kinds of pressures must be removed,
including the lifting of sanctions.' In Paris, Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic failed yesterday to win unqualified support from representatives
of French political parties for an end to the arms embargo which he says
ties his government's hands.

Poland has offered to buy back part of its Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.6bn) debt
at a price of between 41 US cents and 38 US cents to the dollar, in a
financing plan sent out to western commercial banks at the weekend.
The buy-back offer covering 5 per cent of the amount owed is to be presented
to holders of Polish debt at meetings in Frankfurt, Paris, London and New
York beginning at the end of this month and Poland expects to have answers
from its creditors by June 29. The framework for the proposals was
negotiated last March in an agreement which foresaw an overall reduction in
the debt amounting to between 42 per cent and 45 per cent. The proposals
sent out see Poland issuing par and discount bonds and include provisions
for the buy back as well as opening the way for debt-for-equity swaps.
The proposals have the tacit backing of the banks which negotiated the
agreement. The price of Polish debt reached 39.5 cents to the dollar on the
news of the proposals, up from 37 cents at the end of last week. The price
of Polish debt went as high as 52 cents early this year. Mr Grzegorz
Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, said in a newspaper interview
yesterday that he intended to follow up the debt reduction deal expected to
be completed this autumn with 'bold' proposals on swapping the remaining
Polish debt for equity in state sector enterprises.

When Nikita Khrushchev handed Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 to commemorate
Russian-Ukrainian friendship it was in the good old days when the Soviet
party leader could simply decree the nationality of millions in a grandiose
gesture. Like much else in Soviet times, the consequences must now be dealt
with.
The danger in the rising tension in the Crimean peninsula is that it is a
struggle not just over the control of territory but also over the fate of a
heavily armed fleet; that Russia and Ukraine are proud, jealous and unused
to treating each other as equals; that its aggravation is at least in part
in the political interests of their leaders; and that it is a classic
struggle between the principles of sovereignty and the will of the people.
Mr Khrushchev's transfer of Crimea from Russia soon after he moved from the
position of first secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party to general
secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was - Russians say -
always resented, though it appears the majority of the peninsula's 2.7m
people voted for the independence of Ukraine in 1991, probably under the
impression that life would be better.
By 1992, however, the Russian majority appeared to have swung away from
their new 'nation'. The Crimean supreme soviet, to general acclaim, passed a
constitution for Crimea which declared that its government enjoyed all
sovereign rights except those they voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.
But under pressure from Kiev the deputies suspended the law - until, last
Friday when the new parliament, with a militant majority in favour of union
with Russia, unfroze it to cries from Kiev that this meant de facto
independence.
Crimea is the base of the Black Sea Fleet and the presidents of Russia and
Ukraine have signally failed to agree, over the past two years, either to
share it or allow one or the other to command it. It remains in a limbo,
under Russian control, situated on Ukrainian territory, largely in the port
of Sevastopol.
The election early this year of the pro-unity Mr Yuri Meshkov as president
of Crimea and of a parliament also committed to union with Russia has been
followed by the signing of economic agreements between Crimea and the
governments of both Moscow and Russia. In the past two weeks, reports of
Ukrainian forces being moved into the area have been routinely relayed from
both the fleet and the Crimean authorities, and routinely denied by Ukraine.
Over the weekend it was the turn of Ukraine to claim that the fleet command
had moved in tank and missile detachments.
In both Moscow and Kiev, the politics speak to confrontation. Presidential
elections are due in Ukraine next month, but Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the present
incumbent, wants to delay them: a declaration of a state of emergency and a
tough line on Crimea would do him no harm and might push back elections by
general consent.
In Russia, things are in some respects worse. Last weekend, two different
political organisations held congresses. One was the Russian Freedom Party
of former vice president Alexander Rutskoi, who used the event officially to
launch his claim on the presidency with the promise that he would again
extend Russia to the borders of the former Soviet Union.
The other was a gathering of communist groups, including the dominant
Russian Communist party: they, too, pledged to restore the imperial scope of
the former Union. Both opposition groups chose this platform because they
believe it popular: opinion polls show they have a point (though they do not
show what Russians would put up with to achieve it).
It is clear, however - from polling and anecdotal evidence  - that Crimea
occupies a special spot in the hearts of most Russians. Its beauty and
climate (which made it the most popular resort area in the former Soviet
Union); its literary (Chekhov lived there) and historical (Catherine the
Great took it from the Turks) associations; and its Russian majority - all
combine to make it inconceivable that it could be other than Russian.
In the increasingly heated climate which surrounds discussion of the former
Soviet Union - in particular those parts outside Russia in which Russians
are numerous - Crimea at present takes pride of place.
It can become an oppositionist cause over which Mr Yeltsin and the
government cannot afford to appear weak but which they do not wish to see
boil over. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, told Mr Douglas
Hurd, his British opposite number visiting Moscow yesterday, that -
according to Mr Hurd  - 'Crimea is part of Ukraine and that its sovereignty
is not in question'.
At the same time, however, Mr Kozyrev has also said that the wishes of its
people must be respected. Both Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy
to the former Yugoslavia and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister,
used the Yugoslav analogy as something of a threat.
Though all sides profess to be aware of what is at stake, they nevertheless
inch closer to the chasm.

Crimea: the past
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1783: As part of a massive Russian expansion to the south, Catherine
the Great smashes the Crimean khanate, controlled by the Tatars, and
annexes the peninsula.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1944: Between May 18 and May 20 the entire Crimean Tatar population,
some 180,000 people, is deported to Central Asia to punish the Tatars
for backing Hitler.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1954: To mark the three hundredth anniversary of the Treaty of
Pereiaslav, which joined Ukraine and Russia, Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev transfers the Crimean peninsula to the Ukrainian Soviet
Socialist Republic.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1991: On December 1, more than 90 per cent of Ukrainians, including
over half of the residents of Crimea, vote for Ukrainian independence.
As Ukraine asserts its sovereignty, tensions with Russia rise.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994: In January, Crimea, where ethnic Russians constitute 70 per cent
of the population, elect separatist leader Yuri Meshkov as President.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Nato's Moscow stance criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato defence ministers will today hear out the co-operation ideas of General
Pavel Grachev, their Russian opposite number, amid charges from a
prestigious think-tank that the alliance is mistakenly appearing to pander
to Moscow.
The International Institute for Strategic Studies alleged yesterday that
Nato had already made mistakes in its treatment of its erstwhile
adversaries. In its annual strategic survey, the think-tank said Nato had
clumsily given the impression that its refusal to grant early entry to
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had been motivated by reluctance to
upset Russia. 'It was one thing to agree that Russia should have its views
considered. It was another to make it appear that the west feared the strong
objections expected from Moscow on this question,' the survey said. 'To let
it appear that the Russians exercised a veto over Nato's non-existent desire
to take these (central European) countries into the fold was a mistake that
should not be made again,' it added.
Gen Grachev will today lay out Russia's military doctrine, which has been
published only in part, and explain Moscow's terms for a more elaborate form
of co-operation than the Nato-designed Partnership for Peace programme. Nato
has made clear that whatever other arrangements it makes with Moscow, Russia
must sign the same basic documents as the 18 countries which already adhere
to the PFP.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Italian inflation disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian financial markets reacted badly yesterday to preliminary figures
which indicated that inflation was not coming down as quickly as expected.
Preliminary figures for May, based on data collected from nine Italian
cities, indicated that retail prices would show an increase of 0.4 per cent
for this month, compared with the previous year, giving an annual inflation
rate of 4.1 per cent. The data, prepared by the municipality of Bologna, is
normally confirmed by the state statistical institute after the end of the
month. Economic analysts had expected the April increase of 0.3 per cent to
be confirmed, which would have suggested an annual inflation rate of 4 per
cent. Equity investors, positive about the stock market since the election
of a right-wing government in Italy in March, used the news as an excuse to
take profits yesterday morning. Andrew Hill, Milan.
Figures issued by the Bank of Italy revealed that the public sector deficit
narrowed to L41,690bn (Pounds 17.4bn) in the first three months of the year,
compared with L50,810bn in the first quarter of 1993.
Italy's industrial wholesale sales index rose a real 7.8 per cent in January
from a year earlier, the state statistical Institute, Istat, said yesterday.
The January figure compared with a 5.7 per cent year-on-year increase in
December 1993.
The Spanish insurance sector's combined premiums issued in 1993 were 10 per
cent higher than the previous year at Pta2,660bn (Pounds 12.9bn), according
to provisional figures released yesterday by the central government's
Directorate General of Insurance.

FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Portuguese seek a
scapegoat for the broken promises - Peter Wise reports on a country grown
disillusioned with the idea of European integration / Financial Times
Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands and Britain follow the fortunes of
three candidates seeking election to the European parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign in Portugal for the European elections reflects a considerable
cooling of the country's enthusiasm for Europe after almost two years of
recession.
Defence of national interests is the dominant note in the campaigns of both
the governing Social Democrats (PSD) and the opposition Socialists (PS). Two
smaller groups, the right-wing CDS-PP and the communist coalition, CDU, come
close to calling for Portugal to quit the European Union altogether.
As real wages decline and unemployment grows, the Portuguese are counting
the cost of integration into a community they previously saw as a source of
nothing but prosperity. 'Europe has lost its glitter here,' says a European
diplomat in Lisbon. 'People have grown more inward-looking as a result of
the recession and political parties are adopting a more protectionist
stance.'
President Mario Soares, a Socialist, expressed the growing scepticism at a
recent congress of government opponents, where he questioned how wisely EU
funds were being spent and what would happen when the flow stopped.
Agriculture and industry were suffering severely from the effects of the
single market, he said, threatening to leave only services as a competitive
sector. 'Are we to become the waiters of Europe?' Mr Soares asked.
Early campaigning has been focused on the rural interior, where the single
market and the implementation of the EU's common agricultural policy have
cruelly exposed the backwardness of Portuguese farming. Mr Antonio Campos,
the PS spokesman on agriculture and a candidate in the elections, says
Portuguese farmers' earnings have fallen 40 per cent over the past three
years to near subsistence levels.
Farming is a sector with a political resonance in Portugal beyond its
economic weight and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, last week
removed Mr Arlindo Cunha from his post as agriculture minister so he could
run for the European parliament. Both main parties advocate preserving
Portuguese agriculture against what is portrayed as the cold logic of a
European Commission intent on converting the country's farms into forests.
Both the centre-right PSD and the centre-left PS have similarly recast other
European policies in a more nationalistic light in keeping with the public
mood. In fact, the electorate may find it difficult to distinguish between
the two parties' proposals.
Despite apprehension over the consequences of European integration, most
Portuguese remain pro-European. They blame their own government more than
Brussels for their current ills and the vote on June 12 will be more a
verdict on Mr Cavaco Silva's domestic performance than a judgment on
European policy.
In this context, the vote is a bigger test for the PS than the PSD.
Recession has produced mounting dissatisfaction with Mr Cavaco Silva, who
has been in office since 1985, and the PS are currently ahead in the opinion
polls with 39.4 per cent of the vote, compared with 26.2 per cent for the
PSD.
But a hard-hitting, anti-government speech from Mr Soares at the opposition
congress, 'Portugal: What future?', has backfired on the PS by undermining
the position of its leader, Mr Antonio Guterres, and reigniting old
rivalries within the party.
Discord over selecting candidates for the European elections has further
detracted from the Socialists' credibility. If Mr Guterres fails to deliver
a convincing victory on June 12 his leadership is likely to be challenged in
a disruption that could have serious consequences for the PS in the run-up
to the next general election in October 1995.

FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): General in the van of
Forza attack - Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands and
Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking election to the
European parliament
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As befits a military man, General Luigi Caligaris began his campaign for the
European parliamentary elections by studying a map of his constituency.
Heading the Forza Italia list in a constituency covering the whole of
northeast Italy, he needed to base himself somewhere with easy access to
places as far apart as Bologna and Trieste, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
He has ended up renting offices outside Mestre in a flashy business park
half empty because of the recession. Mestre, the depressing industrial
adjunct of Venice, has the great advantage of being criss-crossed by a
network of motorways.
'We have to cover an enormous area, nearly a quarter the size of Italy; and
we are without the help of national television,' says the 62-year-old
general turned military analyst and commentator.
In a week he reckons to have driven almost 4,000km, grabbing little food and
even less sleep. 'If I wasn't trained as a soldier and didn't keep fit, I
don't know how I'd cope,' he says.
He has barely recovered from campaigning in the March general elections in
which he was the most spectacular casualty among the Forza Italia
candidates. Having cast himself as a future defence or foreign minister, Gen
Caligaris failed to be elected. But, as a consolation, he has been made
standard-bearer in these elections for Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister.
His campaign has been put together at high speed in mid-May helped by three
full-time staff (one provided by Forza Italia from Rome), and a handful of
volunteers including his picture restorer wife. He reckons to spend about
L200m (Pounds 83,000) on the campaign, part supplied by Forza Italia and the
rest coming from friends - often in kind, like a campaign car. The biggest
cost is campaign slots on local television, the most effective means of
getting his message across.
In such a diffuse constituency, the general admits it is hard to give a
focus to the campaign especially when voters are apathetic in the wake of
the general elections.
'There is too much toing and froing,' he says, citing the frustration of
driving a 400km round-trip for a poorly attended 40-minute meeting. But he
is buoyed up by the support he finds for Forza Italia. 'They've seen us
winning and everyone now wants to jump on the bandwagon,' he adds.
Forza Italia's success under the mantle of Mr Berlusconi is not without its
problems. The movement encouraged people to form their own support clubs in
the run-up to the general elections, and these remain autonomous, little
co-ordinated and often rivals. Indeed, a new political organisation directed
from Rome is being built parallel to the clubs. More than 2,000 people
applied to be Forza Italia candidates in the European elections, and of the
16 selected in the general's constituency, none have had previous political
experience or close dealing with Brussels.
'Explaining the real nature of the EU is not easy in Italy because Europe
has been taken so much for granted. This is the first time I think any
election here has begun to question the nature of our Europe,' says Gen
Caligaris. He denies being a Euro-sceptic; but equally he is not a
Euro-enthusiast. A Euro-questioner might be a more apposite label for him
and Forza Italia.
'I do not see a strong common desire for the Union - the UK is too
sceptical; Italy is always too rhetorical; the Germans and French are too
exclusive. . . . In going forward, we have to strike a compromise between
full sovereignty and loss of sovereignty. The most important thing is to be
clear what part of our sovereignty is worth losing.'
Perhaps more important, the general believes Italy has failed to exert
sufficient weight in European institutions. 'Italy has lost its influence,'
he bemoans. He is determined to use Forza Italia's presence at Strasbourg to
remedy this.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Yeltsin scraps curbs on energy exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin, seeking to revive economic reform, yesterday
scrapped quotas and licences for oil and gas exports from July 1 and offered
a three-year tax holiday to foreign investors in the manufacturing sector.
Six decrees issued by the Russian leader yesterday are an attempt to push
the government of Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin into resuming the more
active tempo of economic reform in evidence until last winter - in part by
not waiting for parliament to pass the relevant legislation.
In keeping with Mr Yeltsin's new spirit of 'national reconciliation',
however, the decrees blend well with the views of Mr Chernomyrdin and many
parliamentarians who have called for more measures to stimulate economic
growth and restore 'discipline' among state-owned enterprises.
The scrapping of quotas and licences for almost all exports means Russia has
finally heeded calls by domestic and foreign economists to lift antiquated
controls on its lucrative energy exports.
The quotas and licences have not only stimulated massive corruption but have
served as an indirect control on domestic energy prices by regulating
quantities available on domestic markets.
However, Mr Alexander Livshits, head of the president's group of economic
experts, forecast that this decree would not significantly increase
lucrative hard currency exports because export taxes remained high and
pipeline capacity restricted.
Nor was it clear last night how the decree's separate scrapping of all
exemptions on export taxes - with several exceptions cited in the decree
itself - would affect tax breaks promised but not yet granted to foreign oil
companies.
In an effort to stimulate economic growth and reduce tax evasion, Mr Yeltsin
instructed the government to submit to parliament by September 15
legislation lowering companies' overall tax burden by 10 to 20 per cent. He
also decreed a three-year exemption from profit tax for all manufacturing
ventures registered since January with at least 30 per cent foreign
ownership and Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) investment - as long as they stay in
business for at least five years.
Another decree sought to restore genuine state control, including the power
to dismiss dishonest and incompetent directors, over enterprises
theoretically owned by the state but in reality free to do what they want.
Mr Livshits said a priority of this decree was to stem theft of state
property by directors of enterprises which could not be privatised and
therefore subjected to the scrutiny of private shareholders.
Professor Yevgeny Yasin, head of the president's analytical group, said a
list of 'several hundred' enterprises now being prepared would include
several defence plants, and inefficient factories which would be kept open
to prevent otherwise unacceptably big local job losses.
Finally, Mr Yeltsin issued new instructions attempting to reduce
enterprises' indebtedness to one another and the state treasury. For
instance, the decree allows the government to start bankruptcy proceedings
against companies which are more than three months late paying their taxes.
It also attempts to speed the introduction of a long-promised system of
promissory notes for inter-enterprise debt.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Athens to sell off 25% of Greek telecoms company
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's Socialist government yesterday announced the partial privatisation
of OTE, the state telecommunications company. The move appeared to be aimed
at restoring confidence to local financial markets after a week of steady
pressure on the drachma.
The government hopes the flotation of 25 per cent of the company on the
Athens stock exchange, planned for October, will realise at least Dr250bn
(Pounds 674m), with overseas investors likely to take up about half the
issue.
At least 60 per cent of funds raised will go towards covering a revenue
shortfall in this year's budget, estimated at Dr450bn-Dr500bn. The remainder
will be used to improve OTE's ageing fixed-wire network.
The timing of the announcement reflects government anxiety over the
continuing currency crisis, despite official statements to soothe fears of a
devaluation. It had not been due until the government had persuaded the OTE
union to give the partial privatisation its full backing.
While the union now accepts the flotation in principle, it is still
demanding that most of the funds raised be reinvested in the company, 'not
poured into the black hole in the budget', as one prominent member said
yesterday.
Mr Yannos Papantoniou, economy minister, said Credit Suisse First Boston and
J Henry Schroder Wagg would be reappointed as global co-ordinators for the
issue, while National Bank of Greece, the country's largest state-controlled
bank, would handle the domestic tranche.
The two international investment banks had advised the previous Conservative
government last year on the disposal of 49 per cent of OTE through the sale
of a strategic stake to an international telecommunications operator, to be
followed by a flotation. But the agreement was suspended when the Socialists
came to power last October, promising to halt privatisation.
However, the need both to reduce a soaring public sector deficit and raise
funds for long-overdue modernisation of state corpor-ations forced the
government to reverse its policy two months ago.
With privatisation now high on the agenda, the government is also
considering a partial flotation this year of the state-controlled
corporation which controls the country's two largest oil refineries.
Pressure on the Greek currency eased yesterday, although dealers said a
holiday on German financial markets was responsible rather than the
government's announcement on OTE.
Short-term interest rates declined from last week's levels of more than 200
per cent, but the one-month offered rate remained at over 140 per cent. The
drachma improved yesterday against the US dollar, closing at Dr245.1,
against Dr247.4 on Friday.
Economists said that before interest rates could start to come down the
government would have to demonstrate a firmer commitment to fiscal reform,
by trimming spending and curbing tax evasion.
However, Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, the finance minister, said yesterday
that at present he had 'no plans to introduce supplementary budgetary
measures'.

FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Dutchman speaks out for
a federal Europe - Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands
and Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking election to the
European parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Laurens Jan Brinkhorst looks set to bring a reformist and unashamedly
federalist Dutch voice to the European parliament, writes Ronald van de Krol
in Amsterdam.
Director-general of the European Commission's environment department for the
past seven years, Mr Brinkhorst says he wants to swap his executive role for
a frontline place in what he describes as 'the battle for Europe'.
He is campaigning as No 2 on the party list for D66, a left-of-centre Dutch
party that was one of the main victors of the general election three weeks
ago.
If elected, Mr Brinkhorst says he will stand up for a 'transparent,
democratic Europe' withstanding the tendency for 'the nation state (to be)
on the rise again'.
Before his stint as one of the most influential civil servants in Brussels,
Mr Brinkhorst was the EU's ambassador to Japan. At the start of his career,
he taught European law at Dutch universities before being elected to the
Dutch parliament in the mid-1970s.
He now says he wants to serve in the Strasbourg assembly as a means of
propounding ideas on the future of Europe.
He argues that Europe is incapable of dealing with such cross-border issues
as immigration and drugs, as well as the war in Bosnia, because it is still
structured too much along national lines. He has no objections to being
described as a 'federalist'. But he adds: 'That does not mean that I want a
centralised state with centralised authority.'
He has a good chance of playing a high-profile role in the next parliament.
D66, founded in 1966 as a party dedicated to reforming politics, doubled its
seats in the Dutch parliament to 24 in the May general election, giving it
more than one-sixth of all seats. If the same voting pattern holds true for
the European election, D66 may win five out of the Netherlands' 31 European
seats.
Mr Brinkhorst believes the European parliament's agenda can be too broad. 'I
think the parliament would do well to concentrate on a few main themes.' One
of these, in his view, is deepening the European Union rather than simply
enlarging it to admit new members. Another priority is integrating national
and European politics.
In line with D66's reformist policies, the party has proposed in the
Netherlands that MEPs be given the right to speak, though not to vote, when
European affairs are discussed in committee stage in the Dutch parliament.
This would help the national parliament get a grip on what is happening at
the European level. But Mr Brinkhorst is well aware that the proposal is
controversial. 'Some MPs definitely see it as an assault on their
prerogatives.'

FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Bavarian woman aims to
win the heart of England - Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the
Netherlands and Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking
election to the European parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem an impossible task. But a 38-year-old farmer's daughter from
Bavaria could be about to pull off one of the shock victories in Britain's
Euro-elections, writes James Blitz.
Ms Gisela Gschaider, representing Labour in the seat of Worcestershire and
Warwickshire, has taken advantage of a new European law allowing EU
nationals to stand in any Union country.
The law has triggered a flurry of such candidates: in Germany a Dutch woman
is standing for the Social Democrats and in Italy a Belgian man is standing
for the Radical party. But while some of these candidates may be no-hopers,
Ms Gschaider, a vivacious woman with a strong German accent, thinks she may
be in with a chance of taking this newly created West Midlands seat.
'Two years ago it would have been unthinkable that Labour could win in such
a traditionally Conservative region like this,' she says. 'But the Tories
are doing so badly in opinion polls that a Labour victory is a real
possibility.'
Although she has lived in the UK with her English husband for 20 years, Ms
Gschaider's origins have triggered controversy in an area that is the
essence of 'middle England'. Mr John Corrie, the Conservative candidate, has
openly doubted whether people would want to elect a German as their MEP. He
said he hoped his Labour rival would enjoy 'a short sojourn in this
beautiful heart of England - until June 9'.
Gisela, as the local press call her, is not perturbed. While not emphasising
her nationality in the campaign, she still thinks that her background would
make her a particularly affective MEP.
'People do not always understand that you cannot approach European politics
from a purely national point of view,' she says. 'The politics of Brussels
have a supra-national flavour, and countries are discredited if they just
see every issue from their own point of view.'
Luck is certainly on her side in this campaign. She is standing for a party
deeply committed to European integration; the British Conservatives, who are
sharply divided over Europe, would find it much more difficult to put
forward such a candidate in a marginal seat. Nor do local people seem swayed
by the anti-German jingoism fashionable in Britain's tabloid press.
But if Ms Gschaider is to win it will ultimately depend on whether the
Labour party can repeat nationally the strong performance it showed in
recent local elections. For the moment, its campaign managers in the West
Midlands believe that the Bavarian candidate is not losing the party any
votes.

FT  24 MAY 94 / German judge who defies the laws of politics: President
Roman Herzog is both a hardliner and a liberal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roman Herzog, who last night emerged victorious as Germany's new federal
president, is a man of surprising contrasts.
For a start, as president of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe - and
therefore the country's most senior judge - he is neither ponderous nor
humourless. Although he sometimes looks alarmingly fierce in his
photographs, he is noted far more for his homely wisecracks and capacity for
self-mockery.
He came to the court from Baden-Wurttemberg, where he had enjoyed the
reputation of a hardline conservative as minister of the interior - and
promptly put his signature on a string of liberal constitutional judgments.
He is in many ways a typical bluff Bavarian, born in the heart of the
fiercely independent 'free state' at Landshut 59 years ago. Yet he belongs
to the minority Protestant church there, not the dominant Roman Catholic
majority.
His southern German style could hardly have made him more of a contrast to
his principal opponent in the presidential race, Mr Johannes Rau, the former
Social Democratic party (SPD) leader and populist premier of the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia. For all his popular touch, the latter tends to be a
lofty moralist, a protestant preacher. As for Mr Herzog, for all his lofty
legal position, he tends to present himself as one of the lads, as capable
of falling by the wayside as any fellow citizen.
His tastes appear to be thoroughly popular. He allowed himself to be
photographed in Bild Zeitung, the mass circulation newspaper, doing the
washing up (he does not own a dishwasher). Yet he is both a classical
scholar who can converse in Latin, and an expert in early Medieval history.
His nomination as presidential candidate by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union, could scarcely have been less fortunate, or more bungled.
Mr Kohl's first attempt was to promote an east German candidate, the
unfortunate Mr Steffen Heitmann, the justice minister of Saxony, who
proceeded to demonstrate such political naivete and latent conservatism that
he frightened off many of his potential supporters. Only when he was forced
to withdraw did the CSU put forward Mr Herzog - without apparently
consulting Mr Kohl. The result was continuing confusion in the ranks of the
coalition, before the judge was finally confirmed as a common candidate.
Through all of this, Mr Herzog appeared unperturbed. Like Mr Kohl himself,
he does not seem to need to be loved. But he was also perfectly clear that
he was only prepared to stand if he had solid backing from his supporters.
He began his career as a lecturer in constitutional law at the Free
University in Berlin, where he was a professor during the turbulent years
around the 1968 student revolt. He was certainly no revolutionary. He proved
his academic credentials as co-author of the standard commentary on the
German constitution.
Mr Herzog fled Berlin for the calmer waters of the national college of
administration in Speyer. It was there that he first came to the attention
of Mr Kohl, who was then state premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate, and
appointed this earthy but competent professor as his permanent
representative in Bonn in 1973. From there it was a natural progression to
becoming a full minister in neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg.
When he was nominated in 1983 to become a member of the constitutional
court, the liberals were alarmed and the conservatives delighted. He had
gained his hard-line reputation as state interior minister by ordering
demonstrators (against the deployment of US Pershing missiles) to pay for
the cost of policing their own demonstrations, and ordering the police to
use CS gas. Yet he proved a surprisingly liberal judge, in a series of
decisions on the rights of tenants, artistic freedom, and even the right to
demonstrate. As the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote
disapprovingly, the reputation of his court has become almost 'progressive'.
As a federal president, Mr Herzog will undoubtedly create his own style. The
Bavarian touch is unlikely to go down quite as easily in the international
community as the aristocratic elegance of President Richard von Weizsacker.
The greatest challenge he faces is to make himself president not just of the
west Germans, in whose traditions and constitution he is so clearly expert,
but also of the unsettled easterners.
But even if his election was the product of a typical bout of
party-political haggling, his career suggests that he will not be answerable
to anyone. He will bring the independence of the constitutional court to the
federal presidency, with a touch of the common man.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Companies warned of risks as late payments reach peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late payments due to UK companies have reached an all-time high, posing 'a
serious threat' to otherwise healthy businesses, Trade Indemnity, Britain's
largest credit insurer, said yesterday.
Companies were waiting on average for a record Pounds 145,000 in long
overdue payments from their customers in the first quarter of this year, up
from Pounds 116,000 in the same period of 1993, Trade Indemnity said.
Its survey showed that 18 per cent of invoices were 'long overdue' - unpaid
30 days after their due date. The average bill is paid 22 days beyond due
date. Smaller companies had to wait on average 28 days beyond due date for
payment.
The figures will give ammunition to calls for trade creditors to be granted
a statutory right to claim interest on overdue debts. At least 34 countries
have such measures or have agreed to introduce them.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said in his Budget speech that the government
was considering legislation on the issue.
Lord Strathclyde, the small business minister, has been considering
proposals since a consultative document closed to submissions at the end of
March. He may announce the outcome of the government's review on Thursday at
an Institute of Directors seminar on cash-flow management.
Of 822 companies surveyed by Trade Indemnity, only 2 per cent reported that
all payments due to them had been made on time, lending weight to claims by
the Forum for Private Businesses, a small business lobby group, that
companies are stalling on invoice payments in order to gain free credit.
Small companies were worst affected by the delays, with long overdue debts
to companies with turnover of less than Pounds 1m running at 3.8 per cent of
turnover. Companies with turnover in excess of Pounds 50m reported long
overdue debts equal to 0.7 per cent of turnover.
Debts also varied by industry, with construction companies reporting the
highest average of long overdue debts, at Pounds 291,640, and clothing
manufacturers the lowest, at Pounds 39,400.
The engineering sector reported an average of 25 per cent of invoices still
outstanding 30 days beyond their due date. Other industries badly affected
were textile distribution, with 27 per cent more than 30 days late, and the
paper and print industries, at 26 per cent.
An isolated area of improvement came in payments to exporters, 8 per cent of
whom reported that they were paid on time in the first quarter.

FT  24 MAY 94 / US baby food group agrees to Dollars 3.7bn bid from Sandoz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gerber Products, by far the biggest maker of baby food in the US, announced
yesterday that it had agreed to a Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) cash bid from
Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group.
The price offered - equivalent to Dollars 53 per Gerber share, more than 50
per cent above the level at which the stock closed on Friday - surprised
Wall Street analysts and appeared to be pitched at a level intended to ward
off other bidders.
It also brought excitement to the US food manufacturing sector, recently
depressed over the sales outlook for higher-priced branded goods. Shares of
other food companies such as Hershey Foods, CPC International and Quaker
Oats rose sharply.
Gerber's shares closed Dollars 15 1/2 up at Dollars 50 1/2 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Sandoz's bid comes only three weeks after its Basle-based neighbour, Roche,
offered a similarly stylish Dollars 5.3bn in cash for Syntex, a US
pharmaceuticals group. Both Swiss groups have strong net cash positions.
Gerber's sales have been flat in recent years, reflecting a decline in US
birth rates. Mr Alfred Piergallini, Gerber's chairman and chief executive,
said the board had agreed to the merger because the company's best source of
future sales growth lay overseas.
For Gerber to exploit the international prospects alone would require heavy
investment over many years, Mr Piergallini said, but joining with Sandoz
would provide Gerber with ready-made distribution channels in most big
international markets.
Sandoz already has a large nutrition business, built around Ovaltine and
Isostar drinks, various health foods and clinical nutrition products and a
small baby food line. However, only 14 per cent of the nutrition division's
SFr1.7bn (Pounds 801m) sales last year were in North America, whereas nearly
90 per cent of Michigan-based Gerber's Dollars 1.2bn sales were in its home
continent.
Mr Marc Moret, chairman of Sandoz, said Gerber's excellent image and
exceptional market strength in North America 'give us a strong base in child
nutrition on which we will expand internationally'.
Gerber is understood to have been actively seeking a suitor for several
months. Nestle, the Swiss foods group, had earlier been a strongly tipped
bidder.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Halifax expresses interest in merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax, the UK's largest building society, yesterday expressed an interest
in merging with another society, in a further sign of the growing pressure
for a restructuring of the financial services industry.
Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said Halifax wanted to be able to play its full
part in the 'radical rationalisation' of the mortgage lending industry.
'This could include a merger with another society,' he told Halifax's annual
general meeting.
With assets of Pounds 67bn, Halifax is already almost twice the size of the
next largest society, Nationwide.
In 1993 it made about 18 per cent of total net advances in the UK mortgage
market. Only Abbey National, a former society which is now a bank, lent on a
similar scale.
Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, said the society
had wanted to correct the impression that somehow it was 'standing aloof'
from possible mergers. Halifax would be interested in a merger which
increased its mortgage market share.
In this context, he made it clear that one of the changes Halifax was
seeking from the current Treasury review of building society legislation was
a relaxation of the strict rules on the bonus payments that can be made from
reserves in a merger between two societies.
The Halifax declaration introduces a further element of speculation into the
societies sector, which has been galvanised by Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn
cash offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society.
If the Lloyds bid overcomes the legal challenge which begins today in the
High Court, then it is likely to act as the trigger for other banks which
have said they would like to buy societies to press ahead with making
offers.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said that the
most attractive candidates for Halifax were likely to be Yorkshire,
Birmingham Midshires, Coventry, Derbyshire and Northern Rock - all just
outside the 10 largest societies in terms of asset size.
But he added that Halifax would have a job to persuade the management teams
running such societies of the benefits of a merger.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, has told the society's 24,000
staff, that its aim was to take a 'significantly bigger share' of mortgage
lending.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Major gives veto pledge as Euro-poll battle starts: Launch
of manifestos sees PM's record come under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night put preservation of Britain's national veto at the
heart of the Conservative campaign for the European elections as opposition
parties said the June 9 poll would be a referendum on his leadership.
The launch of the three main parties' European manifestos saw the political
truce which followed the death of Mr John Smith disintegrate into a furious
row over how much power each was ready to cede to Brussels.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat
leader, said the elections would give voters the opportunity to judge the
'dismal' record of Mr Major's government.
But at a rally last night in Bristol, Mr Major launched a bitter attack on
his opponents' European policies: 'The other parties believe in a federal
European state . . . they would put our national veto at risk.'
Using language calculated to appeal to Tory Euro-sceptics, the prime
minister insisted the Conservatives were alone in offering an absolute
commitment to preserve the national veto.
He said: 'Conservative policy will always be governed - first, last and
always - by cool calculation of Britain's national interests.'
Earlier, Mr Major had issued a plea to disgruntled Tory supporters not to
protest at the government's domestic policies by staying at home on June 9,
insisting: 'This election is not some trivial opinion poll'. The prime
minister's tone suggested that a carefully-crafted manifesto commitment to a
positive approach to Europe would be accompanied on the campaign trail by a
much tougher emphasis on the defence of British sovereignty.
Mrs Beckett rejected the charge that Labour would give up the national veto
in areas such as defence, foreign and taxation.
She said the prime minister's comments were 'nothing short of despicable'.
She added: 'He knows that he is lying about Labour's approach to the veto.
But he doesn't care.'
Mr Ashdown conceded that the Liberal Democrats would end the veto in most
areas. But he stressed his party would decentralise decision-making in the
EU.
With all three parties sensing the national mood favours sceptical rather
than enthusiastic Europeanism, the Liberal Democrats hedged their commitment
to a federal Europe with a promise of a referendum on the next stage of
integration.
Mr Major dismissed the idea, arguing the 1996 intergovernmental conference
would not lead to any further shift in sovereignty from Britain to the EU.
He said there was no prospect in the foreseeable future of a single European
currency.
But Mrs Beckett revealed a significant shift in her party's policy by
leaving open the possibility that it might back a plebiscite on the outcome
of the 1996 conference. The clearest division between the main parties was
on the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. Both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats said they would sign up immediately while Mr Major said that would
cause British job losses.
The Conservative manifesto struck a balance between underlining a commitment
to Britain's place in Europe and attacking the alleged plans of the
opposition parties to support a European superstate.
As Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, dismissed the possibility of an early
return by sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Major denied
there were any divisions within the cabinet over the government's platform.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats insisted in their manifestos that
Conservative divisions and the opt-outs from the social chapter and a single
currency had left Britain powerless on the sidelines of Europe.

<TEXT>
The Swedish pulp and paper group will almost certainly return to the black
when it announces its first-quarter figures on Thursday. Analysts are
expecting profits of up to SKr310m (Dollars 40m) after last year's SKr200m
deficit.
The improvement has been driven by higher pulp and fine paper prices, a
better performance at the company's French unit and lower financial costs.
MoDo has already indicated that it expects a 1994 profit of more than SKr1bn
after last year's SKr449m deficit.

The transport to energy conglomerate will present its 1993 results on

DM371m (Dollars 220m) reported for the previous year.
Analysts said earnings per share were forecast at about DM16, with the
dividend likely to remain unchanged at DM9. The group recently took over
Bayernwerk, Germany's third largest utilities group, and with annual
turnover of about DM40bn, it is among Germany's top 10 companies in sales

 -Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks are expected on Thursday to announce a sharp fall in profits
for the year to March. This follows aggressive write-offs of their bad debts
through the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, a bad loan purchasing
organisation set up by the banks last year.
Brokers James Capel in Tokyo predicts that the banks' transfer of bad debts
to the CCPC will total Y2,000bn (Dollars 19bn), with a further Y1,000bn
written off by the banks in straight loan-loss provisions.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Workers reject compromise on Suzuki job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at the Suzuki car factory in southern Spain dug themselves in for a
prolonged conflict yesterday, rejecting a compromise job-cutting plan agreed
between the Japanese company and Andalucia's Socialist regional government.
The plan was designed as a holding exercise during the search for a new
owner to replace Suzuki, which controls more than 80 per cent of the
loss-making Santana Motor.
The Socialist government in Madrid and the regional authorities are anxious
to defuse tension during the campaign for regional elections in three weeks.
Production of four-wheel-drive vehicles at the Santana factory in Linares
has been blocked by the conflict, which began three months ago when the
company applied for protection from creditors and announced plans to dismiss
more than 60 per cent of the 2,400-strong workforce.
The plans have provoked a fierce local reaction and a series of
demonstrations and protest marches.
Last Thursday the Santana management reluctantly agreed to a regional
government proposal to reduce the workforce at Linares and nearby La
Carolina by 900, instead of the 1,500 proposed.
The company said it was willing to support the plan 'to contribute to the
normalisation of the situation and the search for definitive solutions'.
The Andalucian government linked the plan to a proposed Pta13.6bn (Dollars
99m) loan which would be either repaid after five years or converted into
shares. However, the regional authorities said they had no vocation as
car-makers, indicating they still hoped for a new partner to take over
Santana.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Rome plans Ina selloff safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government is to take unprecedented steps to safeguard the
rights of small shareholders when it privatises Ina, the state-owned
insurance company, probably next month.
The Italian treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, is this week expected
to approve a very low ceiling on stakes held by individual shareholders, and
an innovative new voting system for electing the first directors after
privatisation.
Late on Friday night, a cabinet meeting agreed proposals to sell off Ina
before the end of June. To meet that deadline, parliament will have to
approve the plans this week.
In particular, the government will have to put pressure on the elected upper
house, where it does not have a majority.
The decision on exactly how much of Ina to sell will not be taken until
nearer the launch date. However, the government is prepared to abandon
control of the insurer. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, told
journalists that 51 per cent of the company could be sold.
When Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, the state-controlled
banks, were privatised earlier this year, a 3 per cent ceiling was set on
individual stakes.
But advocates of wider share ownership complained that the elected boards
were still dominated by large corporate investors, many of them allies of
the secretive Milan merchant bank, Mediobanca.
The Ina ceiling on shareholdings could be as low as 0.5 per cent, backed up
by a scheme which would reserve a number of seats on the board for directors
elected by small shareholders.
It is believed to be the first time such a system has been suggested. If
successful it could be used later this year for the much more sensitive
sell-off of Stet, the state telecommunications company.
The government has agreed to repay L5,500bn (Dollars 3.45bn) of compulsory
contributions which private Italian insurers were obliged to pay to Ina in
its previous role as Italy's insurer of last resort.
Ravenna magistrates are examining documents taken on Friday from Mediobanca,
relating to discussions with the ill-fated Ferruzzi-Montedison group last
year.
The Guardia di Finanza, Italy's financial police, spent seven hours
searching for documents, which may throw light on how much Mediobanca knew
about the 'hole' in the 1992 accounts of its main industrial subsidiary,
Montedison, which helped precipitate the collapse of Ferruzzi. Mediobanca
co-ordinated the complex restructuring of the group.

Wednesday: The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, gives evidence
on the Bank and the UK economy to the Treasury select committee.
UK gross domestic product figures are expected to confirm an earlier
estimate that the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter.
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research publishes its latest
economic forecast.
Friday: The Confederation of British Industry's monthly industrial trends
survey will provide further evidence of the strength of the UK recovery. One
key indicator will be domestic orders, which may have been affected by
April's tax increases, but analysts will also scrutinise the balance of
companies which intend to raise prices. Previous surveys have shown little
sign of inflationary pressure.
Japanese inflation has been phenomenally low for some time, but Morgan
Grenfell is expecting the Tokyo May data to disappoint, with the annual rate
moving up to 1.2 per cent. The market consensus, however, is 0.8 per cent,
both for the May Tokyo figure and for the April whole nation inflation rate.

MONDAY 23
Germany elects president
The federal assembly, composed half of members of the federal parliament
(the Bundestag) and half of deputies from the 12 state parliaments
(Landtage) convenes in Berlin to choose Germany's next state president. The
quest for a successor to the distinguished Richard von Weizsacker (above)
looks set to go through three full rounds of voting.
Roman Herzog, president of the constitutional court, is Chancellor Kohl's
choice, and the man most likely to succeed. But Johannes Rau, the Social
Democrats' nominee, is the popular choice, and could yet give him a run for
his money.
Nigerian democracy: Local polling begins in Nigeria to elect 270 delegates
to the national constitutional conference, due on June 27.
Campaigners for democracy have denounced the conference as a sham, as a ban
on all political parties and associations is in force until 1995. Large
parts of southern Nigeria are expected to boycott the polls and the
conference.
UK economy: The deficit with non-European Union countries is expected to
have widened slightly to Pounds 700m in April, from Pounds 675m in March.
While the UK's trade deficit has been broadly stable in money terms over the
past few months, the trend of import and export volumes has deteriorated.
Some analysts see that as a worrying sign, although doubts remain over the
accuracy of the figures, particularly the price/volume split.
Crimea: Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, meets Ukrainian
counterpart, Yefim Zvyagilsky, in Moscow to discuss the worsening situation
in Crimea. The Crimean parliament voted on Friday for virtual independence
from Ukraine.
Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, is also in Moscow to meet Mr
Chernomyrdin and Russian president Boris Yeltsin.
Romania issues a 10,000 lei (USDollars 6) banknote after three years of
triple digit inflation. Before the end of communism in 1989, the largest
denomination banknote was 100 lei.
Tennis: The French Open begins at Stade Roland Garros in Paris (to June 5).
Holidays: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland (Whit Monday). Canada (Victory
Day). Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, (Eid al-Adha).

TUESDAY 24
Russia outlines Nato policy
General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, visits Nato headquarters
in Brussels. He will give a speech which is expected to present Russia's new
military doctrine and lay out the terms on which his country wants to
co-operate with Nato in such areas as peace-keeping and the exchange of
know-how.
Baltic Council foreign ministers gather for a two-day meeting in the
Estonian capital, Tallinn. Worsening relations between Estonia and Russia
will be on the agenda. The ministers will also discuss joint initiatives
including the so-called 'Eurofaculty', the Riga-based university
specialising in law and economics, and the Via Baltica motorway to link
Helsinki and Warsaw.
The Council, set up in 1992, includes Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the European
Commission.
South African president Nelson Mandela makes a state of the nation speech to
a joint session of the two houses in the new all-race parliament. Following
a cabinet meeting on Monday he is due to set out plans for spending on
reconstruction and development.
EU fraud: Jo Carey, a former official in the UK Treasury who worked for nine
years at European Court of Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog, is quizzed
at Westminster by the House of Lords European Affairs Committee on the
extent of EU fraud.
UK competitiveness: Plans to privatise the Civil Aviation Authority's air
traffic control services are expected to feature in a government white paper
on competitiveness out today.
BBC strike: A series of twice-weekly strikes by journalists and technicians
starting today could hit the programmes of both BBC World Service Radio and
World Service Television as well as live programmes in the UK. The stoppages
could last for 24 hours - or 10 minutes.
The immediate cause of the dispute is plans for performance-related pay and
for different rates of overtime pay and allowances in different parts of the
Corporation.
Chelsea Flower Show:
ticultural Society's annual bash opens to members, after a royal gala
opening on Monday. Open to non-members from Thursday. It finishes on Friday.

Greenspan on derivatives
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, today give evidence to a
Congressional hearing about the impact of derivatives on financial markets.
Last week, regulation of derivatives (financial instruments such as swaps
and options) was criticised in a report to Congress from the General
Accounting Office. The report said that inadequate regulation posed a threat
to the US and international financial system.
Argentina's constituent assembly convenes to begin rewriting the country's
constitution. The main aim is to lift the 1853 constitution's ban on
successive presidential terms, allowing President Carlos Menem (below) to
stand for re-election next year.
An agreement that Mr Menem's Peronist party signed with ex-president Raul
Alfonsn's opposition Radical party last December ensures that this and other
reforms strengthening the legislature and judiciary will be passed by a big
majority.
Energy ministers from the European Union meet in Brussels to discuss the
direction of energy policy. They will discuss energy liberalisation and the
introduction of competition into the supply of electricity.
Nato defence ministers consider the future of the alliance against a
background of uncertainty over its post-cold war role. There are differences
over Nato's role in Bosnia, and over how far it should go in extending
security guarantees to former members of the Warsaw Pact.
Labour's National Executive Committee meets in London to decide the timing
of the leadership contest following the death of John Smith.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange holds a general meeting to elect Mitsuhide
Yamaguchi, ex-president of the Export-Import Bank of Japan as president.
UK National Lottery: The winner of the contest to run a lottery that could
have revenues of Pounds 3bn-Pounds 4bn within the next few years will be
announced. Bids were accepted from eight consortia for the private sector
lottery, designed to raise money for the arts, charities, a millennium fund,
the national heritage and sport.

THURSDAY 26
Quest for a stable Europe
Foreign ministers from most European countries, the US and Russia are
expected in Paris for the formal opening by France's prime minister Edouard
Balladur of 'the conference on European stability' (to May 27). Mr Balladur
proposed the idea a year ago as a means of trying to prevent 'a second
Yugoslavia' in other parts of central and eastern Europe. The aim of the
conference, chaired by the EU presidency, is for countries to reach accords
of 'good neighbourliness', settling frontier and minority differences.
Finns into Europe: Two decisions affecting Finland's hopes of joining the EU
next January will be taken today. The government will set a date for a
referendum on EU membership, and decide on how to compensate the country's
agriculture and food industries for adjusting to EU price levels.
The poll is likely to be in October before similar votes in Sweden and
Norway. This would secure the voting sequence seen as the best way of
bringing all three Nordic states into the EU. Support for membership is
strongest in Finland and weakest in Norway.
Russia's foreign minister Victor Chernomyrdin begins a trip to Beijing (to
May 29) to discuss trade and security issues, including North Korea's
reluctance to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
The Bundesbank council's last meeting, on May 11, saw a cut of half a
percentage point in the key Lombard and discount rates, to 4.5 and 6 per
cent respectively. As a result, traders are not expecting today's meeting to
lead to a rate change, especially after Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank
president, said last week that 'as far as central bank interest rates are
concerned, the horizon has now been cleared for a fairly long time'.
Saleroom: Sotheby's auction of musical manuscripts contains a great rarity:
a small calf bound volume containing the only keyboard music surviving in
the hand of Henry Purcell, the late 17th century English composer. Found
last year in another auction house in a bundle of music, it is considered to
be the greatest British musical discovery of recent years.
Among the 21 pieces are hitherto unknown works and Sotheby's anticipates
bids around Pounds 300,000. Purcell is one of the few British composers with
an international reputation, and attributed music of this early date is
extremely rare.
FT Surveys: International Capital Markets and Brazil.
FRIDAY 27
Solzhenitsyn returns home
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Russia's greatest living writer, returns home after
20 years in exile.
The 75-year-old Nobel laureate will fly to Vladivostok from Alaska and then
travel across Russia to re-acquaint himself with his homeland.
Fed chairman Alan Greenspan testifies on monetary policy before a
Congressional hearing.
The same morning the US Commerce Department releases preliminary GDP figures
for the first quarter. Little change is expected from its initial estimates
of 2.4 per cent.
The Keidanren, Japan's Federation of Economic Organisations, holds a general
meeting to elect Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, as its new chairman.
Bath Music festival begins (to June 12). The theme 'Ancient Echoes' links
modern music with music of the past. Henryk Gorecki and Michael Nyman are
the featured 20th-century composers.
FT Surveys: Relocation in the UK.
Holidays: Sri Lanka.
WEEKEND 28-29
Hungary goes to the polls
The second and decisive round of Hungary's parliamentary elections takes
place on Sunday. The Hungarian Socialist Party, successor to the communist
regime, took a commanding lead in the first round and is poised to win an
absolute majority.
Colombians vote in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday. If
no candidate wins a majority, there will be a run-off on June 19. Opinion
polls put the Liberal Ernesto Samper and the Conservative Andres Pastrana
very close, with the other candidates trailing far behind.
Glyndebourne Opera House, near Lewes in Sussex, re-opens on Saturday in its
new Pounds 33m auditorium with a performance of Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro,
the opera with which it was launched 60 years ago.
Motor racing: The Spanish Grand Prix takes place in Barcelona, while the

FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Analysts still wary of Fed 'neutrality' -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The response from UK stock market analysts to the Federal Reserve's eagerly
anticipated rate rises sounded somewhat muted by the end of the week,
particularly when contrasted with the applause which preceded the move.
Confident predictions that the Fed had set the stage for a rally in global
bond markets which would set London stocks free to celebrate economic
recovery are now carrying the health warning: 'dollar permitting'.
Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, who is still the most bearish of the
UK analysts, has told clients bluntly that the US bond rally would not hold
and that the dollar's failure was beginning 'to look terminal'; this
scenario implies sharply higher US rates, he warns.
London markets have shown themselves more readily influenced than
continental European markets by developments in the US, and Mr Knight
remains pessimistic about interest rate trends in the UK 'and the impact of
rising rates on equity prices'.
Nikko Securities rejects the assumption that the Fed's statement implies
that it has 'achieved neutrality', and believes the Fed remains willing to
raise rates further if need be.
The chances of the Footsie climbing convincingly away from 3,150 this week
will depend on the progress of the bond markets, and of course, the dollar.
But since the Fed is unlikely to move again so soon after last week's
broadside, share prices can still respond to good news.
The broader market remains weak, however. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index has fallen
almost 2 per cent this month, contrasting with an admittedly unimpressive
0.3 per cent gain in the FT-SE 100 Index.
Nervousness ahead of the German money supply figures may prove a distraction
for the UK market. There are plenty of healthy company results in the
pipeline, with building industry groups likely to show the beneficial
effects of the slide in UK interest rates over the past 12 months.
The oil share sector continues to have a significant impact on market
trends, if only because of the international stance of the blue chip stocks
and the background of global crude oil prices.
Indeed, oil prices are probably the most significant factor in the
Enterprise/Lasmo bid situation. But excellent first-quarter results from BP
and some US majors should not overshadow the impact of the 24 per cent rise
in oil prices since the end of March.
The NatWest Securities oil team believes the market may now have seen the
largest part of the oil price recovery and while some further increase is
likely, emphasis may now shift to such other factors as the squeeze on
downstream margins.
NatWest says that BP, notwithstanding its recent outperformance of around 22
per cent to the market, remains 15 to 20 per cent below its relative
standing to Shell in the late 1980s. The unexpected increased BP dividend
will emphasise the pressure to switch from Shell into BP.

ZURICH
Holderbank holds its press conference and analysts' meeting on Wednesday at
which a breakdown of 1993 results, and projections for 1994 will be given. A
raft of annual meetings is scheduled for the week, beginning with
Oerlikon-Buhrle tomorrow, with Ascom, Nestle and Rieter on Thursday and
Forbo on Friday. A CS Holding roadshow will be in Edinburgh on Wednesday and
in Frankfurt on Friday. The Swiss bank has expressed an interest in buying a
20 to 30 per cent stake in Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein with an option
to take control later.
FRANKFURT
Among a range of economic data due this week are April M3, which Nomura
forecasts to rise by an annualised 13.5 per cent, and preliminary cost of
living figures. The Bundesbank meets on Thursday but no move on rates is
expected after the half-point cuts in the discount and Lombard rates last
time. James Capel does, however, expect another reduction before the bank's
summer recess, which begins after the July 21 meeting. Full-year figures
come from Kaufhof, the retailer, and Viag on Wednesday. In March, Viag paid
DM2.3bn in cash, plus a minority blocking stake of 25.1 per cent in the
enlarged Viag group, to take full control of Bayernwerk, Bavaria's
state-owned electricity utility, in a deal described as Germany's biggest
privatisation to date.
AMSTERDAM
Nedlloyd publishes 1994 first-quarter figures on Thursday. Hoare Govett says
that the operating results before extraordinary items are known to show a
loss of Fl 57m for shipping, profits of Fl 9m for European transport and Fl
8m for other activities. Over the year, the broker expects a strong
improvement from the shipping side while the transport and other activities
could be down. Overall, operating profit and net profit should be up
substantially and Hoare Govett is forecasting earnings per share of Fl 5.35
for the current year and Fl 8.90 for 1995.
TOKYO
Investors are continuing to focus on the currency market after confidence
improved last week, as domestic institutions gradually moved back into the
equity market. However, many investors are still wary over selling with the
Nikkei index standing between 20,500 and 21,000, and the upside is expected
to be limited.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Bold strike on interest rates well received
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street is looking forward to a week of quiet reflection, a welcome
break from three months of anxious anticipation about rising interest rates.
It is ironic, perhaps, but equity investors, inherently concerned about
tighter money, found reassurance in the Federal Reserve's aggressiveness
last week. On Tuesday, the central bank decided to increase two key
short-term rates by 50 basis points each.
Gradualism, it seems, was not to the liking of a market which hates
surprises. Instead of fostering a measure of predictability, the central
bank's three previous increases in its Fed Funds target - at 25 basis points
each - served to heighten concern about when the next move was coming.
Last week's bold strike - accompanied by a statement suggesting the Fed had
achieved its goal of moving to a policy which would neither encourage nor
discourage growth - gives stocks some breathing room. Most analysts expect
share prices to hold fairly steady in the next few trading sessions, as the
market digests a net gain of 107 points in the Dow industrials on the week.
'The market is going to move sideways - without much direction - while
waiting to assess the situation,' says Peter Cardillo, head of research at
Westfalia Investments in New York.
How stocks will perform after their pause is more controversial, however. Mr
Cardillo sees the market waiting until next week's employment data before
staging any push upward. But it is likely that the evidence will continue to
point to low inflation, he says, supporting bond prices and 'setting the
stage for a strong summer rally that will take stocks to new highs'.
While William Raftery, technical analyst at Smith Barney Shearson in New
York, agrees that share prices will finish this week with little change, he
is decidedly more bearish about the intermediate outlook. 'Last week was a
brief rally. Just as in a bull market there are pull-backs, in bear markets
there are corrective cycles,' he says. 'They look nice for a week, but then
they trip you up.' Citing underlying technical conditions and historical
trends, he argues that the Dow Jones Industrial Average is heading below the
3,400 level by late summer.
Mr Gregory Nie at Kemper Securities in Chicago, takes a more positive view
but remains circumspect about a sustained upturn. Although the strong
suggestion by the Fed that it had reached a neutral policy has coaxed many
investors out of their foxholes, Mr Nie says there is still some danger of
further rate rises in the near term. The continuing rise in commodity prices
and the persistent weakness of the dollar could force yet another move to
tighter money, despite expectations to the contrary.
He discounts the chances of stocks breaking out of their trading range on
technical grounds. He says the market has moved into an 'overbought'
condition and cash reserves remain low.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Globex highlights race for lucrative
after-hours trade - Risk and reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest episode in the Globex saga has highlighted the strong belief
among the world's leading futures exchanges that there is demand for, and
money to be made in, after-hours trading.
The million-dollar question is whether Globex will be able to secure a
significant slice of this potentially lucrative market or find itself
squeezed out by more nimble competitors.
Although Globex was dealt a humiliating blow last week by Liffe, London's
financial futures and options exchange, when it decided against joining the
system because of the restrictive terms which Globex had laid down, its
future brightened considerably a few days later when DTB, Frankfurt's
financial futures and options exchange, said it intended to join the system.
DTB is the third exchange to join Globex, the electronic futures trading
system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news
group, along with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Matif, the French
futures exchange. 'The future of Globex has cleared up a lot,' says a
spokeswoman at Matif. 'There was no clear commitment before, but now there
is.'
Now that the uncertainty hanging over the system has been dispelled and its
configuration has been clarified, one would expect Globex to speed up DTB's
entry into the system. But DTB still needs to sign a contractual agreement
with Globex, which could take weeks, and then it could take up to a year for
its products to be listed on the system.
This lack of urgency on Globex's part could play directly into the hands of
other exchanges which are considering alternative after-hours electronic
trading systems.
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT), which pulled out of Globex last month,
expects its 'Project A' electronic trading system to start in August. Mr
Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, says the initial aim of Project A is to
operate in the afternoon after the exchange's morning open-outcry session
has ended and before the evening session starts. The system is scheduled to
start operating through the night by the autumn.
CBoT also has an agreement in principle with Bloomberg Financial Services
which would give users with Bloomberg terminals access to its products.
Since this is a non-exclusive pact, CBoT is free to find other potential
distributors of its products.
There are also indications that CBoT and Liffe, which already have a close
relationship and similar business strategies, are exploring ways to work
together. The chairmen of the two exchanges are due to meet later this week.
Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe chief executive, does not rule out linkages of some
kind between the two exchanges, such as fungible links between identical
contracts. 'All these exciting projects would have been off-limits had we
joined Globex,' says Mr Hodson.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe chairman, said last week that Liffe's after-pit
trading could easily be extended by two hours, thus taking it to the end of
the Chicago morning trading session of 2pm Chicago time. Liffe may also
extend its network overseas, following the successful installation of its
screens in New York.
Mr Hodson says that while these steps would not pose a problem on the
technological front, they could be held up by considerations such as market
supervision and the impact on the London Clearing House. 'But these hurdles
are not insuperable,' he says.
But the Matif spokeswoman says that the links established between three of
the world's most important exchanges and their combined political will
should ensure a successful future for Globex.

FT  23 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Revived convertible gilt faces the acid
test - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday, the Bank of England will auction a new convertible government
bond, the first since 1987. The revival of this special breed of gilt has
proved to be controversial. Welcomed by some, it has had a frosty reception
from others, who are frustrated by what they see as the government's
persistent refusal to turn to conventional long-dated gilts for its funding
needs.
A convertible gilt is a short-dated bond which can be exchanged for a
specified long-dated gilt at a fixed price some time in the future. The
conversion dates occur at six-monthly intervals and the terms worsen
slightly at each date.
The convertible gilts auctioned by the Bank of England on Wednesday, worth a
total of Pounds 2bn, will have a coupon of 7.0 per cent, coming to maturity
in August 1997. Investors will be able to convert it into 9.0 per cent 2012
bonds, for the first time on August 6.
The attraction of such an investment vehicle for lenders is that it allows
them to participate in more than one area of the gilt market. It therefore
provides a useful hedge when yields, particularly at the long end, are
volatile.
If, for example, yields fall, then investors may exercise their option of
converting to the longer bond and so benefit from the rising market; if on
the other hand yields rise, they will be protected by only being exposed to
the fall in value of the short-dated bond.
This special property of the new gilt may be particularly attractive to
investors now, given the recent financial market turbulence. Institutions
may be worried about committing themselves to long gilts but are also afraid
of missing out if bond markets do recover sharply once the threat of further
rises in US interest rates has receded.
The appeal for the borrower, in this case the government, is that it does
not have to commit itself to the high yields currently being seen on
long-dated gilts. Issuing a bond at such yields would cost the government
more in terms of interest payments than a short-dated gilt.
Bond markets have been extremely volatile since February, when the US
Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in a pre-emptive strike on
inflation. Investors took fright, sensing a turning point in world rates,
and bond prices plummeted. The UK market has been one of the worst affected:
gilts yields have climbed 1 1/2 percentage points since February.
But the Bank of England believes the bond market reaction has been
exaggerated. It is much more optimistic about inflation and prefers to wait
until long-term yields come down before issuing long-dated gilts.
Some investors, however, doubt whether funding at the short-end still has
many advantages over selling long-dated bonds and they think such a policy
may in fact be damaging to the government's funding programme.
'The Bank's policy is distorting the yield curve,' according to Mr Michael
Saunders, UK economist at American bank Salomon Brothers.
Analysts complain that yields on short-dated gilts have been pushed up so
much and the yield curve has flattened to such an extent under the sheer
weight of the Bank's own funding that it is no longer making any clear cost
savings by issuing short-dated rather than long-dated bonds.
They also say that the Bank's policy adds to the uncertainty that an
investor faces, which acts as a deterrent at the margin.
'Investors already have to predict inflation and interest rates. If on top
of that they have to guess funding policy as well, they may just go and buy
French bonds,' said Mr Saunders.
Last year banks, building societies and overseas investors were keen to buy
short-dated gilts. But this year many of them have turned to fixed-rate
mortgages, which in terms of exposure to long-term interest rates are
similar to a short-dated bond. Yet despite the decline in demand, the Bank
has persisted with its tactic of funding at the short end. Gilts, analysts
say, are falling into a vacuum.
But officials say this type of funding suits the government's borrowing
needs; issuing longer-dated bonds would simply commit the government to
paying higher yields and would be too expensive. They say, and some City
analysts agree, that there will be more than enough demand for the new
convertible bond, particularly among domestic banks, building societies and
domestic fund management institutions.
But the new convertible issue may be a sign that the Bank of England is
beginning to find it difficult to attract demand for short-dated gilts.
Perhaps the biggest problem the new issue will face is the difficulty
investors may have in deciding on a price. When details of the auction were
announced last week, they were greeted with stunned silence as analysts
tried to make sense of it. 'There is no other stock like it in the market,'
analysts complained.
Whether the new gilt will find favour with the market will become apparent
on Wednesday, although the debate it has provoked may not end there.

likely to decline further this week due to the Bank of Japan's continued
easy stance on short-term money market rates.
The central bank still remains cautious on the economy and the negative
effects of a higher yen on corporate profits. The bank said last week that
economic conditions had stopped deteriorating but there was no evidence yet
of a recovery.
Such concerns are expected to be confirmed this week, with industrial
production figures indicating a fall in output in April, and pointing to a
decline in the second quarter. Retail sales figures for April and March
household spending are expected to confirm that consumer confidence remains
weak.
James Capel in Tokyo forecasts a 2.5 per cent decline in industrial
production for the first quarter of the current calendar year and a 1.5 per
cent fall for the April to June quarter.
Although such negative sentiment towards the economy has recently been
factored into bond prices, further evidence of a delayed recovery is likely
to support confidence among bond market participants.
Meanwhile the consumer price index to be released Friday should reflect
subdued inflationary pressures.

FT  23 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Political uncertainty plagues Spain -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spate of corruption scandals which cost several Spanish government
officials their jobs and sparked fears of early elections recently sent
Spanish government bonds plummeting, and while the bond market is expected
to stage a cautious recovery in coming months, it is likely to remain
plagued by continuing political uncertainty.
At the height of political turmoil, the yield on the Spanish 10-year
benchmark bond shot up to 9.8 per cent, its spread over Germany widening to
around 310 basis points. And although prices stabilised last week, with the
yield gap narrowing back to around 290 basis points, many analysts argue
that, in the light of the country's positive economic fundamentals, further
gains are likely.
Moreover, some of them say that Italian bonds, which rallied sharply after
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's victory in the recent elections, are now overvalued
in relation to Spain.
'The optimism in Italy has gone too far, just as the pessimism in Spain has
been overdone,' says Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at Barclays
de Zoete Wedd. Since Italy's elections, 'the political risk has shifted from
Italy to Spain, but some of it has got to shift back to Italy'.
Italy has an entirely new political system which has yet to be tested, she
says. 'There is still a lot of disagreement within the right wing coalition
and we would not rule out another general election within the next year,'
she cautions. While Spanish politics are a mess, 'the most we are talking
about is an early general election, not the overhaul of the entire system',
she adds.
However, it is precisely the uncertainty of a possible early election that
could cast a dark shadow over Spain's bond market, warns Mr Giorgio
Radaelli, senior economist at Lehman Brothers. Mr Felipe Gonzales'
government so far has survived the scandals, with the aid of its 17 Catalan
coalition partners. Their support would crumble if new revelations arose
that could cause cabinet embarrassment and ministerial resignations, he
says.
'Obviously, no one knows when and if that will be the case, but this very
uncertainty argues for investor caution until the government is seen to be
firmly back in the driving seat.' June 12 will be crunch-time for the
Spanish government, featuring regional elections in Andalucia -
traditionally a stronghold of Mr Gonzales' socialist PSOE party - and
European Parliament elections. While the PSOE is expected to win a majority
in Andalucia, 'a slim victory could be seen as a setback', says Mr Jose Luis
Alzola, southern Europe economist at Salomon Brothers. Also, recent opinion
polls have indicated a PSOE defeat in the European elections. All this could
increase the risk of early general elections later this year, even though
the current term expires only in 1997.
However, early elections could bolster market sentiment if the conservative
Popular Party (PP) won. A PP-led government would likely emphasise spending
restraint and privatisations, as well as fostering greater labour market
flexibility and liberalising key services sectors, Mr Alzola says.
Politics aside, Spain's fundamentals of slowing inflation, continued fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms warrant further gains in the bond
market, many say.
For the first four months of the year, the government's cumulative deficit
was Pta599bn - about 20 per cent below the figure for the same period last
year - boosted largely by a jump in tax revenues.
Meanwhile, inflation is at its lowest level in years. The core rate fell to
4.6 per cent in April from 4.9 per cent in March, and is expected to slow to
around 4 per cent by year-end. Last week's approval of the government's
labour market reforms will ease wage pressures permanently, further reducing
long-term inflation expectations, Mr Alzola says.
Political problems notwithstanding, fundamentals are expected to lend the
market longer-term support, and both Mr Alzola and Ms Reed at BZW expect the
10-year Bono spread over bunds to narrow towards 200 basis points by
year-end.
Mr Radaelli, however, says long-term exposure to Spanish bonds should be
avoided as long as political uncertainty prevails, warning that any more
scandals could send the spread over bunds widening back beyond 300 basis
points and the peseta tumbling.
The Kingdom of Spain on Friday issued FFr6bn of 6 1/2 per cent seven-year
eurobonds, priced to yield 24 basis points over the corresponding French
government bond. Lead manager was Credit Lyonnais.

Gilts have rallied over the past couple of weeks, helped by a general upturn
in the international bond market, and there is little on the horizon this
week to suggest a setback is in the offing.
The central event of the week will be the convertible auction on Wednesday
(see article below). According to Mr Ian Shepherdson of HSBC Greenwell, the
issue is likely to have some appeal to domestic investors.
There are few important economic statistics due, although the Confederation
of British Industry's survey, published on Friday, may give further
indications of the impact of April's tax increases on the recovery.
Last week's figures provided some contradictory evidence on inflation, with
the rise in average earnings outweighing the good news of a fall in the
annual rate of underlying inflation.
The market sees the earnings figures as an indicator of future inflationary
problems, while the retail prices index merely reflects the past.
With little on the domestic agenda to affect the market, the main danger may
come from the US first-quarter gross domestic product figures on Friday.
Too strong a GDP number would inevitably upset the Treasury bond market,
with the normal knock-on effect on gilts.

Investors are likely to return from today's public holiday to be confronted
with the figures for German M3 money supply growth in April. Due early this
week, the data could unsettle the market.
Expectations had been that the annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of
growth would sink to 13 per cent in April after 15.4 per cent in the
previous month.
But an article in last Friday's Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper suggested
that the figure may prove to be above the March outcome.
If this proves to be the case, the Bundesbank's chances of hitting its 4 to
6 per cent target for monetary growth for the year as a whole will recede
still further. And the Bundesbank's new policy - introduced this month with
the half percentage point cut in the discount and Lombard rates - of using
interest rate cuts to reduce M3 growth will look more of a gamble than ever,
although of course these cuts were too late to influence the April data.
If the M3 data dampens investors' enthusiasm for bunds, this may be revived
by a good inflation figure for May.
Due to be announced at the end of the week, the figure could be down to an
annual rate of below 3 per cent at last. Coupled with a strong D-Mark, this
could revive hopes of further rate cuts.

The bond market looks as if it may be in for something it has not
experienced for a long time: a quiet week.
Last week, the market first agonised over whether the Federal Reserve would
put up interest rates, then celebrated when the central bank did just that.
By the week's end, the yield on the long bond had dropped from 7.5 per cent
to below 7.3 per cent, and the mood of the market was upbeat. There was even
talk that the 30-year yield might dip below 7 per cent within a few weeks if
recent increases in interest rates begin to take their toll on the pace of
economic activity.
In contrast, this week should allow traders' and investors' nerves to
settle. There is little in the way of important economic news due to be
released until Wednesday, when the April durable goods report is scheduled
for publication. Brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts that
durable goods rose 1 per cent last month, which looks strong but is unlikely
to overly worry the market because the data is notoriously unreliable.
The only other release of note will be Friday's update of the first-quarter
gross domestic product estimate. GDP was originally estimated to have grown
by 2.6 per cent but a downward revision in the number is expected. DLJ
predicts revised GDP growth of 2 per cent.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Arab world opens arms for investment - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the emerging market investor looking for something slightly off-beat, a
new country fund is due to be launched this week which, for the first time,
will allow foreign equity investment in the Gulf.
The Dollars 50m Oryx Fund in Oman is jointly managed by London-based
Blakeney Management and the Oman National Insurance company in Muscat. It
will have exclusive six month access to the Muscat securities market, which
has 62 listed stocks, a market capitalisation of some Dollars 1.5bn and an
annual turnover of about Dollars 200m.
The fund will be listed in both Muscat and London, and while 51 per cent of
the capital will be raised domestically in Oman through the Al Ahlia
Portfolio company, the rest will be open to international investors through
Baring Securities in the UK.
Managers hope eventually to see the foreign portion of the fund raised and
its scope expanded to include other markets in the region, such as Bahrain.
The Arab world has been largely excluded from the wave of foreign funds
flowing into stock markets of developing countries.
Out of an estimated Dollars 52bn of cross border equity flows invested in
emerging markets worldwide in 1993, the small bourses of the Middle East,
north Africa, and the Gulf states attracted less than 2 per cent, according
to Barings, compared to more than 38 per cent invested in Latin America and
58 per cent in the Pacific Rim.
This, however, is set to change as projects like the Oryx Fund put the
region under increasing scrutiny by emerging market investors.
Spurred by favourable developments in the Middle East peace process and an
increasing acceptance among Arab governments that barriers to foreign
investment must be removed, international securities houses are showing
considerable enthusiasm for the region's prospects.
The market which has attracted most attention so far is Morocco. Having
co-operated closely with the International Monetary Fund, the kingdom is
virtually free of its debt burden and is undergoing rapid economic growth
accompanied by low inflation.
Last month Solomon Brothers Asset Management of the US launched the first
Morocco country fund, worth Dollars 60m, in conjunction with Omnium Nord
Africa, the Moroccan conglomerate.
The fund is aimed at equity investments in listed stocks on the Casablanca
exchange, which has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 4.4bn, 68
listed companies, and an average monthly turnover of Dollars 65m. It is well
placed to take advantage of the kingdom's privatisation programme which
began last summer and is by far the fastest in the region.
The government aims to divest Dollars 2bn worth of state assets by the end
of 1995, and so far all offerings in more than 50 companies have been
oversubscribed by both local and international investors.
Also in north Africa, Tunisia and Egypt are seen as offering similar
opportunities to Morocco with a government commitment to IMF-guided
liberalisation policies and a desire, albeit cautious, to attract foreign
capital through privatisation. Currently their tiny stock markets are at
pre-emerging, rather than emerging stages, with little in the way of scrip
to be traded.
Tunisia has a market capitalisation of only Dollars 1.2bn and 19 listed
companies, while Egypt, misleadingly, has 674 stocks of which only about 15
are actively traded. However, capital market reforms have recently been put
in place in both countries and international investors are waiting in
anticipation for state assets to come up for sale.
Further east, one of the most sophisticated and liquid capital markets in
the region is Jordan. The Amman financial market is attracting a surprising
level of outside interest despite the lack of any firm commitment from the
government towards privatisation.
It has a strong domestic base with about 100,000 local investors, far more
than any other market in the region, and is well regulated. Buoyed by two
successive years of strong real economic growth, sustained government
commitment to IMF reforms and high domestic liquidity, the market peaked
last year and has since levelled out. Average monthly turnover in 1994 is
about Dollars 60m, compared to Dollars 110m in 1993. The exchange has 100
listed stocks and a market capitalisation of some Dollars 5.2bn.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, the equity culture has yet to catch on,
although it may only be a matter of time before it does so. Syria's
government has been toying with the idea of a stock market as part of its
self-administered economic reforms and a draft bill for its establishment is
awaiting submission to the People's Assembly. The Palestinians, having only
been granted limited self-rule this month, are now talking of establishing a
bourse in the West Bank; and Lebanon's plans to re-open the Beirut stock
exchange, which was closed in 1983 at the peak of its civil war, are finally
ready for implementation.
The successful Dollars 650m Arab-only share offering in Solidere, the
company established to rebuild downtown Beirut, has created the basis upon
which the Lebanese government will restart what many international brokers
consider likely to be the Middle East's most promising market. Andersen
Consultants in London has completed work on creating a secondary market in
the Dollars 1.8bn company's shares and official trading is due to begin in
June. Although shares in Solidere are closed to non-Arab investors, other
private companies which are expected to come to the market will be totally
open to foreigners.
In anticipation of this, IFC - a Washington-based arm of the World Bank - is
already talking of an investment fund for Lebanon which will be used for
equity participation in small and medium-sized companies which will
eventually be listed. And a number of leading international securities
houses are already positioning themselves for business in Beirut.
In the Gulf, Oman stands alone in allowing foreign investors access to its
stock exchange, although Bahrain is currently looking at ways of easing its
restrictions. The substantial stock market in Saudi Arabia, with a
capitalisation of Dollars 50bn, along with the United Arab Emirates and
Kuwait, however, remain closed for the time being. But many analysts believe
that depressed oil prices, diminishing state revenues and the need to
attract foreign capital into non-oil industrial ventures will eventually
spur an opening up.
The World Bank forecasts regional economic growth in the Arab world over the
next 10 years to be higher than at any time since the 1970s oil boom. In the
period 1994-2003, real regional GDP will grow by a yearly average of 3.8 per
cent, compared to only 0.4 per cent in the 1980s. Add to this the large sums
of money held by Arabs outside the region which will be attracted home as
stock markets develop - more than Dollars 350bn according to one analyst at
the IFC - and the Arab world looks like an emerging market waiting to
happen.

Currency markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges will be focusing this week on the release of the April
German M3 figure for an indication of the likely future path of German, and
European, interest rates.
Markets were awash last week with rumours of another poor figure - M3 grew
by 15.4 per cent in March, way beyond the Bundesbank's 2-6 per cent target
range - which would probably slow the pace of monetary easing.
These fears come in the wake of comments made last week by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, that recent German rate cuts had
'cleared the horizon for the next few months'.
The market took this to mean that the central bank will probably slow the
pace of German rate cuts. German rates, which set the level for most
European interest rates, have fallen fairly briskly in recent weeks. The
repo rate is 5.23 per cent, down from 6 per cent three months ago. Although
the Bundesbank has been fairly cavalier in the attention it has recently
given to M3, it runs the risk of damaging its credibility if it continues to
cut rates against the background of ongoing, and substantial, overshoots in
an important monetary indicator. As a result, there is little anticipation
of any move in rates at this week's Bundesbank council meeting.
If the market's suspicions prove correct, this is likely to bolster the
D-Mark and put renewed pressure on the dollar. It may be that the central
banks will again be called on to support the dollar, as they did earlier
this month. Last Friday the dollar was slipping back towards the levels that
prompted the previous bout of intervention, despite recent favourable moves
in German and US interest rates.
US data releases this week include April durable goods orders, and the
revised first quarter GDP figure. These are unlikely to have important
currency implications, as the Fed has implied that no rate increases are
likely in the near term.
In Europe attention is likely to stay with Greece where the drachma is under
speculative attack. Short-term interest rates have risen as high as 500 per
cent, as banks have sought to defend the currency, but most analysts regard
devaluation as inevitable.
In the UK, the market is likely to focus on Friday's release of the CBI
monthly trends enquiry. The forward-looking survey will be inspected for any
signs of inflation, which could hasten a tightening of monetary policy. This
would help sterling, but any rise in the UK currency is likely to be capped
by its ties with the weak dollar.

<TEXT>
GREECE
Buying opportunities are expected on the Athens stock market this week, with
brokers predicting a sharp decline in the value of the drachma, writes Kerin
Hope in Athens.
The index rose slightly on Friday as overseas institutional investors
returned to the market amid rumours that the currency would be devalued.
However, the index was 2.3 per cent down on the week. The government's
attempts to offset pressure on the drachma by raising interest rates and
lifting capital controls six weeks ahead of the EU's July 1 deadline,
triggered turmoil on Athens financial markets.
The drachma closed the week only 1.32 per cent down against the D-Mark. But
that reflected soaring short-term interest rates that at one point reached
500 per cent.
Foreign institutional investors bought Greek blue-chips, and export-led
companies, including textile and cement manufacturers.
STRATEGY
With the sharp correction in emerging markets this year investors might
wonder if there is more bad news to come. Foreign &amp; Colonial notes that the
IFC Latin American index is off nearly 30 per cent since its peak in
mid-February, while Asia was down some 15 per cent by the end of the first
quarter. According to F &amp; C the apparent hesitation by the US Federal
Reserve to raise short rates more rapidly increased uncertainty and
adversely affected short-term liquidity flows to emerging markets. The
latest rise in US rates should trigger an upturn, says F&amp;C, and they
forecast strong performance over the next few months with the Latin American
markets leading the way.
MOLDOVA
Moldova is to transfer 1,600 state-owned companies to private ownership in
auctions forming part of a delayed privatisation campaign, Reuter reports.
Most small companies will be sold by auction but investors will also be
allowed to subscribe in larger groups.

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Markets: The fundamental things apply - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Having endured a terrifying spring ride on a roller-coaster, can global bond
and stock markets now look forward to an enjoyable summer rally?
That might seem overly optimistic at the start of a week when markets on
both sides of the Atlantic remain jittery, and when poor German money supply
figures could put additional pressure on the dollar. A stronger dollar seems
essential for a sustained rally in the US bond market, which in turn is
driving global sentiment in fixed income and equity markets.
Still, the Federal Reserve's firm tightening action last week, coupled with
a statement implying that it will not raise rates for some time to come, has
prompted a modest rally in US stocks and bonds and gone some way to helping
sentiment in Europe.
The rally, and more recent technical signs of base-forming, suggest that
markets may have come to terms with the initial shock of the turn in the US
interest rate cycle; the accompanying liquidity problems which exaggerated
the three-month correction; and concern that the Fed was not sufficiently
tough on inflation. More fundamental factors may now start reasserting
themselves.
The US now faces two crucial questions: can the dollar rally? And is the
Fed's action sufficient to slow the economy to a more sustainable 2.5 to 3
per cent growth rate, with inflation ticking up at 3 to 3.5 per cent,
extending the current expansion into 1996-97?
On both scores, the signals are likely to be confused for some time. In the
short term, that may prevent the long bond yield getting out of a trading
range of 7.25 to 7.50, which implies a need for further Fed action later in
the year to slow growth. But if this benign environment does materialise,
the yield curve could flatten dramatically in the second half, with the long
bond staging a powerful rally to as low as 6.5 per cent. History, after all,
suggests that long-dated US bonds traditionally yield some 3 per cent above
the rate of inflation.
As for the dollar, the market's swing from optimism about the currency three
months ago (Fed tightening good) to the current fashionable pessimism (trade
and money flows bad) may be overdone. Figures last week underline that the
US trade gap is mainly with Japan, and the recent resumption of US-Japanese
trade talks, and optimistic weekend noises about progress, might help the
dollar in the short-term. Japanese economic recovery, though some way off,
should ameliorate the problem over the longer term.
If there is a strong second half rally in US Treasuries, it may be hard for
European markets to match. Germany and the continental block pegged to its
interest rate structure do not look particularly attractive on a six-month
view, with the German economy showing signs of recovering more rapidly than
expected.
It is not surprising, then, that last week should have seen considerable
switching out of bunds into US Treasuries, gilts and French OATs, though the
narrowing bund/OATs spread could be reversed later in the year as the market
faces a trade off between between heightened political risk (the 1995 French
Presidential election) and continued easing by the Bank of France.
US CYCLICALS
The current stage of the disjointed global recovery - strong growth in the
US, Europe showing the first signs of following the American pattern of an
initially tentative revival - argues for a strong exposure to leading US
blue-chip cyclical and technology stocks with a worldwide spread of
interests and a record of big efficiency improvements over the past few
years. If the US really has recovered its global competitive edge, the
profitability of these companies should powerfully reflect this. Now may be
a good time to pick up bargains, since cyclicals have suffered particularly
badly in the market correction of the past few months.
Chrysler, for example, is selling on a prospective 1995 price/earnings ratio
of just 5, despite record first quarter profits and last week's boost to its
dividend. Ford and General Motors are on p/e's of 6. The market is worried
that the boom in US vehicle sales may peak next year, though the car
companies themselves are looking to 1996-97.
This could continue to hold back Chrysler, which has virtually no foreign
production, but Ford and GM will benefit strongly from a reviving Europe.
Other cyclical and technology blue-chips with strong earnings momentum
include Caterpillar, shares in which have been depressed by a still
spluttering industrial dispute; and AT&amp;T, winner of a huge contract last
week from Bell Atlantic which puts its hardware arm in pole position to
supply America's multi-media revolution.
BRAZIL
Emerging Latin American equity markets have been given a modest fillip by
the Fed's tightening, but last week's sharp rise in Brazil was due as much
to a reappraisal of domestic political risk.
The market has slid over the past few months on fears that left-winger Luiz
Inaco Lula da Silva will win October's presidential election, rather than
former economics minister Ferndando Henrique Cardoso, who is committed to
open the economy further and keep a cap on inflation.
Da Silva is way ahead in the polls, but the market has been buoyed by two
events last week which should help Cardoso narrow the gap: the withdrawal
from the race of former president Jose Sarney, who would have siphoned away
votes, and passage by congress of measures to curb run-away inflation,
notably the introduction of a new currency on July 1. If this slashes
inflation to single digits, as economists hope, Cardoso should benefit.
All this has encouraged analyst Tamzin Hobday of Barings to go marginally
overweight on Brazil in her model portfolio, but as she points out: 'There's
still huge risk there.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Markets: Unloading coffee stocks - Commodity Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of coffee-producing countries accounting for more than 90
per cent of world output gather in London today for a two-day meeting on
ways of releasing up to 2.5m bags (60kg each) of beans stored under their
export retention scheme.
Last October the producers began stockpiling amounts equal to 20 per cent of
exports in an attempt to revive sagging prices. Thanks to the price surge
since then, at first encouraged by the scheme but subsequently fuelled by a
genuine supply shortage, retention has been suspended for both the chiefly
Latin American arabica beans and the coarser robustas that mostly come from
Africa. And last month trigger prices were passed for the release of
retention stocks of both types of beans.
With prices at five-year highs the task of agreeing on release arrangements
will be less onerous than it might have been, but the producers will still
be anxious to ensure that the process does not damage the new-found
buoyancy.
The meeting will also allow them to assess this year's price rises of 82 per
cent for robustas and 75 per cent for arabicas.
On Wednesday the World Gold Council, a promotional organisation financed by
some mining companies, will give its verdict on international gold market
trends in the first quarter of 1994.
Its views are unlikely to be much different from those of Gold Fields
Minerals Services, the consultancy organisation, which, when launching its
influential annual gold market survey two weeks ago, suggested that the
'gold gap' - between newly-mined gold plus scrap returned to the market on
the supply side, and fabrication demand and bar hoarding on the other - had
narrowed from an unprecedented 700 tonnes in the first quarter of last year
to 300 tonnes in the first three months of 1994. To fill that gap either
gold had to be released by holders, particularly the central banks that own
so much of it, or prices must go up.

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Markets: Risks in making false analogies - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'So let's start telling the truth: competitiveness is a meaningless word
when applied to national economies. And the obsession with competitiveness
is both wrong and dangerous.'* The author of the quote, Paul Krugman of MIT,
is a progenitor of 'strategic trade theory', sometimes used to justify the
Clinton administration's interventionist industrial and trade policies. For
this reason, his robust assault on half-baked notions of competitiveness is
most welcome.
In the same article, Prof Krugman notes that Ira Magaziner and Robert Reich,
both important members of the Clinton administration, once argued that 'our
standard of living can only rise if capital and labour increasingly flow to
industries with high value-added per worker'. The absurd implications of
such a rule of thumb are shown in the chart.
In the case of international trade, people are readily attracted by two
false analogies. The most malign is the view that trade is war. Larry
Summers, undersecretary for international affairs at the US treasury, argued
last week that 'some would have the US and other industrial democracies . .
. pursue policies directed at containing threats posed by foreign commercial
rivals in an effort to preserve something called economic security. In my
view this is a profoundly misguided vision. It fails to recognise the
fundamental difference between prosperity and power. Power can be gained
only at someone else's expense. Prosperity can be shared.'**
The second false analogy is the belief that trade is similar to inter-firm
competition. But countries, unlike firms, cannot go bankrupt; the bulk of
the economic transactions of almost all countries are internal; and, most
important, relations between trading partners are mutually beneficial, being
more like those between suppliers and their customers than among
competitors.
Various meanings can still be given to the idea of international
competition.
New, or lower cost, suppliers of goods and services competitive with a
country's exports may emerge, imposing terms of trade losses (reductions in
the prices of exports relative to imports).
Regulatory and fiscal regimes may be forced to compete for flows of mobile
factors of production, particularly capital.
Countries may be subjected to yardstick competition, namely, international
comparisons of performance.
Internationally exposed segments of an economy may fare particularly poorly.
The effects of imports on wages may look malign.
None of these is much like inter-firm competition. The closest to it is the
possible effect on the terms of trade. But this, notes Prof Krugman, has
been insignificant for industrial countries (though that has not been true
for commodity exporters).
The salient feature of the last two concerns is what is happening to
internal relative prices. The competitiveness of internationally exposed
industries, for example, is largely determined by the real product wage -
the cost of labour, adjusted for productivity, relative to the price of
output. Similarly, if trade lowers the wages of the unskilled, it raises
those of the skilled.
Mr Summers asserts that 'notwithstanding Paul Krugman, competitiveness is
important. People who talk about competitiveness want to see America produce
more, better products at lower cost, and sell them into more rapidly growing
and more open markets. What is wrong with that?' Nothing at all is wrong
with it, except that he is talking about overall economic performance. Prof
Krugman is right to complain about this habit of confusing performance with
competitiveness. It is bad analysis, likely also to lead to bad policy, with
foreigners blamed for domestic problems.
Trade liberalisation can improve performance, a point Prof Krugman should

commerce is quite unlike inter-firm competition. Analogies can be highly
misleading. Phenomena have to be analysed, instead, for what they are.

Shell Canada, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell group, has sold a
mothballed refinery near Calgary to Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore, an oil
products company based in Madras, India, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
The refinery, which has a capacity of 30,000 barrels of oil a day, will be
dismantled and shipped to India over the next two years. Terms of the sale
have not been disclosed.
The refinery, which is near the town of Balzac, Alberta, was built in 1982,
but has been idle for the past two years. It was acquired by Shell last year
as part of its purchase of a western Canadian oil production and
distribution com-pany.
Shell Canada shipped a similar refinery to China in 1987.

CGD, a state-owned bank that focuses on mortgage lending and savings

Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest consumer electronics company, has
bought 51 per cent of Lux, the Japanese audio company, from Alpine
Electronics for Y2bn (Dollars 19m), writes John Burton in Seoul.
It is the first time a Korean company has taken control of a listed Japanese
concern. Lux, which was established in 1925, has encountered financial
difficulties because of the high yen.
Under its agreement with Samsung, Alpine Electronics also agreed to pay
Y2.5bn of Lux's Y2.7bn total debt.
Samsung said it acquired Lux to gain access to advanced digital audio
technology that the Japanese company has developed. Lux's main business is
the production of amplifier equipment and components, which are sold under
the name Luxman.

insurance venture

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Great-West Life, one of Power Corporation of Canada's key subsidiaries, is
linking with Axa, a leading French insurer, to establish an insurance arm in
China.
The Canadian company's move, which could involve investment from a Chinese
partner, follows a Chinese government policy change allowing foreign
companies into the financial services sector, according to Mr Paul
Desmarais, who controls Power Corp.
Great-West is one of North America's leading group life and health insurers.
Mr Desmarais, who first went to China in 1979 and already has several joint
investments with China International Trust &amp; Investment (CITIC), said the
government has also asked Power Corp to plan a cable TV system for Beijing.
Power Corp is negotiating with several potential international partners to
set the system up, he said, but refused to identify them.
Power Corp has joint ventures in China in property, electric power and gold
exploration (with American Barrick Resources), with international and
Chinese partners. It dropped a pulp and paper project two years ago because
infrastructure was lacking.
Mr Desmarais holds joint control of Pargesa in Europe with the Belgian Frere
family. Pargesa controls Petrofina, Tractabel and other European industrial
and communications interests.
Besides Great-West, he controls Investors Group, Canada's biggest mutual
fund (unit trust) distributor, a communications group, 18 per cent of
Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper chain, and 1 per cent of Time Warner.
Mr Desmarais, speaking after the annual meeting, said Power Corp had cash
resources of nearly USDollars 2bn and very little debt.
Power Corp's first-quarter profit was CDollars 46.1m (USDollars 33.5m), or
36 cents a share, up 55 per cent from a year earlier, on revenues of
CDollars 1.6bn, little changed.

again
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Frontier Airlines looks like becoming the first of three defunct US airlines
to start flying again under plans drawn up by its former managers.
It is seeking to raise Dollars 6.9m net through a public share offering with
the aim of relaunching air services from its former base in Denver,
Colorado, this summer.
Last week, another defunct carrier, Eastern Airlines, outlined a plan to
emerge from bankruptcy and restart services using 14 airliners from bases in
Atlanta, Indianapolis and Philadelphia, but it has yet to raise the
necessary funds.
Meanwhile, a group of investors has bought the rights to the Pan Am
trademarks with the aim of resurrecting Pan American World Airways.
The group plans to operate the company as an umbrella organisation for other
carriers wanting to use the Pan Am name. The plans, however, are still at an
early stage.
Frontier ran into financial troubles in the mid-1980s and went bankrupt in
1986 after an unsuccessful attempt at a rescue by People Express, the
no-frills carrier. Shortly afterwards, People Express succumbed to a
takeover by Texas Air.
The new Frontier Airlines has been formed by the president and other key
executives of the old company.
The company is offering 1.8m ordinary shares at Dollars 4.25 each and 1.8m
redeemable warrants at Dollars 0.25 each. Net proceeds of the offer will pay
for the airline's launch and for working capital after the start-up.

hard

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Results from Japan's largest petrochemicals companies for the year to March
31 reflect the crisis facing a sector plagued by sluggish domestic demand,
overcapacity, plunging prices and the appreciation of the yen.
News of the sector's dire trading position follow this week's decision by
Showa Denko to sell its polystyrene business.
The company, a marginal manufacturer, sold its 30,000 tonnes a year Kawasaki
plant to Asahi Chemical, Japan's largest polystyrene manufacturer with
capacity of about 333,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to about 25 per cent of
the market. The move was the latest in a series of alliances and mergers as
the troubled industry restructures.
Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the country's biggest plastics group, reported a
loss of Y8.39bn (Dollars 80m) compared with pre-tax profits last year of
Y8.25bn. The group made an operating loss of Y13.8bn, the first since 1982.
The poor result came despite cost-cutting measures, lower raw material
prices, and Y4bn worth of profits from equity sales.
Turnover fell 12.2 per cent from Y372bn to Y326bn, as prices and volumes
declined. Earnings per share, which reached Y52.5 in 1991, fell to a loss
per share of Y9.44. The group, which is scheduled to merge with Mitsubishi
Kasei on October 1, cut its dividend from Y8 per share to Y4.
Mitsubishi Kasei's pre-tax profits fell 76.8 per cent from Y9.3bn last year
to Y2.2bn. The group reported its first operating loss in 40 years at Y467m,
and only managed to post positive pre-tax results by selling Y15.7bn worth
of equities. Turnover fell 1.8 per cent, the fourth yearly decline, to
Y696bn. The dividend was halved to Y3 per share.
Mr Morihisa Takano, managing director, said the newly merged group would
generate pre-tax profits of Y10bn on sales of Y855bn during the year to
March 1995.
He predicted petrochemicals prices would bottom out during the summer. No
decision had been made about the dividend, but the new company could pass it
during the current year, he warned.
Pre-tax profits at Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Japan's biggest
polyethylene maker, plunged 75 per cent from Y9bn to Y2.26bn on sales down
9.3 per cent at Y272bn. The company blamed poor demand for the slump which
offset the benefits of cost-cutting measures. The dividend is unchanged at
Y6 per share. The group forecast pre-tax profits for the current year
marginally up at Y3bn on turnover of Y276bn.
Shin-Etsu, one of Japan's biggest makers of polyvinyl chloride, reported
profits down 26.1 per cent from Y17.6bn to Y13bn. Sales increased 0.2 per
cent from Y275bn to Y276bn. Net profits fell 26.6 per cent to Y7.08bn, or
Y21.85 per share.
The group maintained the final dividend at Y3.75, making the full-year
payout Y7.5 per share. Shin-Etsu forecast pre-tax profits for the current
year of Y15.5bn on sales of Y277bn.
The outlook for the petrochemicals industry remains bleak. The imbalance
between supply and demand for ethylene, the basic building block of
petrochemicals, is about 2.8m tonnes of ethylene and is set to deteriorate
further this year.
A massive 700,000-tonne-a-year ethylene complex owned by Maruzen, Mitsui
Petrochemical and Sumitomo Chemical comes on stream later this year and
Mitsubishi Petrochemical is also commissioning a new 300,000-tonne-a-year
plant this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, has tapped the
capital markets for up to HKDollars 2bn with the launch of the colony's
biggest certificate of deposit issue by a domestic bank.
The three-year floating-rate CDs, arranged by HSBC Markets (formerly Wardley
Capital), also represent the lowest cost of funding yet seen by a Hong Kong
bank, reflecting Hang Seng's solid and cash-rich balance sheet. It is
initially seeking HKDollars 1.2bn, and the all-in borrowing cost for
co-managers is around 45 to 50 basis points above the Hong Kong inter-bank
offered rate (Hibor).
Hang Seng, although second only to Hongkong Bank in size, is the last
entrant into the market. Last year Hongkong Bank raised Dollars 3bn through
10-year subordinated collared floating-rate notes. Bank of East Asia and
Shanghai Commercial Bank, both past issuers, borrowed at some 65 to 70 basis
points over Hibor.
Mr Chung Chun-tung, general manager of the bank, said it was prompted by a
changing attitude and a move to participate in all aspects of banking. Hang
Seng has traditionally trod a very conservative path, which has been
partially responsible for its low loan to deposit ratio of 42 per cent.
However, it also highlights a desire to play a role in the colony's
infrastructure projects: money raised through the CDs will put Hang Seng in
a better position to exploit these opportunities, said Mr Chung.
The offer, which will be open for two weeks, is expected to appeal to
foreign banks seeking an exposure to the Hong Kong market and, to a lesser
extent, institutional investors.

Rothmans (Malaysia) has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 402m
(USDollars 155m) for the year ending March 31 1994. The figure represents a
15.7 per cent rise over the previous year.
Rothmans' Malaysian unit is the most profitable segment of the British
tobacco group's operations in the east Asia region.
Earlier this year Rothmans announced plans to merge its units in the region
to give the group the financial muscle to launch a strong sales push in
China and Japan.
However the plans were abandoned after shareholders in the unit, dominated
by the Malaysian government's investment company, said that a merger could
siphon funds out of Malaysia and dilute local control of the company's
operations.
Turnover at Rothmans (Malaysia) in 1993 - 94 increased by 18.3 per cent to
MDollars 1.33bn. The company has recommended a final gross dividend of 40
cents per share.

<TEXT>
Lola, the British racing car maker, has signed its first aerospace
engineering contracts and is embarking on an expansion programme designed to
transform it into a public company within the next four years.
Mr Eric Broadley, chairman and founder of the Huntingdon,
Cambridgeshire-based company whose single seaters have dominated North
America's most prestigious IndyCar championship for much of the past decade,
has developed a strategy to triple the company's Pounds 12m a year turnover
and take it into mainstream automotive engineering as well as aerospace.
The company employs 160 at its two operating divisions in Huntingdon, but
this number is expected to grow as the strategy develops.
Mr Broadley, who owns 75 per cent of Lola Cars, said expansion outside of
motor racing would be based on the skills in chassis engineering,
aerodynamics and composite plastics technology that Lola has built up over
three successful decades of participation in most senior categories of motor
racing except Formula One grand prix.
Lola has signed several aerospace engineering contracts, including the
developments of parts for British Aerospace and Westland, the helicopter
concern recently acquired by GKN, the engineering and industrial services
group.
Mr Broadley regards aerospace as particularly compatible with the racing car
industry, in which the UK is the acknowledged world leader.
Aerospace requires high technology, low-volume production in which fast
response times during development are important - and which are fundamental
to racing car concerns because of the very nature of competition.
Much of Lola's expansion effort is being directed towards the rapidly
growing and technology hungry Pacific Rim region. Implicit in that is the
expectation that Lola will be able to stay ahead, in technology terms, of
the Asia-Pacific 'tiger' countries like Korea.

FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pru issues sales staff statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, has said that Lautro,
the life industry's self-regulatory body, had found training and competence
of its 9,000 sales staff 'generally satisfactory'.
The company said that it was still considering a detailed report based on a
Lautro audit, but that any recommendations for change were 'minor'.
Prudential cited from a letter from the regulator to Mr Mick Newmarch, the
chief executive, that Lautro's findings would not have 'any serious effect'
on its sales operation.
The company went to the unusual length of issuing a statement to the Stock
Exchange on Friday after its share price fell on rumours that its sales
staff had been suspended, following a suspension by Norwich Union staff in
March.

FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: CPL seeks listing later this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations that it can continue to spread the sweet smell of success have
spurred CPL, one of only two fragrance and flavour manufacturing companies
in the UK, to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange later this month.
The company's origins go back to a firm of north country soap makers last
century.
Mr Terry Pickthall, chairman, explains that his family first became involved
with the industry by inventing fragrances to disguise the smell of soap made
from tallow.
CPL, itself, was founded by Mr Pickthall and his late brother in 1971 as
Contemporary Perfumers.
It has grown into a multinational company with profits last year of Pounds
1.1m on turnover of Pounds 14.7m.
The company is 57 per cent-owned by the family, who expect to retain around
40 per cent after the listing, and 34 per cent by Ensign Trust. It is aiming
to raise around Pounds 5m net of expenses through a placing with
institutions, and is expecting a market capitalisation of Pounds 20m.
Mr Pickthall claims the company's products are found in goods used in most
homes. The fragrances go into soaps, detergents, fabric conditioners,
dishwashing liquids, air fresheners, shampoo and other personal care
products, while flavourings are used in almost every manufactured food and
drink.
The company operates in two divisions - fragrance and flavouring, which
accounts for 60 per cent of sales and aromatic ingredients. It employs 150
people worldwide, including a team of more than 20 perfumers who operate
with over 5,000 ingredients.
'Clearly nature is bountiful in supply with a wonderful array of
substances,' said Mr Pickthall. 'These are supplemented by aromatic
chemicals, which were originally designed to replicate natural fragrances,
but many of which are novel.'
Credit Lyonnais is sponsor to the issue.

FT  23 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ennemix takes unusual route to stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ennemix, a small east Midlands and East Anglian aggregates company, is today
expected to announce plans for one of the most unusual flotations for some
time.
The company, which is seeking to raise Pounds 8.7m for new acquisitions and
to reduce borrowings, will offer shares in the form of a rights issue to
existing stockholders of Anglesey, a publicly quoted North Wales mining
group.
Anglesey, which needs cash to pay for preliminary works, is expected to
receive about Pounds 600,000 of the new money. Ennemix would take a 15 per
cent stake in the mining company.
Imperial Metal Company, of Canada, which previously has provided seed-corn
finance for Anglesey, would not take up its rights but would still be left
with 50 per cent of the company through a debt-for-equity swap.
The scheme, which would resolve the problems of a small highly-geared
aggregates company trying to float on its own in a difficult stock market
and raise much needed cash for Anglesey, has been organised by Guinness
Mahon.
The development of Anglesey, which owns the mining rights to 10m-15m tonnes
of zinc, lead and copper as well as some gold and silver deposits in Parys
Mountain, north Anglesey, has been delayed by a fall in base metal prices.
The company needs to raise more funds if it is to contin-ue.
Anglesey, instead of issuing more paper, will be asking its own shareholders
to put up this money in return for Ennemix shares.
Nash Sells, a venture capital company which owns 22.5 per cent of Ennemix,
plans to raise a further Pounds 1.3m by placing about half its stake with
institutions.
Of the total Pounds 10m to be raised, about half will be offered by way of
rights to Anglesey shareholders with the remainder of the shares to be
placed.
The McLeod family, which currently owns 77 per cent of Ennemix, will not
sell any of its shares - reducing its stake to about 25 per cent after the
issue. About 62 per cent of Ennemix shares would be left with institutions
or Anglesey shareholders.
Ennemix, which owns seven sand and gravel quarries and 17 concrete plants in
the east Midlands and East Anglia, is forecasting after-tax profits of
Pounds 1.1m this year following last year's Pounds 1.64m loss.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, said yesterday that it was 'interested' in
bidding for several of Australia's airports, particularly the three biggest
 -Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.
Earlier this month, the Australian government signalled its intention to
privatise the Federal Airports Corporation, which runs the airports. But a
decision on the structure of the sale and whether foreign ownership will be
allowed is not expected until later this year.

FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Loss that intensified a war of
words - Seafield's battle with dissident shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement last week of a Pounds 24.2m loss on turnover of Pounds
27.5m in 1993 by Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and distribution
company, intensified the war of words between the management and dissident
shareholders.
Shareholders in the troubled group have seen its net worth fall from Pounds
61.2m in 1989 to Pounds 11.1m at the end of last year.
The latest losses were 'the direct result of the ill-conceived decision to
acquire a property development company near the peak of the property market,
a decision taken by the board chaired by Mr Wilson,' Mr Brian Chilver, the
chairman, wrote to shareholders.
He was referring to Mr Tony Wilson, former executive chairman of the group,
and the 1989 acquisition of Charterhall Properties, which was sold late last
year at a loss.
Mr Wilson and Mr Robert Cosby, a corporate adviser, have been nominated by
the dissidents to replace as directors Mr Chilver and Mr Richard Hayes, who
was involved in the Charterhall purchase, at an extraordinary meeting to be
held in Dublin on June 10.
Mr Cosby described last week's results as 'much worse than the
requisitioning shareholder group had been fearing.'
Turnover and operating profit on continuing operations had fallen. 'Unlike
Mr Chilver, this is not what we would describe as the road to recovery.'
The dissidents represent 25.4 per cent of the shares, and claim their
support is growing. Of these the biggest single shareholder is Fidex
International Trust, an offshore trust with 18.5 per cent. It was the main
shareholder in Charterhall, which was chaired at the time by its founder Mr
James Smith.
Seafield paid around Pounds 70m in cash and shares, partly funded by a
Pounds 58m rights issue at 150p a share. On Friday, the shares stood at 12
1/2 p.
Mr Wilson nurses an ambition to return to the transport and distribution
company which he built by acquisition while executive chairman. He claims
that he wanted to resign and lead a management buy-out of the transport
group when it ventured into the property market, but was urged to stay until
the Charterhall deal was complete.
The Charterhall purchase, according to Mr Wilson, was arranged by Mr Dennis
Jones, the 1980s entrepreneur. Mr Jones was a Seafield director and large
shareholder who at the time was also finance director of Hazelwood Foods. Mr
Hayes assisted Mr Jones, Mr Wilson said.
Seafield paid an arrangement fee of more than Pounds 1m to Mr Jones, but the
company's auditors discovered it had not been mentioned in the rights
documentation.
Mr Wilson resigned afer the purchase and was ultimately followed as chairman
by Mr Chilver, who had been chairman of Laing Properties. Mr Chilver,
however, would not agree to a management buy-out of the transport division.
Mr Wilson remains sore. 'Mr Chilver likes to present things as though I
dreamed up the whole excursion into property - nothing could be further from
the truth,' he says.
Mr Chilver, who became chairman in July 1990, accepts that it is probably
true that Mr Wilson was not keen on the foray into property, but in that
case he should have resigned at once.
He himself did not realise when he joined that the problems were quite so
severe. The group did not have the muscle to stay in the property sector in
a declining market. One particular site in Finchley, north London, 'must
have cost Pounds 30m in write-offs over the last four years.'
He points out that Pounds 17.5m of the latest loss represents goodwill
written off on Charterhall. The purchase was originally based on profits
stream, not assets - a move he dismisses as 'stupid'.
The way is now clear to develop the transport and distribution business, he
says, blaming the fall in the division's operating profits from Pounds 1.1m
to Pounds 804,000 on the European recession.
He regrets the dissident move, which came out of the blue and led to Imari,
a private Irish transport company seeking a listing, to withdraw from merger
talks last week.
Seafield has survived where many property companies did not, but it is now
right back to square one. Mr Cosby, who will be chairman if the dissidents
win, says he joined the fray because something had to be done to stop the
company spiralling downwards. 'They were throwing away the shareholders'
money.'
He argues that as a transport and distribution group, the company will be
much better served by the re-appointment of Mr Wilson - 'the man responsible
for successfully building up its transport and distribution activities.'
Mr Chilver, who argues that Seafield has maintained its reputation as an
efficient transport business throughout the last four turbulent years,
predicts: 'We should win as long as there is not too much inertia among
shareholders.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / ARM licenses its chip technology to Samsung
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK-designed silicon chip which powers Apple's 'Newton' electronic
notepad seems set to enjoy a vastly bigger market as the heart of a wide
range of consumer and professional products from the US and the Pacific Rim.
Acorn Risc Machines, which designed the chip, says it has now licensed its
microprocessor technology to Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the world's
seventh largest semiconductor manufacturer.
The value of the deal has not been disclosed. It is the sixth licencing deal
ARM has struck with a large electronics group since it announced its
microprocessor designs in 1991. The others are Texas Instruments, Cirrus
Logic and VLSI of the US, Sharp of Japan and GEC Plessey of the UK. VLSI, a
chip designer and manufacturer, holds an equity stake in ARM along with
Acorn Computers, owned by Olivetti of Italy, Apple Computers of the US and
Daiwa Securities of Japan.
Samsung Electronics, part of the broadly based Samsung trading and
manufacturing group, intends to use the chips in consumer products such as
mobile fax-phones as well as professional computer equipment including
hard-disk drives and laser-beam printers.
VLSI and International Business Machines plan to use ARM-based chips in a
new high speed computing technology that IBM is attempting to establish as
an industry standard called Serial Storage Architecture. ARM processor
circuitry is so small it can easily be embedded in the silicon chips VLSI is
making for IBM.
ARM said its technology would also be used by European companies looking at
ways of improving smart card security systems.
Smart cards, which are increasingly being used in payment, identification
and security systems, are no larger than a credit card but contain a
complete microprocessor. The ARM chip is said to have more than 100 times
the processing power of existing smart card chips, making possible voice
recognition and other advanced forms of secure identification.
Mr Robin Saxby, ARM chief executive, said ARM processors were ideally suited
to consumer electronics products and to hand-held devices because they were
small, used little power and provided high performance.
Competitive chips were large and power-hungry. It was his intention to
establish ARM designs as the industry standard for portable devices. Shares
in Acorn Computers, the largest supplier of systems the UK schools, have
been boosted by excitement over the prospects for ARM. The chip designer
contributed about Pounds 100,000 to group profits last year, moving into
profit about a year earlier than expected.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Green watchers predict a solid
profit of Pounds 65m - Carlton Communications
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wednesday will be a busy day for Mr Michael Green, chairman and chief
executive of Carlton Communications, the broadcasting and television
services group.
At 10am, Carlton will hear whether its little flutter on the National
Lottery - it has a stake in one of the eight bidders, The Great British
Lottery Company - has hit the jackpot, or not.
But even if Carlton's lottery ticket is not a winner, it will have some
decent results to announce for the half-year to March. Most Carlton watchers
are plumping for pre-tax results in the region of Pounds 65m-Pounds 70m,
compared with Pounds 55m last time.
If, as seems likely, the analysts are in the correct range it would indicate
a solid performance for Carlton, providing evidence that the climate for
advertising is improving and that Carlton's main businesses around the world
are pulling out of recession.
The results will, however, contain only around two months of contributions
from Central independent television, the second largest ITV company, which
Carlton acquired for about Pounds 750m at the turn of the year. The main
financial benefit from the government's generous decision to allow the two
largest ITV companies to merge will not be seen until the full year.
The period of consolidation following the Central deal is not over. It is
considered unlikely that Carlton will unveil anything spectacular on
Wednesday. Instead the emphasis will be on steady, solid progress.
Further competition for Carlton in its main UK television markets now seems
likely.
However, the government is likely next month to give the go-ahead for a new
Channel 5 despite the efforts of the ITV companies to head off a potential
rival by arguing for the merits of digital television.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Banks to press government on bid policy: Lloyds' offer for
C&amp;G may spark calls for clarification of building society takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some leading British banks are likely to press the government not to block
agreed cash offers for other building societies if the Lloyds Bank Pounds
1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester survives the legal challenge which
begins in the High Court tomorrow.
Banks which have expressed an interest in acquiring societies believe it
would be unfair if the Lloyds deal was allowed to go ahead and ministers
then changed the law to prevent a similar cash bid in future, where both
organisations wanted to proceed.
C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator,
are seeking clarification from the courts about whether the transaction is
allowed by the 1986 legislation governing societies. The court judgment is
expected later this week. Approval for the transaction could spark other
bids for societies, leading to a restructuring of the UK's financial
services industry.
The commission has issued guidance casting doubt on whether a third party
can make payments to a society's members, and whether relatively new members
are entitled to a share of the cash.
But Lloyds and C&amp;G are confident of the legality of the offer, which would
give individuals borrowing and investing in the society cash payments of up
to Pounds 10,000 for each account.
The Building Societies Association has already said that if the Lloyds/C&amp;G
deal proceeds, it will call on the government to change the law to prevent
offers of cash to members of less than two years' standing.
However, potential bidders for societies say that the impact on future
takeovers and mergers between societies and other organisations should be
seen as part of the current Treasury review of the 1986 act, which was set
up as part of the government's deregulation initiative.
Mr John Fry, group services director at Abbey National, said it would be
inequitable if the government reinstated the two-year restriction and did
not at the same time look at other aspects of the legislation, such as
lowering the high levels of member support needed for a merger, and
increasing the accountability of a society's board to its members.
The Royal Bank of Scotland, which has expressed interest in making an offer
for a society, said it would be 'very unusual and unfair' if the restriction
was reinstated after Lloyds had benefited.
Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB chief executive, thought the government was unlikely
to reinforce the two-year restriction if the courts ruled that it did not
apply in the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal. 'If the deal goes ahead, I think it would be
extremely difficult for other such alliances not to go ahead, albeit in a
slightly different form,' he said.
He added that the deal should encourage societies, as it offered a new
approach to mergers in which both partners retained their identities and
high levels of autonomy.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Singapore Telecom rises 19.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore Telecom (ST), the island republic's partly privatised
telecommunications and posts company, has announced pre-tax profits for the
year ending March 31, 1994, of SDollars 1.55bn (Pounds 667m) a 19.5 per cent
increase.
Turnover increased 15.6 per cent to SDollars 3.19bn. The gross dividend was
raised to 3 Singapore cents from 1.7 Singapore cents.
The government floated about 11 per cent of ST last October, in Singapore's
biggest ever privatisation. The company is the largest on the Singapore
exchange with a market capitalisation that at one stage stood at SDollars
70bn - about 80 per cent of the market capitalisation of British
Telecommunications.
ST attributed the strong financial performance to economic growth in
Singapore and its region and the introduction of new services. Singapore's
economy grew 9.9 per cent in 1993 and 11 per cent in the first quarter of
1994.
The international telephone sector was the largest contributor to group
turnover making up nearly 50 per cent of total revenues and growing 13 per
cent over the previous year. Mobile communications increased 36 per cent
making it the fastest growing sector of ST's business and accounting for 16
per cent of overall revenue. There are now 6.2 subscribers for mobile phones
per 100 inhabitants in Singapore.
ST's directors said the group's results exceeded forecasts made in a
prospectus issued before last year's flotation. They were confident that
group turnover would continue to grow in tandem with the Singapore economy.
Analysts said that while ST has become one of the world leaders in
introducing new services, its future growth was limited by the small size of
its domestic market. Singapore has a population of under three million.
ST has recently been expanding aggressively overseas and joint ventures
include projects in Japan, the UK, the Philippines and Norway.
Despite its expertise in many areas, industry experts still question whether
ST has the ability to compete with the world's larger established
telecommunications companies.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Bosch-Siemens looks to increase market share by acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Germany's largest producer of white goods, is
seeking acquisitions in the UK, France and Italy to strengthen its position
in the fiercely-competitive DM45bn (Pounds 18bn) European market.
The Munich-based concern, owned jointly by Bosch, the car parts group, and
Siemens, the electrical and electronics giant, is Europe's second biggest
producer of white goods with a 15 per cent market share. Electrolux of
Sweden has 22 per cent.
Dr Herbert Worner, president and chief executive of Bosch-Siemens, wanted to
raise the group's European market share to between 18 and 19 per cent within
five years, through organic growth and acquisitions.
This week, Bosch-Siemens announced a sharp fall in group pre-tax profits
from DM346m to DM234.6m. The 1992 figure included a final DM100m subsidy for
the company's Berlin washing machine plant.
Group sales fell 5 per cent to DM6.66bn with non-German sales accounting for
only 42 per cent of the total. Dr Worner said: 'I think we have to change,
we must improve our position in the other big European countries.'
Bosch-Siemens has more than 30 per cent of the German market, Europe's
largest, and market leadership in Spain, Austria and Greece. It is
considering partnerships with manufacturers in the UK and is looking at
making acquisitions in Italy.
Any takeovers by Bosch-Siemens would continue the consolidation in the
European white goods industry. Dr Worner said companies with sales of
DM1.5bn to DM2bn would find it difficult to survive on their own.
Overall, sales and profits had improved in the first four months of 1994, he
said.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): S African group set for first
unbundled result - Barlow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African industrial conglomerate Barlow, formerly Barlow Rand, releases
interim results today. These will be its first since unbundling its main
operations late last year.
CG Smith and Reunert, the two other big companies created in the unbundling,
have had a mediocre six months, and Barlow's figures also are unlikely to be
good.
Analysts say Barlow's results are difficult to forecast. The pro forma
numbers released after the unbundling are no longer a good guide to overall
performance because of various sales during the past six months.
Of the group's remaining assets, Barlow's Pretoria Portland Cement
subsidiary had an excellent first half. Analysts expect its figures to
improve still further this year because of the boom that is likely to follow
the new government's reconstruction and development programme.
But the unit's first-half gains are likely to be largely cancelled out by
the dismal performance of UK subsidiary J Bibby and sons, which reported
pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.4m for the six months to March 26.
The deficit was due to a decision to withdraw from the agricultural feeds
business. Trading in Spain and Portugal also remained weak during the
period, although since February the company reported a small improvement in
the order book level for new equipment.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): British Airways faces City
concerns - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways' tradition of near break-even fourth-quarter results has
left analysts forecasting full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 300m,
against Pounds 185m. However, the tone of today's statement may be more
important than the headline profit. The stock has been weak since
lower-than-expected growth in traffic in April, and there are concerns about
BA's associate USAir.
Thorn EMI: The music, rentals and electronics group, reports full-year
results tomorrow, with pre-tax profits forecast at Pounds 330m-Pounds 340m,
compared with Pounds 286.3m - although that figure is expected to be
adjusted. Attention will focus on the state of the UK consumer market.
Marks and Spencer: Tomorrow's annual results presentation should confirm M&amp;S
as the UK's most profitable retailer, with an increase of more than 17 per
cent in full-year pre-tax figures to about Pounds 865m. Analysts expect
gross margins to have been held and further cost savings to have led to an
increase of a percentage point or more in the net margin.
Argyll: Tough conditions in the grocery market and new depreciation policies
are likely to be reflected on Wednesday in a fall in full-year pre-tax
profits at the UK's third largest grocery retailer. The consensus among
analysts is for about Pounds 365m, down from Pounds 417m after a new Pounds
40m depreciation charge.
Land Securities: The extent of the recovery in commercial property values
will be underlined on Wednesday when the UK's largest quoted property
company reports its final results.
After three years of steeply falling net asset values, the company's nav is
expected to have rise from 504p per share to 630p-660p.
Pre-tax profits are likely to remain static at around Pounds 233m.
Cable &amp; Wireless: Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of more than
Pounds 1bn for the UK telecoms group, about 27 per cent up on the previous
year's (Pounds 824m). However, better-than-expected results announced last
Thursday at Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest business, may make that view
somewhat pessimistic.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Liberals look to exploit Tory split on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives were fighting to bridge a renewed split over Europe
yesterday, as the Liberal Democrats tried to outflank the government by
pledging to hold a referendum on further moves towards European integration.
As campaigning for the June 9 European parliament elections resumed, Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, appealed to the Tory party's Euro-sceptic
wing to unite behind the election manifesto to be issued today.
The manifesto, A Strong Britain in A Strong Europe, will focus on
Euro-sceptic concerns such as the preservation of the UK veto on European
initiatives on taxation, defence and immigration.
Mr Hurd, trying to allay rightwing fears, described himself as a
'Euro-realist', and accused the European Commission of going 'too far into
the nooks and crannies of all our lives'. His remarks, in a BBC interview,
echoed his speech to the Scottish Conservative conference two weeks ago when
he committed the government to seeking a flexible Europe of nation states.
The comments were reinforced in a letter sent to thousands of voters in
marginal seats by Mr John Major, pledging the Tories to block any moves
towards federalism. But the government's claims that Britain is winning the
argument for a less centralised Union were rejected by Sir George Gardiner,
chairman of the 1992 group of rightwing MPs.
Writing in the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group's summer magazine,
Sir George said the party's natural supporters were 'totally opposed to
being sucked by degrees into a federal Europe'.
The Liberal Democrat manifesto, also published today, promises to seek
'popular assent' for 'fundamental changes' agreed at the European Union's
next intergovernmental conference in 1996.
The stance contrasts with Mr Major's refusal to consider a referendum. The
manifesto also proposes cuts in the size of the Commission and the Council
of Ministers, and a stronger European parliament elected proportionately to
size of population.
It also calls for a federal Europe, an independent central bank, and
progress towards a common foreign and defence policy and a European army.
'We don't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for Britain's sake,'
said Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader.
Labour's manifesto, also published today, will commit the party to the
social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and an eventual single European
currency.

FT  23 MAY 94 / British Coal paid under Pounds 1/2m by subsidy scheme:
Ministers indicated millions were on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A coal subsidy scheme, which helped the government suppress a backbench
revolt over pit closures last year, has provided British Coal with less than
Pounds 500,000 from the several hundreds of millions of pounds that
ministers indicated were available.
Although private-sector mining companies are also benefiting, it is likely
that the final bill for the scheme, which ends next March, will amount to
less than Pounds 10m.
The figures will be used by the Labour Party to support its claims that the
subsidy scheme was a cosmetic exercise aimed at saving the jobs of ministers
rather than miners.
However, the Department of Trade and Industry says the low subsidy level is
the result of the weak market which prompted it to implement pit closures in
the first place.
In addition, the subsidies bill would have been several million pounds
higher had British Coal not closed Ellington, one of its few pits to win
aid.
The promise of subsidies was a cornerstone of a government strategy last
March in which ministers 'reprieved' 12 pits from closure while British Coal
looked for markets for their coal.
Most of the reprieved pits have since closed, along with several others
which then looked safe. However the strategy enabled the government to
defeat an opposition motion over its coal policy.
British Coal would not comment yesterday. However it is understood to have
stopped applying for subsidies after complaining the rules of the scheme
were so tightly drawn that aid was rarely granted. That means the sum of
less than Pounds 500,000 it has already received will not increase.
Under the rules of the scheme, no profitable pit is allowed a subsidy and
only those pits with the potential to become profitable in three years can
qualify. In addition, sales from stocks cannot be subsidised.
In last March's coal white paper, the government said it was prepared to
'embrace the range of figures' on subsidies put forward by a House of
Commons industry select committee.
The committee had sought a subsidy until 1998, saying the total cost would
be unlikely to exceed Pounds 500m.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, told parliament this month his department had
offered four subsidies, two to British Coal and two to the private sector,
and was considering another. In 1993 it paid out about Pounds 1m.
The DTI said yesterday that more than that had been paid out in 1994
already, but would not say how much. It said it had received further claims
for subsidies.
Whitehall sources say the biggest subsidy, Pounds 1.8m, was won this year by
the independent Monktonhall pit in Scotland.

FT  23 MAY 94 / World new car sales likely to increase by 5.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car sales worldwide are expected to rise by 5.4 per cent this year to
34.95m, ending three years of falling demand.
Sales fell last year to a six-year low, but demand is forecast to begin a
sustained period of growth in 1994 and rise to record levels throughout the
second half of the 1990s, according to the latest study by DRI/McGraw-Hill,
the London-based automotive analysts.
The short-term recovery is being driven chiefly by a strong rise in demand
in North America, where new car sales are forecast to increase by 11 per
cent to 10.46m this year, as well by the continuing expansion of demand in
the Asia-Pacific region.
The study suggests that the recession in the new car markets of both western
Europe and Japan has bottomed out and the focus for growth is expected to
switch to those regions next year.
'The relatively prolonged recovery phase in Europe and Japan, plus the
take-off of developing countries particularly in Asia, should set the scene
for a steady improvement towards record levels of global car demand
throughout the mid 1990s,' the study says.
Sales in western Europe are likely to rise by 3 per cent or more this year
to 11.77m, as the region begins a fragile recovery from last year's
precipitous decline of 15 per cent, the biggest drop since 1945.
The study says that the recovery in western Europe is uneven - German  and
Italian car markets are expected to continue to contract in 1994. The UK
recovery remains strong, however, and sales are rising in much of
Scandinavia.
The recovery will gather pace in 1995 as both the German and Italian markets
emerge from recession, and sales in western Europe are forecast to rise by
between 6 and 7 per cent in each of the three years from 1995 to reach a
record level of 14.2m in 1997.

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Railtrack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are clear attractions for the UK government in privatising Railtrack
before the next general election. Another Pounds 3bn or so would help plug
the Treasury's funding gap. Moreover, unlike the Post Office, there would be
no need for legislation. Railtrack could also appeal to investors and not
simply those who are railway buffs. The company is a utility, which will
receive its income mainly from track charges paid by the new breed of rail
franchisees. Railtrack therefore has much in common with other transport
infrastructure suppliers such as BAA or Associated British Ports.
Still, the timetable looks ambitious. Railtrack has only been formally in
existence since April. Assuming privatisation in 1995-96, the company would
be able to show investors only one set of annual results.
Moreover, Railtrack would probably not be as low risk an investment as other
utilities. Most of the rail franchisees will be subsidised by the taxpayer,
so Railtrack's income could be vulnerable to a future reduction of those
subsidies. The political risk is also probably somewhat greater than with
other utilities because the rail regulator is formally required to take
account of guidance from ministers until the end of 1996. The other
regulators are more independent. One danger is that the Labour Party might
win a mid-1996 election and order a cut in Railtrack's charges as a means of
driving down fares paid by passengers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank throws itself on the mercy of the courts this week for a
decision on whether its takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society
can go ahead. Present legislation about who can make cash payments to
building society members and in what circumstances is so confusing that the
outcome is highly unpredictable. But it should not be assumed that Lloyds
could easily get round an unfavourable verdict, for example by offering
preference shares instead of cash. That would risk further disagreement with
the Building Societies Commission and another court case. Since Lloyds and
C&amp;G are sure of their case, the chances are that they would rather appeal.
If the verdict goes the other way the Commission may feel tempted to appeal
as well. That would at least prolong uncertainty over what is actually
permitted, preventing a rash of similar merger announcements before the
government can amend relevant legislation to make them more difficult. The
Commission is clearly anxious to bend over backwards in defence of mutual
structures. Its suggestion that societies should use their reserves to pay
dividends to members would not long ago have been regarded as too risky for
organisations that have no access to outside capital.
Unless the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal proceeds, though, there will be little chance of
subjecting building society managements to much outside pressure. The mutual
structure may have some value but not if its main purpose is to protect
management from competition.

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Metals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While financial markets have been in turmoil since US interest rates started
to rise, the bull run in metals has continued. After another sharp rise this
month, copper, aluminium and tin have risen by 30 per cent from last
autumn's lows. Nickel has risen by more. The uncertainty is whether this
represents a fundamental trend or whether the hot money squeezed out of
bonds and other financial assets has simply found another temporary home.
Judging when metals are overvalued is difficult. Production costs should
determine the price in the long run, but the relationship is subject to wild
swings through the economic cycle. Re-opening production capacity is often
expensive, so producers do not respond immediately to higher prices by
increasing supply. When supply and demand are in rough balance, though, it
is unusual to see the price of a metal much above its marginal cost of
production. Copper for one has already passed this point.
The fundamentals are starting to look more favourable for most metals.
Aluminium producers have started to cut production to restore market
balance. Continental European economies are recovering faster than had been
anticipated, which should eventually feed through into higher metals
consumption. But only in copper have stocks fallen significantly from the
record levels seen at the end of last year. Elsewhere the overhang of stock
shows no sign of abating. Until that changes, metals will be vulnerable to
profit-taking or swings in investment fashion.

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Open options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pricing this week's Pounds 2bn auction of convertible gilts promises to be a
daunting task for even the most brilliant rocket scientist. The three year
gilt can be converted on four separate dates into 9 per cent bonds due in
2012. It thus effectively includes a series of options to buy long-dated
paper whose value must be factored into the auction price. From the Bank of
England's perspective this is a good time to be selling such options, since
recent cash market volatility has made them more expensive. For options
traders, the challenge lies in deciding whether the price of the gilt is
such that they can acquire the embedded options at a price lower than the
options market itself would charge.
Market imperfections mean that there is a chance of this happening. The
price of the auction stock will tend to reflect movements in short-dated
gilts, whereas the options relate to long-dated issues. Indeed any gilt
market weakness which discourages institutional buying at the time of the
auction may only make the convertible gilt more attractive to options
specialists. Yet the difficulty in calculating option values and the deal's
complex structure makes it hard for any participant to know what represents
value at the end of the day.
The 2012 issue would have to yield less than 7.2 per cent to make conversion
worthwhile at the most distant date in February 1996. That compares with
almost 8 per cent on Friday. Any institutions which really believe rates
will fall that far during the next two years would be better off buying
longer-dated paper now in order to collect the full capital gain. Any which
believe rates will be higher should buy a conventional three-year gilt and
reinvest the proceeds on maturity.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Murky outlook for healthcare reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little of substance on healthcare reform will be agreed before the mid-term
elections in November. The most that President Bill Clinton can expect is a
deal with Republicans on incremental reforms of the health insurance market,
for example legislation to prevent discrimination against people with
'pre-existing' conditions.
I received this gloomy assessment last week from one of the most respected
analysts on Capitol Hill. He spoke, ironically, just as a milestone of sorts
was passed in the healthcare saga. Last Wednesday, two of the five
congressional committees with jurisdiction over healthcare - those headed by
Senator Edward Kennedy and Mr Dan Rostenkowski - finally began serious
scrutiny of reform proposals.
On the evidence of the stormy opening sessions, it would be rash to make any
prediction of the final legislative outcome. Republicans tabled more than
100 amendments to Mr Kennedy's compromise bill and denounced it as a
pasteurised version of Mr Clinton's 'socialised medicine'. Yet the mood
changed the following day when they reached a surprising bipartisan accord
on ways of containing the cost of a minimum package of benefits. The fact
that Mr Rostenkowski, the Democrats' quarterback in the lower house, faces
possible indictment on felony charges only adds to the uncertainty.
Nobody doubts the depth of Mr Clinton's commitment to healthcare reform  -
the centrepiece of his legislative agenda. He and the first lady have
campaigned tirelessly for reform. The Democratic party enjoys comfortable
majorities in both houses of Congress. Why, then, is he facing such an
uphill battle?
The answer lies in the nature of America's healthcare dilemma. Social
reforms tend to be popular only when most people regard themselves as
beneficiaries. In the late 1940s, Britain's National Health Service was a
wild success because it greatly improved access to care for all but the
seriously rich - and the cost in terms of higher taxation was not generally
appreciated. In the late 1960s, much the same could be said of Medicare, the
popular US public programme that guarantees universal access to care for the
elderly, at highly subsidised rates.
Now consider the Clinton reform. Rather than expanding opportunities it is
about restraint and redistribution. The goal is to provide coverage for the
15 per cent of the population presently uninsured (inevitably a costly
endeavour) while reducing the growth of overall healthcare spending - in the
private as well as public sector.
Ratcheting down growth of overall spending, while shifting resources to the
uninsured, obviously requires new constraints on the 85 per cent who are
insured, especially in their access to expensive high-tech medicine. Such
constraints - however dressed up - are unlikely to be popular, particularly
when no US politician, least of all Mr Clinton, will admit that any
sacrifice is required.
It is thus not surprising that congressional leaders, reacting to opinion
polls, have already scuttled two of the principal restraints on spending
proposed by Mr Clinton. Hopes of shifting Americans en masse into managed
care by corralling them in mandatory 'health alliances', or quasi public
sector purchasing co-operatives, have been abandoned. So, probably, has the
White House dream of imposing caps on the growth of private health insurance
premiums. Effective cost control looks to be a dead letter.
The remaining question is whether Mr Clinton will succeed in guaranteeing
universal coverage - supposedly his non-negotiable bottom line. Americans
seem unwilling to countenance either an overt increase in personal taxation
or, after a decade of red ink, a higher budget deficit. The White House thus
concluded that the only plausible route to universal coverage lay in
imposing an 'employer mandate' - a legal requirement that all employers must
pay the bulk of insurance costs for employees.
Yet this disguised tax is also strongly opposed, especially by small
business, a politically powerful group. It seems draconian to impose new
burdens on businesses just recovering from recession. And it is hard to
refute the argument that higher payroll taxes will destroy jobs. Indeed many
question the wisdom of increasing the corporate sector's social
responsibilities at a time when links between employers and employees are
becoming more, rather than less, fluid. Yet nobody in Congress has devised a
plausible alternative route to universal insurance cover.
In gauging Mr Clinton's chances this year, the best legislative parallel is
perhaps the compendious 1986 Tax Reform Act. At the eleventh hour,
congressional leaders confounded sceptics by agreeing sweeping reforms -
albeit reforms that differed substantially from President Reagan's original
proposals.
Yet Mr Clinton should not draw much comfort from this. Tax reform, although
highly complex, was manageable because lawmakers could trade concessions
(for example higher corporate taxes in exchange for lower personal rates)
almost at will. Healthcare reform is more demanding because the component
parts must be internally consistent. Even setting aside political
differences, Congress may simply lack the technical skill to devise a
workable reform of US healthcare - one seventh of the economy - before
November. Hence the plausibility of predictions that Mr Clinton, this year,
will have to settle for modest reforms.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The liabilities of auditors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is more than a little ironic that while the senior partners of the UK's
accountancy firms are calling for a limitation on their liability in
lawsuits, the heads of their own insolvency practices are busy issuing writs
against each others' firms for negligent auditing.
A campaign backed by the largest accountants in the US and Australia has now
been imported to the UK. It calls for auditors to be protected from
vexatious legal actions by the shareholders and purchasers of companies in
which the accounts turn out to have been misleading.
The firms claim that plaintiffs seek disproportionate penalties from them
for the losses caused, because their assets and insurance policies give them
'deep pockets' out of which to pay damages. Those who are responsible for
the frauds and misstatements, notably the directors, tend to escape
relatively unscathed.
In principle, the argument for reform seems sound. It must be unreasonable
for auditors to be held wholly responsible for corporate disasters when they
have not been the direct cause of the problems. Their failure to detect or
highlight shortcomings should make them only partly culpable.
Yet reform would require radical changes in the law, overturning the
principle of 'joint and several liability', so that auditors would only be
liable to losses in proportion to their degree of blame. This would dilute
plaintiffs' rights, and require the consideration of the Law Commission,
which has indicated its lack of interest by telling the profession that it
has no time to consider the issue in the foreseeable future.
The firms' response has been to suggest a flawed alternative: to remove
section 310 of the 1985 companies act - which expressly forbids auditors
from limiting their liability in contract. They say no such restriction
applies to other professions, such as solicitors.
Important safeguards
While this is true, lawyers have not in practice attempted to limit their
liability in contract. They consider that they could still be found
negligent and sued, making any limits imposed in the contract irrelevant.
Removing section 310 would also eliminate one of the most important
safeguards which stand behind an audit. This is the knowledge that, when a
firm gives an independent, professional opinion, it is putting its
reputation, livelihood and the assets of all its partners on the line.
Self-regulation and tighter standards appear to have had some limited effect
on improving the quality of auditing. But the threat of litigation must help
to concentrate the mind when it comes to making sure that the audited
accounts show a 'true and fair view', as the law demands.
Unique benefit
Accountants have the unique benefit of a government-guaranteed monopoly of
auditing. This is designed to provide reassurance to shareholders but it
also provides firms with lucrative fees and a ready platform to sell other
services to companies.
At the same time, they have shown themselves reluctant to go to court when
sued for audit negligence. They have chosen instead to settle on the steps
of the court rather than have their work scrutinised in public and run the
risk of an award against them. These settlements are made without admission
of responsibility, but they do not make it easier to establish the case for
reform.
The firms and their insurers have also not been above a little creative
accounting themselves. They have chosen to highlight the enormous rise in
the number of legal claims against them, while failing to reveal the far
smaller size and number of awards that have actually been made.
On the rare occasions when cases have been contested - such as the Caparo,
Galoo and Berg cases - the courts have in practice demonstrated considerable
sympathy for the profession, tightly restricting its duty of care, and
limiting damages rather than awarding disproportionate penalties against
them.
While accountants refuse to disclose any details of their own profits and
assets, or the extent of their professional indemnity cover, they will find
it hard to persuade others that the case for reform is as soundly based as
they claim.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Every which way but the right way: The UK government has yet
to deliver a coherent transport policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ambitious Pounds 2bn proposal to build the first east-west rail link
across London comes to grief in a parliamentary committee of just four MPs.
Despite the backing of not merely the government, but also the opposition
Labour party and the capital's business interests, CrossRail is rejected
because traffic projections have changed since it was planned in the late
1980s.
CrossRail has, regardless of its merits, come to reflect a wider malaise in
Britain's transport policy. Many experts, planners and transport operators,
as well as the travelling public, agree that transport planning in the UK is
failing to deliver the goods. Criticism has come from organisations as
diverse as the Confederation of British Industry, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors and the Council for the Preservation of Rural England.
Many of the objections centre on the perception that the government favours
the private car over public transport.
High-profile public protests against a number of road schemes have spilled
over into violence in some instances. More attention-grabbing demonstrations
are expected against a bypass to the east of the picturesque Georgian city
of Bath and against a motorway extension through an area of great natural
beauty south of Blackburn.
Meanwhile, congestion is stifling towns and cities while delaying commuters
on their journey to work; cross-country motorways are clogged by traffic
jams with increasing frequency, while rail services are in the throes of
privatisation with a still uncertain outcome; London Underground suffers
frequent breakdowns because of ageing equipment; the government has cut back
on its Pounds 23bn 10-year roads programme and set more realistic
priorities; and delays on a high-speed rail link between London and the
Channel tunnel mean it will not be completed until at least eight years
after the tunnel itself has opened for business.
Yet across the Channel, French passengers enjoy inter-city trains travelling
at speeds of nearly 190mph; German commuters travel on spanking new
underground systems; and the Dutch get to work on a road network which
provides extensively for the cyclist.
Mounting public dissatisfaction over transport provision in the UK has
pushed the issue to the top of the political agenda. Tory backbenchers have
joined a revolt against a programme for building trunk roads and motorways.
The main criticisms of the government's present transport policy are that:
There is no long-term approach to planning transport infrastructure
projects. As it takes several years to plan, prepare and construct a large
transport link, a short-term outlook can make a nonsense of such a project.
The reason is that traffic or passenger flows are subject to change during
the planning and construction period. CrossRail provides a striking example
of this. If traffic demand increases during the economic recovery there may
once again be a need for a cross-London link and the whole planning process
will have to start again.
'The British government machine, with its . . . year-by-year battles, is
fundamentally ill-suited to dealing with the timescales intrinsic to
transport decisions,' concluded the authors of Transport Policy-Making in
Britain, a recent study by the London School of Economics.
Parliament votes funds for one year; government departments are encouraged
to think three years ahead; while the election timetable imposes a four- or
five-year time frame on thinking.
Contrast this with the long-term strategic planning, often backed by a
guarantee of government funds, in many other European countries. Switzerland
has embarked on a 12-year programme, Bahn 2000, to upgrade its rail network,
while the Netherlands has a 15- to 20-year perspective for its Rail 21
project.
There is little co-ordination of road building with public sector spending
on rail or urban light railway systems in the UK.
Transport projects are judged individually, largely by their contribution to
reducing congestion in a specific area, says Steer Davies Gleave, transport
consultants.
Moreover, says Steer Davies Gleave, the way in which the UK assesses the
merits of different forms of transport tends to favour the private car. The
government offsets against the cost of a road construction project the money
value of the time saved by users. But, in the case of public transport
projects, it does not. German and French assessments do not reflect this
bias.
Tight control by the Treasury adds to the tendency to adopt short-term
financial goals on transport projects. Each rail project requires separate
Treasury approval, while schemes in the 10-year roads programme do not.
The injection of more private sector finance was seen as a way round tough
controls on public spending. But this, too, has run into the buffers of
Treasury control. Private sector bids to modernise London Underground's
Northern Line are due shortly, but problems have arisen over the degree of
risk to be carried by the private sector.
'Government is discovering, says the LSE study, that 'you can either have
control or majority private finance, but you cannot have both.'
The government does not spend enough on the transport infrastructure. Last
November of all transport expenditures the roads budget was most severely
cut. Over the long term, however, it is public transport which has suffered
most, critics say.
John MacGregor, the transport secretary, points out that 40 per cent of his
department's budget is spent on public transport although nearly 90 per cent
of journeys are made by motor car. But overall spending on schemes involving
all forms of transport is set to fall 13 per cent over the next three years
to Pounds 5.4bn, according to transport department forecasts.
The UK spends less on rail infrastructure than any other European country
except Finland. Germany's superior commitment to rail, by contrast, is
evidence in its plans to invest more in its rail network than in roads in
the period up to 2010.
What does the government say to such criticisms? It believes attempts to
establish an integrated plan for transport would not succeed, 'We don't
believe in a centralised system which tells people how to travel,' Mr
MacGregor said recently. The government is, however, trying to create an
overall framework which meets the needs of the economy.
While it does so, it can draw to its critics' attention a shift in its own
approach. This change is driven, in part, by a growing realisation of the
environmental impact of an unrestrained increase in road traffic. Yet any
shift is constrained by its calculation that even a 50 per cent increase in
rail traffic would reduce the number of road journeys by only 5 per cent.
The government is increasing fuel duties by at least 5 per cent a year to
meet the Rio targets for CO emissions, implicated in global warming. There
have also been potentially far-reaching changes in government planning
guidelines, among them one in March calling on local authorities to limit
the scale of out-of-town commercial developments and reduce reliance on the
private car.
Even more far-reaching are plans to introduce tolls on Britain's motorways.
Indications are that, in the early stages, these will be set low, but they
may still prompt a shift towards public transport.
Government rhetoric on public transport is also changing. As yet, however,
there is no commitment to extra funding. Without such a commitment, the
travelling public and much of industry are unlikely to be satisfied. They
await hard evidence of government determination to solve chronic transport
problems and give coherence to planning, whose dislocation was so evident in
the CrossRail debacle.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Observer: Munk's new habit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US interior secretary Bruce Babbitt should know better than to shoot his
mouth off in front of American Barrick's Peter Munk - a Canadian
entrepreneur acquiring a reputation as someone who sues foreign governments
and wins. Babbitt was mighty rude about him last week.
It all started after Munk's lawyers forced Babbitt's department to hand over
the deeds to Nevada's Goldstrike mine, which sits on America's largest gold
deposit. Babbitt described it as the 'biggest gold heist since the days of
Butch Cassidy' and had a mock cheque for Dollars 10bn made out to the
company and signed by the American people.
Munk admits that the 1872 mining law, which enabled his firm to mine gold
without paying government royalties, is outdated. But he played by the rule
book and when Babbitt tried to block him, Munk took him to court and won.
Describing the deal as a 'Dollars 10bn rip-off' is 'emotional nonsense',
says Munk. Even if his firm earns Dollars 10bn in revenues over the next 20
years, Babbitt forgets that Dollars 6bn will be paid to Munk's US workforce,
and another Dollars 1bn has gone on equipment. And then there will be the
taxes on any profits.
A big fan of the legal process, Munk spent 15 years chasing the Egyptian
government for Dollars 17.5m after it let him down on a long forgotten hotel
project.
But even he is unlikely to sue for defamation. He's got what he wanted.
Moreover, Lloyd Cutler, who helped win his case, then answered the call to
become White House special counsel and is thus busy with President Clinton's

A veritable connoisseur of pocket-burning days at the races, Observer could
tell the University of Salford a thing or two about the economics of
gambling. But the dons, whose colleagues in the English faculty recently
added Jackie Collins to the syllabus, seem to want input of a rather more
sophisticated nature.
Advertising in this week's Economist, Salford is looking for a director for
its new Centre for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming. The aim,
apparently, is to develop a degree in 'economics with gambling studies' as
well as to research this 'relatively underdeveloped' by-way of the dismal
science.
The fund-raising part, at any rate, should be a cinch; the vice-chancellor
will no doubt be hovering by his phone on Wednesday, ready to offer
felicitations to whichever consortium is named to run the National Lottery.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Observer: Whale of a story
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news for whales. A group of islands in the Caribbean is fighting about
the creation of a whale sanctuary in Antarctica. Their input could tip the
balance at this week's International Whaling Commission meeting in Mexico.
Whales are spotted but rarely in these waters - and caught still more
infrequently. But Dominica and its neighbours, Grenada, St Lucia and St
Vincent, have emerged as important players in global whale politics. Japan,
which wants commercial whaling to continue, has been jolly generous to the
islands with the result that they have happily toed its line.
However, environmental activists have been working hard to keep tourists
from visiting the Windwards and the campaign is starting to bite. Last week
Dominica broke ranks and said it would support the sanctuary idea. St Lucia
might follow.
But the Vincentians are standing firm. They obviously just won't risk
missing that very occasional whale that swims by.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Observer: Ancient Greek rituals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much in need of an international image makeover, Greece could have made a
start by fielding some bright young politicians for next month's
Euro-elections.
Instead, prime minister Andreas Papandreou's list of candidates reads like
an exercise in personal debt repayment. Angela Kokkola, Papandreou's
secretary for a couple of decades until his new wife Dimitra decided she
wanted the job, is for instance certain to win one of the 25 seats.
Journalist Yannis Roubatis has another safe slot. Once Papandreou's loyal
spokesman, Roubatis was caught up in the backwash of the Bank of Crete
embezzlement scandal which toppled the government in 1988, and kept him on
the sidelines for quite some time too.
The opposition, meanwhile, has made a stab at sprucing up its image by
including the well-known singer Nana Mouskouri. Sadly, she is so rarely
sighted in Athens that many Greeks think she is French.
Alketas Panagoulias, who is coaching the Greek soccer team for its first
appearance in the World Cup this summer, is another unusual choice.
However, if Greece's 5-0 thrashing by England at Wembley last week is
anything to go by, Panagoulias might find the bright lights of Brussels an
attractive proposition next season.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's global vision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No US President has proclaimed more fervently than Mr Bill Clinton the
central importance of international economic policy to his country's
welfare. In an increasingly interdependent global economy, his choice of
priorities is correct. Yet his administration's record in matching words
with deeds has been patchy.
Mr Clinton deserves much credit for steering the Nafta treaty through
Congress and working for the successful completion of the Gatt Uruguay Round
last year. Since then, however, his policies have lacked coherent direction
 -nowhere more obviously than in his dealings with Asia. He has vacillated
over China, while US relations with Japan have been dominated by a myopic
obsession with its bilateral trade surplus. In both cases, the US stance has
been heavily influenced by narrow, sometimes conflicting, domestic concerns.
As a consequence, the administration has seemed not to appreciate fully the
bigger national and global interests at stake, and has sometimes pursued
contradictory objectives. It has talked enthusiastically of its wish to
co-operate more closely with the fast-growing Asian economies of the Pacific
rim, while pursuing policies which have severely strained relations with the
region's two largest and most powerful count-ries.
There are signs that Washington may now be starting to recognise the
drawbacks of its approach. One is that Mr Clinton looks increasingly likely
to renew China's most favoured nation trading status in the next few days,
albeit with possible qualifications. At the same time, his administration
has conspicuously toned down its rhetoric towards Japan. US officials have
indicated that they are rethinking their tactics in an effort to restart
negotiations on a 'framework' trade agreement with Tokyo, which broke down
in February.
Modest concessions
The most plausible explanation in both cases is that US failure to think
through its policies at the outset has steadily reduced its available
options. Having failed to extract more than modest concessions from Beijing
on human rights, Washington appears only now to have realised just how
damaging would be the consequences of following its own logic to its
conclusion by refusing to extend MFN.
In Japan, continuing political instability makes it increasingly doubtful
that the country's minority government can deliver macro-economic reforms
and market access measures on the scale demanded by Washington, even if it
wanted to. Meanwhile, recent US jitters about an uncontrolled slide in the
dollar mean that trying to force up the yen is not an option.
Offending countries
As a result, President Clinton's revival of the Super-301 trade mechanism -
apparently in an effort to buy time for further talks with Japan after
February's breakdown - looks in danger of backfiring. Mr Clinton must name
offending countries, liable for trade sanctions, by September 30. Not to do
so would risk accusations at home of weakness; doing so would escalate the
confrontation with Japan, without improving the prospect of winning more
concessions. Washington's best hope must thus be to stitch up some kind of
deal before late September, declare victory, and move on.
This would also be the most positive outcome - providing it leads Washington
to place future relations with Japan on a more rational footing. US
insistence that its economic growth is seriously threatened by closed
Japanese markets is overblown. Even if last year's bilateral deficit had
been halved entirely through increased US exports - an improbable scenario -
it would have added only 0.5 per cent to US gross domestic product. That
hardly seems a large enough prize to justify the political effort expended,
or the threat US tactics pose to the world trade system.
The most important lesson for the US is that the recent problems in its
dealings with both Japan and China are, for different reasons, largely of
its own making. If they are not to be repeated, President Clinton needs now
to clarify and give real substance to his commitment to international
economic policy. America's trade partners have every incentive to encourage
him in that objective.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Changing cultures of capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does culture determine economics or economics culture? The issue has raged
for a long time. Marx and contemporary Chicago economists are alike on the
economic side; Max Weber, the early 20th century German sociologist who
wrote about Protestantism and the rise of capitalism, on the other one.
Both have now accumulated a lot of egg on their faces. Attempts to explain
the fundamentalist revolution in Iran in terms of rational utility
maximisation by Iranian citizens have, to put it mildly, been extremely
unconvincing.
Of course the cultural and economic spheres interact. Peter Berger, the
American sociologist, has coined the term 'economic culture' for the
resulting product. As he explains in an article in the McKinsey Quarterly,
the interaction has to be studied in careful case studies.
One reassuring conclusion is that comparative cultural advantage changes.
The Japanese bent for organisation building may not be such an advantage in
a post-industrial society based on information technology. Berger also
throws much needed doubt on much of what is written about the Confucian
element in Asian economic success: 'Few Taiwanese entrepreneurs are steeped
in the Confucian classics.'
His most stimulating remarks are on the US-originated counter-culture of the
late 1960s and early 1970s. Most of its members have now accepted 'the
system' but have retained some of the beliefs and lifestyle of their youth.
They are to be found particularly in communications. (Their trademark can be
very simple, such as avoiding wearing jacket and trousers of the same colour
less they be accused of wearing a suit.)
Is this kinder, gentler capitalism doomed to be conquered by the uptight
varieties? Berger wisely leaves open the alternative optimistic hypothesis
that the more sensitive types of behaviour may have an advantage in the
emerging service economies.
Just how diverse the cultural forms of capitalism can be is illustrated in a
new book of essays by American writers entitled The Culture of the Market.
It is a book to dip into at leisure and will be most instructive if read
without too relentless an attempt to derive lessons from it.
The essay nearest to the present day concerns the remarkable vogue of The
Lonely Crowd published in 1954 by the American author David Riesman, the one
sociologist to have made the cover of Time magazine. By the early 1970s more
than 1m copies of the abridged edition had been bought and the book still
sells.
The Time cover has two small-scale figures behind Riesman's head. The first,
'dressed in a dark Victorian suit and wearing long, bushy 19th century
sideburns, seems to stride briskly and purposefully away from the reader,
oblivious to all but his quest, a giant gyroscope strapped to his back. The
second man, dressed in a light coloured suit, is a more modern 20th century
man, perhaps a salesman, facing in the opposite direction'.
The outer-directed person escaped from the authoritarianism of the 19th
century home, school or business, only to be smothered by the new conformism
of his peer group. Riesman had a knack of highlighting relevant children's
stories such as the young engine Tootle, which lands in trouble because of
its unwillingness to 'stay on the tracks with the other engines'.
Most of the chapters go back, however, to earlier periods. There is an
absorbing essay about the painter Edgar Degas's tense relations with
markets, which not only gave him a varying sales outlet but were the source
of some of his most famous pictures, such as a New Orleans cotton office, a
sulking banker and a galaxy of scurrilous stock exchange types. The most
ambivalent of the pictures is Madame's Birthday, in which 'tactile values'
are graphically shown.
In a very different vein, there is an account of the American essayist Henry
Thoreau's temporary period as a semi-hermit refugee from commercial life.
But so far from being any kind of collectivist, Thoreau was a radical
individualist in the American mould, who could not resist instructing his
readers on simple hermitage book-keeping and was not above some
self-mockery.
At the opposite cultural extreme, Balzac's novel Pere Goriot reveals how far
the European bourgeois has often been from any simple idea of utility
maximisation: material goods are sought as symbols of honour, family dignity
and snobbish attainment. The weekly budget of one character is exhausted in
a vain attempt to arrive with clean boots at the home of a minor aristocrat.
But an antidote to nostalgia is provided in Martin Wiener's account of the
moralist-disciplinarian criminal policy of Victorian England, which some
over-promoted British ministers would like to see restored.
Anthropological studies have shown the most varying patterns of linkages
between different beliefs. Similarly capitalist heroes, who wrote their
autobiographies as moral tales, could be anything from stern supporters of
hierarchical order to rebellious hedonists and modernisers.
The main non-materialist advantage of modern capitalism is that it is a
necessary - but far from sufficient - condition of an open society in which
many alternative cultures can flourish.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Private pay rises knock-on to public
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS TRINDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Hunt issues fresh warning on pay rises' (May 19), the emphasis was
on the need for businesses to control their wage costs so as to maintain
their competitiveness.
While this is important there are wider implications of the recent rapid
increase in private sector pay. One aspect is the knock-on effect to future
public sector pay awards.
The pay review bodies for nurses, armed forces and teachers, for example,
regularly refer to 'backward' looking comparisons with earnings in the
previous 12 months in the whole economy when they make recommendations for
the forthcoming year. Increases in the current year until September will
form an important part of their considerations for public service pay
between April 1995 and March 1996. Similar arrangements, such as
inter-quartile ranges of past pay movements, apply in the long-term pay
agreements for civil servants.
In addition to the institutional considerations, econometric analysis for
the period 1963-1982 (which I carried out with S G B Henry and N Foster and
published while at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in
the 1980s) 'proved' public service pay is largely determined by earlier
developments in the private sector.
The 'lags' were often long and also variable, anything from three-quarters
to three years, but in the long run current private sector pay increases
were the single most important determinant of future central and local
government pay levels.
The significance of these 'facts' is that, although the government may
announce public sector pay 'restraint' and implement it for a period, if pay
in other parts of the economy continues to rise at a much faster rate, then
to recruit, retain and motivate people of appropriate quality for the public
services it is necessary to raise those wage rates too. The 'funding' limits
operated by the government over the medium term to that extent restrict the
quantity and quality of the public services available, but the long-term
'price/wages' are outside its control.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russia yet to follow Estonia's
example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof STEVE H HANKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial commentary 'Chernomyrdin sees the light' (May 18),
attempts to portray yet another Russian prime minister as an economic
reformer. You claim that Mr Chernomyrdin has taken to heart the experience
of 'the former Soviet Baltic states, especially Estonia'. This assertion is
incorrect.
Estonia's record on inflation and growth has surpassed other former Soviet
republics'. That is due, in large part, to Estonia replacing the rouble with
the kroon and introducing a currency board-like system on June 20 1992.
Under that system, the kroon is backed 100 per cent by foreign reserve
currencies and gold and is freely convertible at a fixed rate of eight
kroons per D-Mark. The Bank of Estonia cannot engage in discretionary
monetary and/or exchange rate policies. It cannot finance fiscal deficits.
Indeed, the bank's hands are tied, so that changes in the stock kroons are
automatically determined by the free flow of monetary reserves in and out of
the bank.
The Russians, including the so-called reformers, have always rejected what
has become the hallmark of Estonia's reforms, the currency board system. For
example, in 1991 most of the future Russian 'reformers' attended meetings in
Paris. It was there that the young turks selected Mr Yegor Gaidar to be
their leader. It was also there that they were introduced to the currency
board idea. Since then, Russians of all stripes have expended considerable
effort defending the institution of central banking for Russia and objecting
to the currency board alternative.
If Mr Chernomyrdin is ever to be serious about the goal of currency
stability, he must tie the hands of the Central Bank of Russia. To do this
he must do what Lithuania did on April 1, when it followed the Estonian
example.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dividend payout problem unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D R MYDDELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Stephen Dorrell is reported to have said (in a speech to the CBI
this week) that dividend payouts by British companies may have become too
high and too inflexible ('Dorrell critical of high dividends', May 19).
According to him, in the early 1980s companies were distributing between 20
and 25 per cent of their after-tax earnings in dividends; but the payout
ratio has risen to more than 50 per cent in the early 1990s.
There is no virtue in companies retaining profits if they cannot invest the
funds profitably. And the Wilson Committee found no evidence that medium or
large companies were prevented from investing in profitable projects by any
lack of funds. So it is not clear that there is any problem.
Mr Dorrell, being a Treasury minister, will be aware that the pound has lost
more than 90 per cent of its purchasing power over the past 30 years. How
have his calculations allowed for the debasement of the currency? It does
have a significant effect on financial statements which use money as the
unit of account in measuring 'earnings'.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Empirical issue in need of research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN CORRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Does Michael Prowse ('Market v state in Education', May 16) really
think that Financial Times readers are unfamiliar with the simple textbook
theory as to why markets work best, so that we need a patronising fable
about books to explain it to us?
To be able to say, as Prowse does, that 'greater choice of school is
indisputably a good thing', one must be embracing a myriad of assumptions
about information, externalities, economies of scale, income distribution,
accompanying social policies and so on. All of these are questionable.
Let's be frank: most people want a good school round the corner from their
home, not a theoretical choice of 100 schools, especially when the transport
implications of going anywhere but the nearest of them rule most out, and
when the good schools have no space and so in reality they choose their
pupils (and parents) rather than the other way round.
So in order to work, the choice argument has to claim that, by offering
choice and competition, not only will the average level of education rise,
but we will not end up with a split between geographically concentrated good
schools and sink schools.
It must also be shown that the effort made by schools to differentiate their
product (maybe no more than school versions of advertising - a largely
deadweight cost to the economy) and the search costs that must be undergone
by parents are all outweighed by the anticipated benefits.
As in so many other areas, these issues must surely be empirical ones that
should be opened up to piloting and research - like the OECD study of
parental choice of schools.
Simple ideology based on hopeful models of how the real world works may suit
Prowse, but should not sway serious policy makers.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Lone eagles nest in the Rockies: Clean air, open spaces and
low costs are drawing US professionals west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnificent Rocky Mountain vistas dominate the view from Jeff Thredgold's
new six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home near Salt Lake City, Utah. Walk out the
front door of the imposing, pink brick structure, designed by Mr Thredgold
himself, and within minutes you can be hiking in the foothills of Utah's
Wasatch mountain range.
Less than an hour's drive away lie some of the world's leading ski resorts:
Park City, Deer Valley, Snowbird and Alta. 'Now this is living]' declares Mr
Thredgold, surveying the Park City ski slopes over lunch on a warm,
cloudless spring day.
Mr Thredgold, chief economist for KeyCorp, America's 11th largest bank, is
part of a significant US business and social trend: a rapidly growing number
of American companies and individual professionals are settling in the Rocky
Mountain region, attracted by its open spaces, low cost of living, and
pro-business politics.
Mr Thredgold's company is headquartered far off in the rustbelt state of
Ohio. But modern communications mean he can keep in touch from the mountains
of Utah, where he was raised.
He prefers to live here because of its quality of life, family and social
ties, and the perspective a western base gives his economic analysis. He
built his dream house for a fraction of what it would have cost in many
large US cities.
Many newcomers are fleeing the once golden state of California, tired of its
deep (though now ending) recession, regulatory red tape, high costs,
pollution and almost biblical succession of recent disasters - race riots,
earthquakes, and fires.
They have helped make the six states down the spine of the Rockies -
Montana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico - plus Nevada and
Arizona, the fastest-growing US region in recent years, measured by job
creation.
Admittedly, this growth is from a modest base. The region is a vast,
sparsely populated land, accounting for no more than 5 per cent of America's
GDP, and encompasses great extremes of geography, from desert to rolling
high plains.
Expansion is also bringing problems, ranging from social tensions between
Rocky Mountain natives and the newcomers to long-term questions about the
sustainability of growth and the adequacy of water supplies in this largely
arid region.
For now, however, the upturn is welcome in an area which has been
traditionally dependent on mining, oil, farming and forestry, with an
economic history of booms and busts tied to commodity cycles. In the late
1970s the region's main city, Denver, Colorado enjoyed spectacular expansion
on the back of a global oil crisis, but as crude prices fell in the 1980s,
the region missed out on the strong growth enjoyed by the US as a whole.
Ms Susan Piatt, of the Colorado state Office of Business Development, avoids
calling the current expansion a boom. 'It implies things are out of control
. . . We like to think its healthy growth and its our turn, because we were
so depressed when the rest of the nation was doing so well.'
Many of the companies coming to the Rockies are small - the kind of business
that is creating most new jobs in the US - and many of them are in
high-technology areas such as computing and medicine. For example, Boise,
the capital of Idaho, a state renowned for growing potatoes, had the
greatest job growth of any US city last year (6 per cent) and
high-technology employment there has expanded by more than 10 per cent a
year for the past six years.
Companies are attracted by the region's cheap labour (the Rockies have among
the lowest average wages in the US), and modest costs for utilities,
workers' benefits, housing and office space.
They also like the region's strong work ethic. Utah, the fastest-growing
Rocky Mountain state, with 6 per cent job growth last year, seems to be
benefiting in particular from the fact that 70 per cent of its population
belongs to the Mormon church, based in Salt Lake City. Mormons are known for
strong family values and emphasis on education and hard work.
Some companies also hope the quality of life in the Rockies - with its wide
open spaces, fresh air, low crime rate and small town values - will help
them attract and keep well-educated employees.
Says Ms DeeDee Corradini, Mayor of Salt Lake City: 'A decade ago, when I
talked to businesses about moving to an area like this, they wanted to know
what it meant for them financially. Today, I'm finding more and more asking:
'What's the quality of life? Will our employees and their families be happy
living there?' '
The influx of professional individuals - such as fund managers, lawyers,
computer experts, management consultants and writers - stems from two main
forces. First, a large pool of these freelances is being created as US
corporations, struggling to stay competitive, spin off service functions to
outsiders.
At the same time, modern communications - computer modems, fax machines and
satellite television - allow professionals to live where they choose, if it
is within striking distance of a good airport.
Mr Philip Burgess, who heads the Center for the New West, a Denver-based
think tank, calls the breed 'lone eagles' - mobile knowledge workers who
live by their wits.
'We are in an era of a great shift in lifestyle preferences,' he argues.
'More and more Americans are leaving big cities to pursue a better quality
of life.' This promises to revive small towns in attractive parts of the US,
recently deemed to be dying as Americans moved to city suburbs.
Several Rocky Mountain towns have begun wooing freelance professionals,
knowing they are not only highly paid but tend to sink their roots deep into
a community. Says Mr Burgess: 'They will serve on the library board and
perhaps run for the county commission, bringing new ideas and a fresh
perspective.'
For example, Telluride, a former mining town in the Colorado Rockies now one
of America's most fashionable ski resorts, has a project to build a
community wide computer network and improve communications with the outside
world. Locals boast it has the highest per capita ownership of personal
computers in the US.
But for all its benefits, the growth is also bringing problems. Many
long-time Rocky Mountain residents deeply resent the newcomers, their
wealth, cosmopolitan airs, and the inflationary impact on housing and farm
land, which could create a gulf between haves and have-nots. Tensions have
run particularly high in some Utah towns between straight-laced Mormons and
free-wheeling Californians.
The big challenge facing local politicians, says Mr Michael Leavitt, Utah's
governor, is to balance growth against preservation of quality of life: 'The
more attractive you are the more people want to come.'
Utah, for example, has become more discriminating about the kinds of
business it tries to attract. A few years ago it was happy to take all
comers. But Salt Lake City recently cold-shouldered a company which would
have brought jobs to the area but demanded large water treatment subsidies.
Even if quality of life can be maintained, there remain big question marks
over long-term growth. Industry may become less enthusiastic about the
Rockies when wage rates rise closer to the national average. And high
technology jobs can be destroyed by sudden technological shifts. California,
for its part, is starting to fight back against the business exodus, for
example by simplifying its red tape.
On top of all this, growth will eventually bring to the Rockies a problem
faced by all of the arid, western third of the US, but which regional
boosters like to ignore: a shortage of water, pitting state against state
and farmer against town-dweller.
Herculean damming and water diversion efforts mean this may not be a problem
for 20 to 30 years or more. But as the late Wallace Stegner, a leading
novelist and historian of the region, pointed out: 'Sooner or later the west
must accept the limitations imposed by aridity, one of the chief of which is
restricted human population . . .Ghost towns and dust bowls, like motels,
are western inventions.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts: Enter a man with a mission - Antony Thorncroft talks
to Lord Gowrie, the new chairman of the beleaguered Arts Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fifth floor suite at the Arts Council from which Lord Palumbo, as
chairman, watched over four fat years of rising arts subsidy and one
unhappy, final, year of strife and stringency, is empty. Gone is his
exquisite collection of contemporary art; gone the hothouse flowers. The
only decoration now is a photograph of Samuel Beckett propped up against the
wall. 'Beckett is my hero', says the new chairman, Lord Gowrie.
In a way, the empty room says it all. There is to be a fresh start; nothing
can be taken for granted; the organisation's battered reputation, both with
government and its arts clients, is going to be restored. Gowrie sees it as
his mission to save the Arts Council. 'I think ministers would find life
impossible without it,' he says. As a former arts minister, he should know.
Lord Palumbo, a diffident, reserved man, was disillusioned in his final year
of office by the fiasco over funding cuts for London orchestras and by the
Treasury's decision to cut the council's grant by Pounds 3.2m. Lord Gowrie,
54, is a much tougher individual, more adept at traversing political and
artistic minefields. A former chairman of Sotheby's, he is an arts junkie, a
published poet, and a former art dealer. After Eton and Oxford (where he
acquired his nickname, Grey, when his abundant hair prematurely acquired a
silvery tinge) he lectured in the US and advised on art until a Conservative
government desperate for young, energetic, supporters to do its business in
the House of Lords, wooed him with the job of arts minister in 1983.
He is married to the journalist Adelheid Grafin von der Schulenburg and,
though his main home is in Wales, he continues to be a ubiquitous presence
at London first nights. He lists book reviewing as his recreation in Who's
Who and he is a collector with very much the same modern tastes as Lord
Palumbo. This passion for modernism extends to all the arts. He was quick to
stand up and applaud at Covent Garden's recent revival of Harrison
Birtwistle's opera Gawain. In the current art world feud between 'brickies'
and conservatives he is proud to be a bricky, though an admirer of
minimalist Donald Judd rather than Tate bricklayer Carl Andre. And, of
course, he is a fan of Samuel Beckett, the literary icon of minimalism.
Gowrie's immediate objective is to persuade the government to restore the
cut in subsidy, now around Pounds 5m in real terms. 'The base level of
subsidy is too low. Just as it is hard for a pensioner to save a fiver so it
is for arts companies that are already cut to the bone'. To achieve this
change of heart he must first restore pride and confidence in an Arts
Council badly mauled by internal rows and a recent cost-saving redundancy
programme. The new secretary general, Mary Allen, is a Gowrie protegee and
is regarded as a step in the right direction: she has the task of cutting
back on the bureaucracy which bedevils the lives of council clients.
Gowrie has persuaded heritage secretary Peter Brooke to appoint some real
heavyweights to the council: new arrivals Trevor Nunn, Sir Richard Rodgers
and Thelma Holt - figures of international stature in the world of theatre,
opera and architecture - should help to repair its reputation among the
malcontents of the arts world. And it will be the council, as much as the
various specialist internal departments, that will decide policy.
'A lot of bets are off,' says Gowrie. 'I'm not bound to anything. I think
the Arts Council is like Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Sunset Boulevard. It
was a good show but it needed, and received, modification. The council needs
modification.' All those who thought that Lord Gowrie would quietly accept
the recent upheavals at the council - the internal reorganisation; the
devolution of clients to regional arts boards; the stillborn national arts
strategy - will be surprised. 'Everything is open'.
With the council licked into shape Gowrie can try to persuade the government
that the arts are one of the few British success stories of recent years.
'The arts are very cost-effective, with a tremendous spill over from the
public to the commercial. I remember 10 years ago going to see two young
Irish actors at the Roundhouse in a play about the hunger strikers. One of
them was Liam Neeson.'
Given the government's short sighted lack of support for a British film
industry, Neeson, the star of Schindler's List, is now lost to Hollywood,
and is not perhaps the best example of an Arts Council investment yielding a
profitable harvest. But Gowrie reels off some current achievements. Lucian
Freud is probably the best artist in the world; Thomas Allen's recent
triumph as Don Giovanni at La Scala, Milan; the LSO getting four encores
from the hard-boiled Germans in Frankfurt; the success of Diana Rigg as
Medea on Broadway and Darcy Bussell with the Royal Ballet in Washington.
Lord Gowrie believes that the message of British artistic acclaim abroad has
got through to the government, to the media, and to the public.
There was some surprise that Lord Gowrie, a non-executive director of
Sotheby's and bankers Guinness Mahon, was so keen to accept the chairmanship
of the Arts Council. To many, considering the London orchestras debacle and
the ensuing cries for the abolition of the council, it seemed a poisoned
chalice. And it was, after all, an unpaid post - apart from the perks of
car, chauffeur and endless free tickets. Gowrie had notoriously resigned
from the Conservative government in 1985 because he could not live in London
on a minister's salary of Pounds 33,000. But his desire to become chairman
of the Arts Council was not motivated solely by a dispassionate concern for
the state of the arts. There was one appealing lollipop: the arrival in the
next few months of the National Lottery. The council will distribute the
share going to the arts, perhaps Pounds 100m a year. 'It sugars the pill for
the whole arts community. I lobbied for a lottery 10 years ago but Lady
Thatcher disapproved of gambling.' He believes the government assurances
that the lottery money, designed only for capital projects in the arts, will
not be used as an excuse for cutting revenue funding. He also takes a
perhaps over-optimistic view of the ability of arts organisations to raise
matching money to qualify for a lottery grant.
But this is one of his hobby horses: his main achievement as arts minister
was the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme whereby the government topped
up money that arts organisations attracted from sponsors by their own
efforts. As chairman of the Serpentine Gallery he had little trouble raising
matching funding to take advantage of any grants going. But the Serpentine,
avant-garde and with some powerful modern patrons of art as supporters, is
hardly a typical British arts institution.
Lord Gowrie is firm. 'I will shake my fist at the government'; but he is
also practical. He has courted Mo Mowlem, the shadow heritage secretary. He
gets on well with Peter Brooke, who, for no very good reason, has been
tipped to lose his job in any reshuffle. Lord Gowrie comments: 'the country
needs continuity in important jobs. At the Serpentine I had to deal with six
different ministers'.
But he is talking equally tough to the arts. He has warned companies that
they must budget this year within the subsidy-cutting guidelines laid down
by the Heritage department. He is not a man for the barricades. He is also
frighteningly realistic, a rare quality in the arts where being starry eyed
and other-worldly is almost a qualification for a job.
In his first speech as chairman, to a conference organised by the Institute
of New International Visual Artists, the council's most expensive new
project, a planned exhibition space for multi-cultural art, Lord Gowrie
terrified the audience by pointing out that the council had been generous
initially but, in the current climate, he could not guarantee future funding
on such a scale. He is also glad-handing less glamorous gatherings, like the
association of district councils. He knows that local government spends as
much on the arts as the Arts Council.
It is clear that Lord Gowrie is going to throw himself enthusiastically at
the arts. He hopes to furnish his new office by charming a Roger Hilton
painting from the British Council to add to his modest collection of
sculptures by William Turnbull and Julian Sainsbury. He will be turning up
at the council five days a week, at least for the first few months. After
the self-effacing Lord Palumbo, the arts are in for a rude shock. Lord
Gowrie is a believer. He also sees himself as a player. He has just come
back from the Cannes film festival, where he had a walk on part. This
weekend he was off to the Hay-on-Wye festival, where he publicly read poetry
and interviewed RS Thomas. 'I'm a participant, too. I may be only a caddy
but I will keep on the greens.' Rarely has a caddy had so much influence on
the game.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts: ENO turns up the power - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was the most exciting performance seen at the London Coliseum for many
a month. It is said the health of an opera company should be judged by the
strength of its revivals. If so, English National Opera is in fine fettle,
if it can bring back a production three years old with as much bracing
immediacy as Peter Grimes.
It dates from 1991, the height of 'powerhouse' arrogance, when every
production wore its naked light-bulb with pride. Tim Albery's production of
Peter Grimes has the statutory light-bulb, but is surviving proof of the
dynamism that lit up the finest work of those years. Even if the brutalism
of the sets seems unnecessarily harsh, all that goes on within them is
electric, music drama with the power switched up to maximum.
Albery treats the opera as a late example of expressionism (Berg's Wozzeck,
a great influence on Britten, never seems far away). The people of the
borough form the faceless army of society, determined to destroy any
individual who does not conform. Peter Grimes is already unhinged at the
start and the opera is spent watching him teeter on the edge of the cliff,
ready to fall into a bottomless ocean of madness.
In the title role, Philip Langridge gives one of the essential operatic
portrayals of today. Shame and despair have seeped into every muscle of his
body; there are emotions here that Langridge seems to drag up from the pit
of Grimes's stomach. Each line of the text is stamped with individuality and
he is in good voice. With the conductor David Atherton pushing the music to
the brink, the impact is formidable.
So far this is a repeat of the cast from 1991. The newcomers this time
include Janice Cairns, who does not find the vocal writing for Ellen Orford
congenial, but gives the character a more determined personality than usual.
Alan Opie is sure and steady as the faithful sea-dog Balstrode. Among the
many smaller roles there is not one caricature, be it Ann Howard's fearsome
Madame of an Auntie, Susan Gorton playing Mrs Sedley as any nosey Grandma or
Alan Woodrow's near-hysterical Bob Boles. It is good news that the BBC is
filming the production for future broadcast.
There are 12 further performances until June 30.
The night before, Curlew River was performed in St Paul's Church as part of
the BOC Covent Garden Festival by Music Theatre Ulster, not with anything
like the same intensity, though the simplicity of this late Britten score
was generally respected.

Today Horizon celebrates its 30th anniversary. How has the programme managed
to survive so long and acquire such kudos? Benevolent neglect? Top people at
the BBC are predominantly arts graduates. Thanks to their own tastes there
are more series about the arts than the sciences, and they take an active
interest in the condition of the arts series. The BBC's main science
programme, on the other hand, has not regularly had its roots pulled up for
inspection. Consequently it has continued in the style established within
weeks of its launch in 1964: a serious single-issue programme treating its
audience as intelligent beings. The only cloud on the, er, horizon is a
recent tendency to make programmes about sociology instead of science.
Horizon - which today considers some of the scientific predictions of the
past 30 years - should stick with the world of laboratories and white rats
(8.00 BBC2). Later (9.00) BBC2 completes the programme begun last night,
Innocence Lost, about the American who was found guilty in 1992 of 99 cases
of child abuse and sentenced to 12 terms of life imprisonment.

FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Dornemann tipped to lead
Bertelsmann
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As QVC and Viacom hogged the financial headlines with their frenzied bidding
for Paramount last year, Bertelsmann, the German media group, was winning
frequent mentions as a would-be bidder, writes Michael Lindemann.
The group has made no secret of its desire to take a stake in Hollywood, and
with Michael Dornemann about to take over as head of the redesigned
entertainments division, speculation is rife that Bertelsmann may finally
step out of the sidelines.
The sums being paid for Hollywood media properties have never fitted into
Bertelsmann's conservative, family-owned philosophy. '(They) are completely
absurd,' Dornemann was quoted as saying recently, explaining the group's
reluctance to join the fight for Hollywood turf.
But while outright purchases have not been ruled out, Dornemann prefers the
idea of 'partnerships or mergers' where Bertelsmann could deploy its music
and television expertise.
Dornemann, whom sources tip as the successor to Mark Wossner, chief
executive since 1981, moved into entertainment when he took over the
Bertelsmann Music Group in 1987. Before that, he had masterminded the
takeover of Doubleday and RCA, the record label, as chief strategist at the
family-based company based in Gutersloh where it was founded in 1835.
The 49-year-old from Frankfurt studied at the Technical University in Berlin
before joining IBM in 1970. After seven years in computers, which included
time at European headquarters in Paris, Dornemann tested the waters at BMW
before moving to the Boston Consulting Group to run the Munich office for
four years.

FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): Band has hard act to follow at
Premier Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a long search for a new chairman, the Premier Group, one of South
Africa's largest and most successful food and retailing corporations has
announced that Doug Band, currently chief executive of media group Argus
Holdings, will take over from January 1, writes Mark Suzman.
Band will be replacing current chairman and chief executive Peter Wrighton,
who retires at 60. The new managing director will be Gordon Utian, Premier's
longstanding deputy md.
Wrighton's departure after seven years at the helm will mark something of a
break in the South African business scene; he will be a hard act to follow.
He is one of the most widely respected business leaders in the country by
both the stockbroking community, which has watched him lead Premier to 63
per cent compound growth over the past four years, and by the African
National Congress which has approvingly noted his enlightened approach on
hiring black managers and accommodating workers' demands.
By contrast, his successor has, since 1989, been running the Argus group
which recently sold its newspaper interests to Independent Newspapers. He
will stay on until the restructuring of Argus resulting from the sale is
complete while assuming the vice-chair of Premier from July 1. He has a
previous association with Premier from when he was chief executive of retail
and music group CNA/Gallo, in which both Premier and Argus have interests.
'My strength is in retailing and wholesaling. That's what I'll bring to
Premier,' he says.

FT  23 MAY 94 / People (Names in the News): George Trumbull touches down in
Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<TEXT>
The US executive invasion of corporate Australia continues with the
appointment of George Trumbull as the next chief executive of Australia's
largest investment group, the AMP Society, writes Bruce Jacques.
Trumbull, scheduled to take over in September when Ian Salmon retires, has
been recruited from the CIGNA insurance group in the US.
A former American football player, 49-year-old Trumbull has a reputation for
toughness and change. He'll need to score some early touchdowns when he
arrives at the Sydney headquarters next month.
Trumbull's appointment departs from more than a century of promotion from
within AMP. Perhaps his most challenging task will be to modify the creaky
internal structures of one of Australia's oldest corporate cultures. But he
is not alone. A number of his compatriots, including Robert Joss at Westpac,
and Frank Blount at Telecom, face similar tasks.
Early items on Trumbull's agenda are likely to include whether the Society
should demutualise in favour of an equity-based structure and whether it
should again look to banking after recent disastrous flirtations.
Trumbull has already spent nearly a quarter of a century overhauling large
parts of the CIGNA group. An economist with a degree from Dartmouth in 1966,
he also obtained a Masters degree in Business Management in 1968 from the
Dartmouth School of Business.

FT  23 MAY 94 / People: Crescendo for Sir George - Lucy Kellaway explains
that the opening of Glyndebourne's new opera-house this week is the pinnacle
of the chairman's career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On May 28 1934 a special train left London carrying a grumbling group of
music critics to a small town in Sussex. They were off to hear the Marriage
of Figaro at a new theatre built by a rich English eccentric in the garden
of his Elizabethan manor. Their expectation of the music was low, their
resentment at wearing dinner jackets and travelling 50 miles was high.
Yet the following day the newspapers carried rave notices, and Glyndebourne
has played to full houses ever since.
This Saturday, 60 years later to the day, 1,200 people will dress up and
make the same journey with gladder hearts. They too will hear the Marriage
of Figaro, performed in a new theatre built on the same site by the
founder's son, Sir George Christie.
His is the first important opera-house to be built in Britain this century,
and has been paid for without a penny of taxpayers' money.
The opening is a business triumph for Sir George. In 1987 when he first
floated a plan to knock down the ramshackle old 800-seat building and
replace it with an expensive new one, people thought he had lost his mind.
Yet doggedly, and without a hitch, he raised the Pounds 33m needed, and
witnessed the completion of a splendid new opera house in his back garden on
time and on budget.
Eat your heart out, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel. His project
was declared open earlier this month a year late, and at twice the initial
cost. And that was quick and cheap in comparison with the British Library,
still not ready more than three decades after the initial plans were drawn.
My first glimpse of Sir George is an expanse of scarlet sock seen through a
half open door where he is dictating to his secretary. He apologises for
running late, and directs me to his study next door. Here among the battered
leather-bound books and good furniture, a beige pug dog lies on a blue
pouffe.
It is hard to believe that a few yards away from this preposterously English
domestic scene scores of singers and musicians are engaged in earnest
pursuit of artistic excellence.
Likewise it is hard to believe that the genial, gentlemanly Sir George, who
presents himself in due course, is the executive chairman of the only opera
company in Britain that covers its costs without public assistance. As he
closes the door, he sets off the burglar alarm. 'Oh damn,' he says, and
disappears to turn it off.
On returning, he tells me of one evening last year, when he heard a pair of
thieves trying to get in through the window. He pursued them, giving chase
in his Mercedes. 'Their car wasn't all that fast. I was flashing and
peeping, but I couldn't get them to turn round so I could get a look at
them.'
Despite the red socks and the car chase, Sir George is no chip off his
father's eccentric block. While John Christie famously had his appendix
removed simply to keep his young opera singer wife company as she underwent
the same operation, his son appears measured and sensible.
Why did he embark on such an ambitious building plan in the first place? Sir
George refers to his 'venal' motives - as if unaware that the Financial
Times is sympathetic to this sort of thing. 'I wanted to make the theatre
bigger to respond to the audience demand, to provide additional box office
and to secure our long term future,' he says.
'The funding strategy had an element of commercialism,' he continues.
Strong-arm tactics might have been a better description. The aim was to get
most of the money from companies without granting them a larger share of the
tickets than the 30 per cent or so they claimed already.
In the nicest possible way, Sir George told the existing 230 corporate
members that unless they could each make him a present of up to Pounds
90,000 they could no longer be in the club. Some grumbled a little, but in
the end only four failed to get their cheque-books out.
That done, he approached the companies on the waiting list for corporate
membership. Fed up with what promised to be a 900-year wait (300 were
waiting and on average only one member dropped out every three years) some
70 companies came forward, each paying up to Pounds 120,000 for the
privilege.
I express amazement at the pulling power of Glyndebourne, and he shrugs. Its
uniqueness has been a fact of life for him since babyhood. He attributes it
to freedom from 'the vagaries of government funding', to its season of three
short summer months, above all to the high reputation of the performances.
Only when pressed does he add Glyndebourne's snob value to the list; 'the
family's presence unquestionably has an effect.'
It is not only special to the audience but to the singers, who readily agree
to spend the summer singing at Glyndebourne for a fraction of the rate they
might get elsewhere.
The successful completion of the new building was partly down to luck; Sir
George raised the money in a boom, and built the theatre in a recession. But
good timing alone does not explain how seven consultants and 50
subcontractors worked together so well. The secret, he says, was running the
project 'on a personal level. It has not been subject to huge committees and
sub-committees'.
Sir George will have been running the company from his home above the shop
for over four decades when he reluctantly steps down six years from now.
Then he will be 65 and his second son Augustus, who is his chosen heir, will
be in his mid-30s. 'Gus makes wildlife films, which makes him ideally suited
for the job.'
Augustus is no worse qualified than his father was when he took over at the
age of 23. Sir George had always known he would assume the mantle and was
brought up to be passionate about opera. But at the time he was 'completely
green', and certainly couldn't read a balance sheet. Yet soon he found
himself plunged into the rude world of commerce.
Sir George shakes his head at the memory of the more impulsive business
ventures, which the sensible son was forced to unwind on his father's death.
'He owned a 120-bedroom hotel in north Devon, called the Sultan Sands. It
was a disastrous investment.'
It would be wrong to present him as merely the business behind the music.
Although he has no training in opera - he's an 'enthusiastic amateur', he
says - he is closely involved in commissioning the works. The triumvirate -
Sir George, the general director, Anthony Whitworth-Jones, and the music
director, Andrew Davis - ensure the quality of the performances. In his
younger days he used to tour Europe looking for singers, but latterly has
given up his talent scouting because he loathes living out of a suitcase.
Apart from the singers, who are on freelance contracts, Glyndebourne has a
permanent staff of about 50, many of whom have worked there for decades. 'I
know it sounds smug, but we don't have a motivation problem here,' says Mark
Beddy, the finance director.
Saturday's opening should mark the pinnacle of his career, yet Sir George is
showing no sign of nerves. 'I'm so thrilled with the acoustics. I adore the
look of the auditorium.' Evidently, he feels it will be more than all right
on the night.
Later, after our interview, I bump into him in the staff canteen. He and his
wife are queueing up for their canelloni, chatting and joking with some of
the singers.
Being chairman of Glyndebourne must be nice work if you can get it. Or, as
Sir George prefers to think of the job: 'It is better than being a dentist
or a vet.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Faxing daily papers around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rather special edition of the Financial Times popped out of fax machines
in Australia and New Zealand last week. The first fax edition of the paper
is also on its way to Bermuda and South Africa and other places where its
international edition still arrives late in the day or after the day of
publication.
Wednesday's four-page fax edition - on pink paper - led with news of the
latest losses at Lloyd's, the London insurance market, and naturally carried
the Lex column. There was also a list of all the companies mentioned in the
main edition, to encourage readers to buy the full paper. The special
edition is free to readers - although providers such as hotel owners pay a
fee based on the number of rooms they have.
Distribution by cruise lines and airlines is also being explored.
The modest testing of a faxed FT is the latest sign that, after seven years
of trying, Vince Waterson, business development director of Faxcast, is
getting somewhere in marrying fax technology and the vertical blanking
interval in television pictures to create something new.
The data carrying capacity of the spare lines in the television signal,
satellite and cable as well as conventional TV, is enormous and is much
cheaper than international telephone lines. Add a special receiver linked to
the fax machine and you have a new international publishing tool.
Waterson is already running trials on fax editions of the New York Times and
is looking at everything from transmitting meteorological information to
credit card validation.
He has backing of Dollars 25m from investors ranging from the Bank of
Bangkok to Compagnie General des Eaux of France.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Question of two-way traffic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewers in the UK and the rest of Europe who think they can do better than
television game show contestants are about to get the chance to prove it -
and win prizes as well, writes Raymond Snoddy.
Interactive Network, a UK-based company set up by Bill Andrewes, a former
senior executive of the Granada group, plans to launch trials in July of
what it calls Two Way Television.
Two Way TV plans to make television interactive by piggy-backing on existing
programmes such as the Blockbusters quiz show or live sport. A range of Two
Way TV games can also be loaded into the set-top box that operates the
system. The communication link is not provided by cable or 'superhighways'
but, like teletext, uses the blank lines in the television picture.
Interactive Network has developed technical concepts licenced from the US
and believes it will be offering the first interactive TV of its kind in
Europe.
The company has developed a simple push button keypad and mouse to enable
viewers to register their answers to the questions in a quiz show. Scores
then go up on the screen.
Families can simply play against each other or have their scores sent
automatically by freephone to a central computer which pick the winners.
There will be top prizes of Pounds 1,000 to make the games interesting.
The system will be launched in the UK later this year or early next and
there is already considerable interests from other European countries.
Prices have not yet been fixed but the set-top box and four keypads will
probably cost between Pounds 160-Pounds 180. A monthly subscription will
cost about Pounds 6, with a complete rental package available in the region
of Pounds 12.
As former chairman of Granada Rental, Andrewes says he is very aware how
slowly consumers generally take up new technology. 'This is a first little
step towards interactive TV.' He has already raised Pounds 4m for the
venture and is in the process of raising a further Pounds 10m.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Commercial break-up? - Advertising prospects
in an interactive age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first television advertisement appeared on NBC's WNBT channel in
New York on July 1, 1941. It showed a Bulova clock ticking, lasted 20
seconds, and cost Dollars 9. A little more than half a century later,
television advertising in the US is a Dollars 30bn-a-year industry, and it
is hard to imagine life without the commercial break.
Yet that is the prospect that haunts Ed Artzt, chairman and chief executive
of Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant. At a gathering of
advertising agency leaders in West Virginia this month, Artzt shocked his
audience by asking: 'What if there is no place for traditional television
advertising in the new media age?'
For Artzt, the answer is of more than academic interest. Procter &amp; Gamble is
not only the world's biggest advertiser, but spends nearly 90 per cent of
its Dollars 3bn-a-year advertising budget on television commercials. The
loss of such a powerful promotional tool could have unthinkable consequences
for the company.
But why the alarm? Can there really be any prospect that television
advertising is going to disappear?
If media prophets are right, television is set to change radically over the
next few years. Mass broadcasting to a passive audience will be replaced by
hundreds of viewer-controlled interactive channels that will give people the
information or entertainment they want, on demand. The danger for
advertisers is that, even supposing there is a place for commercials in this
new era, people will prefer to watch (or interact with) the channels that do
not show them.
US advertising agencies argue that this is an over-simplification. Not
surprisingly, they like to see interactive television as an opportunity
rather than a threat. For example, they say, imagine someone wanting to buy
a new car. The viewer of the future might welcome the opportunity to tune
into a special channel featuring nothing but car advertisements  -
particularly if he or she could conduct a dialogue with the screen, asking
for more information about performance or safety features of different
models. The same could apply to household appliances, electronic goods, or
any other sort of purchase where consumers want to make an informed choice.
Other advertising opportunities would become available on channels
specialising in sports and hobbies. Viewers of a golfing channel, for
example - just like readers of a golfing magazine - would welcome
advertisements telling them what products were available and where they
could buy them. Similarly, a fashion channel equivalent of Vogue magazine
could be crammed with advertisements for clothing and cosmetics.
This, however, does not answer Artzt's question. Where are advertisements
for Procter &amp; Gamble's products going to appear five years from now? Viewers
will not want to tune into a special channel featuring interactive
advertisements for Fairy washing-up liquid; nor will they expect their
golfing programmes to be interrupted with advertisements for Tide.
According to Barry Linsky, senior vice president for planning and business
development at the Interpublic group of advertising agencies, the gloom is
overdone. True, he says, there are likely to be a lot of pay-per-view
channels without advertising in the interactive future. But there is no
evidence to suggest that viewers are prepared to pay significantly more for
their entertainment than they do today, so most programming will continue to
be supported by advertisements.
Prof Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, disagrees. Theoretically, he points out, if
manufacturers were no longer paying for television advertising, their
products would become proportionally cheaper, so consumers would have more
money to spend on home entertainment.
More significantly, Negroponte points to a future where programming is
indeed still supported by advertisements - but advertisements aimed directly
at the individual. For example, people using their interactive screens to
book a salmon-fishing holiday in Scotland might switch on a baseball game
the next day to find themselves watching advertisements for outdoor clothing
or fly-fishing equipment in the commercial break.
Over time, interactive television would build up such accurate profiles of
individuals from their viewing and buying habits that every advertisment
would be individually tailored to meet their wants and needs. One commercial
might suggest you book a table at Lutece for your wedding anniversary
tomorrow; another could recommend a Hermes tie to match that shirt you
bought last week; a third might remind you that you usually change your car
around this time, and suggest you look at the new Lexus.
And so, yet again, Artzt's question comes back: where does that leave
Procter &amp; Gamble? Or for that matter, Coca-Cola, or Colgate-Palmolive, or
Kelloggs, or all those other manufacturers of hum-drum packaged goods that
rely so heavily on repetitive advertising to support their brands?
Well, you could always pay people to watch their commercials, says Keith
Reinhard, chairman and chief executive of the advertising agency DDB Needham
Worldwide. He isn't joking. You could have machines on top of the television
set that would reward people for watching advertisements by printing out
money-off coupons. Or you could offer people a choice of viewing: watch the
movie for Dollars 3 with the commercials or Dollars 5 without them.
'Maybe people will go to the washroom while some of the commercials are
playing,' says Reinhard. 'But we've always had that problem - how to keep
viewers engaged.'
Another possibility is a return to 1950s-style advertiser - supplied
programming, where one company or one brand supports an entire programme.
Procter &amp; Gamble has been sponsoring daytime 'soaps' - domestic dramas - in
the US since the beginning of commercial TV, which explains their name.
Even so, Negroponte maintains that he cannot imagine any context where he
would want to see a Tide commercial in the interactive world. If he is
right, the consequences could be devastating for sales of everyday branded
goods.
Negroponte's advice? 'I think if I was Procter &amp; Gamble, I'd be buying
billboard space,' he says. 'A lot of it.'

Sega, the Japanese video games maker, is set to launch a cable TV
games-on-demand service on a dozen US cable networks later this month and in
Japan a few weeks later.
In the US, the 'Sega Channel' will be available to almost half of the
country's 60m cable TV subscribers. A joint venture between Sega and two of
the largest cable companies, TCI and Time Warner, it represents the cable
industry's first interactive service.
Sega said the services would begin in Japan in three regions - Tokyo,
Nagano, in northern Japan and Mie, in the south. Subscribers to Tokyo Cable
Network, LCV in Nagano and Cable Television Yokkaichi will be able to use
the service.
In Japan, Sega will charge a monthly fee of Y3,000 (Dollars 29) which will
cover the cost of renting a special cartridge that plugs into the Sega video
game machine, and playing as many of the games available as many times as
desired.
In the US, it says the service will be priced in line with 'premium' cable
TV channel services, which typically cost about Dollars 15 per month.
Compared to the cost of new game cartridges, which typically sell for about
Dollars 50-Dollars 60, this may be a bargain for video game enthusiasts.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Drawing across the phone line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers are now pouring cold water on the idea that the principal
benefit of videophones - telephones equipped with screens and videocameras -
is the ability to see the person at the other end of the line, writes Alan
Cane.
Much more important, they say, is the capacity to work together on the same
task - a document, say, or a chart. In other words, the ability to share a
workspace over the telephone line. Development engineers at Hewlett Packard,
the US electronics group, are in the latter stages of developing a product
which exploits this finding.
Called the 'deskslate', it is essentially an interactive fax machine,
enabling two people linked by a telephone line to examine, modify and
annotate the same document.
Each has to have their own deskslate. It consists of a flat tablet about the
size of a desk ledger; most of the top surface is taken up with a
high-definition liquid display screen. Prototypes at HP's Bristol UK
research centre have large personal computers hidden under the desk, to
drive them, but the aim of the development engineers is to shrink the
electronics into the slate itself.
An electronic stylus is provided to write on the screen and the slate is
linked to a telephone handset. Documents, plans, memos and so on can be put
into the slate by a variety of means - scanning or transmission from a
conventional fax machine or personal computer.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Sonic boost for Rocket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rocket Science Games has moved onto the multimedia scene as one of the most
promising start-up companies in the growing market for interactive computer
games, writes Louise Kehoe.
This week the Silicon Valley company got cash backing from Sega Enterprises,
the Japanese video games company, Sega's venture firm CSK Ventures, and
Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), the German music and entertainment group.
Together these have invested Dollars 12m.
Rocket's launch team exemplifies the trend to splice Silicon Valley with
Hollywood. The company's game developers are drawn partly from the computer
industry and partly from the movie business.
Steven Blank, Rocket president and chief executive, is quick to point out,
however, that the much talked about notion of blending talent from these
disparate cultures is easier said than done.
'The 'Hollywood type' is potentially the kiss of death (for an interactive
entertainment developer), if you find the wrong one,' he says. 'We don't
have fancy Hollywood directors or actors. The people we have are out of the
special effects business.'
Rocket will introduce its first two games in time for Christmas sales this
year.
Its games will combine the rich graphics of CD-ROM - the computer cousin of
the music CD - with the fast action of cartridge video games, Blank says.
Until now, these attributes have been mutually exclusive because CD-ROMs are
relatively slow and video game cartridges have limited capacity to store
complex graphic images.
Rocket has developed technology it calls 'Game Science' that speeds up the
performance of CD-ROMs by organising the layout of data on the disk so that
the next image required in a game can be quickly located.
Unlike most game developers, Rocket will offer games to run both on personal
computers and on Sega CD video game machines. Sales of games that play on
video game machines reached Dollars 5.3bn last year, while sales of computer
games were only about Dollars 800m, so the dual approach is a necessity,
Blank says. Even before it launches its first products, Rocket is winning
wide attention. 'The best buzz in Silicon Valley at the moment is about
Rocket Science,' says Lee Isgur, a multimedia analysts with Volpe, Welty in
San Francisco.

Democracy has its dangers when it comes to development. We learned two weeks
ago that the entire future of the London CrossRail project (a joint British
Rail/London Transport plan for a tunnel from Paddington in the west to
Liverpool Street in the east) was put in jeopardy, perhaps permanently, by
MP's voting against it in an arcane committee.
In this case Parliament has not represented the views of those who live and
work in the capital. Michael Cassidy, chairman of the policy and resources
committee of the Corporation of London, wrote last week that the views of
the City was not sought by the Commons' committee. The City sees CrossRail
as a key component in plans for continued improvement of the area as a
centre of European wealth generation.
More evidence that both government is out of touch over the kind of
planning, building and investment that the majority want to see in the
capital came in a Gallup poll, commissioned by property consultants Richard
Ellis. It disclosed that more than half the world's largest investors
believe the government is not doing enough to support London as a financial
centre. About 81 per cent of those interviewed felt 'the efficiency of
London as a city has been impaired because of the UK government's
unwillingness to invest public money in its transport system.'
London is more than its transport system. It is its architecture and its
town planning and its social ambience. Yet key decisions, taken in
mysterious ways, decide major aspects of the city's future. As a guide to
the significance of decisions as fundamental as CrossRail, it is worth
looking backwards to see how important decisions have been made in the past.
The post-war rebuilding in the city in the 1950s and 1960s was in a similar
style to that in bomb damaged German cities - the glass and concrete style
of the Bauhaus was the architectural victor of the war. It inflicted equal
pain on both sides. The City of London had a second major wave of building
in the 1980s with an office boom which bequeathed the curious post modern
style - a kind of decorated Bauhaus with more marble and granite. Barclays
Bank's recently completed head office probably represents its apotheosis.
This wave had a partially hidden agenda. The City was bothered by the sudden
growth of London Docklands and so in response gave developers almost free
rein to build inside the City's boundaries. It was something of a panic
reaction, which demonstrated the lack of much needed collaboration between
the City and Docklands.
London was already much too big and badly serviced. The Docklands
development was largely unnecessary and largely happened because businesses
going to the enterprise zone on the Isle of Dogs were tempted large tax
breaks.
Docklands is living proof that laissez-faire planning does little for a
city. If a total London view had been taken of the area's role there was a
strong argument for making it a large water and landscaped river park for
the East End, surrounded by new houses to replace the tower blocks of Tower
Hamlets. Controlled commercial and industrial development should have been
balanced with residential, leisure and infrastructure uses.
The devotion of planners, developers and the rating system to the zoning
whole areas solely for offices, combined with a refusal to improve transport
leads to a grim life in working London. Why is it so rare for people to live
where they and others work, in the City or the West End? Why is it so hard
to find in London the kind of cultural street life you find in New York or
Paris? Why are architects so frustrated? Because they are being asked to
design endless offices and very little public architecture or private
housing.
Once a city is agreeable and efficient to live in it will attract
employment. London has for some time had its priorities wrong. Nobody needed
the bankrupt Canary Wharf; no one needs the empty offices in the City; no
one (except Peter Palumbo) needs the proposed offices at No. 1 Poultry. Many
of us in London need better public transport and want better housing.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel: No survival kit necessary - Visiting many
east European cities is a pleasant surprise after Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I set off recently for eastern Europe with the pugnacious attitude and
survival kit - cigarettes, US dollars in small, unmarked bills, and snack
food - that would be necessary for travelling in the former Soviet Union. In
the old, communist days, eastern Europe was only a slightly kinder, gentler
version of the Soviet Union, and in Russia these days travel has, in some
respects, become more difficult.
But my painstaking preparations proved unnecessary. The eastern European
heartland of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary has successfully emerged
from the Warsaw Pact, and now have some of the highest rates of economic
growth on the continent.
The first pleasant surprise was the new Warsaw airport. It is clean,
well-lit and easy to pass through. Most Europeans and US citizens can enter
the country without a visa, but even the Greeks, Turks and Canadians who do
require visas can purchase them from friendly border guards for Pounds 30.
Visas, like almost everything else in Poland, are sold for zloty, the
national currency, which, after its flirtation with hyper-inflation, is on
its way to stability. Changing money straightaway at the airport is a better
idea than expecting to pay in dollars.
The average fare for the half-hour ride from the airport to the city is
about Dollars 15 and Polish cabbies are polite, likely to speak at least
rudimentary English, and charge according to the meter. It is worthwhile
chatting to your driver, because Warsaw's cityscape - the legacy of Poland's
fierce resistance to Nazi Germany - is unfailingly bleak.
The communist-era eyesores, however, do offer one benefit: unlike
better-preserved east European cities, Warsaw is relatively free of
tourists, making hotel and restaurant reservations easier. The best place to
stay is the gleaming Marriot Hotel, whose shiny towers in the center of the
city are striking evidence of the arrival of capitalism in Poland.
For a more authentically Polish experience, have lunch or supper at the
Belvedere Restaurant, perched on the corner of a park - 20 minutes from the
centre - where, legend has it, Polish kings used to retire for trysts with
their mistresses.
From Warsaw, it is an hour's flight to Prague, where the airport, border
controls and taxi service are likewise hassle-free. The similarities end
upon arrival in the city itself. Czech pragmatism preserved Prague from
devastation during the second world war, and communism protected it from the
excesses of the capitalist developers. Prague remains one of the most
beautiful cities in Europe.
The Czech capital has become a popular destination for a nomadic tribe of
American college graduates, who spend a year soaking up the atmosphere of
older civilizations and hanging out, before joining the real world of suits
and CVs. Czech officials claim Prague was one of the most visited capitals
in the continent last year.
For business people, this is a drawback. Finding a hotel room in the city,
especially after the summer tourist season begins, can be a nightmare. Avoid
it by booking rooms well in advance, especially if you want to stay at the
magnificient art deco Hotel Europa, which is already receiving reservations
for July. As a last resort, hotel booking services at the airport can
usually be adequate.
I fled the tour groups, easily identified by the brightly coloured umbrellas
held aloft by their guides, and took to the hills in a car rented from one
of the half dozen western agencies with offices in the centre of the city.
The gently rolling Bohemian countryside, dotted with medieval fortresses, is
a Euro Disney fantasy but without the crowds.
Less than 150km south of Prague, on narrow but quiet, well-maintained roads,
the walled town of Cesky Krumlov, dominated by a castle on hills overlooking
the twisting Vltava river, makes a particularly pretty day trip.
From southern Bohemia, Budapest is a bucolic four-hour drive (most
car-rental agencies permit drop-offs in other cities). Travel via Austria:
the roads are better and the borders are civilised. Best of all, the
contrast, or lack of it, between the Czech, Austrian and Hungarian border
towns is heartening evidence of how quickly eastern Europe is catching up
with the rest of the continent in terms of living standards.
The Hungarian capital itself combines Prague's architectural charm with
Warsaw's grittier economic dynamism. Do not be put off by the airport, which
is slightly drabber than those of the other eastern capitals, or the
language, which is impenetrable to travellers with no knowledge of Finnish
or Estonian. Just three hours by train from Vienna, Budapest is arguably the
most cosmopolitan city in eastern Europe, with fine, comfortable hotels -
try the Kempinski on the Pest side of the city - and dozens of lively
restaurants and night-clubs.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Orly offers optionof convenience - Why UK
travellers might want to fly to the newly accessible airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ceasefire in the so-called Battle for Orly, brokered last weekend after
tough negotiations between the British and French governments, means that UK
airlines will be able to fly from London to the southern Paris airport by
the end of June. For potential passengers the question is: why should they
want to do so?
There are several reasons. At the top of the list is convenience for those
travelling on to other French destinations. British Airways estimates that
about 80 per cent of domestic French airline traffic flies in and out of
Orly. The opening of the airport will avoid the need to trek across Paris
from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport to make a domestic connection.
For many travellers, Orly will also represent a more convenient port of
access to Paris. A shuttle from the airport links with the RER, the
high-speed underground railway, which whisks passengers into central Paris.
The total journey takes about 35 minutes from Les Halles or St Michel in the
heart of the city, slightly less than the journey from Charles de Gaulle
airport. The more southern the destination in Paris, the more attractive
Orly is.
To start with, the services will be limited to three carriers: British
Airways, its French affiliate TAT European Airlines, and Air UK. BA plans to
operate four return flights daily from London Heathrow to Orly, in
partnership with TAT.
Air UK is planning to operate six return flights daily between London
Stansted and Orly, in place of its five daily flights to Charles de Gaulle
airport.
'We believe that Orly will prove more popular than Charles de Gaulle because
of its proximity to the principal commercial and residential areas of Paris
and because of its better domestic con-nections,' says Mr Andrew Gray, Air
UK's managing director.
Other airlines are also planning services. Virgin, British Midland and
Lufthansa have expressed interest in operating the London-Orly route,
although they have not yet announced any concrete plans.
Despite the potential advantages of Orly, however, there are some caveats
for passengers to bear in mind. A one-day strike last week by Air Inter, the
French airline that has a monopoly on most domestic routes, caused the
cancellation of virtually all of its flights resulting in disruption at Orly
airport.
Unions at Air Inter say they plan further industrial action in protest
against the liberalisation of the internal French airline market.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel: You don't have to feel in the dark -
Richard Tomkins offers tips on finding your way around the confusing New
York subway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Riding the New York subway is tantamount to signing a suicide note, right?
If you are not shot by a drug-crazed psychopath, you will surely be knifed
in a mugging or caught in the cross-fire between warring urban tribes.
Actually, if that ever was the case, things have changed a bit. A sustained
anti-crime campaign that began on the New York subway in 1990 is paying off.
The city's transit police say that, of the 1,960 homicides that took place
in New York last year, only eight were committed on the subway - from which
they draw the slightly wayward conclusion that you are much safer below
ground than you are above it.
Whatever the statistics, visitors to New York need have no hesitation in
using the subway to get around. Nowadays the system is not only safe, but
after years of heavy investment, it has become reasonably reliable. On
longer trips up and down Manhattan, it is much faster than a taxi. And at a
flat fare of Dollars 1.25 a trip, it is cheap.
On the other hand, it is not one of the world's most user-friendly subways:
signposting is poor and the system has several quirks. So, for the novice,
here are a few tips.
First, there are no tickets. Instead, you buy metal tokens from booths at
the station entrances and use them to operate turnstiles leading to the
platforms. There is no discount of any sort for bulk purchases. An
electronic pre-payment card (the Metrocard) is being phased in, but it does
not yet work at all stations.
While at the token booth, be sure to pick up a subway map because they are
scarce on platforms and trains. As you will see, most of the lines run on a
north-south axis underneath the big avenues, so the system is rarely much
use for cross-town journeys.
A big source of confusion to visitors is the way the trains and lines are
described. Officially, the trains carry numbers or letters to tell you where
they are going (for example, the number 1 train or the N train). But they
are also named after the avenues they follow (such as the Lexington Avenue
Express or the Broadway Local). And the lines are still widely known by the
initials of the companies that built them - hence, the IRT, the BMT and the
IND.
Note that there are two types of train: locals, stopping at all stations,
and expresses, stopping only at the main ones. Different trains often share
the same tracks, so it is important to check the train's number or letter
before you get on. If in doubt, ask: once they are convinced that you are
not going to kill them, New Yorkers are extremely friendly.
You should feel perfectly safe on the subway in Manhattan throughout the day
and evening, although, as in any big city, it makes sense to keep an eye on
your personal belongings. If for any reason you feel apprehensive, you can
sit next to the conductor's cabin in the centre of the train.
Finally, one quirk that all repressed engine-drivers should experience is
the carriage configuration that enables passengers to stand next to the
driver's cab at the front of many trains. Top tip is to do this on the B
train to Brooklyn. That way, you can play engine-driver as you go rattling
over Manhattan Bridge and enjoy an excellent view of the Manhattan skyline
as you come back - assuming, of course, you can elbow the other children out
of the way.

Vnukovo Airlines, the main Russian domestic carrier, hopes to certify the
new Tupolev Tu-204 medium-range airliner by the end of this year, an
official said. The airline plans to use the 214-seat twin-jet on internal
routes to replace the ageing Tupolev Tu-154 airliner. Three Tu-204s are at
present carrying out regular cargo flights inside Russia and abroad. The
first flight tests for the passenger version of the jet started in December
and no serious problems have been reported, the official said. Some
passenger variants of the new aircraft will be fitted with Russian engines
and some with power plants made by Rolls-Royce of the UK.

were criticised for living decadent lives, say airline officials. CAL has
ordered all flight personnel not to play mahjong while travelling, Hsu
Chia-yen, director of the flight operation division, was quoted as saying.
Taiwan has launched an overall examination of its aviation security after a

Alliances would help small airlines cut costs, which he said were 25 per

They had also to 'spend some money on promotion and advertising', he said.

They sound like lyricist and songwriter or a comedy duo. But in fact Eddie
Haan and Trafton Cole were shoemakers from Chicago in the 1920s. Like
Kleenex and Hoover, Cole-Haans are almost a generic term to Americans. The
penny and the tassel loafer for instance - both very Ivy League, very Scott
Fitzgerald - are traditional Cole-Haans in the US. You can almost see Gatsby
putting on his scotch grain, moccasin construction, cushioned heel
Cole-Haans before choosing from that incredible shirt collection.
Today those handsewn moccasins would cost him Pounds 149 and he could have
them with or without tassell in many shades of brown and black leather, as
well as in suede.
At the company headquarters in Yarmouth, Maine, craftsmen still concentrate
on the artisan touches of the Cole-Haan brand. These include quality of fit,
hand-burnishing the leather (which brings out its character), intricate
hand-weaving and hand-tooling for Western Boots, British Oxfords and what
they call classic Bucks.
Launched at Harrods, Cole-Haans for men have only been in Europe since late
last year, although some of the women's shoes have been available earlier.
In the US they are worn on every campus, in every office and, the
ever-popular deck shoes, in every resort.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: After The Gold Rush - Reading matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stewart Lansley and the Henley Centre. Random House, Pounds 20, pp269
It is an old cliche that money does not make you happy. It is also a
pressing political reality that economic growth has made much of the
developed world not just unhappy, but bitterly divided and socially
unstable. This is commonly blamed on a decline in spiritual values, which
may be true but is of limited use in policy terms. What is needed is a more
objective look at the phenomenon, which may give clues on whether it is
reversible.
Stewart Lansley's After The Gold Rush is a fair shot at a daunting topic.
The author starts with a grim picture of a developed world in crisis:
mounting unemployment, a widening gulf between the rich and poor, a
declining belief in government and the onset of what he terms 'the politics
of exclusion'.
The root cause, Lansley argues, is that rising affluence has brought with it
a change in the nature of consumption. People can afford the essentials, and
concentrate instead on 'symbolic goods', such as a flash car or a second
home: goods whose essential point is what they say, not just about those who
own them but those who do not.
Together with this has come the rise of what Lansley terms 'competitive
individualism', whereby most people seek to shake off collective
responsibilities. This, he suggests, explains such developments as the fall
in top tax rates across the developed world in the past 20 years, and the
drop in trade union membership.
So is there a way out? Ultimately, says Lansley, that depends on one crucial
question: whether people will reach saturation point in their demand for
symbolic goods. If so, they can opt for more leisure, altruistic concern for
others and rational use of scarce resources. Will that happen? Only perhaps,
says Lansley. 'There is reason to believe such a limit exists, but that we
are not yet close to it.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: How to cut that car tax burden - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are paying more tax than last year because of your company car, there
are ways of reducing the burden.
Under the new car tax system introduced in April, employees pay tax on 35
per cent of the manufacturer's list price of the car when new, plus the
price of any accessories and value added tax. (Drivers with personalised
number plates can now heave a sigh of relief - the Inland Revenue recently
confirmed that these do not qualify as accessories.)
Buying a second-hand car will not help reduce the tax bill because you will
still be taxed on its full retail price. However, if your company car is
four or more years old at the end of the tax year, the list price will be
reduced by one third.
The age of the car is measured from the date it was first registered, so
those registered before April 6, 1991 will qualify for the reduction in
1994-95.
The tax burden can also be brought down for those who are able to increase
their business mileage. Drivers covering 2,500 - 17,999 business miles will
have a reduction of one-third on their assessment, while those covering more
than 18,000 will receive a discount of two-thirds.
So, if the car's list price (including VAT, accessories etc) is Pounds
18,000, you would be taxed on 35 per cent of this, that is, on Pounds 6,300.
If you drive more than 18,000 miles, the tax charge would be on Pounds 2,100
and if the car is also more than four years old, the taxable amount would
fall to Pounds 1,400.
Another savings tactic is to drive a van. Maurice Parry Wingfield, tax
partner at Touche Ross chartered accountant says: 'While driving a van will
not be to everyone's taste, there are many kinds of 'van' to consider,
including four-wheel drive pick-ups, which are often used by people as
leisure vehicles.'
If none of these ideas work, probably because your car is a perks car with
business usage of under 2,500 miles, you may be considering opting for a
salary increase instead of the car. The problem is of course that you will
be taxed at your marginal rate on the increased salary.
However, if you also need a car for your private use, the most tax efficient
method might be to take a smaller salary increase, combined with an interest
free loan from your employer to buy a car yourself. This is how it might
work. If you were buying the car from your employer, you would have to buy
it at 'market value' to avoid further tax. The loan benefit will not be
taxed so long as you only borrow up to Pounds 5,000 and you do not have any
other outstanding loans from your employer.
Andrew Frape, tax partner at chartered accountant Wheawill &amp; Sudworth,
reminds those running a private car that charging your employer business
mileage is attractive. Under the Inland Revenue's Fixed Profit Car Scheme,
the employer pays tax-free mileage allowances to employees for business
miles they cover with their own car. As long as the amount paid does not
exceed the set rates, under the scheme you will not be taxed on the cash
received.

<TEXT>
Football has not gone away, it has merely gone to America. Yet for England
the season is over. Am I the only person to think that this is not a
tragedy, not an injustice, but a blessing? What English football needs now
is a rest: reculer pour mieux sauter.
England did not deserve to qualify for the World Cup. They had the ability
to do so and they squandered it. Under Terry Venables they have given three
performances vastly superior to those under Graham Taylor, in that the team
now seems to be playing football rather than wasting time in between set
pieces. But this fragile, if promising, renaissance hardly justifies the
feeling that England have been done out of their rights and that it is,
somehow, somebody else's fault that they are stuck at home this summer.
Alright, England didn't get asked to the party of the year and then, after
the invitations were sent out, they metamorphosed from physically repellent
collectors of Dr Who memorabilia into Debs' Delight. But at a time when the
team is rebuilding itself it is better, far better, to be cool, to be
absent, to hint at what might have been but probably would not have been, to
watch poor old Ireland huff and puff against the runny, ice cream-fluidity
of the Italians and to be spared the powerful embarrassment of singing a
World Cup song.
The season's song was sung, instead, by Manchester United who, in a strange
way, became the object of the focus that is normally concentrated upon a
national team. Romantics loved them and curmudgeons hated them for their
careless, sporadic superiority. They aroused strong, unifying emotions, even
in people who supported neither them nor their rivals. Almost every event of
the season was viewed in relation to this one team: Aston Villa did not win
the Coca Cola Cup, they stopped Manchester United winning it. Blackburn did
not nearly win the League, they nearly stopped Manchester United winning it.
Respect for the team was often grudging but always great; when they achieved
the double with an FA Cup winning performance as cheerless as the sky above
it, the complaints were not borne of mere churlishness but of a child-like
disappointment that, on their glory day, the glory boys had played no
differently to any other team.
Still, they have had their effect upon English football. The feeling that
England deserves to be in the World Cup finals is not unconnected to the
sense of pride, of style, of a story worth following, that has been
instilled in football by United. For too long the sport has lacked a team
like them: a team that transcends the necessary, but limiting, traditional
allegiances. That is what the national team should do. Manchester United may
have helped them to do it.
Of course, the glamour players of United are the foreigners. Of course much
of English football is still symbolised by Arsenal's Cup Winners Cup
performance against Parma: a game in which one counted down the minutes
instead of living through them, and watched traffic policemen bar the way of
Ferraris. But Arsenal still won, didn't they? Manchester United still need
the stalwart services of Bruce and Pallister and Ince, don't they?
It is typical of the English that they should blame somebody else for
keeping them from the World Cup finals. It is also typical that this
aggressive self-aggrandisement should conceal a defensive self-doubt and
that, deep down, they should feel that 'somebody else' is in fact better
than they are. Certainly English bombast about its football exists alongside
a cringing obsession with foreign flair. Yet the truth is that English
football has qualities of strength and bravery that are just as important as
the more exotic, quicksilver skills.
Last season showed a willingness, on the part of enlightened managers, such
as Terry Venables and Alex Ferguson, to advance their game by allowing the
traditions of grit and flair to draw upon one another for sustenance. This
augurs well for next season, though we should remember that greatness was
promised four years ago when the English team returned from the World Cup,
and that it took less than a year for the usual misery to start up again. We
should remember, too, that the season ended not just with the hopeful images
of Manchester United and England, but with Millwall fans overflowing like
sewage onto the scene of their defeat.
This is the reality which confounds the fantasy football managers who spent
last season constructing a perfect future for their sport. The beautiful
game is still, perhaps, a long way away.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Echikatsu - a quiet oasis in downtown Tokyo /
Eating Out
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A compensation of doing business in Tokyo is the thrill of discovering the
many green oases hidden between the sprawl of office blocks.
One of the nicest of these is Echikatsu, a cottage restaurant endowed with a
water garden, in Kanda, downtown Tokyo, only 15 minutes taxi ride (Y960)
from the Otemachi business district.
As you pass Echikatsu's wooden gate and cross its cobbled courtyard, the
sound of traffic recedes and peace descends. A kimono-clad waitress ushers
you to your private tatami-mat room, thoughtfully adapted for westerners by
the addition of a leg pit under the table. Sliding paper doors open on to a
gurgling brook stocked with carp, and lined with candle-lit stone lanterns
and bamboo. Tokyo seems miles away.
Echikatsu's specialty is shabu-shabu (rough translation: slosh slosh) or
beef teriyaki. They both feature thin-sliced beef and vegetables cooked at
the table. Even unadventurous foreigners have been known to like these and
Echikatsu will equally please a Japanese guest.
The food is excellent, copious, and healthy. But steer clear of the wine
list. As in many Tokyo restaurants, it is limited and expensive. I paid
Y3,500 for a bottle of Piat d'Or, one of the only two white wines on offer.
Stick to sake (rice wine) or beer. In any case, Japanese food was never
meant to mix with French wine. Shabu-shabu for two, plus wine, came to just
over Y25,000 (Dollars 240), reasonable for a restaurant of this class.
Echikatsu is suitable for serious business discussion in small groups. It is
upmarket, private, quiet and there is lots of room to spread papers around
on the tatami floor. The service is unobtrusively attentive. Equally, its
charm makes Echikatsu good for romance.
Ask your hotel or secretary to book a room facing the garden and to get
Echikatsu to fax you a map. It is well known, but Tokyo taxi drivers are
terrible navigators.
Echikatsu is open from 5pm to 9.30pm. Bookings only. No English spoken. It
accepts leading credit cards. Phone 3811-5293.

On the face of it, it's hard to see how the traditional wicker picnic hamper
keeps going - being as it is, bulky, apt to spike the legs of the person
carrying it, no good at keeping things cold and not especially strong. Yet
it's hard to imagine appearing for Glyndebourne, Henley, Royal Ascot or a
punt on the Cam with anything other than the inefficient old wicker basket
our grandfathers used.
The two most readily available ranges come from Antler (the suitcase people)
and Optima, a Sussex-based company. Both can be found in John Lewis,
Selfridge's and Harrods, and offer an assortment of styles and patterns,
from Optima's Tropicana two-person hamper at around Pounds 75, to Antler's
vast Summer Fruits model for eight, costing Pounds 850. In between lie all
manner of two, four and six-person designs, including whole willow baskets,
split willow baskets, baskets with flat or trunk lids and baker's baskets.
The latter are basically Little Bo Peep hampers, with a large carrying
handle on the top and two hinged flaps on either side. Affected, perhaps,
but it does mean there's no risk of the lid bursting open and, as one
Glyndebourne-goer put it: 'Dumping your coronation chicken all over the feet
of one of your directors.' On the debit side, the cutlery of the Antler
range can look utilitarian; likewise the tendency of both manufacturers is
to put in tumblers rather than stemmed glasses.
No questioning the robustness of Swaine Adeney's fitted hamper, however.
Swaine Adeney, of Piccadilly, does a beautifully-made hamper for four
persons, at Pounds 395; or for two persons, at Pounds 249. For this, you get
French porcelain plates and mugs, good-quality leather fittings, and real
exclusivity. Yet even Swaine Adeney has difficulty beating its Piccadilly
neighbour, Fortnum &amp; Mason. From The Romantic, for two persons, at Pounds
135, to The Pall Mall, at Pounds 795, Fortnum's offer an extravagant variety
of styles.

TODAY:The French Open begins its two-week run in Paris. Steffi Graf, who has
won four straight grand slams and should again sweep through the women's
singles. Her path is clear of young challengers. Jennifer Capriati (18)
entered drug rehabilitation last week and even though Monica Seles (20)
seems to have recovered physically from her stab wounds, she shows little
interest in returning to the sport.
SUNDAY:
Formula One motor racing resumes its gloomy season with the Spanish Grand
Prix at Jarama, after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at
Imola in Italy and Karl Wendlinger's crash in Monte Carlo. The F1 teams are
struggling to modify their complicated cars to meet new safety rules by
Sunday. The comparatively low-tech US Indycar teams have no such worries as
they prepare for the main event of their season. A crowd of 400,000 will
gather at the Brickyard for the Indianapolis 500, one of America's great

FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Marks gets a measure on stress - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everywhere you look, someone is promising to take your stress away.
Consultants and health centres offer hypnotherapy, relaxation tapes or mud
baths. In this atmosphere, it is easy for companies to assume that their
employees will take care of stress on their own time. But when does stress
become so severe that it is a company's responsibility to take notice?
'The scenario when someone disappears from work, or when the men in white
coats show up, is an extreme sign that stress has become unbearable,' says
Paul Litchfield, assistant registrar at the Faculty for Occupational Health
in the Royal College of Medicine.
But stress is something that mounts, and some companies believe that the
time to act is long before things get bad. Marks and Spencer, the UK
retailer, has just piloted a 'Managing Pressure' programme, designed to
teach employees, from senior management through to the shop floor, how to
cope with an 'unprecedented' set of pressures from inside and outside the
job.
'We thought it would be better to get to people in training programmes while
it was still pressure and not stress,' says Sally Young, executive for
health and welfare at M and S.
Dr Celia Palmer, a former member of M and S's head office occupational
health staff, and Steve Williams, an organisational psychologist at Resource
Systems in Harrogate, Yorkshire, designed the programme, which was piloted
last October among 17 supervisors and sales assistants in one of the
company's Midlands stores.
Palmer and Williams based the programme on the Occupational Stress
Indicator*, a questionnaire that gives individuals a comprehensive picture
of their 'stress profile'. Respondents answer 167 questions on job
satisfaction and personality, such as: 'Generally and at work, do you
usually feel relaxed and at ease or do you tend to feel restless, tense and
find it difficult to settle down?'
Resource Systems produces a three-page report on all the sources of an
individual's stress. For M and S, Williams and Palmer have developed a
'workbook' which would advise employees on how to deal with the pressures
identified by the OSI, and a workshop to advise employees on how to cope
with the issues raised in the OSI and the workbook. M and S plans to train
managers and occupational health advisers to facilitate the programme.
The workbook offers some familiar stress reduction methods: relaxation
techniques, physical exercise, hobbies, tapes, yoga. It also suggests
strategies for time management, improving relationships with colleagues, and
coping with corporate change.
Litchfield warns against companies using such programmes to let them off the
hook. 'It is very easy to concentrate on how stress affects the individual,'
he says. 'But really you have to go back and see how the company exacerbates
stress. Just telling the person on the shop floor to listen to some
relaxation tapes is not going to address the source of the problem.'
Palmer says, in M and S's programme, workshop facilitators will find out
what employee concerns are and feed the information up to management.
In March, participants in the pilot filled in the OSI again. Williams found
that their job satisfaction had improved by about 9 per cent. Now the
company has to figure out how to evaluate the programme's effectiveness.
Individual progress can be measured by the OSI, but measuring the
bottom-line return on investment for the company is more difficult.
To date, the company has spent Pounds 40,000 on developing the programme and
expects to spend another Pounds 100,000 for a full launch.
M and S ultimately hopes to measure changes in sickness absence, staff
turnover, accident rates, customer satisfaction, and employee productivity.
But Williams says: 'There are not any panaceas here. We are not trying to
remove all stress or pressure. The programme has limited objectives to help
people manage pressure. We know there is a relationship between pressure and
productivity so we are hoping that these kinds of things will come out in
the measurement figures as we put these programmes into more stores.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Management (Desert Island Manager): Peter Middleton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spell on a desert island is probably the last thing Peter Middleton, chief
executive of Lloyd's of London, needs as he battles to take the insurance
market through the worst losses of its 300-year history. But Middleton, who
last week announced losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year, is confident
he could survive. 'I'd be all right on my own. That would not be a problem,'
says the man who once trained as a monk.
What would you need, apart from fax and telephone, to carry on your
business?
'A small alarm clock and calculator. I would want a structured programme. I
think it would be important not to let the environment let you drift into
losing discipline. I would use the telephone to conduct a series of planned
meetings during the day and the fax to systematically receive information
from the market at night. I'd need the calculator to speed up financial
analysis. I wouldn't want to work out various ratios, such as Lloyd's
expenditure as a percentage of premium income, on my fingers.'
How would you keep your sanity? What would you read?
'Given the circumstances, I would take Saul Bellow's Mr Sammler's Planet, a
novel written shortly after the successful US space mission to the moon in
1969. The inspiration of the work is a man looking at his life on earth as
if he were on another planet. On a desert island you'd clearly see your life
differently. Principia Mathematica by Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead
is another possibility. I've been battling my brain with that for 30 years.'
How important would music be?
'I can't go through a day without listening to half an hour or an hour of
good music. It is the easiest way of breaking off completely from Lloyd's. I
don't have any appetite for atonal music. Mozart, which always sounds so
fresh, would be an obvious choice. If it was only one compact disc it would
be Shostakovich's 7th symphony, a great achievement of telling a story
through music.'
Which film?
'Easy choice. In the Heat of the Night, starring Rod Steiger and Sidney
Poitier. Steiger's performance and the film's exposure of racism are both
attractive features. A brilliant film. Seen it five or six times.'
What about food and drink?
'I am addicted to lemonade; drink cans of it a day. But it's not enough. So
I'd definitely go for a stock of good burgundy to accompany as large a steak
as can fit on a plate. I like an occasional glass of beer. Because I have
not got Sky TV, I sometimes find myself going to a pub to watch football.'
How would you occupy yourself?
'I would make a serious effort to keep fit (Middleton, once an Olympic-class
runner, runs three times a week). But I would need to take about 10,000
cigarettes. There is no way I would use the opportunity to give up smoking.'
Which person would you like to accompany you?
'There are two quite different approaches. One would be a historical figure.
It would have to be Napoleon. Everybody concentrates on the military aspects
and forgets that in his spare time he devised the whole of the civil code in
France. As for a living person, absolutely not a politician. I'd prefer it
to be an ordinary man or woman from a culture I knew little about, from a
remote part of China or Latin America, for example.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Management: Japanese companies squeeze their white collar
workers - The tradition of jobs for life is forcing Japan's bosses to look
at novel ways of getting more out of their office workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Europe and the US companies simply cut staff. But in Japan - where the
tradition of lifetime employment remains deeply ingrained - the inexorable
global trend towards flatter corporate hier-archies is posing an awkward
chal-lenge.
So far, the restructuring of Japan's business sector has focused mainly on
cutting production lines and paring manufacturing costs. But during the past
few months attention has switched, as it has elsewhere in the world, to the
difficult issue of how to reduce the many layers of white collar workers.
The methods chosen by the Japanese have been necessarily different from
those employed by western counterparts.
Some of Japan's blue chip companies have been forced to announce sackings
and early retirement plans. But the public outcry has been so great that
others are now trying to find new ways to increase the efficiency of their
existing white collar staff without getting rid of them.
Some companies, for example, have tried to deal with the problem by shifting
unwanted employees to subsidiaries or to smaller client companies. Others,
such as the leading consumer electronics company Sony, are trying to
introduce a more Japanese solution through comprehensive re-organisation
schemes.
'For the first time in decades, Japanese businesses must rethink their
functional priorities,' says Shintaro Hori, director of Bain &amp; Company
Japan, the management consultancy.
Sony's plan, announced in March, is intended to tackle a bureaucracy which
appears to have been seriously hampering the company's decision making.
The company has therefore reorganised its 27 departments and sales divisions
into eight internal 'companies' and cut the number of subdivisions and
departments from 580 to 450. Sony believes this move will help to speed up
internal communications and avoid duplication of projects in separate
divisions.
Sony is typical of Japanese companies which concentrated on manufacturing
efficiency while allowing executive grades to spiral out of control during
the 1980s.
For instance, the consumer electronics company's manufacturing headcount
increased by just 6 per cent during the eight years to 1992, but the ranks
of its white collar personnel swelled by 139 per cent over the same period.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, another large Japanese consumer electronics
company, cut the size of its blue collar workforce by 24 per cent in this
time, while its white collar staff rose by 47 per cent.
However, given the continued decline in corporate earnings and the lack of
further room to cut production costs, companies are now finding that their
bloated management bureaucracies are proving an unacceptable burden. The
competitive disadvantage was illustrated by a Japan Productivity Centre
survey in 1992, which found that Japanese manufacturing companies would have
to eliminate 39 per cent of their head count to reach overall US
productivity levels per employee.
Moreover, until recently, Japanese consumers indirectly subsidised low white
collar productivity through higher prices for goods and services. However,
the recent pressure on prices, arising from the slump in consumer confidence
and new attitudes among shoppers towards discount retailing, have squeezed
profit margins, thereby eliminating the 'fat' which effectively subsidised
inefficient performance.
Matsushita, which also implemented its corporate reorganisation last
February, will move 300 administrative staff to its sales divisions, and
reduce its 48 business divisions to 10. Susumu Ishihara, director of
Matsushita, says the layers of administrative managers had caused the
company to misread the market and to miss profit opportunities.
To measure its rise in productivity, the company has pledged to increase its
ratio of pre-tax profits to sales from the current 1.4 per cent to 5 per
cent over the next three years. Similarly, Sony is also pushing its managers
for more efficient use of capital. 'Each company president will be
responsible for not only the profits and losses, but also for the balance
sheets of the organisation, including the return on equity,' says Tamotsu
Iba, Sony's executive deputy president who masterminded the company's
reorganisation plan.
While some companies are trying to raise white collar productivity through
structural changes, some are placing stricter quality requirements on their
managers.
Honda, the automobile maker, recently announced that it would place a time
limit on managerial posts. Starting from June, if a manager fails to be
promoted within 12 years, he or she will be forced to a non-managerial post
without subordinate staff.
The plan has provoked criticism among the Japanese media and business
analysts, but Honda says that it is trying to provide more opportunities for
its younger staff and to improve the productivity of its older managers.
According to the company: 'It's tough on the older workers but the younger
employees are welcoming the move.'
Spurred by this productivity drive, more and more Japanese companies and
employees realise that the old definition of office work is no longer valid.
Tasks such as writing reports and filling forms have been traditionally
regarded as office work, but the concept of white collar workers actually
adding value to products or services has been absent.
Hori points out that Japan's business leaders have first to define what they
mean by productivity of office work, set targets for improving it, and try
to add value through strategic planning by companies and industries.
Ultimately, business leaders will need to set new ground rules for
employees, as the traditional social contract breaks down. In the past
companies guaranteed workers a path up the corporate hierarchy in return for
loyalty and service. In situations where 'bucho' or division managers find
themselves losing their titles and becoming ordinary staff, companies need
to map out a new direction for them.
In the meantime, more companies may have to face up to the inevitable - the
reduction of overhead costs, western style. While many leading Japanese
companies will continue to resist the concept of sacking staff, they may not
achieve successful results without wielding the white collar axe.
'The magnitude of excess is too large,' says Hori. 'With too much
organisational slack, bringing in new values is impossible to achieve in the
short term.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Management: A Sony manager's tale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sony's reorganisation has been good news for Yoshihiko Yanagimoto, a
42-year-old general manager of one of the group's eight new in-house
companies.
The reshuffle has streamlined his responsibilities, which previously
included development and marketing of any sort of product linked to personal
information hardware from personal computers to CD-Rom. 'There was never a
clear sense of direction because everyone was involved in everything,' he
says.
Now he is in charge of developing personal communication hardware around
Magic Cap, a new communication software that integrates electronic mail,
facsimile, telephones and paging systems. The other assignments he
previously held have been shifted to the in-house Computer Systems Business
Company.
Yanagimoto says this has allowed him to concentrate on the planning and
developing of one theme. It has also meant that Sony itself is more focused
on its plans in the next generation information and communications area.
Meanwhile, the creation of internal 'companies' has shifted power to the
heads of groups from the central administrators.
'We are having to deal less with the corporate headquarters since most of
the decision making is done within the (in-house) company,' says Yanagimoto.
The removal of extra administrative layers has also meant that decisions
made at headquarters rather than the individual internal companies are
processed much more quickly than before. 'I was always aware of the size of
the company getting in the way of new business decisions,' he says.
Sony's changes have not worked well for everyone. Unlike Yanagimoto, who has
retained his old responsibilities in the same product area, and looks over
the same number of subordinate staff, some managers have been given
completely new assignments without staff directly under them. 'There are
some people who are discouraged with their new mission,' he says.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Management: Weird and crazy world of Tom Peters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On my desk is a photo of world famous management guru Tom Peters smiling
broadly in a pair of pink boxer shorts. The picture has been taken for his
forthcoming book Crazy Times Call for Crazy Organisations, an ambitious work
aimed at everyone from the chief executive to the janitor.
In an accompanying letter sent by Peters to 'various friends' in the media,
he explains that the idea of a Dollars 15 book for those who cannot afford
his Dollars 2,000 seminars 'felt right - very, very right'. He also warns
that book is going to make readers angry. Before I have even opened the
covers I am a feeling annoyed, though not perhaps in the way the author
intended.
The title gets on my nerves a little; the picture, a lot. Why is it that
management gurus feel the need to grow their hair, wear kipper ties or have
their pictures taken half undressed? Perhaps the sad truth is that most
people will not buy books about organisational structures unless a zany
personality is thrown in too.
The thesis by which Peters hopes to enrage his audience is that there is no
future for sane companies in this insane world.
Organisations must go beyond the management crazes they are now grappling
with - re-engineering, TQM, empowerment, change - and enter an era of
revolution and reinvention.
He may be quite right, but I am worried about his premise. Why does he think
these are the craziest times for 200 years? They strike me as being sane
enough, if sometimes a little grim. I'm not sure I like his recommendations
for individual behaviour either. He urges us to behave like entrepreneurs
building portfolios of skills and marketing our wares. We are also advised
to use words like 'apeshit', 'weird', and 'freaky'.
This sounds like a recipe for Tom Peters clones. He certainly has no
problems when it comes to selling his own wares. He has already put in a
plug for his next book which he says will be a 'Wit and Wisdom' format, and
should be with us in a matter of months. I hate to think which item of
clothing he will take off to market that one.
                          *      *      *
McKinsey, the management consultancy which prides itself on the quality of
its analysis, is being alarmingly thorough in its latest recruitment
efforts. It is looking for accountants with top degrees, flawless
professional qualifications, and up to seven years' glittering experience in
the real world. Anyone answering the description should send in a full CV
including their grades in the A-level exams they did at school.
Come off it, McKinsey. Is it really relevant what an experienced, top-flight
accountant was like at school? If so why stop at A-levels? What about
O-levels? Or those new exams that 7-year-olds do? Why not find out when they
took their first steps or counted to 10?
As I fluffed my own A-levels, it is natural that I am a little sceptical.
But I'm sure Tom Peters would agree that what sorts out successful people is
that they go on learning and reinventing themselves.
                          *      *      *
The issue of oldies in the boardroom has surfaced again following the
appointment of 72-year-old Sir Michael Palliser to the board of Exploration
Company of Louisiana. Ageist remarks about the choice have made some Veds
(Very Elderly Directors) quite cross. Roland Shaw, the 72-year-old chairman
of Premier Consolidated, wrote an irate letter to the Financial Times
pointing out that the great Armand Hammer was in his nineties when he
stepped down at Occidental Petroleum.
Now I am sure that veteran diplomat Sir Michael will do an excellent job
helping this little, loss-making oil company in its search for the black
stuff in China. I also agree with Shaw that some directors stay on the ball
for a long time. I would not have chosen Hammer as an example, though. His
many critics would say he was a raging megalomaniac who spent more time
furthering his own reputation than that of his company.
However, as a general rule, 70 does seem is a bit old for a seat on the
board. As people get on in years they get less willing to embrace change,
while non-execs who have retired from executive jobs have less relevant
experience to offer as time goes on.
There is, of course, no point in being too dogmatic about it. The ever
youthful Sir John Harvey Jones with his flowing locks (and kipper tie) has
just reached 70 and has said now is the time to stop being a non-exec.
Meanwhile, Lord Weinstock, his exact contemporary at GEC, is showing no
immediate signs of passing on the mantle.
                          *      *      *
Mary Spillane, who makes a handsome living telling western businessmen
whether single or double breasted suits better flatter their physiques, is
now planning to set up in Russia. 'The new Russian elite wear shiny suits
which don't fit properly. They look very greasy, flash - not trustworthy.
They need a lot of help,' she says.
Some might say that the idiosyncratic dress sense of Russia's new
businessmen is not the most pressing of the country's problems as its
economy goes into free-fall. Yet Spillane is raring to go, and has lined up
a grant from the Bank of Siberia and found a partner who used to be the Visa
Officer at the Russian Embassy in London.
Perhaps Peters is right. These are crazy times, after all.

FT  23 MAY 94 / DTI seeks more scrutiny of insolvency fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is considering how to scrutinise more
effectively the fees charged by insolvency practitioners.
The move is in response to public concern over insolvency fees charged in
several recent high-profile corporate collapses.
Senior officials at the department plan to hold talks with professional
bodies and regulators covering the insolvency sector during the coming weeks
to decide how best to respond to criticism.
The discussions will focus on efforts to improve the transparency of fees
charged and ways to motivate creditors to consider whether practitioners are
achieving value for money.
Last July the Commons social security committee called for an independent
monitor in larger insolvencies to help determine whether practitioners'
actions and fees were appropriate. Government ministers rejected the
suggestion of an independent monitor and are opposed to any legislative
change or extensive involvement by civil servants in monitoring insolvency
practices more closely.
However, officials are trying to develop ways to encourage creditors to take
more seriously their role in approving practitioners' work programmes and
fees.
The result of the discussions might be codes of conduct or other voluntary
measures issued by the professional bodies during the coming months.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm which is working on the liquidation of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, reported this month that its fees
since appointment at the end of 1991 exceeded Pounds 98m.
Last month the Commons social security committee criticised Buchler
Phillips, a specialist insolvency firm, in a report which highlighted that
it had barely recovered assets to pay for its fees in its work on the estate
of the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell.
Other substantial professional fees have been incurred over the handling of
the companies in the Maxwell business empire and on the administration of
Polly Peck International.
The profession argues that the fees reflect the work firms have had to do
and are generally a small proportion of the total asset recoveries made as a
result of their efforts.
The renewed scrutiny comes at a time when the Joint Insolvency Monitoring
Unit, the new regulatory body for the profession, is also turning its
attention to fees during its random inspections of practitioners.
Ms Kay Linnell, the head of the unit, said inspections would consider how
reasonable charge rates were and the accuracy of time records. 'I do think
there are reasons for concern,' she said.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Call to shake up 'costly' quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quangos cost too much and should be reformed drastically, a group of
constitutional experts says today.
Quangos - or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - account for
nearly a third of all public expenditure, costing Pounds 46.6bn in 1992-93
(Pounds 48.2bn at current prices), according to a report by Charter 88
Trust, which seeks to promote constitutional reform. This is a rise of 24
per cent in real terms since 1979, when 'Mrs Thatcher came to power pledged
to reduce their numbers and cost'.
The report identifies 5,521 executive quangos. 'This shows that in area
after area of public life, elected government is being replaced by
appointive government,' it says.
People who are appointed rather than elected run some 6,700 bodies of all
kinds at national and local level, with the most rapid growth occurring
locally, the report says.
It adds: 'This hastily erected apparatus of appointive government lacks the
essential democratic underpinnings of scrutiny, openness and
accountability.'
The report - sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust - criticises
the Citizen's Charter for providing weak and inadequate mechanisms of
democratic control and openness. Quangos are under the control of a new
'business-dominated elite' which could be as large as 73,000 appointees.
The report calls for a review of which non-elected bodies should become
elected bodies, the introduction of a statutory 'right to know', new legal
standards of consultation, open decision-making and equitable conduct for
all public bodies; and a review of ministerial patronage.
Extra-Governmental Organisations and their Accountability. Charter 88 Trust,
Exmouth House, 3-11 Pine Street, London EC1R OJH. Pounds 9.95.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Welsh find Redwood is not to their taste: A controversial
minister's first year is assessed by Roland Adburgham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When John Redwood was appointed Welsh secretary a year ago, Plaid Cymru, the
Welsh nationalist party, said: 'He will go down like a rat sandwich.'
This was a predictable reaction, given that Mr Redwood is an English MP
representing Wokingham in Berkshire, and reputed to be a rightwing
ideologue. But a year later, as Plaid Cymru prophesied, many Welsh have not
found him to their taste.
A director of a leading Cardiff company explained why it had not invited Mr
Redwood to visit, unlike previous Welsh secretaries. 'We don't want to,' he
said bluntly. 'Our staff would not be very pleased to meet him.'
Welsh sensitivities will not unduly trouble Mr Redwood who, at 42, is one of
the youngest and brightest members of the cabinet. While his office is
regarded as a relatively junior post, it does have a distinct advantage: the
freedom to roam across departmental boundaries.
The Welsh Office, with a staff of 2,300, has responsibility for everything
except foreign affairs, defence and Home Office matters. It allows Mr
Redwood to make speeches ranging from the 'social problem' of single-parent
families to the oversupply of administrative 'grey suits' in the health
service.
'I am keen to demolish the idea that the answer to any social ill is more
bumf and bureaucracy,' he has said.
His views on Europe are assumed to have caused him to be included among Mr
John Major's 'bastards'.
Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, comments: 'Mr Redwood uses
Wales as a platform to advance his national political aspirations.
'He is very much in contrast with his predecessors (Mr Peter Walker, now
Lord Walker, and Mr David Hunt, now employment secretary), who sought to get
into the broad stream of Welsh life. Mr Redwood has a much more aloof
stance, and gives the impression of being determined to integrate Wales more
into the UK.'
The Conservatives hold only six of the 38 parliamentary seats in Wales.
Professor Philip Cooke, director of the Centre for Advanced Studies at the
University of Wales, argues that it is the role of Tory Welsh secretaries
'to keep the lid on the pot - culturally and literally it is not their
territory. Their task is to keep the union together.'
Prof Cooke sees Mr Redwood as setting his own political agenda of national
rather than Welsh issues.
'The defining characteristic of the Redwood period is inertia - nothing
seems to be happening. In the past, Wales has been something of a test-bed
for policies. In the 1980s, an interesting network developed for getting
initiatives going and Welsh institutions became more confident. But these
are now being reined in by the Welsh Office.'
One notable curbing by Mr Redwood is that of the Welsh Development Agency,
after it was sharply criticised by the Commons public accounts committee
last year. Staffing is being cut and it has been brought under more direct
ministerial control.
The Welsh secretary, vulnerable to criticism of quango accountability, is
reviewing the future of the Development Board for Rural Wales, whose
chairman resigned earlier this month after it too was criticised by the
Commons public accounts committee.
Against expectations, however, Mr Redwood has not savagely cut public
spending and abandoned his predecessors' interventionist policies. The
expenditure settlement for the current year of Pounds 6.65bn is planned to
rise next year to Pounds 6.89bn. 'He has fallen very quickly into the Welsh
Office patter of boasting about high levels of public spending - I've been
very surprised at that,' said Mr Davies.
Mr Redwood, while stressing that he looks for 'improvements in value for
money and efficiency in all Welsh Office programmes', has set better
education and training and an improved health service as his priorities.
He has supported funding for regeneration projects and readily puts his name
to announcements of job-creation projects for which regional selective
assistance is granted.
His year overseeing a UK region has, though, made him no more sympathetic to
the concept of regional government. The reform of local government, due to
take effect in 1996, has led to renewed calls for an elected all-Wales
assembly. Mr Redwood regards this as an unnecessary tier of government.
Within the Welsh Office there are complaints that he keeps himself isolated,
with policies formed more by his moral certainties than by consultation.
Among the public, his remarks on single parents and criticism of Welsh
schools with low educational standards, caused antagonism by appearing to
show a lack of appreciation of the difficult realities of many people's
lives.
Mr Redwood's views look less stark when his speeches are read in context.
But he has seemed unconcerned to alter the impression that his appointment
was less to be a standard bearer for the red dragon than to adjust the
political balance of the cabinet. The assumption within Wales is that he
sees the principality as no more than a wayside halt en route to higher
office.

An ICM poll in the Daily Express newspaper today indicates that the Tories
will lose 13 of their present 32 Euro-seats. It shows Labour on course to
win 61 seats in the enlarged European parliament, up from 45, while the
Liberal Democrats should win three seats.
The poll puts Labour on 46 per cent, Tories on 27 per cent, Liberal
Democrats on 22 per cent and others on 5 per cent.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Airport dismisses safety allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester Airport, which faces a tough fight to get permission to build a
second runway at a planning inquiry next month, last night denied aircraft
were being endangered by problems with navigation aids.
The allegations - seen in some quarters as part of a dirty-tricks campaign
to try to discredit the airport - were contained in a Sunday newspaper
report.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which licenses airports for safety, supported
Manchester's protests. 'If the CAA felt there was any problem, Manchester
would not have a licence,' the authority said last night.
The public inquiry begins on June 21.
A report in The Sunday Telegraph alleged malfunctioning landing lights and
inaccurate information from the airport's control tower on wind speed and
direction. The airport was also criticised for only having one windsock,
after investigation of a 1985 accident recommended more.
The authority said one pilot had filed an 'occurrence report' this year
after landing lights malfunctioned. Investigation had revealed electrical
interference caused by maintenance work. The authority said that the
incident was iso-lated.
A second pilot's report of inaccurate wind-speed information is still being
investigated. However, the authority said wind variations and gusts cannot
be predicted, which is why pilots are trained to deal with them on landing.
The airport said neither pilot had complained to the Manchester authorities,
which are responsible for about 250,000 take-offs and landings a year.
The CAA said only one windsock was needed. In an aircraft fire on the
Manchester runway in 1985, lives may have been lost because the pilot turned
the aircraft so that flames blew on to the fuselage. 'But more windsocks
would not help in a similar situation at night when you cannot see them,'
the authority said.
Last year more than 13m people used Manchester, Europe's fastest-growing
airport, which expects to pass Copenhagen to take sixth place in the
European size league shortly.
A second runway is widely supported in the region, particularly by business,
but is opposed by some residents. It would increase capacity to 30m
passengers early next century.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Poll figures may flatter Labour: But there is no doubt a
landslide is in the making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European elections are hard to predict. The low turnout and the
likelihood of tactical voting present special problems to the pollsters.
There will be relatively few surveys during the campaign. There may not even
be any exit polls to tide curiosity over the gap between the vote on June 9
and the count that takes place three days later when all the other countries
have cast their ballot.
The Conservatives' prospects are bleak. Recent nationwide polls are running
about 45 per cent for Labour to 25 per cent for the Tories and 25 per cent
for the Liberal Democrats. The local elections yielded 41 per cent for
Labour, 27 per cent for the Conservatives and 27 per cent for the Liberal
Democrats.
Recent experience suggests that opinion-poll figures may flatter Labour.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a Labour landslide is in the making.
But what will happen in the Tory seats of the south. How far will the
Liberal Democrats' breakthrough go?
The only published polling this week has been about the Labour leadership
and those forecasts are not polls in any meaningful sense. The 'don't knows'
and the 'won't says' are too numerous, and nobody is in a position to
construct a reliable sample frame for the constituency activists or for the
trade unionists who will actually vote.
But there is some data on what may happen when the votes are cast in the
Euro-election 17 days hence. Different analyses of the local elections and
of two opinion polls taken just before John Smith's death give a clear range
for the likely division of the newly redrawn UK Euro-seats.
The Conservatives, who won 32 seats in 1989, are forecast to gain a maximum
of 20 seats this time and a minimum of eight. Labour, which has 45 seats, is
given a maximum of 66 and a minimum of 52, and the Liberal Democrats, who
have no seats, a maximum of 14 and minimum of three.
But these figures take no account of tactical voting. There are almost 20
seats where Labour voters have a far better chance of ousting the Tory MEP
if they vote Liberal Democrat. The outcome will turn on how effectively the
Liberal Democrats put this point over.
The Conservatives have leaked one interesting figure from their private
polls. A total of 45 per cent of the electorate say they are 'certain to
vote'. In 1989 the same poll said 35 per cent, and proved to be exactly
right.
But who will the non-voters be? If they are a representative sample, drawn
proportionately from all parties, abstention will not matter. But it will be
a very different story if disillusioned Conservatives go 'on strike' as one
rightwing Tory MP has suggested, or if Euro-sceptics, with no Euro-sceptic
to vote for, stay away.
A 45 per cent turnout, although the lowest in Europe, may seem high in a
country where just 27 per cent recognise the name of Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president, and fewer than 50 per cent claim to know of
the European parliament.
Perhaps the most interesting poll so far was a union-wide one by MORI for
The European newspaper. This tackled the central issue of the community's
future. Just three of the 12 countries - Belgium, Italy and Greece - showed
a significant majority wanting a United States of Europe. Denmark (74 per
cent to 11 per cent) and the Netherlands (73 per cent to 21 per cent) showed
an even greater majority against the idea than the UK (68 per cent to 17 per
cent). In no country would a majority vote in a referendum for leaving the
union, although, as expected, Denmark (53 per cent in, 35 per cent out) and
Britain (52 per cent in, 36 per cent out) emerged as the most sceptical.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Campaign Diary: Foreign hopefuls liven up contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Obscure it may be; dull it is not. The departing European parliament
includes some remarkable MEPs including an Italian representing his fourth
political party and a Dutch Roman Catholic priest who is a Green.
The hopefuls standing on June 9 also include the biggest-ever crop of
'foreign' candidates standing in countries other than their own.
Mr Pedro Canavarro, a Portuguese candidate for the Northern league in Italy,
will no doubt win support for announcing that he is learning Italian - just
in case he is elected.
For sheer eccentricity however, it is hard to beat our own Screaming Lord
Sutch, perennial by-election candidate of the Official Monster Raving Loony
Party. Sutch planned to put up candidates in France and Germany as well as
the UK under the slogan 'Loonies of the World Unite'. Unfortunately, the
party seems to have failed to register in time for the ballot - the European
parliament says the only Loonies it knows of are British.
Sutch himself is too busy to stand for Strasbourg. He plans to fly the Loony
flag in the Barking, Eastleigh and Bradford South by-elections. But he has
no doubts about the main opposition. 'Every time we come up against the
Greens we poll double their vote,' he says.
                          *       *       *
Two non-nationals trying their luck in Britain have had contrasting
receptions. Parisian-born Conservative Christine Adamson, nee Piot, wife of
a Harrogate chartered accountant, says she has been well received in
Yorkshire South-West. But then she has little chance of ousting Labour.
Gisela Gschaider, a German-born college lecturer, is having a bumpier ride
for Labour in Worcestershire and Warwickshire South. Her opponent,
Conservative candidate John Corrie, says voters want a British MEP. He adds
gracefully: 'I hope that the German candidate enjoys her short sojourn in
this beautiful heart of England.'
Brian Wilson, Labour MP for Cunninghame North, may be a sought-after ally in
Labour's leadership election - he is the only Labour MP who owns a
newspaper.
This week's issue of the staunchly Labour West Highland Free Press pays
dignified tribute to John Smith, the late leader, but ignores the leadership
contenders.
'The paper will make its choice clear over the next few weeks, at the same
time as me. But I can't imagine our readers are waiting desperately for our
verdict,' Wilson says modest-ly.
At least he can't complain about newspaper proprietors trying to hijack the
election.
Let no one accuse the Greens of hypocrisy. The party opposes pollution, so
naturally it omitted to inform Fleet Street's political correspondents about
the launch of its manifesto. Result: the launch went unpolluted by
journalists, and the manifesto went largely unreported.
A pity, because it includes some interesting ideas. For example, Greens not
only oppose a single European currency, they want more currencies - local
ones to promote recirculation of money. They have obviously never tried to
spend a Scottish fiver in Kent.
Green candidates are standing in all 84 mainland constituencies with hopes
of repeating their 1989 haul of 2.3m votes. Sadly, the list of candidates
excludes David Icke, the former television presenter who claims a direct
line to the Almighty. 'He left the party some years ago,' a party official
says sniffily.
                          *       *       *
Lindi St Clair, otherwise known as Miss Whiplash, will also be absent,
following the collapse of her Corrective party last year. Miss St Clair, a
doughty campaigner for courtesans' rights, is understood to have retired
from politics.
But watch out for the Natural Law party, which is standing in every
constituency, in spite of losing deposits in the 350 seats it contested in
the 1992 general election.
The party, which demonstrates Yogic Flying at election meetings, polled an
average of 150 votes. It hopes for take-off this time. 'We got 3 per cent in
the West Lancashire local elections,' it says hopefully.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Launch of Euro-manifestos ends political truce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main parties will this morning signal an end to the political truce
which followed the death of John Smith with the launch of their manifestos
for the European elections. The return of politics as usual will mean that
after a welcome respite during the past 10 days, Mr John Major's government
will return to the uncomfortable glare of the political spotlight.
Uncertainty in the Labour party offers no guarantee that the Conservatives'
disastrous performance in recent local elections will not be followed by
another electoral calamity on June 9.
For its part, Labour's claim that Smith has bequeathed a mature, united
party will be tested severely by the leadership struggle which will permeate
the European campaign. The contenders for the succession inevitably will
spend as much time in internal manoeuvring as in fighting the Conservatives.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats must demonstrate that they can win
seats in the European parliament as well as protest votes in the Eastleigh
by-election on the same day.
The party's claim it represents the only real alternative to the Tories in
much of southern England now confronts the strong possibility that Labour
will re-invade the same ground by choosing the social democrat Mr Tony Blair
as leader.
It is Mr Major however who has most to lose. The conventional wisdom is that
his leadership is now safe through the summer. Mr Michael Heseltine no
longer looks quite such an attractive alternative. The reputations of Mr
Kenneth Clarke and the youthful Mr Michael Portillo are not at their best.
But the Tory party's destructive divisions over Europe have not disappeared.
Nor, as the rightwing Conservative Way Forward reminded him at the weekend,
has the determination of a section of the party to undermine the prime
minister. Mr Major has to survive the autumn as well as the summer.
So the Conservative election manifesto will address two audiences: the wider
electorate and the warring factions within the party.
Party strategists see glimmers of optimism. For all its internal divisions
and underlying unpopularity, Europe remains the one issue on which voters
seem prepared to give the Tories the benefit of the doubt.
Private polling suggests the electorate still trusts the Tories to do a
better job of standing up for Britain's interests in Europe than Labour or
the Liberal Democrats. The voters may not like the government but they have
no time for Brussels.
Mr Douglas Hurd insisted at the weekend the government was offering a
positive vision of a wider, decentralised, de-regulated Europe in which the
main foreign, economic and social policy levers remain with nation states.
But on the doorstep that will be translated by party workers into a pledge
to fight off the Brussels bureaucrats. Labour and the Liberal Democrats will
be cast in the role of unthinking supporters of a European super-state.
The government has all but given up hope of holding on to its 32 seats in
the Strasbourg assembly. But if its message gets though it might keep 20
rather than a dozen or less.
That gap between defeat and disaster may well depend on the Euro-sceptics on
the Tory back benches and their ministerial backers in the cabinet.
Careful manifesto language on the European exchange rate mechanism (Britain
will not return in the foreseeable future) and a single currency (parliament
will decide if and when it ever happens) has brought a temporary truce. Mr
Portillo and his fellow sceptics in the cabinet have been told to follow the
party line scrupulously.
But one or two bad opinion polls during the campaign will generate pressure
from the sceptics on Mr Major to widen his attack on socialist control of
the European Union's institutions to the institutions themselves.
If he succumbs, the pro-Europeans will retaliate. Images of the two wings of
the party fighting it out on the hustings will not inspire its supporters to
vote.
Labour's tactics are more straightforward. Its manifesto will press for a
positive but discriminating approach to European integration. Britain should
sign up for the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, accept the
principle of a single currency and be ready to extend majority voting in
some areas.
But the party will insist it is not committed to the blueprint for a federal
Europe tabled by its partners in the parliament's Socialist Group - nor to
the detail on such issues as taxation policies and working time.
The thrust of Labour's campaign will be on domestic rather than European
issues anyway. Its strategy will be to maximise the electorate's anger with
recession, tax increases and the air of incompetence around the government.
The closer the character of the poll on June 9 is to a nationwide
by-election, the better the chances of Labour adding to its present 45 seats
in the parliament.
The Liberal Democrats start from a much lower base. They are unrepresented
in the Strasbourg assembly. Projections based on recent opinion polls
suggest Mr Ashdown should win a minimum of two or three seats this time
round.
The party is concentrating its efforts on a swathe of south-western England
from Cornwall to as far east as Hampshire. It also seems assured of a
by-election victory in the once-Tory bastion of Eastleigh.
Wary of frightening off Tory voters, Mr Ashdown has already tempered the
Liberal Democrats' reflex Europeanism with the promise of a referendum on
the next stage of integration.
He intends to benefit from popular disenchantment with the government's
domestic policies - and from any divisions which emerge during Labour's
leadership race.
John Smith's premature death did more than deprive the Labour party of a
popular and astute leader. It shifted the political landscape. In the next
three weeks the European elections and their aftermath will begin to fill in
the new contours.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Health purchasing changes proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is likely to be urged this week to set up an experiment that
would make 10 to 15 local authorities responsible for purchasing health
services.
Local councils and health authorities are being drawn into growing
disagreement over the running of the National Health Service.
A paper going to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities policy
committee on Thursday argues that switching health-purchasing
responsibilities from district health authorities to local councils could
produce better management, service planning and public accountability.
The paper calls for a pilot project under which local authorities of varying
size, type and geographical location would take over health commissioning.
Local authorities have never had a direct role in the NHS since its
foundation in 1948. One of the traditional arguments against local authority
involvement - lack of suitable expertise to run hospitals - has been
diminished by the government's 1991 NHS reforms. Hospitals are now run by
their own trust boards, with purchasing decisions made at arm's length by
district health authorities.
Critics in local authorities say unelected health authorities lack the
legitimacy or public standing to make difficult decisions about spending
priorities. They believe the government's decision to make local authorities
responsible for purchasing community care services adds force to the
argument that they should take over the entire health purchasing role.
The proposal is being fiercely resisted by the National Association of
Health Authorities and Trusts, which believes it could undermine the
national character of the NHS.
Mr Philip Hunt, the association's director, said health authorities were
accountable to the health secretary and were scrutinised by the Audit
Commission, the National Audit Office and other public watchdogs.
It was, however, important that appointees had credibility within their
local communities. 'Every effort should be made to encourage people from a
wide cross-section of the community to put their names forward for
appointment as chairmen and non-executive directors of NHS boards,' he said.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Post Office chiefs accused of sell-off plot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Post Office senior managers were accused yesterday of conspiring with Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to try to achieve full
privatisation of postal services.
Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW postal union's general secretary, told his union's
annual conference that Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office chief executive,
had been involved in a 'pernicious plot' with Mr Heseltine but this had been
defeated at the last moment in the cabinet, partly as a result of the
union's pressure.
Mr Johnson said the union had 'achieved the first objective in the campaign
to oppose privatisation' with the government's decision that Parcelforce is
not to be sold off separately from the rest of the postal services.
At the weekend Mr Cockburn sent letters to the Post Office's 150,000
employees making it clear that he wants to see the Royal Mail's
privatisation. 'This is the only way absolutely to guarantee us all the
freedom we need to fight off foreign competition, protect jobs and invest
more freely in our future,' Mr Cockburn said.
But Mr Johnson said a third of all postal workers would lose their jobs if
the government eventually decided to break up the Post Office and privatise
it.
Until now the UCW and the Post Office have worked closely in support of
giving the service more commercial freedom. But the union is opposed to any
split of the mail and postal services from counter operations, and to giving
the private sector a majority shareholding.
The union's leaders are increasingly confident that public opinion will
deter the government from complete privatisation and that it will agree to
the option of leaving the business in the public sector but extending its
commercial freedom. The union believes this proposal will be introduced into
Mr Heseltine's consultative document on the Post Office's future, expected
to be published next month.
Replying to Mr Johnson's speech, Mr Cockburn said yesterday that
privatisation would 'protect jobs not threaten them', and accused the UCW of
scaremongering. 'Leaving the Post Office locked in the public sector would
be a recipe for disaster,' he said. 'The union is being profoundly
complacent and living in an unreal world. Time is not on our side.'
On Wednesday the powerful Federation of Women's Institutes, Age Concern and
other pressure groups are due to launch a campaign in defence of existing
postal services. They will demand at least six months for consultation when
Mr Heseltine publishes his green paper. Delegates questioned at the UCW's
conference yesterday were convinced the government would not proceed with
any privatisation plans for the Post Office.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Policing of child labour criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Most local education authorities are failing in their duty to police child
labour, and their regulatory responsibilities should be transferred to
environmental health departments, a report says.
The report, delivered at a conference of the International Association of
Labour Inspection in Tunisia, may embarrass the government among its
European partners.
The government has met European Union resistance to its attempt to secure a
four-year opt-out from a directive controlling the number of hours that
children can work. It believes the European law, which forbids children
under 15 from working more than 12 hours a week, would interfere with
newspaper rounds.
The survey by Ms Michele Baron, a senior environmental health officer
attached to the Health and Safety Executive, sampled 15 per cent of local
education authorities. She found six out of 10 treated applications for
children's work permits from employers as an administrative exercise and did
nothing to enforce child labour laws by checking on working conditions.
'They have all made by-laws under the relative acts, but the extent to which
they enforce them varies depending on the available resources,' said Ms
Baron.
'Local authority environmental health inspectors are in a better position to
undertake this work.
'They are regularly inspecting the places where children work and have more
resources to devote to this area,' she said.
The report emerges amid increasing concerns among British labour
organisations about the extent of illegal child labour. Last month five
children were discovered working at a clothing factory in Preston,
Lancashire. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, has estimated that more than 2m
children do illegal part-time work in the UK and the Labour party produced
figures recently which recorded 39 work-related deaths among
16-to-19-year-olds in the UK since 1990.
Ms Baron's survey coincides with a study carried out by the Scottish Low Pay
Unit which found widespread abuse of child-labour laws among three schools
it surveyed in Dumfries and Galloway.
More than a third of the 259 pupils surveyed were working and the majority
of them worked beyond the time limits laid down in law.
The children were working an average of 8.5 hours a week and drew average
weekly earnings of Pounds 13. One child was working a 39-hour week as well
as attending school.
Fewer than a quarter of the pupils had possessed a work permit. The report
also found that children who had never worked were likely to have better
results in English examinations, though mathematics results appeared
unaffected.
Ms Baron said: 'Enforcing the laws properly and decreasing the amount of
illegal child labour in the UK would increase the amount of work available
for adults. I am not advocating more regulations but more effective
inspection techniques.'
The IALI is a body established by the International Labour Organisation to
promote better international labour controls.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Corporate aid to charity declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate support for charity has declined for the second successive year,
according to research published today by Directory of Social Change, a
leading voluntary sector publishing and training organisation.
Tighter financial controls adopted during the recession are only part of the
explanation. Researchers believe the drop in donations may reflect a trend
for big companies to treat corporate community involvement as a more
commercial activity. Many companies are ceasing to support charities unless
they fit into community involvement strategies reflecting core business
interests.
Directory's research, published in its Corporate Citizen magazine, shows
that charitable donations by British Petroleum - the UK's top corporate
donor with Pounds 9m in 1992 - fell to Pounds 6.5m last year. Imperial
Chemical Industries' donations were down from Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.2m.
National Westminster Bank cut its donations from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.5m,
and Barclays Bank fell from Pounds 2m to Pounds 800,000 in three years.
Although some donors increased their support, the overall trend was
downwards. Directory says charities received almost Pounds 1m less from the
top 16 companies with financial years ending last December, compared with
the year before.
The figures measure only financial support for charity. Staff secondments,
provision of office space and equipment and other activities push up the
total value considerably.
A growing number of companies are adopting more focused community
involvement polices which reflect their business interests - for example,
insurance companies supporting crime-prevention charities. While such
partnerships can benefit both corporate donors and the voluntary sector,
they are likely to accentuate a decline in random charitable giving.

FT  23 MAY 94 / More unions may face blow to revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing number of trade unions may face severe financial difficulties if
they fail to win their members' approval for subscriptions to be deducted by
employers from wages under the check-off system.
By law unions have until August to persuade their estimated 6m members on
check-off to agree to its renewal.
Few unions report resistance from members they have contacted to continue
with check-off, and many employers have co-operated with unions in the
exercise which will have to be repeated every three years.
However, financial experts fear that unions might lose Pounds 25m to Pounds
50m in total, amounting to 5 per cent to 10 per cent of their current
pre-tax income, as a result of a membership shortfall through the changed
check-off rules.
'Many unions are being too complacent about the success of their check-off
campaigns,' said one union adviser. 'They think they will have done well if
95 per cent of their members re-sign for check-off but the loss of income
that would result could still be serious for many of them.'
Two unions already with financial difficulties face further problems as a
result of the check-off change.
These are the NUCPS civil service union and Ucatt, the construction union.
The NUCPS says it has secured about 38 per cent of members on check-off but
remains below its target, and even a 5 per cent shortfall would mean a
Pounds 220,000 loss in revenue.
Ucatt has 90 per cent of its membership on check-off but even at its most
optimistic estimate the union believes it will lose 10 per cent of them.
This could cost it about Pounds 500,000 in lost income.
The RMT transport union had its check-off facilities withdrawn last summer
by British Rail during a dispute. The withdrawal has been one factor blamed
for a subsequent 20 per cent decline in the union's membership.
As many as 80 per cent of its members were on check-off and there is
resistance to switching payment of subscriptions through employees' bank
accounts by direct debit. The RMT stands to lose as much as Pounds 1.6m a
year as a result.
Other unions say their check-off campaigns are going well. The GMB general
union claims to have increased its membership by 4 per cent as a result,
with large net gains in Scotland and northern England.
Among other unions that believe they will increase their memberships are the
UCW postal union and the NCU communications union.
The IRSF tax officers' union and the CPSA civil service union have virtually
completed their check-off campaigns which they believe will result in all
members being signed up. Big general unions such as the TGWU and technical
union MSF still have some progress to make to achieve this aim. Only a small
number remain to be signed up in the AEEU engineering union.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Safety body set to urge more regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater regulation of health and safety in various high-risk occupations is
likely to be recommended to the government tomorrow by the Health and Safety
Commission.
Seven taskforces, with representatives from business, have been examining
health and safety regulations, their costs and benefits in areas such as
construction.
They have reported back to the HSC, which will publish its recommendations
to the government shortly after Mr John Major, the prime minister, announces
the competitiveness white paper.
It is understood that the HSC will say that there are various areas of high
risk in which current legislative controls are inadequate and that new
goal-setting regulations are needed.
Mr Kevin Barron, Labour's health and safety spokesman, said yesterday that
in 1992-93, 368 people died as a result of accidents at work in the UK while
143,244 serious accidents were reported to the Health and Safety Executive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to companies of giving paternity leave to workers is negligible, a
survey by Industrial Relations Services has found.
Allowing a father time off for his child's birth amounts to as little as 23
minutes per worker per year. A poll of 126 companies showed that about 6,000
workers had taken paternity leave during the past year. The average time off
was five days, although some companies grant only one day.

Customs and Excise is likely to appeal to the Lords after losing a case in
which it claimed value added tax worth Pounds 9.5m from a mail order company
selling through agents.
Three Court of Appeal judges ruled by a two-to-one majority that agents of
Bradford-based Fine Art Developments did not have to declare for VAT
purposes what they had sold.
Customs and Excise said the case revolved around the fact that VAT was only
being paid by agents on the price of the goods sold to them. It was not paid
on the full selling price to customers.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Legal challenge to dam funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is facing a challenge in the High Court over its funding of
the Pergau dam in Malaysia, Robert Rice writes.
The World Development Movement, a lobby group for the Third World, will
today launch an application for a judicial review of the decision taken in
1991 by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to fund the dam.
The group claims that 'the purpose for allocating the funds for the Pergau
dam project was not a purpose permitted by the 1980 Overseas Development and
Co-operation Act'.
The group wants Mr Hurd's decision overturned and an order prohibiting him
from 'making further payments out of aid funds for the Pergau dam project'.
The UK has so far spent Pounds 24m on the dam. The remaining Pounds 200m is
due to be paid to Malaysia through a soft loan over the next nine years.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Lilley to probe National Insurance avoidance claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has ordered an investigation
into allegations that some companies are avoiding National Insurance
contributions by paying staff bonuses in diamonds or wine and even through
life insurance schemes.
The move comes only seven months after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
announced moves in his Budget to stop employers legally avoiding the 10.4
per cent National Insurance they pay on staff bonuses.
However, by insisting that National Insurance was due on any bonus paid in
the form of 'a traded commodity on a recognised exchange' Mr Clarke left a
loophole. There are no such exchanges for diamonds or wine.
The Mail on Sunday drew attention to the issue again yesterday and also
pointed to a new avoidance scheme using life insurance in lieu of bonuses.
This involves a company taking out life insurance policies which are then
signed over to employees. The company pays premiums into the policies and
the employees cash them in after a short time.
National Insurance avoidance schemes are particularly attractive to City
companies that pay large annual bonuses. The newspaper claimed that 70 per
cent of the Pounds 500m paid in this way by City organisations this year
made use of avoidance schemes, thereby costing the government Pounds 36.4m.
A Department of Social Security official said yesterday: 'There will be an
investigation. Clearly, if there are still loopholes and significant sums of
revenue are being lost we will take it very seriously.'

FT  23 MAY 94 / Loyalists admit Irish pub attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The outlawed loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force last night claimed
responsibility for a failed bomb attack on a crowded Dublin pub on Saturday
night, during which one doorman was shot dead and another wounded.
The doorman was shot twice as he attempted to prevent two men from entering
the Widow Scallan pub in central Dublin shortly before closing time. The pub
is a well-known republican venue, and on Saturday night Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, was holding one of its regular fundraising events
there in support of republican prisoners.
Another man was shot in the neck after he had succeeded in slamming the door
on the attackers, who fired through the door as they fled. They abandoned a
holdall containing 18lbs of commercial explosive which failed to detonate.
More than 200 people were packed into the pub at the time.
A burnt-out car with Northern Ireland licence plates, believed by police to
be the attackers' getaway car, was found in central Dublin shortly after the
incident.
In a statement released in Belfast the UVF said it had 'struck at the very
heart of the republican movement in its own backyard'. It wanted to 'warn
the IRA and the Dublin government that the Ulster people will neither be
coerced or persuaded and will remain masters of their own destiny'.
The UVF said it had now overcome the 'logistical setback' caused by the
interception last year of a huge arms consignment destined for loyalist
paramilitaries and had a new supply of explosives.
The Dublin attack marks a dangerous escalation in the Northern Ireland
conflict, and follows a week of sectarian killings in Ulster in which four
Roman Catholic men were shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries, a part-time
British soldier was abducted and killed by an IRA unit, and a cleaner at an
RUC police station was killed by an IRA car bomb.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday appealed for an end
to tit-for-tat sectarian violence which he said was dragging the communities
apart. 'Sooner or later it has to stop. Why not stop it now? Let's get on
with working out an accommodation between the two communities (in Northern
Ireland).'
Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party, said yesterday: 'It is another piece of evidence that ever
since peace started to really be on the agenda, there has been a clear
escalation of loyalist violence. . . an obvious conclusion is that they
don't want the IRA to stop.'
Mr John Bruton, the leader of the opposition Fine Gael party in the Irish
Republic, said the attack was designed to 'terrorise the people of the
republic' and was being encouraged by efforts to open political contacts
with the IRA. 'Any type of dialogue with an organisation which continues to
use violence encourages imitators to bid for the same status,' he said.
Loyalist paramilitaries have carried out attacks in the republic before, but
these have mostly been confined to firebomb attacks on shops in the capital
and in border towns.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The political weakness of Mr John Major, the prime minister, could be
holding up the Northern Ireland peace process, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein
president, said at the weekend.
He said Sinn Fein was giving careful consideration to the British
government's clarification, published last week, of December's Downing
Street Declaration. He was speaking at the Turin book fair where he was
launching the Italian edition of his book of short stories about the
Northern Ireland troubles, The Street and Other Stories.
'John Major is a British prime minister who has great difficulties within
his own party,' he said. 'He is very dependent on his own right wing. That
may explain to some degree why, having addressed certain issues, the
government then slowed and is even now grudging in its commitment to the
peace process.'
During a wide-ranging audience discussion Mr Adams said the peace process
was at a critical phase and confirmed that he was consulting Sinn Fein
colleagues 'to see in what way these clarifications can move the peace
process forward'.
He added: 'The opinion of Sinn Fein is that there is a need for a peace
process. Unionists, including the (Unionist) death squads should be part of
it. We think if the British take a progressive attitude, the Unionists can
be brought round to work on a peace settlement.'
He suggested afterwards that the next steps in the process might not be
taken until after the European parliament elections early next month.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Early cut likely in Commons hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A drastic reduction in the number of hours that parliament sits could be
implemented within months amid signs that government and opposition business
managers are set to make progress in talks on the issue.
Concern over the heavy Commons workload on MPs, highlighted by the recent
death of John Smith, the Labour leader, has injected an urgency into the
approach of Conservative and Labour business managers towards the issue of
restricting the Commons timetable.
The issue will be discussed later this week at a meeting led by Mr Tony
Newton, the leader of the House, and Mr Nick Brown, his acting counterpart,
for Labour.
Measures being considered include the conclusion of more Commons business by
10pm, the introduction of Wednesday morning sittings and the allocation of
10 free Fridays per year in which MPs could visit their constituencies.
The government side will claim at this week's meeting that the measures
could be introduced quickly through the Commons' standing orders rather than
primary legislation.
Labour business managers have also said they may be willing to give way on
several demands from the government which are essential to any agreement for
reducing the length of sittings. A senior Labour MP said the party would
view favourably the request that more bills should be informally timetabled
so that votes could be taken after a specified period. 'There is a
willingness on our part to make reasonable arrangements,' he said.
Progress could also be made to ensure that more bills are subjected to
detailed examination in standing committees rather than on the floor of the
Commons.
Labour's front bench may find an agreement hard to sell to backbenchers
after a row earlier this year over the guillotining of bills arising from
the Budget. Labour introduced a period of non-co-operation with Tory whips
in protest at the move.
However, the government is keen to get an agreement on the Commons
timetable, partly because it needs to improve the efficiency with which
bills are considered. According to ministers, the amount of legislation
proposed by Whitehall departments for next year's session is already three
times greater than the parliamentary time available, and an agreement with
Labour might allow more bills to be considered.
Ministers are concerned that several bills due to be considered in the
1994-95 session - including the pensions bill - will weigh heavily on
Commons time.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Brown makes appeal to tradition: Leadership contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday made a strong appeal to
Labour's socialist past as a guide to the party's future, in a speech
carefully pitched at the traditional Labour mainstream. Combined with
repeated attacks on privatisation, the City and means-testing for welfare,
the speech was clearly aimed at the prejudices of the constituency and union
rank-and-file at Labour's annual Welsh conference.
In his keynote speech to the 500 delegates meeting at Swansea for the
one-day conference - truncated in the wake of John Smith's death - Mr Brown
called for party unity and made no mention of the coming leadership contest.
He also committed Labour to a University for Industry, partnership between
the public and private sectors and a readiness to grasp the opportunities of
the dawning new information age and the permanent industrial revolution now
in train.
But the tone of Mr Brown's speech was firmly traditionalist, laced with
appeals to socialist values 'that do not change. Let us have confidence that
our values are the values of the people of this country,' he told the
delegates, in what some saw as a clear effort to distance himself from
Labour's more radical modernisers.
Privatisation and the City were the targets of sustained invective. Mr Brown
contrasted 'neglected public services' with 'international companies using
and abusing Britain as a tax haven, directors of the privatised industries
overpaying themselves so grossly . . . (and) the waste, short-terminism and
costly failure of self-regulation in the City of London'.
In place of 'dividends-hungry' financial institutions, Mr Brown called for
'long-term investment agreements between UK companies and banks and
pension-funds investors'.
He said that an investments revolution lay at the core of Labour's
industrial policy.
He also recommitted Labour to a national minimum wage and a windfall tax on
the profits of privatised utilities. The tax would be used to help fund
radical measures to expand the capacity of the economy, including an
emergency employment programme and active regional and industrial policies.
Mr Brown had little to say about Europe except to condemn Conservative
divisions on the issue and to repeat Labour's support for a European
recovery fund and the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
The speech was well received by delegates, who had earlier debated
employment and the welfare state, including a motion calling for full
employment to be a key objective of a future Labour government.
Outside the conference hall the mood of delegates appeared to be in favour
of a contested leadership election. One said there was strong resentment in
south Wales constituency parties at the 'media bandwagon' for Mr Tony Blair,
the shadow home secretary.
Several delegates volunteered support for Mr John Prescott, shadow
employment secretary, because of his emphasis on full employment and his
rapport with Labour's grassroots.
A constituency official from Newport summed up the mood of one group in the
bar: 'Blair may be the man to win the election - but at least he should be
forced to debate the issues with John Prescott.'
Mr Brown's appeal to Labour's roots in Welsh trade unionism - 'from its
small beginnings in valleys and pit villages' in the late 19th century -
could be seen as the start of a campaign to cultivate union support.
Trade unionists make up one-third of Labour's leadership electoral college.
Mr Brown spoke to the hearts and concerns of Welsh union officials in his
audience with his commitments on employment, means-testing for benefits and
a 'strategy for coal' to revive the Welsh valleys, the cradle and bastion of
the 20th-century Labour party.
'We are sustained by our enduring values, handed down from one generation to
another, values that do not change,' Mr Brown said.

South Yemen's political leaders continued to defy northern ruler General Ali
Abdullah Saleh by announcing the formation of a new five-man presidential
council yesterday. The council proceeded to elect the southern leader, Mr
Ali Salem al-Beidh, president of the new state.
Drawing on a broad spectrum of political persuasions, the new council is an
obvious attempt to consolidate southern efforts at separating from the north
and at establishing an autonomous state.
Gen Saleh, reversing promises not to bomb the south, has meanwhile resumed
missile attacks on Aden, stronghold of the southern forces, vowing to
capture it at any cost. The planning minister, Mr Abdul-Karim al-Iryani,
told Reuters that with the secession 'the continuation of the war has become
inevitable.'
The north said its troops yesterday captured the southeastern Shabwa
province and its regional capital Ataq, including its airfield.
With members selected from five of South Yemen's six provinces, the aim of
the new presidential council is to achieve cohesion against northern efforts
to prevent any separatist movements. But the new council also brings
together old political rivals in a show of non-partisan support for the
Democratic Republic of Yemen, the new state announced on Saturday by Mr
al-Beidh.
Apart from Mr al-Beidh, leader of the Yemen Socialist party, other members
of the council include the deputy leader of the YSP, Mr Salem Saleh
Mohammed, the head of the Sons of Yemen League, Mr Abdul Rahman Ali
al-Jifri, the head of the Federation for the Liberation of South Yemen, Mr
Abdul Kawi Makawi, and Mr Suleiman Nasser Masoud, a member of the Ali Nasser
Mohammed wing of the YSP.
Western observers noted that members of the new council had all fought
against the British occupation of Aden in the 1960s and that several had
struggled against one another in the run-up to South Yemen's independence in
1967. The new council is therefore seen as an attempt to transcend long-
standing political rivalries in the face of the more urgent threat to
southern autonomy posed by Gen Saleh.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Southerners rejoice at move to end union: The four-year
merger was seen to favour the president's family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years playing second fiddle to the united Yemen government of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the south Yemenis, led by Mr Ali Salem
al-Beidh, have now publicly thrown down the gauntlet. On Saturday night they
announced their secession from Yemen, and the formation of a five-man
presidential council, which elected Mr al-Beidh president.
In Aden, the south Yemen capital, celebrations went on all night, even
though a missile fired by the north landed near Khormaksar airport and
fighting continued around the key southern airbase at Al-Anad, 60km north of
Aden.
The news brought a predictably vitriolic response from President Saleh, but
southern opinion and the army seem to be solidly behind Mr al-Beidh, his
deputy, Mr Saleh Salem Mohammed, and the Yemen Socialist party (YSP)
leadership.
The 2.5m-3m people in southern Yemen, including many northerners who have
settled in Aden, are united in their intense dislike of a northern regime
based on and favouring the president's family and relatives, and the Ahmar
clan within the Hashed tribal confederation to which the president belongs.
This oligarchy, they say, has abused its power and diverted the south's oil
revenue away from the south's economic development to satisfy the priorities
of 10m northerners.
'If a referendum were to be held tomorrow in the eastern and southern
governorates (of southern Yemen), there would be a clear majority in favour
of south Yemen reverting to its former statehood,' Mr al-Beidh told the
Dubai daily Gulf News in March.
The divisions between north and south were more than simple ideology or
tribal rivalry. In May 1990, when the north and south formally united, their
two separate systems of government were profoundly incompatible. The
southern one was based on 20 years of hardline Marxist control which
emphasised a strong central authority. By contrast, the northern central
government has never fully existed beyond Sanaa and two other cities,
Hodeida and Taiz. Elsewhere, tribal authority imposes itself on and competes
with the central government in Sanaa.
There is widespread resentment in the south at the way the Saleh presidency
lined up with Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, without
consulting southern members of the government. As a result of Saudi
antagonism, up to a million northern Yemenis had to leave Saudi Arabia,
dislocating the entire Yemeni economy through the loss of remittances and
the unwanted arrival in the south of several thousand northerners seeking
work.
The progressive devaluation of the north Yemeni rial - 84 per cent since May
1990 - and the wide difference between the official rate, YR12 to the dollar
compared with the free-market rate of YR75, have dragged the southern dinar
down with it.
The present cohesion in the south has depended to a large extent on the
durability of the oral pact earlier this year between the army and the YSP
leadership. According to this agreement, the army high command, most of
which comes from Dhala, Radfan, amd Yafai, the mountainous areas to the
north of Aden, agreed to support the political leaders' bid for secession
providing the latter stopped flirting with the idea of secession for the
Hadramawt, the eastern oil-producing part of south Yemen.
Most of the top leaders of the YSP come from the Hadramawt. They include Mr
al-Beidh, the erstwhile prime minister, Mr Haider Abu Bakr Al-Attas, the
former oil minister, and south Yemen chief-of-staff Saleh Abu Bakr Bin
Hussainoun, as well as the governor of Aden, Mr Salem Nasser Al-Siyali, who
has a Hadrami father and a Yafite mother.
All the signs are that this pact is holding up, thanks partly to the stiff
resistance being put up by the army at al-Anad and the reciprocal support it
was getting from the YSP leadership.
The south's Marxist period from 1970 to 1990 rarely involved more than the
political leadership and its acolytes in the internal security apparatus.
The leadership also utilised the system handed to it by the Soviet Union and
used it to remain in power. It was more a personal desire for power than a
power based on ideology.
The south also has a wide degree of support from south Yemenis overseas, as
well as a degree of tacit sympathy from some of its neighbours. In Jeddah,
the Bugshan, Binladin, and Bin Mahfouz families, all important figures in
Saudi corporate and financial life, come from the Hadramawt.
Saudi Arabia was never entirely happy with a united Yemen on its southern
border, part of which, in the areas around Najran, Gizan, and a large swathe
of the coastal Tihama plain, was conquered by the Saudis in the early 1930s
 -a legacy which has not been forgotten by north Yemenis.
Economic plans on the south's drawing board include the establishment in
Aden of a free zone, upgrading Aden's refinery, modernising the port, and
exploiting the Hadramawt's oil resources. Aden was reported to have been the
preferred terminal in a US-backed scheme for vapourised natural gas to be
pumped from north Yemen's gas fields of the Marib/Jawf area.
If the south is to survive, it will need a sustained period of political and
economic stability, and an economy based this time on a free-market rather
than a Marxist system.
With the north bent on its military destruction, stability seems a long way
off, but without it the south will not get the foreign investments it must
have.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Israeli troops alerted for reprisals

Troops in Israel's south Lebanon security zone and along the international
border were placed on heightened alert yesterday, after Lebanese Moslem
militants threatened to avenge the kidnapping by Israel of Mustapha Dirani,
leader of the pro-Iranian 'Faithful Resistance' guerrilla movement.
Mr Dirani was seized from his home in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley early on
Saturday morning, in what Israel's army chief of staff, Lt-Gen Ehud Barak,
described as an 'impeccably executed' commando operation.
The army's intelligence chief, Maj-Gen Uri Saguy, said Mr Dirani had
'already provided some answers to questions we've been asking for a long
time'; other military sources said that he was proving 'a tough nut to
crack' and that his interrogation would continue for several weeks.
The guerrilla leader, whose movement is linked to the pro-Iranian Hizbollah
group, is alleged by Israel to have taken prisoner an Israeli air force
navigator, Ron Arad, who bailed out of his Phantom jet over Lebanon in
October 1986. The Israelis claim Mr Dirani held Mr Arad captive for two
years, then sold him to a contingent of Iranian Revolutionary Guards for
Dollars 300,000 (Pounds 200,000).
Israel's Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said the Dirani kidnap had been
planned for months and that he hoped the Shia militia leader would be able
to provide information on Mr Arad's whereabouts. He added that Israel
decided on the operation after repeated appeals to Syria, via the US, for
details of Mr Arad had failed to produce results.
He said Israel did not intend to use Mr Dirani as a bargaining chip, having
learned from experience that trying to arrange such details was futile.
While Hizbollah vowed to 'expand the scope of fighting' against Israel in
response to the kidnapping, and other Islamic militant sources threatened
'spectacular retaliation', Israeli politicians from across the spectrum came
out overwhelmingly in support of the operation. Israeli troops killed at
least one alleged Islamic militant and captured two others when raiding a
house in the West Bank town of Hebron yesterday.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Cabinet focuses on house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli ministers are to hold a second cabinet session tomorrow to debate
ways to slow the rise in house prices, having failed to reach any final
decisions at a long cabinet meeting yesterday.
With the Gaza-Jericho autonomy deal still in its earliest stages, and a
threat of hostilities on the Lebanese border following the weekend's
kidnapping by Israelis of an Islamic extremist leader, the scheduling of a
second cabinet session devoted to house prices reflects the extent of
government concern.
Government figures indicate that apartment prices have risen by some 60 per
cent in dollar terms over the past four years alone. Real estate rises are
the key factor in the monthly consumer price index - housing accounted for
0.8 points of the 2.1 per cent rise in the index for April - and the
continued rises so far this year have already in effect killed hopes that
Israel might keep inflation to single figures in 1994.
Flats in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, where demand is highest, are selling for an
average of Dollars 3,500 (Pounds 2,300) a square metre.
What most concerns Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Labour government is the
growing anger among both new immigrants and young Israeli families that they
can no longer reach even the first rung on the housing ladder. Mr Rabin
fears economic discontent, centred on housing costs, could rebound against
him at the next elections in two years.
Unimpressed by the efforts of his minister of construction, Mr Benjamin
Ben-Eliezer, to speed the procedures for freeing state land for building, he
recently appointed an inter-ministerial committee, headed by his own bureau
director-general, Mr Shimon Shevis, to devise new proposals to slow the
price rises.
The cabinet heard the first of these proposals yesterday, including plans
for government building projects, for schemes to guarantee government
purchase of apartments that contractors prove unable to sell privately, and
for the allocation of land for 110,000 apartments over the next two years.
The Treasury and the Bank of Israel, however, strongly oppose public
construction and government guarantees for private contractors.

Rwandan rebels yesterday captured the government army barracks in the
capital, Kigali, removing the biggest obstacle in their drive to seize power
in the city, reports Reuter from Kigali.
Witnesses said the Kanombe barracks, like the nearby airport taken earlier
by the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels, fell without serious resistance.
Asked what was now the RPF's target, a senior officer said: 'The city and
then the country.'
Hundreds of civilians were streaming out from districts around the barracks
to the relative safety of the airport, now firmly in rebel hands.
The RPF military leader, Maj-Gen Paul Kagame, is credited with rebuilding
its army single-handed when the death of its former leader in October 1990
threatened to tear the movement apart.
Government and rebel forces have agreed to a truce while UN envoys are in
the country, from 8am local time today until 6pm tomorrow, UN military
commander General Romeo Dallaire told Reuters.
Uganda declared districts bordering Lake Victoria disaster areas yesterday
because of the danger posed by corpses that have floated downriver from
Rwanda, AP reports.
Radio Uganda said 10,000 to 40,000 corpses had floated into Lake Victoria
from the Kagera River, which flows out of Rwanda's highlands.

FT  23 MAY 94 / UN tightens Haiti sanctions: Little assurance new curbs will
work against military junta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tougher international economic sanctions went into effect against Haiti
yesterday after leaders of the military junta failed to leave the country by
a United Nations deadline of May 21.
But there was little assurance the sanctions would be more effectively
implemented than the narrower embargo on deliveries of fuel and arms over
the last seven months.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, formally notified the UN
Security Council on Friday that General Raoul Cedras, the military commander
who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991, had not met the
necessary conditions, triggering a broad embargo on shipments of everything
except food, medicine and cooking gas.
The existing fuel embargo, however, has had little effect on the Haitian
military - although it has raised prices - because of a steady flow of
contraband petrol across the border from the Dominican Republic, which
shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
US Vice-President Al Gore said yesterday the US was holding talks with the
Dominican Republic on ways of improving implementation of the sanctions, but
declined to threaten reprisals if co-operation does not improve. He insisted
that it would be 'premature to discount the effectiveness of these tough new
sanctions, but we are proceeding with other measures as well'.
In the Dominican Republic, the government of 87-year-old President Joaquin
Balaguer remains to some degree in suspense after the elections board
ordered a recount in last week's election, responding to complaints of fraud
made by Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the challenger.
President Bill Clinton's Haiti policy has continued to suffer intense
criticism, particularly from human rights advocates and black politicians,
even after the White House shifted its policy of returning Haitian refugees
to their country and named Mr William Gray, a respected former congressman,
to be the US's new special envoy on Haiti.
But the US won significant endorsement for its new policy towards refugees,
which involves hearing their claims to asylum at sea, when Mrs Sadako Ogata,
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, promised her agency's assistance in
processing Haitian emigrants.
The US has chartered a Ukrainian cruise ship as a processing centre at sea,
but Mr Clinton last week raised with Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, the possibility of using some uninhabited islands in the Turks and
Caicos archipelago, a British possession which lies to the north of Haiti.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Frei delays action on power of Chile's military leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei has promised to push through important
amendments to the 1980 constitution, inherited from the military regime,
though he has postponed dealing with the most controversial issue - the
immobility of commanders-in-chief.
Mr Frei, in a weekend address to Congress, said he would seek to remove from
the Senate the eight non-elected members appointed by former dictator
General Augusto Pinochet.
The presence of the designated senators makes it difficult to force
controversial legislation through the 46-member body.
Mr Frei, who assumed office in March, will also move to change the binominal
electoral system which guarantees the opposition disproportionate power in
parliament.
However, the president, who said the proposed changes were not a matter of
'imposing one's will over others', avoided the issue of his own inability to
appoint or sack military commanders, including Gen Pinochet. Mr Frei has
repeatedly protested that such limits on presidential authority are
incompatible with full democracy.
The president, according to a fellow coalition member, Mr Jorge Schaulsohn,
did not wish to 'waste time or congest the legislative timetable on
constitutional reforms that we know beforehand are going to fail'. Mr Frei's
willingness to avoid more controversial amendments improves his chances of
pushing through those he has proposed.
The president's emollient attitude, however, fails to address the current
constitutional impasse in which the police chief, Gen Rodolfo Stange,
remains in office in spite of government insistence that he should go.
Gen Stange, one of the unremovable commanders-in-chief, is being
investigated for the alleged cover-up of three political murders committed
by the police. In private, the government admits it does not know how to end
the confrontation.
