FT  20 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Grand Metropolitan raises Dollars 400m
in eurodollar debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relief over the latest move by the US Federal Reserve Board appeared to be
filtering through to the eurobond market yesterday as Dollars 1bn worth of
eurodollar issues were launched.
One of the first in the queue was Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink
giant, which raised Dollars 400m through its first eurodollar issue. The
five-year paper was priced to yield 53 basis points above the equivalent
Treasury bond.
Mr Nick Rose, GrandMet's group treasurer, was enthusiastic about the bond's
reception.
'Its not that often that rates in Europe are as attractive as they are in
the US,' he said, arguing that he was taking advantage of the low level of
issuance in five-year maturities.
He said the paper was issued in Europe principally to increase GrandMet's
profile on the continent where its brand names such as Burger King and
Smirnoff vodka were more familiar to investors than the name of the company.
The bonds were aimed at retail investors and by the end of the day around
two-thirds of the issue had been taken up. Proceeds of the deal will repay
short-term commercial paper borrowings and have already been converted into
floating-rate dollars.
However, some syndicate managers said the deal was priced too competitively
and take-up was relatively slow. They felt that the pricing should have been
least 10 basis points wider and were sceptical about the amount alleged to
have been taken up.
One commented: 'We are in the most vicious bear market in years and
sentiment is not going to change that quickly.'
Joint lead manager Morgan Stanley agreed that sales by the co-managers had
been 'spotty' but defended the pricing.
'Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have always been responsible for raising
GrandMet's debt in the US. We understand the company's credit rating and
this deal is actually cheaper than the equivalent US paper,' an official at
Morgan Stanley said.
The market's inability to absorb yesterday's flood of paper were also
reflected by an issue from JFM of Japan, which raised Dollars 300m through
an offering of 10-year paper priced to yield 33 basis points above 10-year
Treasuries. The spread held but lead manager IBJ International was believed
to have bought some of the issue back after syndicate broke.
Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Sweden launched a Y80bn zero-coupon issue maturing
in September 1999. The issue was targeted at the Japanese retail investors
and was priced to yield between 30 and 35 basis points above an equivalent
bank debenture currently traded in Japan.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB gives Globex vote of
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DTB, Germany's financial futures exchange, said yesterday it intends to join
Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by
Reuters, the financial information and news group.
DTB's decision gives a badly-needed vote of confidence to Globex, which has
been rejected by two leading futures exchanges in the past month.
On Tuesday, Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, decided against
joining the system, blaming in part the terms which Globex had laid down.
Last month, the Chicago Board of Trade said it was pulling out of Globex
despite a new two-year agreement designed to give exchanges more
flexibility.
DTB is the third exchange to join Globex, along with the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Matif, the French futures exchange. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters'
managing director for transaction products, said an agreement between Globex
and DTB would be signed 'quite soon' and that its products would be listed
on the system shortly thereafter.
DTB said one of the main attractions of joining Globex was the access it
would provide to the US market. The most likely DTB products to be traded on
Globex would be its futures contracts in five-year and 10-year German
government bonds (bobls and bunds) and the corresponding options.
Futures industry observers said that since DTB did not have after-hours
trading, it should be able to mirror the success Matif has found on Globex.
Matif closed down its after-hours trading system when it joined and its
products now account for 80 per cent of volume on the system.
'Our decision forced an initial liquidity into the system because people had
no choice,' said a Matif spokeswoman. However, most of Matif's volume on
Globex is generated between 4pm and 9pm Paris time and there is virtually no
trading during the night, she said. Cross-exchange trading has also failed
to meet its goal, accounting for only 3 per cent of volume.
DTB's hopes to increase volume in its contracts through Globex could be
dashed by counter-moves at Liffe, which is keen to protect its 70 per cent
share of the market in German government bond contracts.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said earlier this week that Liffe's
after-pit trading could easily be extended by two hours, thus taking it to
the end of the Chicago morning trading session which ends at 2pm Chicago
time. Liffe may also extend its network overseas, following the successful
installation of Liffe screens in New York.

Pakistan is preparing to launch its first eurobond - possibly raising
Dollars 200m - in the next two months, writes Farhan Bokhari from Islamabad.
It will be the country's first attempt to convert some of its short-term
loans into medium-term borrowings. It is also keen to improve the stability
of its foreign exchange reserves.
'It is time to go to the international capital markets with a better credit
rating than is available in Pakistan and convert some six-month borrowings
into a bond,' said the Islamabad MoF.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: HK Telecom calls on local talent
 -Simon Holberton examines the blueprints for an invasion of China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the very end of last year, Linus Cheung left Cathay Pacific, his employer
for 23 years, and accepted the job as chief executive of Hongkong
Telecommunications.
For Mr Cheung, a Cathay man through and through, the decision was agonising.
It cost him 10lbs in weight, but he gives no indication that he has spent
any time looking back.
'The trust they (Cable &amp; Wireless, which owns 57.5 per cent of HK Telecom)
have put in me is amazing,' Mr Cheung said in an interview yesterday. 'I'm
breaking my back to make sure I deliver.'
Mr Cheung holds the distinction of being the most senior Chinese executive
of all the traditional big British companies in Hong Kong. But while he may
display an uncommon humility, he is not sentimental: 'Without 1997 this job
would not have been available to a Chinese person,' he says.
His appointment 2 1/2 months ago went to the heart of Hongkong Telecom/Cable
&amp; Wireless's strategy for China and its realisation that the company should
be led by an ethnic Chinese.
There may be good business to be done in cellular telephones in Singapore
(population 2.5m), or nibbling at the edges of a liberalised telecoms market
in Taiwan (population 21m), but China (population 1.2bn) is where the future
lies for Hongkong Telecom.
Mr Cheung acknowledges this himself when he says how he admires Lord Young,
Cable &amp; Wireless's chairman, for 'localising' the top job in Hong Kong; and
notes his welcome from officials in Beijing. 'They have reacted positively
to my appointment,' he says.
Cracking the China market will not be easy. History and geography confer on
Hongkong Telecom a special place in China's emerging telecommunications
market, especially in relation to Beijing's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT).
China, through the MPT, accounts for 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom's
revenues. Also, as the principal and dominant telecoms operator in what is
soon to be China's richest province, Hongkong Telecom has recognised that it
has no alternative but to co-operate with the MPT - the guardian of China's
telecoms system from foreign invasion and a regulator it cannot ignore.
Mr Cheung yesterday gave the clearest exposition to date of what his company
wants to do once the MPT relaxes its prohibition on foreign involvement in
China's domestic network. 'We would very much like to invest in fixed
network construction and management,' he says.
'We prefer those localities which require a high number of lines. We are
open-minded as to where we do this but any investment will have to be
commercially viable.'
Mr Cheung believes the BOT (build, operate, transfer) model - which has been
used so successfully by foreign investors in China's power industry - can be
modified and used for regional telecoms development on the mainland. He
believes Hongkong Telecom would want a continuing management role in a
network after its transfer to the local PTT.
The company has offices in Beijing and Guangzhou but will expand its
presence on the mainland. It will soon open in Shanghai and Mr Cheung says
he would also like the company to be represented in Xian and Dalian - to
cover the north-west and north-east of China respectively. 'We have lots of
friends in China,' he says.
The company has very good relations with the MPT in Beijing. This was
underlined last month when C&amp;W/Hongkong Telecom and the MPT formed a joint
venture partnership in submarine cables. The Sino-British Submarine Systems
Company is 51 per cent owned by the MPT and 49 per cent owned by Great
Eastern Telecommunications, jointly owned by C&amp;W and Hongkong Telecom.
Submarine Systems will lay optical fibre cable in and around the waters of
China and maintain the optical fibre link between Japan and China. Given
Britain's poor relations with China over Hong Kong it is remarkable that the
deal went through. It is even more remarkable that Lord Young met Mr Jiang
Zemin, China's president and Communist party chief.
If China will let any non-mainland company benefit from involvement in the
domestic telecoms network then that company will be Hongkong Telecom. With
China's plans to increase the size of the telephone network from its current
capacity of 40m lines to 100m (and possibly 140m lines) by 2000, Mr Cheung
believes that foreign investment will have to come.
For a Chinese nationalist like Mr Cheung to participate in the building of
modern China gives rise to no small amount of pride. 'China has waited 200
years for prospects like these,' he says.

Four big Japanese construction companies have reported lower pre-tax profits
for the year to March, underlining the poor state of the building sector.
The declines came in spite of government efforts to boost the economy
through construction related projects.
Most companies blamed intense competition for sagging margins and warned
that the introduction of competitive tendering for public sector orders
would erode margins further this year. Three of the four cut their dividends
or said they would reduce them during the current year.
Three of Japan's biggest property companies also posted poor results, in
spite of large sales of property to boost net income. All three reported
lower pre-tax profits and warned that results would deteriorate further this
year.
Shimizu, Japan's largest general contractor, posted pre-tax profits down 9.6
per cent to Y119bn (Dollars 1.15bn), on sales 3.4 per cent lower at Y2.09bn.
Mr Takeshi Shiroishi, vice-president, said orders had been below budget,
with falls in private and public sector demand.
The group cut its dividend from Y14 per share to Y10 and said it would cut
it again to Y9 this year. It predicted pre-tax profits this year would fall
to Y50bn on turnover of Y1,800bn.
Taisei, one of the largest building and civil engineering groups, reported
pre-tax profits down 27.7 per cent at Y73bn, on sales 6.5 per cent lower at
Y1,850bn. The company said improvements in housing construction and public
works spending had not offset poor demand in the private sector.
It warned that pre-tax profits would fall again this year to Y33bn on sales
of Y1,550bn. The company said the dividend, maintained at Y12 per share for
last year, would be cut to Y8 for the current 12 months.
Kaijima, the building and civil engineer, posted pre-tax profits down 23.4
per cent at Y67.4bn, on sales 10.4 per cent lower at Y1,750bn. The dividend
is cut from Y13 per share to Y9. It forecast pre-tax profits this year of
Y57bn on sales of Y1,700bn.
Obayashi, the Osaka-based construction group was the only one of the four to
post increases in pre-tax profits, up 17.8 per cent at Y57.7bn, and sales,
up 7.6 per cent at Y1,636bn. The company, which is strong in south-east
Asia, said it had benefited from public works orders. However, after-tax
profits dropped 52.3 per cent to Y10.3bn following the Y30bn liquidation of
a US subsidiary.
The group maintained its dividend at Y8 per share. It predicted pre-tax
profits this year would drop to Y42bn on sales of Y1,450bn.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: HK Telecom improves 18 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Telecommunications yesterday exceeded analysts' expectations with
an 18 per cent rise in 1994 net earnings to HKDollars 7.5bn (USDollars
974m), in 1993.
Turnover was up 12 per cent to HKDollars 24.3bn, while operating costs were
held to a 9 per cent rise. The total dividend is to be HK cents 51 a share -
up 18 per cent on 1992.
International telephone services - which account for 63 per cent of the
company's turnover - grew by 12 per cent. China business grew by 31 per
cent, less than 1993's growth of 35 per cent, reflecting a cooling of
economic growth on the mainland.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Top trading houses hit by strong
yen and slow sales - Japanese Results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The combination of a harsh economic climate at home, and a surging yen
abroad produced another difficult year for Japan's five largest trading
companies. In the year ended March, four of the five groups saw profits
tumble.
The trading houses' core activities depend heavily on the flow of goods and
services in the domestic and international economy. Continuing weakness at
home was reflected in their domestic results.
Although some achieved small increases in sales, thanks largely to an
improving market in metal products, most companies reported weakness in the
large industrial sectors. Sluggish domestic demand also reduced revenues
from imports. However, for most companies, the tightest squeeze on sales
came from the exchange rate. The yen's sharp appreciation in the last year
cut exports, with car sales to the US particularly affected. Sumitomo
reported exports down by more than 20 per cent.
All five companies continued to suffer the painful consequences of
ill-starred ventures into financial products in the late 1980s. The
unwinding of these investments reduced profits further last year.
The worst performer was Itochu, which saw pre-tax profits fall by 38 per
cent. Most of the decline was the result of the liquidation of loss-ridden
financial investment schemes, and the disposal of tokkin, or specified money
trusts, worth Y110bn (Dollars 1.1bn).
These funds have left the trading companies heavily exposed since the stock
market began its precipitous decline four years ago.
Itochu has now reduced its outstanding tokkin accounts to Y97bn, against
Y566bn in 1990.
The five big groups managed to maintain the pace of cost-cutting.
Despite a fall in turnover, Marubeni reported a slight increase in pre-tax
profits as a result of deep cuts in administrative and sales costs.
Most companies forecast a rise in current year profits but remained
cautious. They expect only a gradual recovery in the Japanese economy, and
few are banking on any help from a weakening yen.

<TEXT>
National Australia Bank and Westpac, two of Australia's largest commercial
banks, yesterday reported interim figures which emphasised the continuing
improvement in bad debt experience. They also demonstrated some pick-up in
the business lending market.
NAB, reckoned to be the strongest of Australia's big four banks, announced a
profit of ADollars 868.8m (USDollars 634.2m) after tax for the six months
until the end of March. This included a ADollars 63.8m abnormal item
relating to a disposal, but still represented a sharp increase on last
time's ADollars 507.3m, which also included a ADollars 32.9m abnormal
surplus.
NAB attributed the improvement to a higher level of business loan demand in
Australia and New Zealand, a decline in operating expenses, and a further
'significant' reduction in the charge for bad and doubtful debts.
The two biggest geographical divisions - Australian operations and
businesses in the UK and Ireland (which include the Clydesdale, Northern,
Yorkshire and National Irish banks) - posted net profits of ADollars 509.9m,
against ADollars 325.9m last time, and ADollars 233.6m against ADollars
157.2m, respectively. The New Zealand group made ADollars 37.9m.
Westpac reported a ADollars 320.9m profit after tax, against a loss of
ADollars 204.6m a year earlier. In its case, the drop in the bad and
doubtful debts charge was more marked, although the figure remains much
higher than at NAB. The charge in the half-year was ADollars 379m compared
with ADollars 799.7m.
Westpac's gross problem assets stood at ADollars 5.5bn at the end of March,
compared with ADollars 8.57bn a year earlier.
Westpac said restructuring at the bank had helped to push its expense/income
ratio down to 60 per cent in the six months. It said it was 'well-placed' to
achieve its target of 58 per cent in the 1995 financial year.
Westpac is increasing the interim dividend by 33 per cent to 8 cents a
share. NAB has declared a full-franked interim dividend of 35 cents a share,
up from 24 cents.

Sega, the video games group, last year suffered its first fall in profits
for 12 years, coming under pressure from a rising yen and weak demand in
Europe and Japan.
Revenues for the year ended March, improved 2 per cent to Y354bn (Dollars
3.38bn) but pre-tax profits tumbled 23 per cent to Y42.5bn.
Sega said that the US market had been buoyant and had contributed
significantly to profits but demand from Europe was weak.
The company, which relies for nearly 70 per cent of consolidated sales on
overseas markets, was hurt by the yen's sharp appreciation.
Sega is cutting costs and moving software manufacturing overseas in order to
counter the impact of the strong yen.
It is confident that efforts to move into new areas will pay off this year.
It will introduce a new advanced games machine in the autumn. It has already

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Computer Associates to acquire
Ask Group

<TEXT>
Computer Associates, one of the largest software groups, is to acquire the
Ask Group, a California company that specialises in software for
manufacturing systems and database management, for about Dollars 300m in
cash.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates will offer to purchase all
outstanding shares of the Ask Group for Dollars 13.25 per share, a premium
of Dollars 4.25 over the pre-offer share price of Dollars 9.
Following the tender offer, any Ask shares not owned by Computer Associates
will be converted into the right to receive Dollars 13.25 per share in cash.
The agreement has been approved by directors of both companies.
EDS and Hewlett-Packard, the two largest shareholders of the Ask Group, have
agreed to tender their shares, representing a total of 27 per cent of the
outstanding shares.
'The ASK/CA combination is the best possible outcome for the employees,
shareholders and customers of ASK, and we look forward to working with CA,'
said Mr Eric Carlson, Ask chief executive.
Ask has gone through a series of top management changes over the past three
years as it struggled to achieve sustained profits.
The company recorded heavy losses, after charges, in fiscal 1992 and slim
profits of Dollars 149,000, or 1 cent per share, in 1993 on revenues of
Dollars 426m.
The company employs about 2,000 people but is restructuring operations and
cutting its workforce.
Computer Associates, which has grown to become one of the world's largest
software companies through acquisitions, has about 7,000 employees and
reported revenues of over Dollars 2bn for 1993.
'We're excited to have the opportunity to include the Ask people, products
and clients in the CA family,' said Mr Charles Wang, chairman and chief
executive.

Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was
closing three plants and shutting production lines at four other plants over
the next 30 months with the loss of 1,100 jobs.
The closures are part of the restructuring announced in July last year under
which Procter &amp; Gamble is closing 30 plants and shedding 13,000 jobs, some
12 per cent of its workforce world-wide.
Under the plans announced yesterday, the company will close the Manati
pharmaceuticals plant in Puerto Rico in 1996; the Hatboro health and beauty
care products plant in Pennsylvania by May 1996; and the Torshall throat
drop products plant in Sweden by the end of next year.
Production will be transferred to other sites. Procter &amp; Gamble said
employees would be offered early retirement, transfers or 'supportive'
severence packages. Skin care production lines will close in Mississauga,
Ontario; Hunt Valley, Maryland; and Naucalpan, Mexico.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: NEC to open Europe R&amp;D centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEC Corporation, the large Japanese electronics group, is to open its first
European research centre in Bonn, Germany, in September. The company has
nine laboratories and three research and development centres in Japan, but
its only overseas research centres are in New Jersey in the US.
NEC said yesterday the new centre would enable the company to build closer
ties with research centres in Europe as well as helping to underpin
research, manufacturing and product sales. The initial investments will be
modest: about Y100m (Dollars 920,000) a year to support six staff. However,
there are plans to grow to a staff of 20. A director for the centre has yet
to be named.
The centre, to be sited in the German National Information Processing Centre
Technopark (GMD) in the Bonn suburbs will investigate problems associated
with advanced computing and multimedia communications systems. It will
include joint research with GMD using NEC's parallel processing
supercomputer, Cenju-3.
NEC said it believed the GMD was the leading institute in Europe for
parallel computing, distributed processing and multimedia. The Bonn location
made for easy interchange with other Europe institutes.
NEC is the second Japanese company this week to announce a European R&amp;D
initiative. On Monday, Hitachi said it was establishing a wholly-owned
semiconductor design operation in the UK to service European customers.

rescue

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All of Euro Disney's 61 creditor banks have accepted a financial
restructuring package for the troubled leisure group, Banque Nationale de
Paris and Banque Indosuez, the joint heads of the banks' steering committee,
announced yesterday.
The unanimous agreement, which ended resistance from a few of the group's
smaller creditor banks, clears the way for the final phase of the leisure
company's FFr13bn (Dollars 2.3bn) emergency restructuring.
Euro Disney shareholders must now be asked at an extraordinary meeting to
endorse proposals for a FFr6bn rights issue, which forms the core of the
restructuring package.
The meeting, expected to be announced imminently, should take place in about
a month. Details of the share issue are expected to be announced a few days
after the meeting, with the aim of completing the restructuring before the
August summer holidays.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which holds 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, has promised to take up its full entitlement of the rights issue.
The banks will underwrite the remaining 51 per cent.
Yesterday's announcement of a green light from all the banks coincided with
the inauguration of a high-speed rail link for the EuroDisneyland theme
park.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney chairman, said the new terminus at the
theme park, connecting the Paris-Lille and the Paris-Lyon high-speed railway
lines, would improve access to EuroDisneyland. 'New horizons are opening to
us,' Mr Bourguignon said.

Transbrasil, the Brazilian airline, is negotiating the sale of 40 per cent
of its voting shares and a capital injection of Dollars 700m as part of a
restructuring.
Mr Omar Fontana, who founded the airline and controls 94 per cent of voting
capital, said a group of European and Brazilian bankers was planning to buy
40 per cent of the voting shares.
The purchase would be followed by an immediate cash injection of Dollars 80m
and a total investment of Dollars 700m by the first half of next year. This
would include an investment of Dollars 100m in the airline's cargo
operations.
A final decision is expected shortly.
Transbrasil recorded an operating loss of Dollars 45m in the year to
December 1993 on sales of Dollars 422m and has not paid share dividends
since 1986.
Mr Fontana declined to name the potential buyers but said the Dollars 700m
investment would take the form of loans to be converted into equity.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hanson to step down as chief at
Calpers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dale Hanson, one of the leading figures in the movement to strengthen
shareholder rights, is to step down as chief executive of the California
Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension
fund in the US.
Under Mr Hanson, Calpers has become one of the most aggressive - and because
of its size, influential - members of the shareholder rights movement, which
seeks to make companies more accountable to investors by improving their
corporate governance.
Mr Hanson, 51, became chief executive of the California fund in 1987. He was
expected to announce his plans at a press conference at Calpers'
headquarters in Sacramento yesterday.
Mr Hanson played an important role in encouraging the nascent shareholder
rights movement to focus on companies' poor financial performance and
agitate for change, rather than limiting its activism to issues such as
anti-takeover poison pills. He pushed hard for executive pay to be more
closely linked to financial results.
A study by Wilshire Associates, the pension consulting firm, suggested his
approach had produced positive results: the shares of companies targetted by
Calpers between 1990 and 1992 had outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index of leading stocks.
However, his forthright criticism of corporate under-performers made him
unpopular with some pro-business Californian politicians, and he came under
pressure from Calpers' board to cut back on high-profile corporate
governance work in favour of more mundane fund administration.
His departure leaves uncertainty over Calpers' corporate governance
strategy. Mr DeWitt Bowman, Calpers chief investment officer, left the fund
recently. He has been replaced by Ms Sheryl Pressler, a former McDonnell
Douglas employee benefits fund manager.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic to develop
multimedia data network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bell Atlantic, the tele-communications group, yesterday announced the most
ambitious plan by a US telephone company to build a commercial multimedia
information network. It will lift AT&amp;T, equipment manufacturer, by making it
prime contractor for the project. Other contracts have been awarded to
General Instrument.
The programme forms the centrepiece of an Dollars 11bn five-year capital
spending programme by Bell Atlantic, the Baby Bell telephone company serving
states from New Jersey to Virginia. Yesterday's contract award is thought to
be one of the largest in telecommunications history.
Bell Atlantic said it would begin offering its 'full service network' -
delivering interactive multimedia television entertainment and information
to the home - in six leading markets in 1995 and in the rest of its 20
largest markets by 1998.
Many US cable and telephone companies are conducting trials of multimedia
and upgrading their networks, but Bell Atlantic's system looks likely to be
the first to go commercial on a large scale.
It said AT&amp;T's Network Systems division, which makes communications capital
equipment, had been selected as the prime contractor and systems integrator
and would be the main network equipment supplier.
It is the latest in a series of big contract wins for AT&amp;T, which is
modernising the network of Pacific Telesis, the Californian
telecommunications group, and it recently won a Dollars 4bn order from Saudi
Arabia.
General Instrument, supplier of set top terminals to the cable television
industry, has been selected to provide a new generation of interactive
multimedia terminals, and provide end-to-end access control, encryption and
digital compression technologies.
BroadBand Technologies, a small North Carolina company will help implement
multimedia network architecture. The deal is a blow to DSC Communications,
which lost a bid to supply transmission gear to the project.
Yesterday's announcement underscores Bell Atlantic's determination to push
ahead and offer multimedia to consumers in its telephone region, in spite of
the collapse in February of its proposed merger with Tele-Communications
which would have opened up multimedia opportunities in other US regions.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Woolworth inquiry finds cover-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Employees of Woolworth, the US retailer, falsified the company's financial
results in the first two quarters of last year because they believed they
were acting under orders to show a profit, an internal investigation has
found.
In spite of a conclusion that wrong-doing occurred within the company, the
report stops short of pinpointing blame. 'Recollections clashed sharply and
the evidence is in conflict,' it said.
However, Mr Charles Young, the chief financial officer, has resigned and Mr
William Lavin, chairman and chief executive officer, has been stripped of
his chairmanship. He will become vice-chairman
Woolworth's board launched the investigation in March after realising that,
although the previous year's annual results were correct, the quarterly
results were wrong. Profits had been reported in the first two quarters when
the company had in reality incurred losses.
Employees tried to conceal losses by deferring costs till later in the year,
when the financial position was expected to improve. The plan went wrong
when the company stayed in losses for the third and fourth quarters.
The report, released late Wednesday after the stock market closed, presents
a picture of management and employees contradicting each other over who was
to blame.
It says a large number of employees interviewed commented on 'a reporting
environment at the company that placed extreme emphasis on maintaining
quarterly earnings, and more specifically, reporting quarterly financial
results consistent with budget projections.'
Mr Selig Adler, chief financial officer of Woolworth's Kinney Shoe
Corporation subsidiary, told the board that Mr Young, the parent company's
chief financial officer, had instructed him to report inaccurate quarterly
results 'so as to inflate the company's publicly reported profits'.
Mr Young conceded he might have described some preliminary results as
'unacceptable' but said he had never asked anyone, directly or indirectly,
to report inaccurate figures.
An employee of Woolworth's Canadian subsidiary told the investigators he had
been directed by Mr E. Ronald Gamble, the unit's chief financial officer, to
report monthly financial results 'that differed from the numbers contained
in the general ledger, thereby overstating Canada's interim operating
results'.
Mr Gamble confirmed this but said he had been directed by the then chief
executive of Woolworth Canada and Mr Young to report different numbers. The
former Woolworth Canada chief executive and Mr Young denied the allegation.
Mr Lavin, group chief executive, conceded in interviews with the
investigators he had pushed employees hard to verify earnings numbers. 'It
is conceivable that because of my position and forcefulness, subordinates
could feel pressure and misperceive my intentions.' But he added: 'I
certainly did not intend my remarks to be construed as encouragement to
report other than truthful numbers.'
Mr Young, resigning as chief financial officer, denied any misconduct. But
in his resignation letter dated May 17, he said conditions had so changed he
could no longer effectively discharge his duties.
Mr Lavin and Mr Young stepped aside during the investigation. Mr Young will
be replaced by Mr Andrew Hines, earlier appointed his temporary replacement,
while the new non-executive chairman will be Mr John Adams, the outside
director who headed the investigation.
A criminal investigation appears unlikely, but the Securities and Exchange
Commission has launched an inquiry into the accounting irregularities. The
company remains the target of shareholder lawsuits.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Eastern plans low-cost take-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Airlines, the defunct US airline, hopes to emerge from bankruptcy as
a low-cost carrier similar to Southwest Airlines, according to the
court-appointed trustee for the company.
Mr Martin Shugrue, who wants to re-start the airline as an alternative to
pressing ahead with its liquidation, told a conference in Las Vegas the
airline would aim to penetrate carefully-selected US markets which were
either overpriced or under served.
Mr Shugrue said the airline would fly from three main cities - Atlanta,
Indianapolis and Philadelphia - to destinations initially including Boston,
Orlando, Miami, Tampa and Detroit.
He said the airline hoped to begin operations in October next year with an
initial fleet of 14 McDonnell Douglas DC9s making 78 trips a day between the
eight cities.
Eastern Airlines, once one of the best known names in US aviation, went into
bankruptcy in March 1989 amid a bitter power struggle between its unions and
its then chairman, Mr Frank Lorenzo.
It was grounded in January 1991.
Mr Shugrue, a former vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Pan
American World Airways, announced last month he wanted to get the airline
flying again. He said Eastern's creditors would get more money back through
a re-start than they would through a liquidation.
Mr Shugrue told the Las Vegas conference the plan had the approval of the
bankruptcy court, but could only go forward if he could raise sufficient
capital to begin services and see off any competition An initial
capitalisation of Dollars 100m would provide that cushion, he said.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sony falls 21% to Y99.7bn for
year

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, suffered a sharp
fall in operating profit due to appreciation of the yen, weak demand in key
markets and a poor performance by its film company.
The continuing difficult environment for Sony resulted in a 6.5 per cent
fall in revenues to Y3,734bn (Dollars 36bn) in the year to the end of March,
from Y3,993bn last year, and a 54 per cent decline in net income to Y15.3bn
(36.3bn).
Operating profit was down 21 per cent to Y99.7bn from Y126.5bn previously.
However, pre-tax profits were lifted by foreign exchange gains and lower
costs, including lower interest costs, to Y102.2bn, which rose 10 per cent.
Sony said new products, such as car navigation systems and MiniDisc players,
had fared well. Sales of video equipment, however, fell 19 per cent and
audio goods by 9 per cent.
The US market was buoyant as the economy there recovered, but Europe and
Japan remained weak. Europe, in particular, saw sales fall 19 per cent both
as a result of the slump in demand and a strong rise in the yen's value
against leading European currencies.
Parent operating profit, however, surged 94 per cent to Y3bn from Y1.55bn
largely due to lower costs while parent net profit was boosted by an
extraordinary profit of Y1.08bn due to the listing of a telecoms company in
which Sony has a stake.
The yen's appreciation against the dollar and European currencies continued
to plague Sony. The company said that if it had not been for the yen's
appreciation, consolidated total sales would have increased by Y501bn over
the reported figure.
The company does not expect a marked improvement in its trading environment
in the current year, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding the foreign
exchange market, heightening price competition and continuing weak demand in
Japan and Europe.

The improving fortunes of the Swedish banking sector were underlined
yesterday when Swedbank announced a SKr1.7bn (Dollars 220m) first-quarter
operating profit after a SKr864m deficit a year earlier.
The turnround was spurred by a 46 per cent cut in bad debt and a SKr1.58m
capital gain from the sale of Robur, a fund management unit.
The bank's recovery has been assisted by cost-cutting and a SKr8bn programme
to rebuild its capital base. It intends to seek a stock market listing early
next year.
The group's consolidated result before loan losses was SKr3.2bn, a 67 per
cent improvement.
Loan losses of SKr1.5bn were equal to 1.5 per cent of group lending. Problem
loans were down 30 per cent at SKr15.4bn at the end of the quarter. The
group's capital adequacy ratio was 10.9 per cent.
The bank expects full-year credit losses of around SKr6bn, down from
SKr11.7bn last year. It expects to return to profit after last year's
SKr3.66bn deficit.
Mr Goran Collert, chief executive, said: 'Continued efforts to cut costs as
well as sustained low interest rates and increased credit demand are of
vital importance for a favourable result development in 1994.'
Swedbank still suffers from weak credit demand, with lending to the public
falling by SKr22bn to SKr387bn over the 12 months to March 31.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Upbeat Chrysler lifts payout
again

<TEXT>
Chrysler yesterday under-scored its confidence in its financial outlook by
boosting its dividend for the second time in six months. It also announced
plans to eliminate its large unfunded pension liability by the end of 1994.
The initiatives reflect surging US demand for vehicles, and Chrysler's
success in winning market share through a succession of attractively-styled
cars and light trucks.
The quarterly dividend will rise from 20 to 25 cents a share for the payout
due on July 15. Chrysler increased the dividend from 15 to 20 cents a share
with its mid-January payment. That was the first rise since it halved the
dividend from 30 cents in the second quarter of 1991.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, told yesterday's annual meeting Chrysler had not
planned to increase the dividend again so quickly, nor fully fund its
pension obligations this year.
'But because of our strong cash flow and what looks like a continued strong
auto market and general economy, we believe these actions are warranted,' he
said. The company had Dollars 4.5bn in cash at the end of last year, and
this had risen to Dollars 5.9bn at the end of the first quarter.
Chrysler's unfunded pension liability has been a restraint on the company's
stock and credit rating for many years. It stood at Dollars 3.9bn at the end
of 1992, and dropped to Dollars 2.2bn at the close of last year.
Chrysler put an additional Dollars 700m into the fund early this year, and
the recent rise in US interest rates should also have shrunk the shortfall.
Detroit rival General Motors, which has the largest US pension deficit,
announced plans earlier this month to inject some Dollars 10bn into its
fund, with Dollars 4bn coming from improved cashflow and Dollars 6bn in the
form of its E series stock. The stock is linked to the performance of EDS,
its computing services subsidiary.
Mr Eaton said Chrysler's aggressive action indicated 'the degree of
confidence we have in ourselves, the strength of the automotive market and
the overall economy'.
His remarks contrasted sharply with Chrysler's plight three years ago when,
facing the onset of US recession with a tired product line and falling
market share, its future as an independent company seemed in doubt.
Moody's, the credit information agency, raised its senior debt ratings for
Chrysler to Single-A3 from Baa2 yesterday.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia has hopes of
being a world leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, created yesterday, is laying plans to become one of the
world's leading telecommunications operators during the next decade,
according to Mr Ernesto Pascale, chairman.
Shareholders in Sip, the quoted domestic network operator of which Mr
Pascale is also chairman, gave the go-ahead yesterday to a merger with four
other state-controlled telecoms units, to form Telecom Italia.
'After the year 2000, only a few companies will manage to operate at a
global level: Telecom Italia will do its utmost to be one of them,' Mr
Pascale told shareholders.
The complex merger, which involves the conversion of shares in the four
other companies into Sip shares, is the prelude to the eventual sale of the
Italian government's stake in Stet, the national telecoms utility. Stet will
own just over 55 per cent of Telecom Italia after the merger.
The Stet privatisation should take place before the end of the year and is
likely to be the largest in the ambitious Italian programme of state sales,
and the most important challenge for Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new right-wing
government.
This week, Mr Berlusconi promised to accelerate the privatisation programme,
but he will have to resolve complex and controversial questions about
whether to spread ownership of the utility widely or allow it to come under
the control of a few groups, including suppliers such as Pirelli.
The likely popularity of the sale has been reflected on the Milan stock
exchange where shares in both Stet and Sip have performed strongly this
year. Shares in Telecom Italia will begin trading on the Milan exchange on
August 18.
Telecom Italia is expected to have share capital of over L7,000bn when its
shares are first quoted on the Milan stock exchange in August. Turnover is
expected to top L27,000bn (Dollars 17bn) and net profit L1,000bn, making the
group the sixth largest telecoms operator in the world.
Yesterday, Sip shareholders were set to approve results for 1993, which show
a pre-tax profit of L1,471bn, up 47 per cent on 1992, and a net profit of
L657bn, an increase of 43 per cent.
The other companies to be amalgamated with Sip are Telespazio, the satellite
operator, SIRM, the maritime telecoms operator, Iritel, the long-distance
operator, and Italcable, the international telecoms services company, which
also approved the merger at separate assemblies yesterday.

<TEXT>
Esselte, the Swedish office products group, lifted first quarter pre-tax
profits by 11 per cent as higher margins and cost-cutting helped to
compensate for lower sales.
Profit for the period totalled SKr121m (Dollars 15.7m), up from SKr109m in
the same 1993 period. Sales amounted to SKr3bn, down 2 per cent from 1993
after adjusting for exchange rates.
Mr Bo Lundquist, chief executive, said the full-year result was expected to
be better than the SKr301m achieved in 1993.
Esselte said its result had been hit by a SKr9m charge after a dispute with
a pension fund over a property deal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investor, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family,
rebounded into the black in the first quarter, with a strong recovery at
Saab-Scania helping to compensate for a low level of capital gains.
The group recorded a SKr222m (Dollars 28.8m) profit after financial items,
recovering from a SKr559m loss in the same 1993 period.
Saab-Scania, which is 100 per owned by Investor, made a profit after
financial items of SKr448m after suffering a SKr109m loss.
The vehicle and aerospace group has entered a more buoyant phase, with sales
climbing to SKr6.7bn from SKr5.6bn and orders rising by 49 per cent to
SKr7.9bn.
Apart from reduced losses at the 50 per cent-owned Saab Automobile, the
group has benefited from a much better performance from its Scania truck
unit. A continued improvement in Saab-Scania's performance is expected.
Investor, which has strategic shareholdings in a clutch of Swedish
blue-chips, including Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux and Stora, said its net
worth at the end of March amounted to SKr36bn, or SKr198 per share. This is
down from SKr37.5bn, or SKr206 per share at the turn of the year, although
there has since been a rally.
The value of the group's strategic holdings at March 31 was SKr26.4bn, down
5 per cent since the start of the year while the broader market index was
unchanged.
Investor's net debt at the end of the quarter amounted to SKr5.2bn, against
SKr4.85bn at the year-end. Capital gains during the quarter amounted to just
SKr35m, following the sale of shares in the roller bearing group SKF.
Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment specialist, has maintained an
impressive profits development with a 20 per cent increase in first-quarter
profits to SKr265m.
Group sales rose by 14 per cent to SKr2.4bn, with underlying growth
amounting to 10 per cent. Earnings per share rose 22 per cent to SKr5.46.
Gambro will change hands if the SKr8.4bn bid by Incentive, a Wallenberg
company, for the investment group Cardo is successful. Cardo has a 58 per
cent voting stake in Gambro.

<TEXT>
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, one of the world's leading makers of diesel
engines, said it made a DM135m (Dollars 80.8m) operating loss in 1993
following a DM26m profit the year before.
The Cologne-based group said it would make a loss in the first half of 1994
but would break even this year, forecasting turnover up 6 per cent. Sales
rose 6 per cent to DM839m in the first four months and incoming orders rose
10 per cent to DM1.10bn.
Group turnover fell 11 per cent to DM3.2bn, with a 17 per cent drop in
Germany alone because of recessionary pressures on German clients. Orders in
1993 rose overall by 12 per cent - after a 79 per cent increase in orders
for industrial plant - leaving KHD with an order book worth DM2.3bn. Group
debts rose DM280m to DM1.3bn as investment in new products continued.
Demand for engines and energy systems, which make up about 55 per cent of
turnover, is expected to pick up this year.
KHD had said it would be able to pay a dividend in 1996 but Mr Werner
Kirchgasser, chief executive, said such plans would have to be put off until
1997 and even then a dividend would not be guaranteed.

break-even

<TEXT>
First-quarter losses at Volkswagen narrowed to DM342m (Dollars 204.7m) from
DM1.25bn last year, the Wolfsburg-based group reported yesterday. There was
a good chance it would break even for the full year, it said.
The German-based parent company, VW, returned a profit of DM35m in the
review period, compared with a loss of DM917m last time, when the results
were heavily burdened with restructuring costs and provisions.
Total deliveries of VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and
Skoda, rose 5.7 per cent in the first three months of this year. However,
turnover increased only 2.6 per cent to DM20bn.
Analysts, welcoming the results as better than expected, attributed the
disparity between volume and turnover growth to sharp price cuts, especially
in Europe.
Group vehicle output rose 4.8 per cent to almost 760,000 units, including a
0.6 per cent rise in production of flagship VW models. Output at Seat, the
crippled Spanish subsidiary, rose 44 per cent, while Skoda in the Czech
Republic produced 4 per cent more cars. Audi, the quality car division,
managed a 6 per cent rise.
According to the company, group sales in Germany fell 1.3 per cent in the
first quarter, when overall demand for cars rose 2.9 per cent. VW's market
share was unchanged at a dominant 29.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, BMW yesterday forecast improved 1994 profits and reported a 7.4
per cent rise in turnover, to DM13bn, for the first five months.
Incoming orders had risen considerably, and would have a corresponding
effect on earnings. However, the end result would be diluted by the costs of
launching two new models, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman, told the annual
meeting.
Setting up equipment for the compact 3-Series and the new 7-Series
interfered with production in the first quarter, reducing output by 1.7 per
cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher unit production costs in the coal division resulted in increased
losses at Great Western Resources, the US-based energy company, in the six
months to March 31.
There was increased revenue in oil, gas and coal giving turnover of Dollars
71.6m (Pounds 48m), against Dollars 59.1m. Profits from the oil and gas
divisions were substantially higher, the company said, but pre-tax losses
were doubled at Dollars 4.08m (Dollars 2.03m).
The company added that new mining equipment had become available and the
rail network had returned to normal and coal division results should return
to expected levels.
The results were also affected by much higher exploration costs of Dollars
4.36m (Dollars 581,000).
Losses per share were 4 cents (2 cents).

Shares in Bluebird Toys rose 30p to 850p yesterday as Mr Torquil Norman,
chairman, told the annual meeting that pre-tax profits for the first half to
June 30 would not be less than Pounds 6.5m compared with Pounds 1.99m last

per cent).
Mr Frank Jackson, chairman, said the group's expectations of further
business improvement in 1994 were 'not dependent on a general economic
recovery but would . . . be enhanced should a lasting upturn materialise'.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fine Art rises 12% to Pounds 38m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fine Art Developments, the mail order and greetings cards group, pushed
pre-tax profits up 12 per cent to a record Pounds 38.1m for the year to
March 31. The shares rose by 11p to 505p.
The result includes Pounds 1.53m from James Galt, the educational toy maker
acquired for Pounds 13.5m in July last year. Galt contributed Pounds 13.4m
to total group turnover of Pounds 317.2m, just 2 per cent ahead of last
time's Pounds 311.5m.
Pre-tax profits for 1992-93 were Pounds 33.9m, including total gains of
Pounds 2.5m from disposals.
Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, described the latest year as difficult. But the
management had done a lot of groundwork which would lead to benefits this
year, he said.
Without the acquisition of Galt, turnover and operating profit in the mail
order division would have been marginally lower. In fact, the division's
operating profit rose from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 23.8m on turnover of
Pounds 180.6m (Pounds 171m).
The merging of Galt with Hope Education had achieved significant benefits.
Hope lifted turnover 16 per cent and continued to win market share.
Sales at the agency mail order business were down 3 per cent. Express Gifts
sales were hurt by poor take-up after catalogues were requested. In the
light of subsequent market research the catalogue has been redesigned to
make ordering easier, and prices have been reduced. The group is also
introducing interest bearing credit following requests from 50,000
customers.
Operating profit in the cards and paper products division rose from Pounds
16.2m to Pounds 19.8m, while turnover declined from Pounds 140.5m to Pounds
136.5m. However, excluding disposals divisional sales were 5 per cent ahead.
Mr Chapman said that Britannia Products, the greetings card publisher,
lifted sales in both the private label and branded businesses.
Net interest payments were down from Pounds 7.69m to Pounds 5.54m. Gearing
was 52 per cent (39 per cent) at the end of the year, reflecting the Galt
acquisition. The group aims to get it back below 40 per cent this year.
Earnings per share rose by 9 per cent from 29.54p to 32.29p. A final
dividend of 11p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 14.3p, 12 per
cent up on last time's 12.75p.
COMMENT
Another record result has helped to reassure the City after the hiccup of
the interims, when teething problems with a new distribution system emerged
and an aggressive marketing campaign failed to win growth in the mail order
business. As a low-cost card producer, a small degree of recovery will
quickly feed through to the bottom line. The credit scheme should generate
some growth in mail order sales, and the group is keen to exploit Galt to
the full. With profits of Pounds 43m pencilled in for this year, the shares
are on a multiple of 14.5. which looks attractive.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Policy Portfolio matches forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Policy Portfolio, the marketmaker in second-hand endowment policies which
joined the main market in July last year, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
839,144 for the year to end-March.
The outcome was achieved on sales of Pounds 11.6m and compared with a profit
of Pounds 816,630 last time on turnover of Pounds 7.91m.
Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, chairman, said the result was in line with the
statement on trading and market conditions made in January.
A final dividend of 3p makes a forecast 4.5p total. The dividend is more
than twice covered by earnings of 9.8p (7.6p).
The shares closed up 4p at 102p; they were placed at 130p.
Securitised Endowment Contracts yesterday reported substantial increases in
sales and profits for its first half to March 31.
Turnover almost doubled to Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 4.58m) and pre-tax profits
jumped 87 per cent to Pounds 562,000 (Pounds 301,000).
The company said the progress was helped by a large increase in marketing
and promotional efforts. It was confident that a similar level of activity
would be maintained in the second half.
Earnings per share advanced to 3.03p (2.31p). An interim dividend of 1.5p is
declared and the board expects to recommend a final of at least 2p.
The company joined the USM in December at 60p; the shares added 4p to 80p
yesterday.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon shows 10% dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Willis Corroon Group, one of the UK's leading insurance brokers,
fell 47 1/2 p to 191 1/2 p yesterday, after the company surprised analysts
with a decline in profits for the first quarter of 1994.
A sharp fall in contributions from its US businesses resulted in pre-tax
profits falling by 10 per cent, from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 42.2m, for the
three months to end-March.
The first quarter contributes a substantial portion of profits, and brokers
immediately marked down their full-year forecasts by up to Pounds 25m - to
between Pounds 70m and Pounds 75m.
The company said that April had been 'another difficult month', with
continuing problems in the US, but a satisfactory performance elsewhere.
Turnover fell by Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 192.5m, but revenues from continuing
operations rose by just 2 per cent to Pounds 192.2m.
Interest and investment income fell Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 10.1m, as a result
of falling interest rates; the company, however, was a net beneficiary of
currency movements to the tune of Pounds 2.2m.
Operating profit from the UK showed an increase to Pounds 37m (Pounds
34.8m), but Willis was hit by a Pounds 6.7m decline in US contributions to
Pounds 200,000.
The US business was affected by the loss of 70 construction risk brokers to
a competitor, which could result in the loss of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) of
revenue for the full year, although a replacement team is now in place.
In addition, Willis has suffered from falling business and reduced rates on
its substantial US casualty insurance business.
In the UK, reinsurance renewals in January were 'satisfactory', and total
revenues from reinsurance and specialist business grew by 4 per cent in the
first quarter.
Earnings per share fell by 1p to 6.1p. A second interim dividend of 1.65p is
declared, maintaining the total to date at 3.3p.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ferguson International jumps 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong sales of cable television products in the US, acquisitions, exchange
rate movements and the absence of exceptional costs helped Ferguson
International Holdings to report a 21 per cent increase in annual profits.
The restructured labels, hangers, and communications components group
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.7m in the year to February 28, up from
Pounds 9.7m last time when the outcome was reduced by a Pounds 400,000
provision for reorganisation.
Turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 140.4m (Pounds 121.3m),
including Pounds 7.58m from the Red Wing hangers acquisition in the US in
the second half. Exchange rate movements accounted for six percentage points
of the turnover increase.
Earnings per share increased to 23.5p (19.5p) and the final dividend is
unchanged at 8.25p, maintaining the total at 12.5p.
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, described the results as 'highly respectable in
the circumstances'. He said they demonstrated a strong performance in all
three of the group's main activities 'despite market conditions exerting
intense pressure on operating margins'.
Operating profit on continuing activities increased by 10.3 per cent to
Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 11.4m), including a Pounds 489,000 initial contribution
from Red Wing. UK operations accounted for 57 per cent of the total, down
from 64 per cent.
The core labels division produced flat operating profits of Pounds 7.23m
(Pounds 7.22m) on sales which increased by 3 per cent to Pounds 71.1m
despite the effects of fierce competitive pressures on the division's main
retail customers.
Operating profits in the hangers division improved 27 per cent to Pounds
3.15m on sales up 31 per cent to Pounds 41.4m, reflecting organic growth and
input from Red Wing. Excluding the acquisition, profits were ahead 8 per
cent.
In the communications components side, TVC, a wholesale distributor of cable
television products in the US, benefited from an upturn in demand and
operating profits increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 2.16m on turnover up 36
per cent at Pounds 27.9m.
Net debt increased by Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 8.5m, representing gearing of
24.2 per cent.

<TEXT>
Shares in Delyn fell 8p to 99p yesterday after the packaging and
housebuilding group reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 998,000 to
Pounds 168,000 for the year to January 30. Turnover rose 14 per cent at
Pounds 14m.
An interim loss of Pounds 142,000 had been caused by exceptional costs
relating to Delyn's former French associate and start-up problems with new
machinery at Calendered Plastics.
Mr Paul Norman, chairman, said that after a slow start, Calendered improved
its performance in the second half and was now progressing well. The new
machinery had provided the company with increased capacity and the ability
to produce a greater variety of plastic film.
Reflecting the progress expected in the current year, which Mr Norman said
had started well, the final dividend is maintained at 1.17p for an unchanged
total of 1.67p.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Norcor debut valued at Pounds 32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norcor, a corrugated board maker, priced its flotation yesterday at 120p a
share, valuing the Norwich-based company at Pounds 32.3m.
A total of 14.2m shares, or 52.6 per cent of the enlarged equity, have been
placed with institutional investors, raising a net Pounds 16.1m for the
company.
Norcor, which had Pounds 35m of debt before the flotation, will use the
money to pay off Pounds 12m of bank debt and Pounds 3.5m of loan notes. Some
of the existing shareholders are converting the rest of the loan notes into
shares to make the company effectively debt free. Its plans, however, to
spend between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m rebuilding one of its four machines
will require some debt finance.
No existing investors are selling shares but as a result of the placing, the
stake of Phildrew Ventures, the venture capital arm of UBS and Norcor's main
backer, will be halved to about 20 per cent.
The shares are on a pro-forma p/e of 12.5 times fully taxed 1993 earnings of
9.6p. A notional 1993 net dividend of 4.56p, covered 2.5 times, gives a
gross yield of 4.75 per cent.
The group recently announced price increases to cover higher paper costs,
but it gave no forecast for this year's results. Last year it reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.09m on turnover of Pounds 38.7m.
Dealings in the shares start on May 26, The placing was underwritten by UBS.

Pounds 40m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NSM, the debt-laden international coal mining group, is more than trebling
its equity with a heavily discounted rights issue to raise Pounds 40m.
The cash call was accompanied by figures showing a recovery to pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.1m for the year to March 31 compared with losses of
Pounds 9.8m.
Mr John Jermine, executive chairman, said an injection of equity was
required to complete the restructuring started three years ago which
reversed the diversifications of the late 1980s. 'The refinancing will
provide NSM with sufficient facilities to continue to develop its businesses
and to assess the opportunities presented by the privatisation of British
Coal.'
NSM, which produced 1.6m tonnes of coal from opencast mines in the UK last
year, might be interested in individual British Coal assets but is unlikely
to venture outside its opencast expertise. Mr Jermine stressed: 'Any
acquisitions will be bolt-on and we would not do anything that was not
earnings enhancing.'
Alongside the rights issue, which would reduce pro forma gearing from 158
per cent to 52 per cent at March 31, NSM's banks, led by Bank of Scotland,
have agreed to provide 'substantial' new facilities.
The terms of the rights issue are 5-for-2 at 100p compared with a market
price of 174p, down 43p yesterday. Institutions accounting for 57 per cent
of the shares are committed to taking up their rights with the remainder
underwritten by Noble Grossart and Cazenove.
Mr Jermine said the deep discount reflected the size of the issue, the
company's 'difficult' history and the uncertain future facing the coal
industry. But changes in the UK industry would also produce a 'lot of
opportunities which have not crystallised yet'.
Although NSM's UK tonnage dropped from 2m last year, the proportion sold
direct to generators rose to a quarter as less lucrative contracts with
British Coal declined.
Sales from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 111.9m (Pounds 114.1m)
producing operating profits before interest of Pounds 9.54m (Pounds 7.04m).
Earnings per share were 12.3p (59.1p losses).
COMMENT
The rights issue will merely restore NSM's balance sheet to reasonable
health rather than give it the muscle to take on allcomers in the break up
of British Coal. For now the main strategy is to concentrate on reducing
costs per tonne on both sides of the Atlantic. In the UK it should be helped
by relaxation of restrictions on private operators - notably in the size of
opencast sites - and in the US by recent capital investment in new reserves
and drift mines. Thanks to the interest saving from the rights issue profits
should top Pounds 6m this year. At the notional ex-rights price the shares
are on a prospective multiple of about 14, reflecting the balance of
opportunities and uncertainties.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Capital Radio sharply up at Pounds 12m -
Advance at the London music station is expected to herald a general upturn
in the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing share of advertising revenue for radio and growing confidence
in the industry were the reasons cited for a marked improvement in profits
at Capital Radio, the flagship station of UK commercial radio.
The London music station, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 4.65m to
Pounds 12.5m on increased turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 14.1m) in the six
months to end-March.
This year's figure however, includes an exceptional gain of Pounds 4.1m made
from the sale of a number of radio stations in the east Midlands.
Earnings per share emerged at 13.9p (4.6p) - or 8.1p stripping out
exceptionals - and the interim dividend is increased by 29 per cent to 2.25p
(1.75p).
Analysts believe that other large radio groups, such as GWR and Metro, are
also likely to report rising profits.
Mr Ian Irvine, the chairman of Capital, said yes-terday: 'the upturn in
confidence in the radio advertising market which began in the second half of
1993 has been sustained'.
Costs had been kept under tight control, Mr Irvine said, while there had
been increased investment in sales and marketing to take advantage of the
upturn.
The main underlying factor behind the results was that after 12 years in
which radio's share of total advertising scarcely moved, in 1993 it grew
from 2.8 per cent of display advertising to 3.4 per cent for a total of
Pounds 179m.
It also benefited from Midlands stations acquired in April 1993.
Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital, said he was optimistic that
the station, which has to reapply for its two eight-year London licences
next month, would be unopposed. Four new London-wide licences were
attracting all the interest.
Mr Eyre promised yesterday that if a new national FM licence, now under
consideration, is advertised next year Capital would bid for it.
The company is within a couple of weeks of completing its agreed Pounds
32.6m takeover of Southern Radio and planned to launch a new station for
Eastbourne and Hastings, an area which takes its main service from Brighton
at present.
'Radio is quite a fashionable medium now,' said Mr Eyre, who used to work in
advertising in the days when commercial radio got only the money left over
from other campaigns.
The shares closed at 407p, up 2p on the day.
COMMENT
The improvement at Capital represents a fundamental shift in how commercial
radio is perceived as a medium and is likely to be replicated by other
well-run groups. For the full year Capital is likely to have pre-tax profits
of between Pounds 17m and Pounds 18m, although with four new London stations
on the way the competition can only intensify. Large established stations
such as Capital - its services are first and second in London - just benefit
disproportionately if a rise in advertising share continues. For the first
time a 5 per cent share of total advertising no longer looks like a pipe
dream. However, the shares have already doubled in the past year and at 23
times this year's earnings they fully reflect the profits potential.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Robust house sales help recovery at
Westbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westbury, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, yesterday reported a swing from
losses of Pounds 2.18m to profits of Pounds 8.31m pre-tax for the year to
February 28.
The turnround reflected a more stable trading environment and record house
sales of 2,685 units compared with 2,428 last time. Turnover increased by 15
per cent to Pounds 152m.
The 1992-93 deficit took account of exceptional charges of Pounds 7.35m,
including a Pounds 5.6m write-down on the land bank.
A tax charge of Pounds 2.36m (credit Pounds 2.01m) left earnings per share
of 9p (losses 0.3p). An increased final dividend of 3.5p makes a 5.25p (5p)
total. The shares closed 11p higher at 175p.
Commenting on the results, Mr Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman, said: 'After four
successive years of recession, the industry appears to have stabilised over
the past year.
'All of the economic indicators affecting our industry are as favourable as
at any time in the recent past; this encourages us to foresee a modest
recovery in our markets over the next few years.'
Operating profits jumped from Pounds 630,000 to Pounds 9.55m while losses
from the group's interests in associated undertakings fell from Pounds
617,000 to Pounds 248,000.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 990,000 (Pounds 2.19m).
The group ended the period with net borrowings of Pounds 4.5m, equivalent to
gearing of 5 per cent.
During the year Westbury invested Pounds 48m on new land, strengthening its
land bank with planning consent from 5,850 plots to 6,600 plots at an
average cost of Pounds 15,400.
Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, commenting on the outlook, said: 'The
current year has started well and our expectations of higher sales volume,
an increase in the average selling price and an improvement in the operating
margin are being borne out.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Conrad Black cuts his stake in The
Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, has
cut its stake in The Telegraph, holding company of The Daily Telegraph, from
66.2 per cent to 57 per cent.
However, Hollinger indicated that it was committed to retaining control of
The Telegraph and had no further plans at this stage to reduce its stake
further.
With the proceeds from this sale, totalling about CDollars 152m (Pounds
73m), Hollinger has more than recouped its entire CDollars 314m investment
in The Telegraph over the past nine years, as well as having earned a
sizeable rate of return.
The company realised CDollars 187m from a portion of its Telegraph shares
when the UK company made a public offering in 1992, and raised another
CDollars 17m late last year.
Hollinger said there was no particular significance in the timing of the
sale, except that it had planned for some time to get back the money it had
ploughed into The Telegraph as a form of 'discipline' in its investment
strategy.
The sale involves 12.5m shares, which were sold at 587p each to Goldman
Sachs and Cazenove.
Shares in The Telegraph closed yesterday down 20p at 600p.
Mr Black paid 100p per Telegraph share when he made his initial investment
in 1985. A year later, Hollinger paid 50p per share to bring its investment
in The Telegraph up to 50 per cent.
Hollinger said the proceeds of the latest sale would be used for general
corporate purposes. It added that the transaction was unrelated to its
recent purchase of the Chicago Sun-Times, or the withdrawal of a small
public offering planned by UniMedia, a wholly owned Canadian newspaper
group.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Wheels offshoot sold as AAF losses rise to
Pounds 34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAF Industries, the building systems company, yesterday said it was selling
Alloy Wheels International and its 49 per cent stake in Kent Properties for
Pounds 19m to Murray &amp; Roberts Engineering of South Africa.
It also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.7m for 1993 on total turnover
of Pounds 78.8m. It compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.76m on
turnover of Pounds 72m.
AWI, the biggest aluminium alloy wheel maker in the UK, will retain its
borrowings of Pounds 10.2m.
The disposal leaves AAF with pro forma net worth of Pounds 21m, compared
with Pounds 35m at the end of 1992. Without the proceeds, which will be used
to pay off Pounds 6.7m of debt and provide working capital, net worth would
be Pounds 15.4m.
AWI, which was bought by AAF for Pounds 13.2m three years ago, made profits
of Pounds 722,000 on turnover of Pounds 31.8m last year. It had net assets
of Pounds 12.3m at December 31.
Mr Alex Brown, who took over as chief executive last summer, said yesterday
that the group would have considered selling at the Pounds 19m offer price
whatever the financial circumstances. As it was, AAF could now stop
negotiating with its banks and get on with running the remaining business.
The group's problems stemmed from the expansion of its prefabricated
building manufacturing business in Blackburn into an on-site contractor.
Mr Brown said sorting out the problems had proved 'a painful and difficult
exercise'. The site was now closed.
The closure and other reorganisation costs accounted for Pounds 24.5m of the
latest loss, including a total of Pounds 4.9m of goodwill written off. A
further Pounds 1.5m of goodwill was written off on the disposal of Diamond,
its US modular building subsidiary, for Dollars 33.3m (Pounds 22.2m) last
November.
The group has also written down by Pounds 3.5m its operating assets of the
hire and site services business.
Net interest payable was Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 2.1m).
Losses per share were 157p, compared with earnings of 24p last year. The
board is not recommending a final dividend.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denby Group, the stoneware pottery maker, yesterday announced the final
details of its flotation with a share price of 130p, which values the
company at Pounds 43.3m.
Based on this share price, and forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m for
the year to September 30, the group is coming to the market on a prospective
multiple of 14.
This compares with about 17.5 for Portmeirion Potteries, which has been
cited as its closest comparison in the sector.
Denby also forecast a final dividend of at least 1.4p for the year to
September 30 and earnings of 9.2p. Based on the pre-tax forecast, the
notional full year dividend would have been 3.1p, with a yield of 3 per
cent.
Denby, which is returning to the market after a 13 year absence, is issuing
20.4m shares through a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 8.5m net for
the company. Some 15.3m shares are being placed with institutions. The
balance will also be placed, although subject to a clawback depending on the
public demand for shares.
Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, has said the group intends to use the
proceeds to pay off the debt incurred in the Pounds 5m venture
capital-backed management buy-out in 1990. The board will retain 22 per cent
of the enlarged company, with existing shareholders owning a further 17 per
cent.
The group has spent the last four years recovering from mishaps which began
with an ill-fated diversification in the US in the 1970s.
Heavy losses led to a takeover by Crown House in 1981, and eventually
Coloroll, which collapsed in 1990. Since Denby's management bought the
company pre-tax profits have risen from Pounds 724,000 in the 18 months to
September 30 1991.
COMMENT
The glut of flotations left Denby coming to the market with a price lower
than many existing shareholders might have wished. The rating seems about
right, however, given the difficulties which many are facing in getting new
issues away. Investors can look forward to substantial growth abroad, and
might want to study Portmeirion's experience in the US for future potential.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: LIG shares fall on sale of lossmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in London Inter-national Group fell 5p to 116p yesterday after the
company said it had agreed to sell ColourCare International, its lossmaking
photo-processing business, to a management buy-out for a nominal amount.
LIG, which makes Durex condoms and Biogel and Marigold gloves, said the
disposal was an essential part of the group's restructuring plan.
LIG last month warned that it faced the near elimination of its net assets
by a 'very substantial' restructuring charge for the year to March.
Yesterday the group said this sale would lead to a substantial write-off,
including goodwill of Pounds 47.5m. The net assets transferred to Boots had
a book value of Pounds 32m.
The company said the terms of the transaction reflected the poor performance
of ColourCare, which was expected to have incurred an operating loss of
Pounds 10.5m for the year to March.
The sale does not include the 257 minilab operations located in stores of
the Boots Group. Negotiations are being held with Boots regarding the future
of this part of the business.
'In the meantime, it is expected that the effect on LIG of retaining the
minilab business will be broadly neutral in terms of both cash and profits,'
the company said.
ColourCare, which will continue to trade under the same name, was sold to
the management team free of debt and leasing commitments, but with trade
debtors and creditors. LIG has agreed to loan the MBO team Pounds 6m for 18
months, which will be interest-free for the first year.
The sale, which is subject to shareholders' approval, ends a disastrous
attempt by LIG's former management to diversify into photoprocessing. It has
cost between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m in acquisition and rationalisation
costs over the last 12 years and gave the group a 30 per cent share of a now
sharply declining market.
One analyst said: 'ColourCare was haemorrhaging cash. We thought they'd have
to give it away, and they have. But there's relief that they have done it.'
LIG said it was likely to announce a rights issue and new banking
arrangements in June, when it publishes its results for the year to March
which are expected eliminate net assets of Pounds 120m. Net debt is thought
to have reached between Pounds 160m and Pounds 200m.
Last month Mr Nick Hodges, the new chief executive, announced a
restructuring, foreshadowed in December, which involved the closure of three
UK plants and the loss of 1,000 jobs followed by another 1,000 losses
worldwide. The group also sold its Buttercup, Liqufruta and Galloway's cough
mixture brands.
Mr Hodges said yesterday: 'We have every confidence in the success of our
strategy of focusing on our global condom and specialist gloves business.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Candover's Pounds 213m for new fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Candover, the venture capital group, has received commitments of Pounds 213m
for a new fund which it will invest in larger management buy-outs and
buy-ins.
The group expects to raise further capital and close the fund later this
year.
This is the first sizeable fund since Pounds 319m was raised by the group in
1989. The capital has been raised at a time when many venture capital groups
are finding it hard to persuade investors to back them with new money.
'It was easier five years ago,' said Mr Stephen Curran, chief executive. 'We
are satisfied with the progress in what is not an easy market and we are
confident there will be additional commitments in the second closing.'
The figure for the first closing includes a commitment from Candover to
invest Pounds 64m.
At the last balance sheet date Candover had Pounds 22m of cash. It expects
the imminent realisation of investments to produce the balance needed.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Burton in Pounds 153m property sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burton, the clothing retail group which includes Debenhams, Burtons and
Dorothy Perkins, is ending its foray into the property business with the
sale of its four remaining shopping centres to Prudential Assurance for
Pounds 153m.
The group yesterday also revealed increased pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks
to February 26 of Pounds 36m. However, last year's Pounds 24.7m was after
restructuring costs of Pounds 11.9m.
Prudential effectively completes the policy of Mr John Hoerner, chief
executive, of withdrawing from the property market.
Burton's property ventures began in the 1980s. But it has written off almost
Pounds 340m against its office blocks and shopping centres since 1990.
With its remaining property portfolio - including an office block in St
Albans still to be sold, and an office development being sold for Pounds
14.5m - in the books at Pounds 122m, the expected net surplus from the
shopping centre sale is Pounds 20m. That will be taken in the full-year
profit and loss account.
The property deal overshadowed continued problems in the retail businesses,
where group sales fell to Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 1.07bn).
Sales at Debenhams, where Mr Hoerner began his 'recovery programme' before
moving to head the group, increased by 5 per cent, but sales in the high
street chains fell 5.5 per cent. Trading profits at Debenhams rose from
Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 44.2m, but the multiples slid from a Pounds 18.5m
profit into a Pounds 4.5m loss.
Trouble spots were Top Shop and Top Man, where an attempt to focus on 16 to
19-year-olds proved popular with the target audience but alienated older
customers. A 6 per cent fall in sales transformed a Pounds 1.8m profit into
a Pounds 7.3m loss.
Mr Hoerner added that a refit and new range at Principles, which proved to
be too upmarket, had led to a 16 per cent fall in sales. Losses grew to
Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 2.9m).
'The one thing I will say about Burton is our mistakes have been beautifully
executed,' he joked.
Sales and profits also fell at Burtons and Dorothy Perkins, due to the
upheavals of modernising shops and repositioning ranges, but revamped stores
were trading well.
Evans, the chain aimed at larger women, increased profits to Pounds 4.4m
(Pounds 4.1m).
Gross margins fell by 1.6 percentage points in the period, mainly because of
increased mark-downs.
Efforts towards recovery include Townprint - a review and restructuring of
the store portfolio.
The interim dividend is held at 1p, with earnings up from 1.4p to 1.9p a
share.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chillington lifts pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chillington Corporation reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 217,000 for 1993,
against a Pounds 482,000 deficit previously.
Sales fell slightly to Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 44.4m). A Pounds 871,000 loss
from discontinued operations was behind reduced operating profits of Pounds
1.74m (Pounds 2.66m).
A charge of Pounds 1.14m mainly represented the loss on the disposal of its
49 per cent stake in Anglo-Eastern Plantations. Interest took Pounds 2.04m
(Pounds 2.38m).
The company said that it had decided to concentrate on developing its
plantation and overseas trading interests. In order to reflect this it
proposed to revert to its former name - Plantation and General Investments.
The recommended final dividend of 0.75p makes a total of 1.5p (0.25p) for
the year.
Some Pounds 908,000 was transferred from reserves to cover this.
The loss per share worked through at 1.57p (3.78p).

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bulmer to axe soft drinks side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP Bulmer, the Hereford-based cider maker, yesterday confirmed plans for
further restructuring including a withdrawal from the soft drinks market in
order to focus on its cider and beer activities.
The move follows a strategic review of the group's production and
distribution activities and is expected to lead to the loss of up to 300
jobs.
Bulmer's soft drinks operations include distribution agreements for Volvic,
the second largest mineral water brand after Evian, and Orangina, which is
manufactured under licence. Its own soft drink brands include Kiri sparkling
apple juice, which will be sold.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said the planned reorganisation
represented the final step in strategic repositioning of the group which had
involved it pulling out of small, low-margin businesses.
Last year the group disposed of its pectin operations and had previously
withdrawn from the US apple juice market and the wine and spirits
distribution business in the UK.
The move will result in a Pounds 7.8m restructuring charge in the results
for the year to April 30 which are due to be announced on July 13. However,
the group said that the restructuring, when complete in 18 months' time,
will result in annual savings of about Pounds 6.5m a year.
Some of the savings are expected to be reinvested in the group's brands
which include the three cider market leaders, Woodpecker, Strongbow, and
Scrumpy Jack.
Meanwhile, the company said yesterday that the UK cider market continued to
perform well and grew by more than 8 per cent in the year to March.
It added that in an increasingly competitive market the strength of its
brands had substantially insulated it from the effects felt by others in the
industry.
As a result the board said it was confident that the results for the year to
April 30 'will be in line with market expectations'. Analysts had been
forecasting profits of up to Pounds 21.5m compared with Pounds 19.6m a year
earlier.
The shares closed up 8p at 397p.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Flotation values ICG at Pounds 105m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Intermediate Capital Group, the specialist provider of mezzanine
finance to unlisted companies, were priced at 225p yesterday, valuing the
group at Pounds 105m.
The issue is fully underwritten by Lazard Brothers and will be placed with
institutional and other investors. There is also a clawback to meet demand
from an intermediaries offer.
The notional gross dividend yield for the year ended January 1994 is 5.5 per
cent. Since it was formed in 1989, ICG has carved out a niche providing
loans to fund management buy-outs and buy-ins, acqu-isitions and development
cap-ital.
The group enhances returns by receiving warrants or a redemption premium
when the investment is realised.
COMMENT
Niche lender, Intermediate Capital Group, is a strange animal. Part bank and
part investor in unquoted companies, it is both an operating company that
lends and an investment trust with a portfolio of equity stakes. Judging by
the pricing, the company's advisers are confident institutions agree ICG
should not be valued as an investment trust - Pounds 105m values the group
at a 19 per cent premium to net asset value. Viewed as a specialist lender,
however, ICG's notional gross dividend of 5.5 per cent is only just covered
by earnings from core interest income, dividends and management fees. Hardly
comfortable cover in conventional terms. But then the group hopes to
continue to realise capital gains through further sales of equity. ICG is
not a stock for risk-averse investors. It is a growth stock underpinned by
an unusually high yield. But for investors who believe ICG can maintain its
healthy, if short, record of realising capital gains, the shares have some
attractions.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Britton launches Pounds 121m agreed bid for
NMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britton Group, the acquisitive packaging company, has launched a Pounds 121m
bid for NMC, the London-based packaging group.
The recommended takeover would result in an almost threefold increase in
Britton's market capitalisation. It would build up Britton's strength in the
UK polythene market, but its primary motivation is the purchase of NMC's
highly profitable US subsidiary, UPC, the largest independent carton
business in the US.
If successful, Mr Jack Hutton, UPC's president, will join the Britton board,
but the other NMC directors will resign. These directors, accounting for 12
per cent of NMC shares, are being well rewarded. Mr Robin Williams, Britton
chief's executive, said compensation payments to NMC's directors and
advisers would exceed Pounds 3m.
Bid speculation on Wednesday pushed NMC's share price up by 42p to 159p.
They rose just 1p yesterday in the face of a bid which values the ordinaries
at 169p. Britton's shares fell 4p to 161p.
The enlarged group would have combined annual sales estimated at more than
Pounds 200m, with some 60 per cent coming from UPC. That would represent an
enormous leap for a lossmaking oil and gas company acquired by ex-Salomon
Brothers bankers, Mr Robin Williams and Mr Simon Beart, in March 1992.
Mr Williams said Britton could add value to NMC's UK packaging operations,
while removing substantial head office costs and investing more capital in
the development of UPC.
NMC is forecast to have made at least Pounds 10m profit in the year to
March, putting it on a p/e of slightly more than 16 times, significantly
lower than Britton.
Britton is offering 100 new shares and 400p cash for every 100 NMC shares,
and 90 new shares and 400p cash for every 100 warrants. Investors can opt
for a higher proportion of cash. It is also offering 28 new shares for every
33 NMC convertible preference shares, with a cash and convertible share
alternative.
Britton is also launching a rights issue of one convertible stock unit for
every 3 Britton shares. The stock automatically converts at 150p, if the bid
succeeds. The issue will raise Pounds 25.7m, bringing post-acquisition
gearing to between 30 per cent and 35 per cent.
COMMENT
NMC was the late-1980's glamour stock in the packaging sector, but
badly-performing UK investments had left it ripe for a takeover. There is no
real industrial logic to Britton expanding into cartons, but an acquisition
was expected, and provisional estimates suggest that its 1995 p/e will be
brought down to about 14.5. Britton will take time to digest this latest
morsel, but the numbers look good, and the shares should maintain their
premium rating.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: EOP raises Pounds 6.6m for acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
English &amp; Overseas Properties is to buy Keswick Holdings for up to Pounds
5.3m and is to fund the acquisition by way of a placing to raise about
Pounds 6.6m.
Keswick is a privately owned property holding company which owns five
properties - comprising two office properties, two industrial and one retail
 -in the south of England. Together their net annual rental income is about
Pounds 1.26m and they have been valued on an open market basis at Pounds
15.5m.
At March 24 Keswick's consolidated net assets totalled Pounds 5.07m and, in
the year to March, pre-tax profits were Pounds 46,000 on turnover of Pounds
1.24m.
The consideration is to be satisfied as to Pounds 1m in ordinary EOP shares
at 35p and the balance in cash from the placing. An open offer is to raise a
further Pounds 1.7m on a 1-for-2 basis.
In 1993, EOP returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 312,000
(losses Pounds 707,000) on turnover up at Pounds 5.98m (Pounds 986,000).

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise chief scotches hopes of higher
oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil, the explorer embroiled in a hostile Pounds 1.4bn all-paper
bid for rival Lasmo, yesterday poured cold water on hopes for higher oil
prices even as the commodity rose strongly yesterday.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief executive, told shareholders
at the annual meeting that oil prices in the first three months of the year
were 20 per lower than 1993 at Dollars 14.73 per barrel. 'It is true that
there has been a marginal improvement in the past six weeks, but even this
may now be reversing,' Mr Hearne said.
Nevertheless, Brent crude recovered most of its losses earlier in the week
to trade at around Dollars 16.25 a barrel late yesterday.
Shareholders refrained from questioning Mr Hearne on the bid for Lasmo. This
will be the subject of an extraordinary meeting in London on Thursday.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith to change share structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, one of the last big UK quoted companies to have a two-tier share
structure, yesterday announced proposals to introduce a single class of
ordinary shares.
The company said the move would give it greater flexibility in gaining
access to capital markets and would increase liquidity for the shares.
Sir Malcolm Field, managing director, said: 'A number of institutions do not
like two classes of shares and have not bought ours as a result.' However,
he stressed that the reason for the change was the general principle now
favoured by investors that shareholders bearing the same risks and rewards
should hold the same voting rights.
Smith's share structure has been in place since the company was incorporated
in 1949 when it gave the Smith family members effective control of the
company.
They held mainly the B shares, which have a nominal value of 10p and a
single vote, while the A shares, with a nominal value of 50p, have one vote
but enjoy five times the B share dividend. Current B shareholders have 36.1
per cent of the votes but only 10.1 per cent of the dividends.
The company announced last October that it intended to create one class of
shares. At that stage the B shares were standing at a small discount to the
A, a quirk explained by their poor marketability, but since then they have
traded at an average premium of about 15 per cent, adjusting for the
difference in nominal value.
The proposed compensation for B shareholders has been pitched at that level
via a proposed capitalisation issue of 15 B shares for every 100 held. This
is followed by a 5-for-1 consolidation into A shares, all of which are then
redesignated ordinary shares.
The B shares slipped 1p to 119 1/2 p while the A shares added 2p to 512p.
Following similar moves by Great Universal Stores and Whitbread, Smith's
proposal leaves only a handful of large companies with two-tier share
structures. These include Daily Mail and General Trust, Securicor and Savoy
Hotel.

FT  20 MAY 94 / British Gas feels pain of regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steady erosion of British Gas's profitability through growing
competition and regulatory pressure was underlined yesterday when the
company reported first-quarter historical cost profits of Pounds 634m, down
from Pounds 650m.
Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, repeated a warning that full-year results
were likely to be below 1993. He added that uncertainty over the regulatory
environment made it 'inappropriate to comment on dividend prospects.'
British Gas shares, however, closed up 4 1/2 p at 284p.
First-quarter earnings per share were 14.6p, against 15.1p.
The drop in earnings would have been steeper without particularly cold
weather in what is the company's most important quarter. Increased volumes
were reflected in higher turnover of Pounds 3.67bn (Pounds 3.61bn) and a
Pounds 30m rise in operating profits from UK gas supply to Pounds 773m.
But Mr Giordano said the 'underlying trend of profits in that business
remains downwards due to regulatory pressure on prices in the tariff sector
and loss of market share, mainly in the firm contract market'.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, yesterday published a consultation paper that
could lead to the removal of some of that pressure.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general, said it was time to decide
whether it was still 'appropriate' to maintain constraints imposed on
British Gas as part of the government's efforts to open up the firm contract
market, mainly for industrial and large commercial users.
These require British Gas to sell gas only on the basis of published and
non-discriminatory tariffs. It must also reduce its share of the market
above 2,500 therms a year to 55 per cent by 1995, a level which British Gas
says was reached at the end of last month. 'Unless the constraints on our
ability to compete are lifted soon, our market share will continue to fall,'
Mr Giordano said yesterday.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, welcomed the Ofgas proposal, which he said
was 'long overdue.' But even if the restrictions were lifted, there would be
little positive impact on the company's performance this year.
Mr Brown noted that there was still 'massive uncertainty' over the impact of
future regulations. Consultation on how the domestic market will be opened
to competition is taking place. And an Ofgas document is due shortly on the
pricing formula for use of British Gas's transportation and storage network.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Engineering a path through a sea of debt: The challenge
facing Eurotunnel's banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A monumental task of civil engineering was brought to a successful
conclusion yesterday when the Channel tunnel was opened for freight
services. However, the equally daunting financial engineering challenge
faced by Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French operator of the tunnel, is yet to be
achieved - and there is a growing concern among its bankers and shareholders
that the company may be engulfed by its Pounds 7.7bn sea of debt.
To avoid receivership or administration under UK insolvency law, the company
needs to raise Pounds 1.6bn in bank debt and equity to cover interest
payments and operating costs until the forecast break-even date of 1998. Of
this, it would like Pounds 850m to come from a rights issue, which it needs
to launch in the next 10 days before the French markets begin their usual
long summer slumber.
However, the issue cannot take place until Eurotunnel's 200 bank creditors
have agreed to provide around Pounds 700m of new senior debt - and by
yesterday they had given commitments to provide slightly more than Pounds
500m.
The formal deadline for raising the bank finance was last Monday. But
missing deadlines is something of a tradition among Eurotunnel's banks - in
the 1990 refinancing, when Pounds 1.8bn of additional banking facilities
were provided, the company avoided receivership by a whisker. As one of its
main bank lenders said: 'Midnight is once again only a few seconds away.'
The company's critical condition is set out in its latest set of accounts:
'Eurotunnel's existing equity and bank facilities will have been fully spent
by June of this year.' So within a very few weeks, the company will have
exhausted the Pounds 9.3bn in debt and equity it has raised in five
principal financing exercises.
Last night, Eurotunnel managed to secure the required 90 per cent majority
vote of its banks in favour of the refinancing and a change in loan
agreements to avoid breaches of covenants.
Bankers were hopeful that commitments would by tonight have reached around
Pounds 600m. 'I think we will get to something over Pounds 600m early next
week,' said one of the principal bank creditors.
Japanese banks, whose capital has been eroded by recession, have been the
slowest to commit new money. Collectively they have provided 23 per cent of
the company's existing commercial bank debt so their participation in the
latest financing is vital.
The four with the biggest exposure of this group - Bank of Tokyo, Industrial
Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank and Sanwa Bank - have at last indicated
that they are likely to participate or indeed have already made a binding
commitment.
But even with these contributions, bankers are convinced that the Pounds
700m target cannot be met. 'The syndicate (of 200 banks) has done what it
can,' said a banker. 'After all, Pounds 600m is a lot of money.'
Eurotunnel's board is therefore going to face in the next few days the
difficult decision of launching the rights issue in these adverse banking
circumstances.
With only Pounds 600m of senior debt, it would need to raise around Pounds
900m of equity. But even its preferred target of Pounds 850m in equity would
be difficult to achieve - after all that is 20 per cent more than the stock
market had been expecting until a week ago.
'I simply do not know whether Pounds 600m of senior debt is enough,' said a
Eurotunnel director.
The debt and equity elements of the refinancing are inter-dependent. The
commitments to provide senior debt would be withdrawn in the event that the
equity is not raised.
But underwriting this substantial share issue will be extremely challenging,
according to leading corporate stockbrokers. The marketing of the issue has
already begun, with Sir Alastair Morton, the company's joint chairman,
yesterday giving presentations to institutional investors.
A fund manager expressed a widely held concern: 'Given the company has
itself said that cash generated from operations will not cover interest
payments until 1998 and there will not be a dividend until 2003, I don't
feel at all comfortable about how to value these shares.'
Mr Terry Smith, an investment analyst at Collins Stewart, has calculated
that for yesterday's Eurotunnel unit price of 405p to represent an
appropriate valuation of the company's financial prospects, it would need to
pay dividends of almost Pounds 300m after tax in 2003 and then increase them
at a compound annual rate of 9 per cent for the lifetime of the operating
concession, which expires in 2052.
The question for shareholders is therefore whether the company's revenues
over the coming years are going to be lower than it expects. On its
forecasts, revenues will have climbed to Pounds 1.3bn by 2003, from which
Pounds 376m of operating costs have to be deducted and more than Pounds 600m
of estimated interest costs - leaving a margin of just Pounds 300m from
which to repay principal on the debt, provide for depreciation and pay the
promised dividend. 'There is a tiny margin for error,' said Mr Smith. 'If
revenues are lower than forecast or costs higher, the company will be facing
yet another refinancing before long.'
However, there is one reason for having some confidence in Eurotunnel's
forecast. Its main competitors, the ferry operators, would probably be
ill-advised to launch a bitter price war which puts Eurotunnel into the
hands of a receiver or administrator.
If forced to restructure in those conditions, Eurotunnel would obtain relief
from its debt burden, making it a far more potent and aggressive competitor.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Deutsche makes DM500m provision for Schneider loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUSSELDORF
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank will have to make provisions of DM500m (Pounds 200m) against
its exposure to the collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group, the bank's
chief executive said yesterday. This is about 40 per cent of the bank's
total DM1.2bn loans to Schneider.
The bank had previously insisted that its loans to finance eight of
Schneider's property developments were well secured, although it had hinted
that provisions would amount to several hundred million D-Marks. Analysts
had estimated that the bank would have to make provisions of DM300m. The
Schneider group's collapse last month was the biggest in Germany's property
sector since the second world war.
Mr Hilmar Kopper and his boardroom colleagues faced intense shareholder
criticism over the Schneider affair, at the bank's annual meeting in
Dusseldorf yesterday.
Last month he dismissed the DM50m owing to trade creditors as 'peanuts', but
yesterday he was apologetic about the bank's role and for this particular
comment. 'Mistakes of professional judgment were certainly made,' he
conceded.
He added that loans to Schneider were made in at least one case on the basis
of manipulated documentation, for example forged rental agreements which
gave rise to fraudulent property valuations.
Mr Kopper told shareholders that despite the Schneider affair the level of
provisioning against bad and doubtful debts would actually fall at the bank
this year, reflecting recovery in the German economy. However, he said the
bank's record profits in 1993 could not be matched this year. Group
operating profit, after risk provisioning, was down more than 10 per cent in
the first four months, against the comparable period in 1993.
The interest margin showed signs of narrowing, Mr Kopper said, and profits
from the bank's own account trading activities would be down from last
year's spectacular levels. Last year group operating profits rose 16 per
cent to DM5.3bn, after taking account of a DM1.4bn increase in risk
provisioning to DM3.3bn.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Thomson Directories bought by US West
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US West, the regional telecoms company covering 14 midwestern US states, is
increasing its stake in the highly competitive UK telecoms market with the
purchase of Thomson Directories for about Pounds 70m.
The move pitches US West into competition with British Telecommunications
for UK business directory services, which it believes are underdeveloped.
It views the purchase as an important means of gaining access to businesses
for the development of multi-media services.
US West's international strategy centres on mobile communications and
combined cable television and telephone networks, which it plans to develop
for inter-active services. In the UK it has a 50 per cent stake in Mercury
One-2-One, a cellular mobile network, and a similar stake in TeleWest, a
cable company claiming more than 150,000 telephone subscribers.
Thomson Directories, which publishes 155 business directories in the UK
serving 1.6m businesses, is owned by the Thomson Corporation, the Canadian
publishing and travel group, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the US information
products and services company.
It started life in 1966 publishing Yellow Pages for the Post Office under
contract. Since going it alone it has engaged in protracted disputes with BT
over access to BT's numbering database. Mr Alain Treille, US West director
of international marketing, said the dispute had now been 'resolved
satisfactorily'.
BT has about 85 per cent of the directory advertising market with its Yellow
Pages division, and has been diversifying with products such as Talking
Pages.
US West said it saw 'massive potential' for developing the European
directory business, still largely in the hands of state-owned telecoms
operators. The company also has a business directory concern in Poland, and
is looking to expand in the directory market across Europe.
In the US, moves are advanced to extend the Yellow Pages concept to other
media. Last December Nynex, the Baby Bell company serving the north-east,
announced a partnership with Prodigy, a national computer information
network owned by IBM and Sears, to introduce a Yellow Pages service for
personal computers.

FT  20 MAY 94 / BT raises regional pricing issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications has raised the possibility of regional phone
pricing in the UK.
At yesterday's results meeting, Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director,
flagged regional pricing as an option after the introduction of a new
charging system next year, which will replace unit-based prices with
per-second charges.
Mr Hepher insisted BT had 'no plans' for such a change, which would be
highly controversial, but analysts believe it has clear attractions for BT
in its battle with competing operators building local or regional networks.
BT announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.76bn for the year to March 31,
against Pounds 1.97bn. Leaving aside redundancy charges, disposals and other
non-recurring items, the increase was less than 3 per cent. Operating
profits were Pounds 3.53bn (Pounds 3.47bn) before redundancy charges of
Pounds 517m (Pounds 1.03bn).
At Pounds 13.7bn, BT's annual turnover rose 3.3 per cent. Earnings per share
were 28.5p, against 19.8p. Before one-off items the increase was 0.4 per
cent. A final dividend of 10.05p raised the total by 7.1 per cent to 16.7p
(15.6p).
Growth was stronger than expected in the UK, but the Pounds 750m of
redundancy charges to be taken in this year's figures were larger than
analysts had anticipated. The high cost, against the past year's Pounds 517m
(down from Pounds 1.03bn), is due to a new emphasis on cutting management
jobs. BT is set to shed 15,000 jobs this year.
Its share price has fallen by nearly 20 per cent against the FT-A All-Share
index over the past year amid fears about regulation and strong UK telecoms
competition.
Inland call volumes were 6 per cent up on 1992-93, increasing turnover by
1.9 per cent despite the effects of a price cap agreed with Oftel, the
telecoms regulator, obliging BT to cut its prices by 7.5 per cent after
allowing for inflation. BT is bound by the same price cap this year.
Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, committed BT to vigorous efforts to attract
customers back from competitors who have taken about 11 per cent of the UK
market. Mr Hepher promised an intensification of the marketing campaign
aimed at the residential sector. The objective was to build 'a high
phone-usage culture in the UK'.
BT will make a special Pounds 250m contribution to its pension scheme this
year following a revaluation, after an Pounds 800m special payment last
year.
Mr Hepher claimed BT had won back more than Pounds 200m of business from
rival Mercury as part of its 'win back' programme. More than 50 per cent of
its business revenues now derive from discount schemes, offering reduction
of up to 16 per cent on standard tariffs in return for a quarterly fee.
BT's gearing was down to 9 per cent at the end of March, but will rise
sharply this year if its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) alliance with MCI, the
US long-distance carrier, is cleared by US regulators.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Heseltine concedes ground on Post Office sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to test public opinion over its plans to privatise the
Post Office by publishing a green paper containing its favoured option of
selling 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce.
But in issuing a consultative document ministers were acknowledging that
they may have to dilute their preferred sell-off option or even drop it.
Backbenchers opposed to privatisation said they would use the 'breathing
space' to try to persuade the government to abandon the flotation plan, or
to stop it from selling a majority stake.
The cabinet's so-called consolidators, who oppose further radical
legislation, are understood to have won important concessions from Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine had wanted to privatise the whole of the Royal Mail and
Parcelforce. But the consolidators made it clear they would only give the
go-ahead to privatisation if the government continued to hold at least 49
per cent of the shares and allowed a further period of consultation.
Mr Heseltine said the green paper would be published within weeks. He is
still confident of bringing forward a bill in November to privatise the
Royal Mail and Parcelforce after a consultation period of several months.
In a bid to allay backbenchers' fears, he committed the government to a
universal tariff and said stamps would continue to be exempt from value
added tax.
The government also obtained the Queen's permission for the depiction of her
head on postage stamps, the use of Royal emblems and permission to register
a privatised Royal Mail at Companies House.
The green paper is likely to spell out the government's desire to give
employees 'a significant holding of shares', which one minister said could
be as much as 15 per cent.
Post Office Counters has secured the freedom it wanted to increase the scale
of its activities.
The Treasury has agreed that rural post offices will continue to be
subsidised by about Pounds 25m. Only a quarter of Counters' turnover comes
from the Royal Mail, but the government would still require the letters
division to continue to use post offices.
However, backbenchers continue to oppose the privatisation.
Mr Patrick Cormack, Conservative MP for Staffordshire South, said: 'There
are many old fashioned Tories, of whom I am proud to be one, who view the
prospect of Royal Mail plc about as favourably as they would view your old
regiment being replaced by Group 4 at Buckingham Palace.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Honda and Rover heal rift over sale to BMW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Honda, the Japanese carmaker, and Rover, the UK subsidiary of BMW of
Germany, are to continue collaboration on the development of future car
models well into the next decade.
The two carmakers announced yesterday that they had signed a series of
contracts, which confounded earlier fears that the 15-year alliance between
Rover and Honda would be brought to an end by the Pounds 800m takeover by
BMW of the leading UK carmaker from British Aerospace earlier this year.
Honda will still go ahead with its withdrawal from its 20 per cent equity
holding in Rover - expected to be completed next month - but it has agreed
to continue long-term co-operation.
Honda was initially angry with BAe's sale of Rover to BMW, announced at the
end of January, and at the apparent betrayal of the close working
relationship that had developed between the two groups. This led to
widespread concerns that the move could jeopardise continued Japanese
investment in Britain.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said healing the rift
was 'good news for the companies, for the UK and for Japanese firms based in
this country'.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chief executive and chairman of Rover, said all
current supplier and licensing agreements between Honda and Rover would
remain intact.
Mr Pischetsrieder said work on cars in development would also be completed.
This covers the replacements for the current Honda Concerto and Rover
200/400. Mr John Towers, chief executive of Rover, said collaboration would
go into other new model generations. It is understood that this could also
include the future replacements for the Rover 600 and Honda Accord cars.
Mr Towers said that the new agreements 'could take us well to 2006. The way
we work together in the future will not be very different to how it has been
in the last two to three years'.
He said one of the Japanese carmaker's chief concerns had been the access
that BMW might gain to Honda technology.
This concern had been met by the new agreements with Honda. 'There will be
confidentiality walls around what we do with Honda, which will be clearly
visible,' said Mr Towers.
'What is sensitive is Honda's intellectual property rights and expertise. It
is easy to organise ourselves so that a particular set of products will be
confidential to Honda and ourselves. In another sector we may be
collaborating with BMW.'
Honda is moving towards ensuring its UK production could eventually stand
alone, if necessary. It said it was planning to invest in its own 'limited'
sheet metal pressing facility at its plant at Swindon. At present, virtually
all its sheet metal pressings are supplied by Rover's separate stamping
plant at Swindon.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Lloyd's underwriter was urged to mislead Names, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Lloyd's underwriter who worked for the Gooda Walker agency came
under pressure to mislead Names about the extent of losses suffered by his
syndicate in the late 1980s, he told the High Court in London yesterday.
Mr Anthony Willard, an underwriter on the Gooda Walker syndicate 299, which
lost heavily after the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster, said he was told to
rewrite a letter to exaggerate the wealth of the syndicate in the wake of
the explosion.
The evidence emerged during a highly emotional and strained
cross-examination of Mr Willard in the High Court action brought by 3,095
lossmaking Gooda Walker Names - the individuals whose assets have
traditionally supported the Lloyd's insurance market.
Mr Willard told the court that in 1989 Mr Anthony Gooda, the agency's former
chairman, rejected his first letter as too pessimistic. 'He wanted me to
write a more optimistic letter, it does not have to be the truth.'
The accusation was one of a series made by Mr Willard against Mr Gooda and
Mr Derek Walker, the agency's former leading underwriter.
He accused Mr Walker of 'a lot of interference' in the business of syndicate
299, which specialised in marine insurance. He said Mr Walker encouraged him
to take on inappropriate 'time and distance' policies. These are reinsurance
policies allowing syndicates to manage reserves against 'long-tail' claims,
which come many years after the start of policies.
'He attempted to get me to write risks that I did not consider to be a valid
marine risk,' Mr Willard said.
On one occasion, Mr Walker and another broker, Mr Andrew Goodyear, wanted
him to write reinsurance for the non-marine syndicate 164 'which was thought
to be in danger of going through the top'.
'I think it was Derek Walker who said 'That is no problem, we have a tame
company, they would write it, they could disguise it as marine and you could
write it',' Mr Willard said.
He had replied that the auditors would have to be informed but Mr Walker had
then responded: 'Surely, Tony, you do not tell your auditors everything, do
you?'
Mr Willard refused to write the business and told Mr Gooda at the end of the
meeting 'I do not think this firm can stand my honesty any more'.
He told the court he had come under 'considerable stick' from fellow
directors who suggested that 'instead of telling the truth, I should be
keeping quiet, putting my head down and writing more business'.
Mr Willard said he was brought up a long time ago to act in the utmost good
faith. 'That went out the window at Lloyd's some time ago,' he told the
court.

FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Nuclear review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who saw privatisation of the nuclear power industry collapse in
1989 may well think the government is wasting time asking whether
privatisation would now be feasible. But it would be a mistake to rush to
that conclusion. In recent years, Nuclear Electric has improved efficiency.
Though it is not yet profitable without the nuclear levy, its management
believes it can be by 1996.
There still remains the problem of how to tackle the industry's vast
liabilities for disposing of nuclear waste and decommissioning plants.
Current Treasury thinking is that the industry's existing liabilities could
be assumed by the taxpayer. Obviously, such a model would need elaboration
before investors were prepared to buy shares. They would want a clearer idea
of what future liabilities would be incurred. They would also need
reassurance that they would not suffer if tougher environmental standards
were imposed after privatisation. But all this should be possible to
resolve, albeit probably not before the next election. The existence of
quoted Spanish, German, US and Japanese power companies with nuclear
interests shows that the goal of privatisation is at least theoretically
attainable.
By contrast, the case for Nuclear Electric proceeding with its cherished
dream of building Sizewell C is not so good. The figures currently do not
stack up. Investors would not be happy if Nuclear Electric saw privatisation
as a signal to splash out Pounds 3.5bn.

FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to dismiss Deutsche Bank's DM500m loss provisions in connection
with the Schneider affair as trivial in the broader sweep of events. The
figure compares with total group provisions of DM3.3bn last year; even after
the Schneider charge, provisions will be down in 1994. It is harder to
dismiss the impact on Deutsche's image. Together the Schneider and
Metallgesellschaft cases have revealed it to be less conservative than many
of its admirers thought. At yesterday's annual meeting Mr Hilmar Kopper,
Deutsche's management board spokesman, was reluctant to point fingers while
official inquiries are still under way. At some stage, though, the bank will
have to demonstrate clearly that it has put its house in order. One danger,
if it does not, is that its share rating will suffer because its business is
perceived as riskier. In the short term, though, the main concern is
operating profit. During the first four months profits were running more
than 10 per cent below the average rate for 1993 as a whole. The comparison
may not be entirely fair for seasonal reasons, but the shortfall in trading
income is clearly having a significant impact, while Mr Kopper said interest
margins have narrowed further. His comments only serve to reinforce the view
that Deutsche, like other German financial stocks, is less likely to
out-perform now that interest rates must be coming within sight of their
floor. Industrial stocks should show more impressive earnings performance as
corporate restructuring and, eventually, economic recovery take hold.

FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Burton Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight it is difficult to see why Burton's shares rose 4.5 per cent
in response to yesterday's interim figures. While Debenhams continues to
perform creditably, the rest of the group is hardly firing on all cylinders.
Top Shop/Top Man and Principles are the biggest problems, together showing
trading losses of Pounds 16m in the first half. That is worse than last
year.
With gearing of less than 10 per cent after the latest property sale, the
balance sheet has been restored to full health. Since cash generation
remains strong and capital spending will peak this year, one might wonder
whether last year's Pounds 160m rights issue was strictly necessary. But
Burton still has to demonstrate that it can use financial freedom to
revitalise its stores. The suspicion remains that the disparate parts of the
empire compete too much with each other, while attempts to narrow the focus
of each chain have not delivered the right result. The poor performance of
Top Shop is a case in point.
Early indications are that the second half is shaping up better than the
first and tax increases do not appear to have damped consumer spending. The
rationalisation of the stores portfolio now taking place - including a 20
per cent reduction in the number of sites - looks like solid groundwork. But
on a multiple of around 30 times this year's consensus forecast earnings
Burton needs to prove that it can do more than stop the rot.

FT  20 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BT phones home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One swallow does not make spring. So it would be wrong to conclude too much
from the encouraging 6 per cent growth in BT's inland call volumes in its
final quarter. Even so, shareholders should be warmed by signs that its
policy of boosting network usage is at long last bearing fruit.
The general economic recovery, of course, goes some way to explain the
strong growth in calls. So do enforced price cuts. But the company's belated
efforts to market its services also deserve some credit. Over the past year,
charge card customers rose two-thirds to 2.8m, residential subscribers to
extra services such as call diversion more than doubled to 1.4m and
freephone usage grew 30 per cent. Sunday calls have responded to lower
weekend tariffs, though not enough to counterbalance the price cuts.
Similarly, discounts targeted at business customers have slowed BT's loss of
market share and helped it win back customers from Mercury.
BT realises it has so far exploited only a fraction of this growth
opportunity. Britons use their phones much less intensively than their
American counterparts. The company therefore plans to step up its marketing
campaign in an attempt to a create a 'high phone-usage culture'.
Investors, who have heard management promise similar things in the past, may
be sceptical whether growth will materialise, given that BT's market share
is bound to fall further. They may also be concerned that earnings are
likely to be flat this year following a more aggressive redundancy
programme, focusing on managers, which will cost Pounds 750m. But the
medium-term outlook is rosier. The stock's sharp underperformance since last
November is starting to look overdone.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Britain and nuclear power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has laid the ground well for a properly searching review of
the nuclear power industry with the publication yesterday of its terms of
reference. Ministers now need to make sure that the controversy which will
surround the review does not distort or delay the answers.
The analysis, repeatedly postponed, comes at a crucial point, as Britain's
ageing Magnox reactors reach the end of their lives. Its conclusions will
determine whether nuclear power has a future in Britain, or whether it will
be snuffed out as existing plants close.
If there is to be a future, it must be different from the past. Despite the
industry's appetite for state subsidy, it has failed to fulfil its promises
of delivering limitless cheap electricity or world-class technological
expertise.
For those reasons, the government is right to have drawn its terms of
reference much more broadly than parts of the industry wished. The review
will encompass questions of nuclear decommissioning and environmental
impact, as well as the economic issues. The Department of the Environment
will also hold a separate, complementary review into the disposal of
radioactive waste.
Most controversy will surround the government's comments that it will
'consider without commitment' the possibility of privatising the industry.
But as Mr Timothy Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday, privatisation is
unlikely before the next general election. The debate is also secondary to
the central question of whether Britain wants more nuclear power.
The answer to that question should depend entirely on whether nuclear power
can deliver electricity as cheaply as other available fuels. According to
Nuclear Electric, the generator, future reactors built to the latest designs
could do so. Economies of scale, plus lessons learnt in building Sizewell B
in Suffolk, mean that construction and operating costs will be lower than in
the past, it argues.
That claim, which has aroused scepticism on many sides, needs to be
vigorously tested. It assumes that new plants will run at 85 per cent
capacity, and that costs will not run over budgets, both questionable given
the industry's record. The estimate also discounts the cost of capital at a
rate that may be too low if private finance is employed. The government
should insist that details of these calculations are published, and not
withheld on grounds of commercial confidentiality.
The competitiveness of nuclear power also depends on its environmental
impact. Unlike fossil fuels, it does not emit carbon dioxide and sulphur,
implicated in global warming and acid rain. The review should attempt to put
values, however imprecise, on these benefits, and to weigh them fully
against the costs of disposing of radioactive waste.
But preserving British expertise in nuclear technology should form no part
of the case for nuclear power. The UK has lost its historic lead in
developing civil nuclear technology. If the review decides that more plants
are justified, generators should be freed of any obligation to buy British.
Politically, there is no comfortable outcome: deciding to build more plants
or to extinguish the industry will arouse protest. The best that can be
achieved is for a conclusion to be reached in the light of all relevant
facts.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Sickly steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Karel van Miert, Europe's competition commissioner, may have been a shade
premature yesterday in announcing the death of his 15-month-old plan to cut
excess capacity in the European steel industry. Though the plan looks
increasingly fragile, its condition need not be terminal. On balance, it is
probably still just worth trying to revive it.
The latest complications are, for once, not due to resistance by EU
governments or steelmakers. Indeed, Brussels finally seems to be making
headway in persuading unsubsidised producers to offer production cuts needed
to complete the package by the end of this year. Rather, the cause is an
unexpected decision by Mr van Miert's fellow commissioners to veto a
proposed revision of the plan's terms to cover small steelmakers in northern
Italy. Since the issue turns on legal technicalities, and not on principle,
it ought to be soluble.
It cannot seriously be argued that the plan deserves to survive because it
is perfect. It manifestly is not. The child of political compromise, it
calls on efficient, unsubsidised steelmakers to shoulder too much of the
adjustment and requires too little of flabby state-owned producers. These
had to be bribed into co-operation with promises of still further subsidies.
Furthermore, some of their proposed capacity cuts look bogus.
The strongest case for the plan is that the alternatives look even worse.
Scuttling it would be unlikely to encourage healthy rationalisation. The
more probable result would be another subsidy race which would penalise
efficient producers and invite fresh US trade sanctions against European
steel exports. The Commission's other option would be to declare a 'manifest
crisis', empowering it to impose cuts and fix prices. That failed abysmally
when tried in the 1980s.
The commissioners should try again to settle their differences. That is far
from an ideal outcome. But while European governments refuse to let the
market solve industrial problems for which their past policies were largely
responsible, it looks the least bad course available.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Political wobbles have their price: Japan's new era of
unstable government is a challenge for business and the bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate planners across Japan are counting the business costs inflicted by
the unprecedented instability of political power in the world's
second-largest economy.
'We are very worried by the current stalemate. It contributes to the
speculation driving up the yen, holds up public works spending and delays
stimulation measures like economic deregulation and market opening,' says Mr
Masaya Miyoshi, director-general of the Keidanren business federation.
The Keidanren is so worried that it has begged Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime
minister for the past three weeks, and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party, to set aside their war and work
together to get the economy back on its feet. Its message has been only half
heard, as Mr Kono has vowed to call a vote of no confidence against the Hata
administration as soon as the budget, which has now been delayed until July,
is passed.
The Keidanren echoes a concern shared in boardrooms large and small, as they
adjust to unstable coalition governments, after the end last summer of 38
years of rule by the pro-business LDP.
A private poll of Japanese executives indicates the day-to-day handling of
the economy is surprisingly unaffected by political instability intensified
by last month's resignation of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the
establishment of what looks set to be a short-lived minority coalition. Yet
many fear the results of any weakening of the ties between business and
government, which is now unpredictable.
In the short term, the strength of Japan's bureaucracy, and the fact that
few top bureaucrats are appointed for party political reasons, means a
change of government brings less upheaval than in other leading economies.
The finance ministry is now, for example, keeping the country funded with
provisional budgets, while politicians struggle to agree the full budget,
due to have come into force on April 1. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan
intervenes, unhampered by the political rows, to keep the yen from running
out of control and carries out monetary policy - for better or worse - as
before. Other ministries plug away, implementing deregulation measures, from
brewing to air transport, agreed by parliament.
Thus, Japan's public administration probably has more of a hand in preparing
policies than many foreign counterparts. But it cannot make political
decisions on matters like tax reform. In this area, failure to agree on a
permanent income tax reduction (seen by many as essential to pull Japan out
of recession) contributed to the downfall of the Hosokawa government. The
reduction was to be funded by a subsequent rise in consumption tax.
The precise cost to business of this uncertainty is unclear. Estimates are
subjective and tend to vary, depending on the company.
Mr Susumu Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines, for example, says his business
is more affected by global competition than Japanese politics. A manager at
a leading trading company is more cynical. 'Perhaps we are lucky that
politicians are not running the economy at the moment,' he reflects. At the
other extreme, Mr Toshihiro Kiribuchi, managing director of Omron, the
control components group, says the cost of paralysis of economic policy and
continued trade friction with the US is 'very serious'.
But all agree the budget, tax reform, deregulation and US trade talks are
the main areas affected by current political turmoil.
The budget only calls for a 1 per cent rise in state spending to Y73,081bn,
unlikely alone to galvanise the economy. The problem posed by delay is the
government cannot propose extra spending, such as another stimulation
package, until this year's budget is settled. Last year, the government
needed three supplementary budgets to fund emergency spending to combat
recession, so it will probably need at least one this time.
While new spending is being held up, Japan's conservative bureaucracy has
been doing its best to prevent revenues from being eroded by the recession,
so cutting across government fiscal policy.
Several ministries have quietly tabled public sector price increases in the
past few months, totalling a net Y2,301bn, covertly clawing back nearly 40
per cent of the income tax rebate agreed by the Hosokawa government in
February. This provoked such an outcry from business organisations, worried
about choking the fragile hopes of a consumer led recovery, that the
government had hastily to freeze the rises.
On tax reform, the main cost of government paralysis is the inability of
business to plan for a rise in consumption tax. This is serious for small
retailers, such as Mr Ryuichiro Yasui, who employs four people in his
jewellery store in central Tokyo. Mr Yasui kept his net prices stable when a
3 per cent consumption tax was introduced in 1989, and plans to do the same
if the tax is increased - probably to 7 per cent. His shop is barely
breaking even, so he will have to borrow to cover the loss he plans to take.
'It's difficult to set my costs when I don't know what's happening to
taxes,' he says.
The outlook for deregulation is equally poor, fear many business people. Mr
Hata has declared that cutting red tape is a top priority for his
administration. Yet that is little comfort given that his opponents are
unlikely to allow him the time to usher a new batch of deregulation measures
through a sometimes reluctant bureaucracy.
Mr Mark Bedingham, chairman of the European Business Community, a lobby
group of European chambers of commerce, fears many deregulation measures
dreamed up by a business panel established by Mr Hosokawa will end up in
civil servants' bottom drawers.
Deregulation might slow down, but a growing number of businesses believes
market forces will not let it stop. Mr Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni
Credit Rating, points out: 'It does not matter whether governments regulate
or deregulate. Growth in our export markets is dead. Because of this, we are
facing a shift from a sellers' to a buyers' market at home.'
The final big concern is that Japan's weak government will fail to make
progress in the dispute with Washington over market access for foreign
goods, on which the two resumed their dialogue in Washington yesterday.
Here, Mr Hata's government has made good initial progress, and president
Bill Clinton has softened his stance on Japan, so helping to stave off a
sharp rise in the yen in the Japanese leader's first few days.
The more recent jump in the yen was partly driven by fears, rightly or
wrongly, that the US might retaliate to a breakdown in the trade talks by
nudging up the Japanese currency - perhaps by intervention, interest rate
manipulation, or merely by suggestion. 'For now, the pressure on the yen has
been alleviated, but this does not give us any relief at all,' says the
Keidanren's Mr Miyoshi. 'A further reversal can take place at any time,' he
says.
Here, the business costs are easier to calculate. The government's Economic
Planning Agency estimates that Japan's export industries are on average
competitive at Y117 to the dollar, as against the current Y104 at which the
currency has settled after nearing Y101 the day after Mr Hata formed his
cabinet.
For the economy at large, Mr Miyoshi reckons each 5 per cent rise in the
yen/dollar rate knocks 0.3 of a percentage point off annual growth in gross
domestic product.
Of one thing Japanese business can be sure. The message of the bumpy
transition from the old days of the LDP to an as yet undefined new political
system is that it cannot expect as much help from the guiding hand of the
state as they did in the past.
'Business is starting to realise that it cannot depend on government
action,' says JAL's Mr Yamaji. 'We will have to start doing more for
ourselves.'

So how do European countries leave their stamp on posterity given they only
have a brief six-month bash at the EU presidency? Naming some sort of scheme
after a national egg-head seems a popular move.
The Greeks, the current incumbents, have just christened a new educational
co-operation scheme SOCRATES. It replaces something called ERASMUS, which
certainly sounds as if it ought to have been dreamed up during a Dutch
presidency.
And presumably the LEONARDO training programme has something to do with the
Italian commissioner responsible for it. Perhaps the upcoming Luxembourg
presidency, though, will be a bit pushed to find a suitable title for its
pet cultural initiative . . .

The monies member countries pay in - normally based on the size of their
domestic economy - determine how much they can subsequently draw out. So
when officials sat down to discuss the credit, both sides were more than a
trifle dismayed to discover that Turkey's entitlement is smaller than that
for Romania, or for Pakistan, or for the Czech and Slovak republics taken

And then there were two. Derek Rosling, 63, who retired this week from
Hanson, was one of the Yorkshire trio which founded Britain's seventh
biggest company. A partner in a firm of Huddersfield accountants which
audited Hanson's family haulage business, Rosling has never had the same
public recognition as Lords Hanson and White. He got a CBE - they got
peerages.
But Alex Brummer, whose book on Hanson comes out later this year, says that
Rosling was a key figure behind the scenes. White did the deals, Hanson
knocked them into shape, and Rosling kept the books. Whereas Hanson, 72, and
White, 71, intend to soldier on till 1997, Rosling is quitting while he's
still young enough to enjoy retirement in California's Palm Springs.
He shouldn't be short of brass - Pounds 100 invested in Hanson in 1964 is
now worth Pounds 137,000.

China, the latest host to be snubbed, has been informed that Franco will be

Congress.
As the Chinese have no doubt twigged, however, the strike is winding down
and the army, which had been sent in to seal off some police buildings, has

The Chartered Institute of Bankers deserves a prize. After 116 years it has
elected a non-Brit as president - Andreas Prindl, a fiercely well-educated
American who works for a Japanese bank.
Not before time, since a quarter of the institute's members are non-Brits.
Let's hope the open-door policy catches on. The London Investment Banking
Association, the grandchild of the old Accepting Houses Committee, has
already picked a Brit as its next president - Flemings' John Manser. But
next time round it might pluck up courage and choose a foreigner, such as
Union Bank of Switzerland's Rudi Mueller.
At least it has dropped the British from its title - unlike the British
Bankers Association. It has never had a non-Brit as president in its 75-year
history. Given that the BBA represents over 300 banks from more than 60
countries which happen to operate in Britain it could make a start by
renaming itself.

To visit or not to visit? Japan is agonising over whether its Emperor
Akihito should drop in on Pearl Harbour when he makes his first state visit
to the US next month.
He visited Pearl Harbour when he was crown prince. But now he is the emperor
and some of his advisers are questioning whether he should be seen paying
his respects at Pearl Harbour's Arizona National Memorial, a monument for
victims of Japan's air attack in 1941.
Rightwing politicians in Japan argue that no US president has ever visited
Hiroshima or Nagasaki, destroyed by atom bombs. So why should their emperor
apologise for an attack which many still believe Japan was tricked into
mounting by the US?
Japan's qualms about showing remorse over its actions of 50 years ago are
not going to go away. After all, there is the tricky question of how the
world is going to celebrate the 50th anniversary of VJ Day - August 15 1945.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Personal View: High on dividends, low on investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN BOND and COSTAS MEGHIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is currently much concern about the low level of investment in the UK
and the impact of government policies on investment. Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury, is conducting a review of the effects
of taxation on savings and the flow of funds to companies. Further attention
has been drawn to company investment by the recent report of the House of
Commons trade and industry select committee.
A specific aspect of this debate which has come to the fore is the possible
link between high dividend payments and low investment spending. Could it be
more than coincidence that the UK company sector has high dividend payouts
and low investment?
The traditional view within economics is that high dividend payouts should
be irrelevant for investment. Companies that have attractive investment
projects but not enough internal finance from retained profits should be
able to raise suitable external finance, from debt or new share issues, in
well-functioning capital markets. Given the expected return on investment,
neither the level of current profits, nor the share paid out as dividends,
should influence investment levels.
Recent econometric evidence has tended to reject this view. This is
confirmed by our analysis of the investment spending of 626 quoted
manufacturing companies. We found that availability of internal funds does
affect investment spending for a significant fraction of companies. This is
consistent with other evidence. For example, the Confederation of British
Industry trends survey consistently shows that a shortage of internal
finance is perceived to be a significant factor limiting investment
spending.
This suggests many companies find external sources of investment finance
more expensive than internal funds.
We are not suggesting that this reflects any failing of the UK financial
system. Financial constraints on investment spending may be the inevitable
consequence of differential information.
What this research does indicate is that policies which reduce the
availability of internal finance are likely to have an adverse impact on
company investment. High company taxes are an obvious cause for concern.
Corporation tax revenue has increased by about 50 per cent in real terms
since Lord Lawson's 1984 reform. This increase in company tax payments has
done nothing to help investment spending; it has reduced the post-tax return
on investment and reduced the availability of internal funds.
Our study also suggests that high dividend payouts will directly reduce
investment for companies whose investment spending is limited by a shortage
of internal finance. This adverse effect is likely to be particularly
important during recessions. The availability of internal finance for
investment is reduced by the decline in company profits during recessions,
and this is worsened by the downward inflexibility of dividend payments.
We believe that this evidence calls into question the wisdom of Britain's
existing tax structure, which gives a big tax incentive in favour of paying
out dividends rather than retaining profits. The tax credits associated with
dividends make dividend income more attractive than capital gains for
tax-exempt institutional shareholders, including pension funds. Only for top
rate taxpayers is it likely that dividend income is not tax-efficient.
It is possible that high dividends have countervailing benefits that could
justify this tax subsidy. Most of the advantages that have been claimed for
high dividends, such as the spur to managerial efficiency provided by
financial pressure, could more obviously be achieved by debt commitments.
And even if high dividends are beneficial, this would surely be recognised
by companies and shareholders. The case for government intervention to
promote high dividends is unproven.
We would welcome moves towards a more neutral tax treatment of the payout
decision. One way in which this could be achieved is through a reduction in
the rate of advance corporation tax. Former chancellor Norman Lamont reduced
this rate from 25 to 20 per cent in his 1993 Budget. A further phased
reduction, possibly associated with lower tax rates on dividend income for
personal taxpayers, could eliminate the existing tax bias.
An added benefit of this approach is that the lower refunds of dividend tax
credits to institutional shareholders would raise tax revenue for the
government. This revenue could be used to cut corporation tax, offsetting
the impact of lower tax credits on the stock market, and giving a further
stimulus to company investment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Andreas Papandreou regained power last October, there was some
optimism that the new Greek government would take urgent action to correct
the country's severe economic imbalances. This hope has evaporated into the
Athenian ether.
The upheavals surrounding the drachma following the ending of capital
controls last week are a symptom of a more widespread Greek crisis. Since
his unsuccessful premiership between 1981 and 1989, Mr Papandreou and his
Panhellenic Socialist Movement have toned down left-wing radicalism. Yet
they appear as ill-equipped as ever to manage the economy of the poorest
and, on many measures, most wayward member of the European Union.
Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the new economy minister, has given no sign that he
will prove better able to master Greece's challenges than his predecessor,
the late Mr Giorgos Gennimatas. By freeing capital controls without
announcing measures to curb the fast-growing budget deficit, Mr Papantoniou
exposed Greece to the risk of instant retribution from the financial
markets.
The measure, anticipating by six weeks the liberalisation deadline of July
1, looks like a gamble that has failed. The Greek authorities have managed
to prop up the drachma with a draconian tightening of short-term interest
rates to levels of more than 100 per cent. This has further damaged the
outlook for the Greek economy in the coming year.
A monetary squeeze of the sort the Bank of Greece has been imposing can at
best buy time for stern budgetary action. In the absence of such moves, and
in the wake of last week's estimated Dollars 1bn fall in foreign exchange
reserves, a decision to let the drachma float down abruptly against the
D-Mark could be only a matter of time.
A combination of recession, lack of spending controls and large-scale tax
evasion may push central government borrowing to 17 per cent of gross
domestic product this year, compared with a target of 12.9 per cent. In view
of the inertia of Mr Papandreou's administration, it seems unlikely to
summon the necessary political will either to increase the efficiency of tax
collection or to expand the privatisation programme.
The government appears to be banking on extra revenue from EU structural
funds later this year to ease the problems caused by revenue shortfalls.
However, a country already heavily dependent on EU transfers, and which has
antagonised its partners by its intransigence over neighbouring Macedonia,
can expect tough treatment from the rest of the EU.
Greece's prospective transfer to Germany of the EU's six-monthly presidency
should be the signal for a more uncompromising EU line over the chronic
divergence of the Greek economy. Disbursement of EU grants for planned
infrastructure projects should be made dependent on the Greek government's
ability to fulfil rigorous economic targets.
Additionally, there can be no question of Brussels discussing any new EU
loans to Greece until the Papandreou government has put its house in order.
If Greece needs additional external credits which cannot be raised on
capital markets, it should turn not to the EU but to the International
Monetary Fund.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Limit to Irish waiting game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein will squeeze much propaganda out of the 20 questions it sent to
the British government last Friday. The answers will be treated in the same
fashion. That was the purpose of the exercise. The political front of the
Irish Republican Army will derive raw material for its constant public
relations offensive from the commendably robust reply prepared for it in
London yesterday. As expected, Britain restated its known position. The
government could not afford to show any give, nor did it. If Sinn Fein/IRA
is true to form, questions and British commentary alike will be deployed as
evidence of the 'reasonableness' of the armed republicans' cause and
methods. Then the terrorists will carry on shooting and bombing as usual.
Wait a minute. The above prognostication jars. It is not in tune. It differs
from the conventional wisdom. Officials and ministers in London, Dublin and
Belfast have recently begun to sing a familiar song. There is an evident
longing for peace, they warble. We are at last reaching the end of the
period of terrorism that began a quarter of a century ago. The Northern
Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, exudes confidence in the peace
process. The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, has long spoken as if
an early ceasefire was probable. His foreign secretary, Mr Dick Spring,
talked yesterday morning of clearing the logjam within the next few days.
Even the president of Sinn Fein, Mr Gerry Adams, speaks as if we had reached
the end-game.
Perhaps we have, but there is no telling how long the final agony will last.
The IRA could lay down its arms tomorrow, if it chose. Equally, it could
continue the 'armed struggle' for the rest of this year, or another five
years, or another generation. In a new book* on the province published on
Monday Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, academics born in Ulster, suggest that
the security forces 'now appear to have moved towards a strategy of
containment pending the achievement of some form of political
accommodation'. Equally it might be said that the IRA has set itself the
limited objective of maintaining its present level of operations in the hope
of securing an eventual British withdrawal. 'Seen in these terms, both sides
appear to have the capacity to continue indefinitely,' say Boyle and Hadden.
Much de-pends on how long it takes for the message implicit in the
Irish-British declaration of December 15 1993 to sink in. Its essence is
that the prime ministers of the two countries, Mr Reynolds and Mr John
Major, have determined that if Sinn Fein wants to be treated as a
constitutional political party it must first renounce violence. As Mr
Reynolds said on Sunday, 'it also requires acceptance that, where you have
two communities, political structures cannot be based on simple
majoritarianism'.
The IRA/Sinn Fein will doubtless search for differences between Mr
Reynolds's 'clarifications' of the joint declaration and last night's
British commentary on its 20 questions. It is not clear how assiduously the
two governments have worked to compare notes in advance, but the assumption
must be that their responses do not deviate from the principles of the
December declaration. Just one of the IRA's 20 questions seemed to Sir
Patrick to be on a point of genuine textual ambiguity. It was answered
accordingly. The rest were grouped under various tags, such as whether they
sought to reopen negotiations on the declaration, or whether they were mere
repetitions of previous positions.
If the optimists are right, the armed nationalists will now perceive that
their only hope of achieving anything like a united Ireland lies in the
peaceful persuasion of a majority of the people of Ulster. This argument is
doubtless being deployed in smoke-filled rooms in the six counties, but it
is anybody's guess as to when, or whether, it will prevail. No one pretends
that a referendum now would produce any result other than a defeat for the
concept of a united Ireland.
This position may change as the Catholic proportion of the population
increases. Unionists won 62 per cent of the votes in the elections to the
Northern Ireland assembly in 1973. In last year's local elections their
score was down to 49 per cent. The nationalist vote rose from a quarter to a
third over the same period. Yet this is a slow process. The IRA/Sinn Fein is
being asked to do a deal from which it cannot hope to profit for another
generation. It will only acquiesce if it is convinced that there is no other
way - that however much a section of the British public may long to be
detached from Northern Ireland, it will not do so under duress, nor against
the will of the people of the province.
In London and Dublin this may seem like a statement of the obvious. There
may be a long, bloody wait before it is accepted in Belfast. This does not
mean that the Irish and British governments need do nothing. Once next
month's elections to the European Parliament are out of the way, they should
try once again to get the constitutional parties in the province to talk
about a new settlement for governance of Ulster. The Boyle and Hadden book
lists a variety of possibilities, some based on the ethnic separation that
has evolved as Catholics and Protestants have moved to areas safer for
themselves.
The authors explore the power-sharing option, but their charts, particularly
when set beside a Flemish-Walloon map of Belgium's provinces, speak for
communal self-government. A 'preferendum' is proposed, based on the
experience of Newfoundland in the 1940s. The options suggested for Ulster
include continued direct rule, but not immediate unification with the south.
There would be 'little point' in asking about that, say Boyle and Hadden.
They propose that the Irish constitution and British law be altered, so that
both promised to legislate for a united Ireland if at any time in the future
a majority of the people of Ireland and Ulster voted in favour.
It may seem fanciful to talk of preferendums and new internal arrangements
for Ulster while the terrorist outrages continue. Unification, if it ever
comes, is for well into the next century. But the two governments cannot
wait forever for the IRA to make up its mind. As Mr Reynolds, quoting Edmund
Burke, said at the weekend, 'there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to
be virtue'.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Refreshing spontaneity at breakfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES CARROLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agree with Christopher Dunkley that 'watching television at breakfast
is depraved' (Arts: 'Mixed up breakfast menus', May 18). However, I think he
missed something when reviewing The Big Breakfast.
The Big Breakfast is refreshingly real, energetic, spontaneous and the
presenters genuine and fallible. The BBC's Business Breakfast is
appropriately professional and technically slick. However, GMTV, in its
phoney living room setting, seems to me to fall down a hole in the middle.
I suspect that GMTV is aimed at a social group that agrees watching
television at breakfast is depraved, so guess what - they don't watch it.

FT  20 MAY 94 / A season for sacrifices: John Murray Brown examines Turkey's
economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Turks prepare for tomorrow's festival of the Sacrifice of Abraham, a
gloomy mood pervades the capital Ankara. For this year's Bayram (Eid
al-Adha), which families traditionally celebrate by exchanging gifts and
slaughtering their favourite sheep, finds Turkey in the middle of its worst
economic crisis in a decade.
The sacrifice most Turks will make this year will be an economic one. For
the government is steeling its political nerve to implement a set of
measures which even the International Monetary Fund is concerned may prove
overambitious.
The prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller is invoking the spirit of the war of
independence against Greek and other forces in the 1920s in a bid to muster
public support for her plan for national revival.
Most bankers and economists, and some government officials, believe Turkey
cannot get through the crisis alone. Much hangs on an IMF agreement. An IMF
mission left Ankara on Wednesday after two weeks of negotiations on the
austerity programme announced by Mrs Ciller on April 5. Turkey is seeking a
one-year standby loan of about Dollars 450m to support its balance of
payments, half of which could be immediately disbursed.
Turkey will need the understanding of its foreign bankers if it is to escape
a debt rescheduling. With about Dollars 4.7bn of medium- and long-term
principal to be repaid this year, the government is also relying on measures
from creditors such as the European Union and Japan to refinance this
amount.
Turkey's request for a standby loan is to be presented to the IMF board in
July. The fund's approval would send a signal that international confidence
in Turkey was rising.
Until then, Mrs Ciller has to keep her adjustment measure on track, holding
the line on wages in the current biannual talks with civil servants and
public sector workers, and meeting repayments on Turkey's Dollars 66bn
foreign debt, of which about Dollars 1.3bn is due at the end of June.
Even if a standby agreement is concluded, funds would be frozen if Turkey
slipped up on what are likely to be extremely strict performance targets set
by the IMF. Moreover, any World Bank structural adjustment loans, also under
negotiation in parallel with the IMF deal, would be put on hold. Turkey's
foreign bankers may also consider cutting their lines of credit. This could
lead to a balance of payments crisis, forcing Turkey to a full debt
rescheduling with both the Paris and London clubs of creditors. Such a
development would put Mrs Ciller's political survival at serious risk.
Turkey's economic ills can only in part be laid at Mrs Ciller's door. The
main reason is the refusal of successive governments to tackle growing
fiscal deficits, the root cause of Turkey's persistently high inflation
rate, which last month rose to an annualised 107 per cent. Second, the
impact of new financial instruments such as asset-backed securities, has
undermined the ability of Turkey's central bank to control the money supply.
Third, Mrs Ciller last year launched an unsuccessful attempt to push down
interest rates on government paper in a bid to reduce budget costs.
In the first quarter of this year, without being able to borrow domestically
and with the international debt markets closed off after a series of credit
downgradings by the agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the government
was forced to go to the central bank for short-term advances to finance the
budget. The resulting increase in money supply set in train a run on the
Turkish lira. The lira has fallen in value by 50 per cent against the US
dollar since January.
Nevertheless, there are signs that confidence is slowly returning. Earlier
this month, for the first time this year, the government sold Treasury bills
at auction, albeit in relatively small volumes. Interest rates, having been
as high as 400-500 per cent over the past three months, are edging down and
the exchange rate appears to be stabilising at about TL33,000 to the dollar,
compared with a low of TL41,000 in mid-April. Central bank reserves are
recovering slightly, although at Dollars 3bn, they are at half the levels of
1993.
The fiscal adjustment plan comprises both short-term stabilisation measures
and longer-term structural reforms. It envisages halving the projected
deficit to Dollars 2.8bn by the end of the year and slashing the public
sector borrowing requirement from 17 per cent to 10 per cent of gross
national product, through a Dollars 2.1bn one-off wealth tax, a 15 per cent
real wage cut in the public sector, laying off 30,000 state workers, and
speedier privatisation.
Pain is being felt across the economy. Business people think the government
is leaving companies to fend for themselves in an officially engineered
recession, while calling on the private sector to make new tax
contributions.
Three banks have already been closed by the Treasury. The authorities
recently introduced unlimited deposit insurance to stem the haemorrhaging of
savings from the banking sector. The policy appears to have worked, although
over the longer term, it could encourage banks to pursue imprudent
practices.
The State Planning Organisation is projecting a fall of 4 per cent in
consumer demand this year, compared with growth in consumption of 13 per
cent last year. On one day last week, for the first time, Turkey's car
industry failed to sell a single vehicle.
Imports have been hit hard in the wake of the lira's devaluation. According
to Mr Cumhur Atilgan, of the International Transporters Association, more
than half Turkey's truck fleet is stranded in Europe, unable to find a load
for the return leg. But as a result of slower imports, officials say the
current account should come back into balance or perhaps a small surplus
this year, compared with a Dollars 6.4bn deficit in 1993.
The real challenge for the government is to curb its own finances.
Economists criticise the programme for relying too much on one-off measures
such as tax charges on the rich, without proposing more sustainable sources
of revenue.
Mrs Ciller seems to be hostage to her own bold proposals. Having announced
them with such a fanfare on April 5, she is reluctant to change course. In
rejecting the IMF's suggestion to adopt a two- or three-year adjustment
period, she may have one eye on her electoral calendar, aware that a general
election has to be held before the end of 1996.
Western diplomats are doubtful whether Mrs Ciller has the political
authority to push the programme through. They point out that it is central
government, over which she has direct control, which has taken the main
brunt of the spending cuts. State enterprises run by ministries, where there
is excess labour, have escaped relatively unscathed.
For her programme to succeed, Mrs Ciller must keep wages down. But first she
must convince workers that she is winning the battle against inflation. On
this, the jury is out.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Channel 5 essential for regional
network growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Viscount LEWISHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is disappointing that once again the government is delaying a
decision on the re-advertisement of Channel 5 ('Brooke delays Channel 5
further', May 10).
The recent wave of takeovers against the ITV Channel 3 companies might well
establish competitors with the 'skyscraper' potential to improve our
position in the world markets.
But, alas, this feeding frenzy has, as a by-product, accelerated the shift
in programme making to London. It is worth noting that the holding companies
of four out of the 'Big 5' ITV companies are headquartered in the capital.
The consequence of this is that creative talent in the regions has suffered
and will continue to suffer to the point of elimination.
Channel 5, with its network of local city stations, will quickly restore the
balance, providing creative and technical jobs in the regions - as well as
extending consumer choice at no cost to the viewer or taxpayer and to the
benefit of the Exchequer.
If this government is genuine in its stated desire to encourage competition
and to foster enterprise, it will release the appropriate frequencies to
allow the ITC to readvertise Channel 5.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: World Bank support for the blind begs
many questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof R A WEALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on World Bank support for the struggle against blindness is
welcome ('World Bank cash to help the blind', May 14). It may therefore seem
carping to ask questions.
If this is 'the first project supported by a multilateral agency
specifically aimed at combating blindness' why were the funds not channelled
to WHO's programme for the Prevention of Blindness, which has been combating
blindness on a shoestring now for decades?
What better expertise does the World Bank possess than WHO? Why select India
when similar conditions prevail, for example in Pakistan, as I discovered
last February?
Why is the Indian surgery backlog increasing when the Indian delegate to a
WHO meeting nine years ago said it was being contained, if not reduced?
What percentage of the loan is earmarked for overheads, and how will
expenditure be monitored?
Specific conditions in the Indian sub-continent make it unnecessarily hard
to grapple with the tragic situation of its blind millions.
It is the intention to train 360 surgeons and about 1,700 nurses and other
support staff to restore sight to more than 8m by the year 2000. But we are
in the middle of 1994. Medically qualified graduates, if found, take four
years to train.
In that part of the world it is generally only males coming from well-to-do
families who are thought to be sufficiently intelligent enough to
successfully pursue medical and specialist studies.
If second-tier specialists are to train with an abbreviated curriculum,
which candidates are going to volunteer for this, with reduced prospects in
private practice?
A more economically sound move to follow could be a policy pioneered in
Africa. Suitable medically non-qualified staff were trained in the skills
required for the successful removal of cataracts.
On the Indian sub-continent there is always the concern that non-medics will
set up practices in the souk. It is hard to decide which is the greater
concern - that for misled patients or for unfair competition.
It would be interesting to know what representations were made to the World
Bank in connection with any alternative schemes, and on what grounds they
proved unacceptable.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Goode opposition short-sighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K WALLACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The suggestion that larger companies are pressing the government to abandon
the Goode recommendation on having at least one-third of pension scheme
trustees drawn from the workforce is alarming ('Employers oppose rule change
for pensions', May 17).
The stalking horse for this view is that it is said to involve
'over-regulation'.
There are a number of very respectable reasons why member participation in
pension scheme trusteeship is highly desirable.
One point though needs to be made loud and clear in this particular context.
The 'nasties' identified over the last few years would never have occurred
if the trustees had been robust, experienced, well-informed and uninvolved
in management's financial ploys.
You can achieve similar protection from external independent trustees or a
really tough pensions regulator. However, there is no doubt that good member
trustees play an excellent role as quick, sensitive and extremely cheap
'watchdogs' and regulators of pension schemes.
It is very short-sighted of these larger companies to oppose this thoroughly
sensible recommendation. They are likely to find that the regulatory regime
may be much tougher and more expensive in consequence.
Their beneficiaries may find it, I fear, less effective.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ANNI MARJORAM and Ms ANN PETTIFOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We write to complain about the highly offensive tone of your piece in
Observer: 'Difficulties with a girl' (May 18). The piece is a reference to a
planned meeting between President Clinton and the leader of the Labour
party.
The diarist writes on the assumption that 'the girl' that is the subject of
his piece, the Rt Hon Mrs Margaret Beckett MP, 'will not get the job' of
Labour leader. On what is this assessment based? As we understand the
constitutional position, Mrs Beckett is already in post as leader of the
Labour party. Nominations and the election for the post of a new leader have
not yet been opened.
Mrs Beckett has announced that as our leader she will fight for victory in
the European election campaign before declaring her position. We have every
confidence that she will lead us to victory, and that, should she choose to
stand in the forthcoming election, she will make a formidable contender for
the post.
The person who wrote your piece displays a misogyny common in Fleet Street
and the corridors of Westminster. We regret this, as we look to the FT for
adult comment and analysis on political affairs.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: A night on the town with Jack - Ian Shuttleworth
welcomes the return of Nicol Williamson to the London stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine only knowing George Best's footballing skills through his mid-1970s
comeback; many of Nicol Williamson's audience will be in an analogous
position. The pre-publicity for his return to the West End after a decade
and a half has familiarised us with his achievements in the 1960s -
startling performances in Inadmissible Evidence and Events During the
Guarding of the Bofors Gun and the definitive Hamlet of his generation - but
since his relocation to America our only sightings of him have been on the
screen, as Mountbatten the Last Viceroy or a gloriously idiosyncratic Merlin
in John Boorman's Excalibur.
Williamson now seems intent on proving that his control and precision are
unabated. Paradoxically, he has chosen to do so in a one-man show about the
erratic, alcoholic John Barrymore, whose career spanned vaudeville,
Shakespeare and matinee idoldom before declining into pathetic self-parody.
He has been at pains to deny any alleged parallels, but as with most solo
presentations it is impossible to watch Jack without a keen consciousness of
the performer.
This was heightened on the press night by Williamson's evident nervousness;
it is difficult to ascribe many of the fluffs and uncertainties to the
portrayal of a figure whose skills have been shot by booze - not even on the
stammered line, 'My m-uh, my memory's not a problem.' For much of the first
act he seemed simply to be hitting his spots and delivering lines in the
requisite moods, but a combination of restraint and timidity prevented him
from inhabiting his character. The first hints of a native ebullience came
with the unambiguously broad parody of the voice teacher to whom Barrymore
resorted to train for the parts of Richard III and Hamlet - culminating in
the sight of a theatrical legend (Williamson or Barrymore, take your pick)
in vest and tights singing 'The Laughing Policeman'.
Screen director Leslie Megahey (making his stage directorial debut) and
Williamson have devised a show which engages and endears, despite lapsing
into purple orotundity during the self-pitying passages about Barrymore's
terminal alcoholism. They are alive to the mileage in self-referential
chuckles without falling into solipsism: knowing the story of Williamson's
last New York appearance, we are allowed a snigger when Barrymore speaks of
only occasionally giving his Laertes a flesh-wound in the duelling scene of
Hamlet (and the line 'What kind of asshole does it take to write 'My Life In
the Theatre' at 28?' cannot have been lost on one of the trustees of
Criterion Productions, a Mr. Branagh).
The actor lives up to his description of his own talents - 'I can understand
people's pain, passion, fear, hurt, and I can mirror it and set it up for
them to look at'; he can work wonders with a moment of silent reflection or
(scripted) hesitation - but always seems to be reining himself in.
Crucially, he fails to convey possibly the most essential element of
Barrymore's charisma, his sexual magnetism. For all Barrymore's talk of his
four matrimonial 'bus accidents' and romantic excesses, Williamson simple
does not smoulder sufficiently.
Both he and Jack will be feted, and rightly so; for all these reservations,
it is damned good to have back an actor individual enough to divide his
programme biography into performances on stage, on screen and 'for the
American Presidency' and who uses his curtain speech to invite the audience
to listen to him perform a jazz set in the bar after the show. However,
those of us who missed his early glories will have to take up the Nicol
Williamson story, without preconceptions, from here.
At the Criterion Theatre until July 16 (071-839-4488)

FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: Beards, bop and blues - The London Jazz Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a time during the all day avant-garde segment of the London Jazz
Festival, I could feel tears of joy falling silently to mingle with drops of
beer in the beard I had grown especially for the occasion. Guitarist Billy
Jenkins' was wheezing his way through an excruciating version of 'What a
Wonderful World'. Earlier in the set Jenkins, who usually performs as the
Voice of God Collective, had been inexplicably yelling 'Jurassic Park]' at
his perplexed (German) horn section before throwing himself painfully to the
stage floor. A large man bellowed at him to desist, shouting 'Have you
forgotten what jazz is?' Jenkins responded by thanking the Goethe Institut
for their support and proceeded to demolish the Louis Armstrong weepie with
power chords and an asthmatic vocal style inspired by Norman Wisdom.
A full day's worth of sturm und drang in the confines of the Sadler's Wells
theatre is enough to make a grown critic cry: good job it culminated in the
confident and sophisticated musings of pianist Carla Bley, master bassist
Steve Swallow and saxophonist Andy Sheppard. Performing a repertoire of
gentle writing arrived at between the three of them in the Bley/Swallow
kitchen, a cool blue intimacy descended on the concert hall. Bley and
Swallow are clearly enjoying the bucolic idyll of their north western
mountain greenery. Their first three pieces are known collectively as
'Wildlife' and included 'Sex With Birds'; the skittish 'Chicken' was written
for them by their chickens and 'Wrongkey Donkey' was a stubborn melody which
eventually came along as a kind of arabesque.
Sadler's Wells also hosted the 'Jazz Australia' evening whose highlight was
multi-instrumentalist James Morrison's sextet. Fewer gags and horn
acrobatics than is usual from the funny man meant that closer scrutiny of
his mainstream trumpet playing was possible - but what still impresses are
the man's chops of steel and his ability to sustain impossible notes.
In support, pianist Paul Grabowsky takes the prize for being the most
authentically dissolute jazz musician of the festival. He has the appearance
of a man who commutes daily between Sydney and London, subsisting on the
airline's courtesy refreshments. Unfortunately, his sub-Mingus, horn-led
work was handled in such a cavalier way that abruptly called time changes
could not restore its impact. Perhaps the material sounds better on the new,
much awaited Viva, Viva (East West Records).
Over at Ronnie Scott's club, every night of the week, Joshua Redman was
demonstrating the straight-on, in your face style of post-bop playing which
has made him the hot young tenor to watch. His youthful band, which on these
nights included pianist Eric Reed as well as Christian McBride (bass) and
Brian Blade (drums), whipped through blink-and-miss-the-changes numbers from
Wish, Redman's recent release on WEA. Reed, who also has a new disc on the
racks, It's Alright To Swing (MoJazz) punches out precise and brittle notes,
bringing the rhythm section on behind him. Redman cites Sonny Rollins as a
major influence and he shares the great man's love of a waltz and a calypso
 -and like Rollins is compulsively and imaginatively 'on' for most of the
time.
On the South Bank, a large crowd of faithful Chick Corea acolytes assembled
to meet the pianist's new Elektric Band. Taking his material from the new
GRP album, Paint The World, Corea's latest sound is semi-electric, more
spontaneous than previously, but remains a crowd (mostly men) pleasing
fusion of rock and jazz. Shrill altoist Eric Marienthal continues from the
old band and he is joined by Gary Novak's machine gun drumming, Jimmy Earl's
monster bass lines and Mike Miller's heroic licks. Predominantly nerdy,
Corea's chip-driven technique is nevertheless reliably exciting. You could
say that he presses all the right buttons.
The FT will be printed to the sound of Glenn Miller's music on Thursday, May
26. The Ambassadors, the jazz orchestra of the United States Air Forces in
Europe, is playing a one-off concert at the St Clements Press, East India
Dock House, from 7.30pm to 10.15pm. Tickets are Pounds 6 each, available
from Tracey Coyle on 071-537-8012. All proceeds in aid of St Anne's Church,
Limehouse, the Getty Challenge Grant Appeal and Bromley Hall School Fund.

There is a treat in store for those with nearly four hours to spare:
starting at 6.55 Radio 3 is relaying Carmen from Covent Garden with Placido
Domingo in the role of Don Jose for the first time at the Royal Opera House
for more than 20 years. The title role is taken by American soprano Denyce
Graves and Barseg Tumanyan sings the toreador Escamillo. In his seminal
work, 'The Complete Opera Book', Gustave Kobbe states that the character of
Carmen 'is, of course, the creation of the novelist' Merimee. But tonight in
an interval talk between Acts 1 and 2, Tony Briggs suggests that the true
model for Bizet's gypsy heroine was Pushkin's Zemfira. If opera is not to
your taste there is a mass of other music on radio to choose from. At 8.00
the Classic FM Evening Concert consists of early music including the
oratorio 'San Giovanni Battista' by the mysterious Italian composer
Alessandro Stradella, conducted by Marc Minkowski. Or how about highlights
from the recent European Brass Band Championships in Montreux, which can be
heard in Listen To The Band (9.00 Radio 2).

After 25 years of hiding inside roles of flexi-tubing, air-filled packaging
and moulded foam, the three members of Swiss Mime-theatre troupe,
Mummenschanz, have decided to call it a day, having accepted that the number
of facial expressions one can pull while sporting a malleable, doughy head
is limited.
Parade, the company's swan song at Sadler's Wells, is fashioned as a
collection of greatest hits but, four tracks into the show one realises that
Mummenschanz is a one-hit wonder and that the 'parade' denotes a tired,
conveyor-belt selection of inhabitable or manipulable props through which
the two-men, one woman team conjure up the same few sketches over and over
again.
Boy meets girls is the most familiar theme - and one which Mummenschanz
seems incapable of visualising as anything other than coy declarations of
physical attraction between a couple of over-excited yet asexual figures,
sheathed in black from head to toe.
Everything in Parade belongs to this tedious, mass appeal 'naughty but nice'
mentality and, as one might expect, it is all kept above the belt. In one
such 'headpiece' encounter, a male plug and female socket make contact and,
even after they have exited together, lights continue to flash; in another,
a pair of huge, empty, gossamer-fine condom faces billow in erect
anticipation and crumple in flaccid disappointment by turns as their owners
dash back and forth across the stage, unable to unite.
Watching these vignettes, one sees the weakness of Mummenschanz's art: it
has become a series of visual gags which have run their course. And the
theatrical notion which informs them - that is, the transformation of human
bodies into amorphous, inanimate objects, only to attempt to breathe life
into them again - amounts, on stage, to little more than perverse gimmickry.
The performer as breeze block or cylindrical roly-poly is not a new idea:
during the Bauhaus period, Oskar Schlemmer created various assemblages of
moving objects and puppet figures in his Mechanical and Triadic Ballets. At
that time, Schlemmer's pared-down physical theatre constituted a radical
departure from Expressionism. Watching Mummenschanz, however, throws one
back to a far less fertile era of performance - an era of black light mime
theatre, full of wacky tricks and cutesy, applause-milking turns.
At Sadler's Wells until May 21 (071-278-8916)

FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: A Midsummer Night's Dream - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Below a ceiling painted with moons and stars the nightly ritual of dream and
awakening which forms the magical theme of A Midsummer Night's Dream begins.
The Freemasons' Hall in Covent Garden must be one of the most unusual venues
for opera and the challenge is to find operas that will gain from being seen
in its hallowed interior.
If one cannot have access to the Royal Opera House, the hall is the largest
in the area. The BOC Covent Garden Festival used it to strikingly pertinent
effect last year for Mozart's Die Zauberflote, where it had the most apt
setting for the Temple of the brotherhood. This year Britten's A Midsummer
Night's Dream was again performed in the round, risking a more significant
penalty if the text could not be heard.
In the centre stands a huge four-poster bed. Hordes of infant fairies skip
around, wearing green-and-white striped pyjamas and cute little green boots,
as if they have stepped straight out of Never-Never-Land with Joseph
Beattie's cheeky Puck their Peter Pan of a leader. But Jamie Hayes's
production, designed by Ruari Murchison, has a darker side too.
Puck describes Oberon as 'King of Shadows' and that is what he is here: bald
and bespangled, an 'alternative' leader from a fairy underworld, whose
authority is diminished only by the lack of nobility in Christopher Robson's
counter-tenor voice. His prowling Tytania in black leather bodice and
thigh-boots is at least his match and Judith Howarth sings her music with
unblemished certainty.
The objective of British Youth Opera (under whose auspices the production
has been put together) is to encourage young singers, and in the other roles
there is a parade of prize-winners from vocal competitions past and present.
The four lovers are not easy parts to sing and this quartet made a handsome
job of them, the appealing duo of Ruby Philogene's Hermia and Ian
Bostridge's Lysander just outstripping their opposite numbers, Carol Smith
and Charles Johnston as Helena and Demetrius.
Their main problem was trying to get the words across to an audience seated
on all sides, as their scenes together involve rapid-fire exchanges. The
rustics did better at that, but were less entertaining. Comedy has
previously been Hayes's favoured outlet, but the 'tedious brief scene' at
the end - led by Jonathan Veira's prima donna of a Bottom - felt decidedly
more tedious than brief. There was ample time to examine the detail of
Zandra Rhodes's last-scene costumes.
Conducting with one eye over her shoulder, Jane Glover succeeded in keeping
singers and orchestra together better than anyone could rightfully have
expected. In all, there was a warm feeling of community opera. Perhaps the
Masons' watchful eye had cast a benign influence over the evening.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: Uncle Silas - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How 'richly compostly loamishly sad were those Victorian days,' wrote Stevie
Smith in Novel on Yellow Paper '. . . always someone dies, someone weeps, in
tune with the laurels dripping . . . and the dim gas flickering greenly in
the damp conservatory.'
Mike Alfreds' production of Uncle Silas for the Cambridge Theatre Company,
currently at the Lyric, Hammersmith, understands not just the eerieness of
something nasty in the shrubbery but the melancholy as well; not just death
stalking the over-upholstered drawing-rooms, honoured with cultish ritual
and jet trimmings, but that house-guest the Victorians preferred not to
acknowledge: sex. Sheridan Le Fanu's novel belongs, like Wilkie Collins' The
Woman in White, to the genre of the abused and deluded heiress driven almost
mad with terror before being rescued from nefarious plotters.
Alfreds is fond of the Gothic tale, as witness his National Theatre
production of that old chiller, The Wandering Jew. Paul Dart's designs, all
black foliage and sable swags on walls that slide silently into place,
evokes the requisite spookiness. Other elements include the grotesque menace
of the sinister French governess: Sam Cox plays her with unabashed,
raw-boned masculinity and an accent that verges on parody ('eet ees your
turn to suffair'). The production shows the affectionate mockery of style
characteristic of confident story-tellers, combined with absolute respect
for the substance.
But if the style looks back to Struwwelpeter's eruption of the nightmarish
into the almost comically prosaic, it also looks forward: to the thriller of
atmosphere, unvoiced suspicion, half-understood fears, as cumulative as a
Hitchcock film, as internalised as Henry James' Turn of the Screw, where the
reader is unsure whether the ghosts are real or products of hysteria. Did
James unconsciously remember Silas's maid Mary Quince when he created the
spectral manservant, Peter Quint?.
Here the production's bumpiness tells against the smooth spinning of a mood
of ambiguity. As practically nothing really frightening happens before the
interval, mood is all-important. The director's own adaptation pares the
narration down to a series of short, sometimes elliptical scenes. One feels
something is missing. Once the orphaned Maud (Anne Marie Duff, looking every
inch the tremulously courageous - and foolish - Victorian heroine) has taken
up residence with her mysterious Uncle Silas (Terence Wilton in a white
mane, looking like Liszt) the yarn is spun more clearly but also more
slowly.
If the pace and rhythm can be evened out there will be much to enjoy,
including often ingenious doubling. Sam Cox abandons his Gallic governess
for a brutal northern peasant; Mary Roscoe has the Dickensian gift of being
funny and touching; and Carolyn Jones splendidly differentiates between a
snarling crone below-stairs and the natural good-heartedness of the British
aristocracy. The production unwaveringly captures the sense of cruelty and
danger that a child sometimes feels when regarding the incomprehensible
world which, in this respect at least, resembles the grimmest of
fairy-tales.

<TEXT>
The 'vinegar syndrome' is the curse of film archivists, but Kodak has
developed the Molecular Sieve to combat the deterioration of valuable motion
films in storage through moisture, temperature, acids and vapours from the
air.
The molecular sieve consists of a small sachet of zeolite, a mineral, that
absorbs moisture and chemicals. Kodak says its inclusion with processed film
in a plastic bag will extend the life of the dye images and the cellulose
triacetate film support.

<TEXT>
'The brightest watch on the world market,' is the claim made by Seiko of
Japan for a new range it is launching later this year. The company's
Lumibrite technology - which dispenses with electrical energy and
fluorescent paints with small amounts of radioactive substances - provides
an initial brightness which Seiko says is up to 10 times greater than with
conventional luminous watches.
Lumibrite watches use a new Japanese pigment based mainly on aluminium
oxides. The watch dial glows brilliantly for four to five hours after 10
minutes exposure to light equivalent to the brightness in a typical office.

It sounds like an invitation to crime. The UK's Transport Research
Laboratory intends to ply drivers with alcohol and drugs and see how they
perform behind the wheel. But this will take place in a safe environment -
in TRL's new car simulator. Only the drink and drugs will be real.
TRL, part of the Department of Transport, developed the simulator with the
help of Silicon Graphics of the US. It uses technology previously associated
with complex applications such as flight simulation. Designed and built by
Maritime Dynamics of the UK, it contains a standard saloon car, modified to
provide realistic motion and operation.
Four screens surrounding the car will show realistic scenes and the sounds
of the engine and starter motor will also be simulated. 'The driver had to
be completely convinced that the car was moving, so the images had to be
totally realistic and generated instantaneously,' says Robert Sharples,
Maritime Dynamics' software manager.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Apple peps up its Powerbooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer rejuvenated its line of Powerbook portable notebook computers
this week with the launch of six 'new and improved' models, writes Louise
Kehoe.
The Powerbook 500 series features a new type of cursor control device,
replacing the built-in trackball with a touch sensitive pad. By moving a
finger tip across the pad, or tapping it, the user controls the movements of
the cursor on the computer screen. Other innovations include 'intelligent
batteries', that enable users to monitor battery life accurately, and
CD-quality stereo sound capabilities for multimedia applications.
Apple also introduced two new 'sub-notebook' computers, including the first
with an active matrix colour display. They will be upgradable to the new
PowerPC chip at the heart of Apple's latest desktop Macintosh computers when
a low-power version of that chip becomes available.
By promising upgradability, Apple hopes to encourage buyers to act now
rather than wait for the PowerPC notebooks expected later this year. US
prices range from Dollars 2,269 for a Powerbook 520 with 4MB of memory,
160MB hard disk and monochrome display to Dollars 5,539 for the Powerbook
540c with 12MB of memory, 320MB hard disk, built-in modem and colour screen.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Technology: Scoring on the digital pitch - Tom Foremski
believes US computing will fare better in the World Cup than the country's
football team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US national soccer team is not expected to go far in the 1994 World Cup.
But the country's high-tech companies hope to score strongly on the digital
playing field with a state-of-the art computer network that will support all
aspects of the competition.
In what is probably the most sophisticated computer network ever assembled
for a sporting event, US companies Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Electronic Data
Systems (EDS) and Sprint, have collaborated to produce a sophisticated
system for the US-hosted event. More than 1,000 Sun workstations running
multimedia and other software from Sybase, and applications developed by
EDS, will form a national and international network linking 12 sites where
the games will be played.
In the process, the Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) network will help propel World
Cup USA 1994 into the ranks of the Fortune 200 companies from just a few
dozen employees one year ago. This is an example of a so-called virtual
corporation - comprising groups of people linked electronically for a
specific purpose - growing to more than 15,000 staff during the summer
games.
The organisers of World Cup '94, which kicks off on June 17, face formidable
challenges. Unlike Olympic events, where the sporting action takes place
within a short distance of a central location, the computer network must
tackle what could easily turn into a logistical nightmare.
'It's like fighting a war - the logistics problems are very similar,' says
Norm Koo, technical office director for World Cup, at Sun. 'Things are
further complicated because we have to take into account the national
culture of each team. For example, Moslem teams need to be placed in hotels
that can accommodate their special dietary needs. We also have to be very
careful that all the hotels are of a similar standard. It would be easy to
offend a national team if they thought we placed them in a lower standard
hotel.'
Nine US cities will host 52 matches played by 24 national teams during four
weeks across four time zones. The computer network has to calculate all the
logistics of moving teams and their support staff to the next location
within two days of the match result.
Security is another major task. The computer network will be used to
streamline security procedures developed with the aid of the US defence
department and the FBI. The system will track security clearances for more
than 50,000 people, including team players and 15,000 media representatives
from around the world.
There are special safeguards to prevent computer virus infections and
break-ins from computer hackers. This is done by creating 'fire walls',
explains Bill Alaoglu, director of technology for the organising body, World
Cup USA 1994. 'The system will not accept file transfers from outside the
system.'
Security badges will be issued at various sites connected to the computer
network. The accreditation system is based on Sybase's Gain Momentum
multimedia software from its subsidiary, Gain. 'We can feed video images of
each person through the network to issue photo ID badges,' says Frank
Strelau, director of product marketing at Sybase. 'Even if someone loses
their badge, they can get another one within minutes at any stadium site.'
Sybase's SQL Server database software will be used to deliver match results
and other news and background information to thousands of journalists. The
World Cup News Service will include a large database of historical
information about previous World Cup games, statistics on each team, team
member biographies and cultural information on each participating country.
All this information will be in both English and Spanish, with about 80 per
cent also available in French and German.
The historical database, based on the records kept by the Federation
Internationale de Football Association (Fifa), has also been useful to the
organisers, Koo says. 'Selecting referees can be a difficult matter since
the nationality of the referee and his experience are taken very seriously
by each team. With the World Cup database, we can quickly check the
qualifications of thousands of referees and which games they took part in.'
Sun workstations and Sybase software are also used to create multimedia
kiosks, connected to the computer network, in which users can access the
World Cup database through a touch screen. The original plans called for the
placement of the multimedia kiosks in public areas but they will now be
found only in VIP areas.
However, the World Cup will be accessible to travellers on the information
superhighway. The World Cup News Service can be reached by computer users
around the world with a subscription to the Fifa World Cup Bulletin Board
Service which can be accessed through the commercial online service
Compuserve. The action on the soccer field will be keyed into the network by
special observers, providing an online real-time commentary to each game.
US long distance carrier Sprint will handle the communications links for the
network. Working with local telephone carriers, it will install more than
1,000 telephones at each of the nine cities hosting the games. It will also
provide the data links connecting the nine stadium sites with EDS in Plano,
Texas, the World Cup USA '94 offices in Century City, California, and the
Fifa headquarters in Zurich.
'Each of the cities hosting the games has two data links,' explains Bill
Heuston, national account manager for the World Cup at Sprint. 'This way, we
can ensure that should one link fail, we have a back-up that will keep the
network running.'
The network is being managed by EDS, which specialises in setting up and
running computer systems for large corporations. EDS is also developing the
applications that run on the network and is co-ordinating the efforts of its
other technology partners.
The most important feature of the World Cup network is that it uses a
client/server model rather than terminals linked to a central mainframe. The
client/server model uses PCs and workstations connected to dozens of small
but powerful computers called servers. This gives the network remarkable
adaptability - allowing the organisers to quickly add and move hundreds of
workstations at a time from site to site.
Most of Alaoglu's technical expertise was gained in mainframes. 'With a
client/server approach, we have much more flexibility. With mainframes, I've
known it to take two weeks to bring in an extra terminal online,' he said.
Harold Bendic, EDS account manager for World Cup '94, says the network
performance is impressive. 'Because most of the processing is being done on
the server in true client/server fashion, we're getting sub-second response
times, even when we pull data from remote locations thousands of miles
away.'
The computer network has already undergone extensive testing when parts of
it were used for the US Cup competition last year. The last few software
applications are now being completed.
The technology employed by World Cup USA '94 has helped it not only to
achieve its stated goals in a short time, but also to earn the distinction
of becoming the world's fastest growing 'virtual corporation' with important
lessons to be found for other organisations.
While the organisation will disband after the final games, parts of the
computer network and equipment will survive, donated to the US Soccer
Federation to help promote soccer in the US. The applications and the
historical database will go to Fifa and the rest will be taken back by the
participating companies.
'The virtual corporation approach means that I don't have an actual plant
that I have to sell off. And I have outsourced all our computer and
telecommunications requirements to our technology partners,' Alaoglu
explains.
As US and worldwide attention begins to shift to the World Cup soccer finals
this summer, Sybase, Sun, EDS and Sprint hope that their efforts will create
a valuable technology showcase. But with the competition looming, few in the
US seem to know about it. Strelau, an Englishman, isn't concerned.
'Americans are very good at marketing. They'll get the message out.'

The Chartered Institute of Bankers has picked a foreign banker as president
for the first time in its 116-year history. Andreas Prindl, 54, an American
who lives in London and works for a Japanese bank, has taken over from Sir
Brian Pearse as president of the main professional body for Britain's
bankers.
Prindl (right), who has been a member of the institute since 1970, began his
banking career with New York's Morgan Guaranty Trust in 1964. After stints
in Europe and Tokyo, he was seconded as chief executive of Saudi
International Bank in London. In 1984 he joined Nomura International and two
years later helped found Nomura Bank International, of which he remains
chairman.
In the past the president's job has tended to be given to senior British
clearing bankers as a mark of recognition at the end of their banking
careers. As well as Sir Brian, who stepped down as Midland Bank's chief
executive earlier this year, the post has been held recently by people like
Sir Jeremy Morse, the ex-chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Sir John Quinton, the
former chairman of Barclays Bank.
Prindl, who has a doctorate in international economics, says that the
institute faces a number of challenges 'ranging from the acceptability and
validity of its qualifications, its international commitments and the
structure of its membership, to its relationships with other institutes in
the City'. As competition in the financial services industry has grown in
recent years it has been rumoured that the Institute of Bankers might merge
with other bodies such as the Insurance Institute or the Building Societies
Association.
Prindl is not the only foreign face at the institute. Gavin Shreeve, 47, who
was educated in South Africa, is taking over as secretary-general from Eric
Glover, who is retiring after 31 years with the institute. Shreeve is a
former editor of The Banker which is owned by the Financial Times.
John Melborn, 56, deputy chief executive of National Westminster Bank, has
been elected as deputy chairman of the institute, which means that on past
form he will take over as president after Prindl has served his turn. (See

<TEXT>
Fitch, one of the world's largest design consultancies famous for its shop
interiors, announced yesterday that its founder, Rodney Fitch, was resigning
as chairman and director of the company.
Martin Beck, group chief executive, who is based in the US, takes on the
additional role of chairman, while Jean-Francois Bentz becomes managing
director of the London office.
The announcement ends months of speculation in the trade press about Fitch's
departure from the company. It has been suggested that Fitch has had an
uneasy relationship with the firm's French partners.
The company - which has a December year-end, but has yet to announce its
preliminary results - was rescued in 1992 by a refinancing. It announced
interim pre-tax losses for the first half of the year of Pounds 381,000,
down from Pounds 1.8m the previous year.
It is believed that the company will soon announce the sale of its
headquarters, which were expensively refurbished but have slumped in value.

FT  20 MAY 94 / People: Baker and Harris leave Herring Baker Harris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Herring Baker Harris, a troubled surveying company, yesterday announced that
Michael Baker and Simon Harris, who founded part of the group, are leaving
the business.
'They feel they would like to go back to doing their own thing in their own
way,' said Jeremy Pratt, finance director.
Baker, 47, and Harris, 46, will remain directors until January 31 1995, but
they have already relinquished their executive responsibilities. They are in
discussions with the company about the enforcement of restrictions in their
contracts, which prevent them from setting up in competition within a year.
Baker and Harris became directors of the combined group in December 1991,
following the merger of Herring Son &amp; Daw with Baker Harris Saunders, a
company with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles and Denver.
The rationale of the merger was to increase Herring Son &amp; Daw's exposure to
agency work. However, the company encountered problems, particularly in its
US operations, and made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 430,000 for the year to
January 31.
'In our business the strengths of the group are greater and the interests
more important than those of any individual,' says Nick Owen, the chairman.
'The departure of Messrs Baker and Harris will not have an impact on our
core areas of activity in rating, agency and investment, where the client
base remains very strong throughout the group.'
Herring Baker Harris has no plans to change its name. The shares closed down
7p to 41p.

FT  20 MAY 94 / People: More changes at CountyGlen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There appears to be a game of musical chairs going on in the boardroom of
CountyGlen, the Dublin-based property investor.
Alan Sherry, the chairman who was appointed last September, has announced
the replacement of Richard King, the chief executive, by Niall Duggan, a
British-based Irish businessman, and has requested the resignation of
another director, Clayton Love. Love has refused to comply with the request
however, which Sherry said he 'very much regretted'.
Daniel Hardie, a Canadian stockbroker, quit as a director at the beginning
of this month, less than three months after joining the board. Hank
Vanderkam, a US lawyer, resigned from the board in April.
He had joined at the same time as King last September, after the largest
shareholding in the company - a 16.2 per cent stake owned by John Teeling, a
former chairman - was sold to a British Virgin island company Wyndham
Trading, beneficially owned by Sarah Buzze Sharpe, a US stockbroker, for
IPounds 500,000.
A High Court inspector was appointed in January, at the request of the
minister for enterprise and employment, to investigate whether CountyGlen's
own money was used to finance that transaction, in violation of company law
and which, if proven, might have been prejudicial to other shareholders.
Trading in CountyGlen shares was suspended on the Dublin stock exchange last
October 'until such time as the company has a business which satisfies the
requirements of the official list'.
Sharpe, who was appointed to the board in February, this week left the board
and sold her stake to Duggan for an undisclosed sum.
The inspector is to present an interim report of his investigation to the
Dublin High Court next month.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Property: Manchester's waterway finds a safe berth - The
outlook for the canal has been transformed by land development along its
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester Ship Canal, which Queen Victoria opened 100 years ago tomorrow,
symbolises the nature of economic regeneration in north-west England.
A decade ago, the canal terminated in Manchester's disused docklands. It was
still a profitable waterway - but only because of trade in its lower
reaches, where ships service the petrochemical industries of the Mersey
estuary, 30 miles away. The trade was mature, the prospects unexciting.
Today, however, prospects are as exciting as the canal was revolutionary in
1894. This is because the canal's future is linked, ironically, not to
water, but to land: specifically, a string of developable plots of land
along its banks. The Manchester Ship Canal company has been transformed into
a property company and absorbed by Peel Holdings, a quoted property group
chaired by Mr John Whittaker, who made his mark in the industry during the
heady 1980s.
MSC's transformation has been helped by two (now defunct) enterprise zones -
at Salford Quays and Trafford Park, with the canal and its dockland basin
dividing the two - but it took Mr Whittaker, who had no links with the
canal, to recognise the waterway's pot-ential.
He realised that MSC's true potential lay not in its (declining) waterway
but in its portfolio of developable land along the canal's banks. This
insight triggered one of the more bruising takeover battles of the 1980s as
Mr Whittaker, through one of his private family businesses, started buying
MSC shares in 1985.
Mr Whittaker was particularly impressed with 300 acres of canalside land at
Dumplington on the western fringe of Trafford Park, where a convergence of
motorways or trunk roads put about 7m people within 40 minutes' driving
distance. It was an ideal spot for an out-of-town shopping centre.
Unfortunately for him, Mr Nicholas Berry, another entrepreneur, had also
recognised MSC's land-owning potential. He bought a stake in the company in
1986 with a view to thwarting Mr Whittaker, whom he thought was getting MSC
too cheaply at Pounds 7 an ordinary share.
The result was a stand-off. Though Mr Whittaker obtained a majority of
shares and votes in 1987, Mr Berry retained enough of a minority holding to
impede Mr Whittaker's plans, as he needed 75 per cent shareholder approval
to exercise absolute control.
The dispute became a public wrangle over the potential value of MSC if the
proposed shopping centre were to be developed at Dumplington. The row
dragged on for years as plans for Dumplington became bogged down in public
inquiries; at the same time the burden of Peel's high borrowing and the
impact of recession combined to restrict Mr Whittaker's negotiating position
viz-a-viz Mr Berry.
The wrangle was finally resolved last year, with Mr Robert Hough, chairman
of the canal company, acting as peace broker. Peel was by then recovering
from recession and could afford Mr Berry's settlement price of Pounds 30 a
share.
The cessation of hostilities between Mr Whittaker and Mr Berry paved the way
for Peel - which by 1991 had absorbed the Whittaker family's MSC holdings -
to wholly subsume the canal company last year. MSC still exists as a
statutory company with navigation rights and drainage obligations, but it is
no longer listed on the stock exchange.
Prospects now look promising for Peel. A lack of good public transport to
the old Manchester docklands has inhibited lettings at Salford Quays, but
Manchester's 'supertram' will be extended there next year, making the city
centre only a 10 minute ride away. Peel will eventually contribute
substantially to extend 'supertram' through Trafford Park to Dumplington,
where the Trafford Centre, as the regional shopping complex will be known,
will be located.
The Trafford Centre is still awaiting the green light following argument
this week in the Court of Appeal, but Mr Hough says Peel, of which he is now
deputy chairman, is well-placed whatever happens.
'Peel has 15,000 acres of land, of which 6,000 acres came with the canal
(company). We are in it for the long term and can afford a measured approach
to speculative development by releasing land according to demand, timing it
with the economic cycle,' says Mr Hough. 'There can be nothing short term.
It has taken two recessions to transform Salford Quays and Trafford Park,
but you can see the result when you look out of our boardroom window,' he
adds.
The view from the boardroom - on the top floor of Quay West, a new
eight-storey building in Trafford Park - is evidence of the transformation
taking place. The building stands on the water's edge of what were once
Manchester's docks, facing northwards across the main basin to Salford
Quays, a few hundred yards away.
To the east lie the new office buildings of Exchange Quay, with the
Manchester city centre a mile or so beyond. Westward lies the canal.
The contrast with 12 years ago is striking: then Salford Quays were largely
empty but for a copse of disused cranes, and Trafford Park - Europe's first
industrial estate which grew on the back of the cheaper route to world
markets created by the canal - looked as though it might become overgrown
with weeds.
A decade ago, the basin, which Peel intends to open up to leisure craft by
driving a channel through to the nearby Bridgewater Canal, was choked with
the unsinkable plastic flotsam of urban dereliction: the wind would blow it
up against the canal's locks, where it festered and stank.
The transformation is still going on, with constant improvements to
infrastructure and a steady clearance and clean-up of the basin's edge and
canalside.
Moreover, there has been encouraging demand for office space. Mr Hough says
only 600,000 square feet of office space in the area are vacant, down from
1.5m sq ft at the bottom of the economic cycle in 1991.
'The market has turned; there is no doubt at all,' he says. 'This calendar
year we have seen a rise in interest. There is still an oversupply, but
take-up is much more apparent. Headline rents here are Pounds 10-Pounds 20
compared with more than Pounds 20 in Manchester city centre prime.
'It's the most active interest for three years. There are serious prospects
for every square foot of space available.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Management: China's treasure chest unlocked / Assessing the
potential for UK businesses hoping to strike gold on the streets of Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are no gold bars lying on the streets of Beijing,' according to
Imperial Chemical Industries chairman Sir Denys Henderson. But with 1.1bn
people in the provinces surrounding the Chinese capital, UK companies,
including ICI, are convinced there is treasure to be found.
'You come away from China with a sense of the enormousness of the place and
the vastness of the opportunity,' says Bryan Lodder, chief executive of
listed textile company Parkland group. 'But after a while, you also consider
the magnitude of the pitfalls.'
China's advantages - low cost manufacturing and an enormous population
starved of Western goods and technology - have long been well-known, but in
the early days there was limited scope to exploit this.
When Deng Xiaoping opened the door to China in 1979, it was merely ajar. The
only opportunity for foreign companies was to set up export-processing joint
ventures.
Times have now changed. China's determination to join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade has forced open its own market.
However, with factors such as the country's antiquated bureaucracy still
hampering the supply of the domestic market, the manufacturing joint venture
remains a popular way of proceeding.
According to John Beyer, director of China-British Trade Group, which
advises UK companies on activity in China, there are around 300 UK joint
venture companies in China, and the number is growing rapidly.
A joint venture takes much time and money, but it provides the significant
advantages of proximity to the market place, and the absence of duties, that
are essential for lower-margin or perishable goods. It also provides a
relationship with a partner that can potentially ease the bureaucratic
burdens, and even provide a client list.
According to Derek Welch, Far East Business Development manager at
Courtaulds, 'the key issues are trustworthiness and influence', when
choosing a joint venture partner. The partner's primary role is to provide
the land, the workers, and also the numerous chops (government stamps) that
are necessary for planning permission and licences. The overseas company
provides capital, technical expertise and machinery.
Most problems with joint ventures stem from either having a crooked partner,
or wanting different things from the relationship.
Understanding the business partner is important, but a company must also
clearly define its objectives and ensure these are fulfilled in the details
of any agreement. 'You need a lot of patience', says Welch. 'The Chinese
have a philosophy that if they wait long enough, they will get whatever they
want.'
For companies with sufficient capital, there are obvious advantages to
controlling the joint venture, and therefore its management.
United Biscuits owned 60 per cent of its first manufacturing joint venture,
but still had problems when its Hong Kong partner attempted to restrict
supplies of imported raw materials. It wanted to use local products to
fatten margins. Rather than risk compromising on quality, United Biscuits
had to buy out the partner's 30 per cent holding (10 per cent was held by
the township where it built its plant).
Western companies should at least find that potential partners are in
plentiful supply. According to William Whitely, director of valve
manufacturer Rotork: 'At the moment, you can't walk down the street without
someone trying to sell a joint venture manufacturing agreement to you.'
Chinese companies can reduce their tax bill by around two thirds by linking
up with a foreign company; they also want access to the technology. Over the
next few years, foreign companies will have an alternative route to
manufacturing in China, by buying one of many ailing state-owned industrial
companies. But Beyer suggests that at present this is only for pioneers.
For those companies seeking a substantial new export market, the choice is
between setting up a direct sales network or using an agent or local
partner. Setting up on one's own is more expensive, and fraught with the
difficulties inherent in penetrating an alien market.
'China took the basic decision 500 years ago to be an inward-looking
society. That whole mind-set is still in place, but agents should understand
that and work around it,' says Giles Chance, chairman of Chance China, a
consultancy and agency company.
For capital goods, where the British company may have a product that the
Chinese need, but cannot produce, the agent can provide access to the
complex decision making process.
But for those with a long-term perspective, direct access must be
preferable. Welch, of Courtaulds, says: 'If you sell through a Hong Kong
agent, you don't know where the product is going, and you therefore don't
know how to develop the market, because you don't have access to the
necessary information.'
Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare company, has started a network of
wholly-owned sales and marketing offices to help it build a presence in what
is the world's fifth largest healthcare market.
Allied Lyons has also progressed from an initial 40 per cent stake in a
Chinese winery, to build up eight wholly-owned sales and marketing offices,
with 300 Chinese-speaking staff. Joint venture production agreements are now
planned.
The number of businessmen on trade and investment missions to China is
testimony to China's growing appeal. Lodder, of Parkland, went to China with
the view that it should be only a long-term objective to start manufacturing
there. After ten days, he came back saying: 'I now think we should be there
within two to five years'.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Management: Technology demands a more balanced view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technology tends either to daunt top managers or to dazzle them. Outside the
confines of high-technology industries such as electronics,
telecommunications and pharmaceuticals, few US and European chairmen or
chief executives have a balanced grasp of what product or process technology
can do for their company - and where the limits are. As a result they tend
to veer between suspicion of technology and over-enthusiasm for it.
The problem is particularly acute in the US and Britain, where only a
handful of top managers outside high-tech industries have a technical
background. It is aggravated further in companies which have a passion for
one-off managerial 'flavours of the month'.
Such naifs lurch constantly and dangerously between the latest
one-dimensional 'best way' of revitalising their business, and the next one.
Total quality management is overtaken by customer service, which then gives
way to 're-engineering', and so on.
Until the early 1980s the general executive attitude to technology was one
of suspicion. Studies at that time showed that, even where a company had
appointed a 'chief technology officer' or 'technical director', he was
seldom ranked by the chief executive as a core part of his team. Research
also showed that most companies' corporate and technology strategies were
developed in isolation from each other.
The arrival of microelectronics, new materials and powerful information
technology appeared to change all that, even in relatively mundane
industries such as motor vehicles and food.
But more top managements were attracted to new process technology than to
products, in part because it seemed less risky. Consultants advised them
that the quickening pace of innovation around the world was making it harder
to sustain a competitive edge through new products alone.
The process mania drew many converts. As with any new religion, the most
extreme were in the US. Deere &amp; Co, the conservative tractor maker, became
almost as carried away by factory automation as General Electric and General
Motors, which made expensive investments in the field but then proceeded to
burn their fingers badly, both as makers and users.
After several years of travail, GE, GM and Deere saw the light and pulled
back, relegating automation technology to its rightful place as part of a
wide spectrum of instruments - most of which are human and organisational,
not technological - for improving quality, flexibility, productivity and
cost-effectiveness.
But GM's new-found technomania also led it up another garden path: the idea
that IT would affect its industry so radically that it needed to own a
computer services company. It chose fast-growing Electronic Data Systems
(EDS).
This week it emerged that GM is at last planning to sell EDS. It has
recognised what common sense could have told it a decade ago: it can only
revive its fortunes by focusing all its attention on becoming a better motor
company.
In less spectacular fashion, other companies saw the IT light several years
ago. In the mid-1980s they had been dazzled by its promise, giving IT tsars
big salaries, vast budgets, and a status in the corporate hierarchy which
often outranked all other types of technology executive. But within a few
years they ran into the now familiar corporate IT pattern of overspend and
under-performance.
Richard Heygate, a McKinsey director who specialises in IT, told a
conference last week that the failure of computer technology to deliver
'bottom line value' over the past 20 years has made top executives search
for almost any method of managing change that does not rely on technology.
Technomania has given way to the old technophobia again.
This lurch in attitude is blinding top executives to the much more flexible
and cost-effective ways in which IT systems are now being designed and
applied. It is also deterring them from using intelligent technology to
reconfigure the way in which they do business, thereby stealing a
considerable march on their rivals. Benetton did that in clothing and
retailing, as have various mail order houses. First Direct has followed suit
in UK banking, and Direct Line in insurance.
In some companies, IT's plunge from grace has harmed the perception of
technology as a whole. But in others the status of research and development
has risen, as top management has realised that its consultants were wrong to
downplay the importance of product innovation. R&amp;D spending has held up
surprisingly well in the US over the last few years. In Europe, some
companies now pay their R&amp;D chief as much as his finance colleague.
But these are in the minority. In a recent study of high R&amp;D spenders, PA
Consulting and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that the
chief technology officer (or equivalent) was a member of the top
strategy-setting team of almost every company in Japan, but of under 60 per
cent in Europe, and of just 20 per cent in the US. Only 34 per cent of US
chief executives, and 37 per cent of the Europeans, were highly involved in
developing the company's technology strategy, compared with 46 per cent in
Japan.
In other words, most western top managers still distrust technology, and
keep it at arm's length. It is high time they made more of an effort to
understand it, and put it on an equal
footing with marketing, finance, and all the other inter-linked essentials
of the modern business system.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Painful choices on disabled bill: Concern over the cost of
compliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday spelt out to the House of Commons the hard
economics which lie behind the political furore over the Civil Rights
(Disabled Persons) Bill.
Mr Major cited the official estimate of Pounds 17bn in non-recurring costs
(plus Pounds 1bn a year in subsequent costs) and the potential bill from
litigation as reasons for the government's opposition to the private
member's bill.
But are these cost figures realistic? The Confederation of British Industry
and the Institute of Directors, which have been lobbying effectively against
the bill, believe that they are. Disability lobbyists say they are not.
The institute argues that the bill is loosely drafted and does not properly
address the issue of who pays. It says that the cost of compliance could
close thousands of small businesses across the country, and even interfere
with the privatisation of British Rail (the government estimate of the costs
to the rail system is Pounds 2.85bn).
Mr Ira Chalphin, a re-searcher with the IoD, points to the dangers of
following the US experience.
He says that the Americans with Disabilities Act 1990 will turn out to be
the second most costly piece of business legislation to be enacted in the
country, after the Clean Air Act.
Both the CBI and the IoD stress that they are not opposed to
anti-discrimination legislation for the disabled, and accept that business
will have to bear some of the cost.
The CBI says, however, that this should happen through the 'normal
legislative channels' after full consultation with business.
The government has been encouraging business lobbyists to make public their
arguments and its own cost estimates. But the figure of Pounds 17bn is more
than double the true cost, according to Ms Victoria Scott, the disability
lobbyist and daughter of Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister responsible for the
disabled.
Dr Roger Berry, the Labour MP who introduced the bill, says the figure is
'absurd' and takes no account of the cost savings from employing more
disabled people.
Dr Berry, who has made no estimates of his own, says several government
departments have produced summaries of costs which include a large number of
'guesstimates' as well as being based on the recommendations being
introduced within five years.
Dr Berry said: 'The bill as amended says that the timescale would be subject
to the decisions of the secretary of state. So the government could control
the costs.'
The heaviest costs, according to the government estimate, would be incurred
by improving access to and within non-domestic buildings, including state
schools, shops and business premises.
Here the cost 'guesstimate' for the private sector alone is around Pounds
10bn.
The next heaviest bill falls on the transport industry, with changes to
land-based vehicles estimated to cost Pounds 5.5bn-Pounds 6.2bn. The
Department of Transport says that for a typical bus operator the proposed
changes would cost about Pounds 20m.
But the operators of rail services would face the heaviest cost burden.
While only 712 of the 2,796 trains on the heavy rail network remain
inaccessible to wheelchair users, the replacement costs for them would be
Pounds 2.85bn.
Changes to airlines are not included in the estimates but the department
says costs would vary greatly. One main schedule operator calculated
non-recurring costs of Pounds 2m while a charter operator suggested improved
access to 10 aircraft would cost around Pounds 16m.

<TEXT>
ANGLIAN
Anglian is in a solid position on waste-water efficiency, according to Ofwat
figures. Forecast range for K of between 1.5 and 2, which could still be a
tough target given capital expenditure requirements.
NORTHUMBRIAN
Heavy spending requirements leave this company in a combative mood,
particularly when it comes to Ian Byatt's assumptions on asset values.
Forecasts on K range from 2.5 to 2.9.
NORTH WEST
Does well out of Ofwat's methodology. Has the added perk of an agreed 7 per
cent rate of return on Pounds 360m of its Pounds 2.75bn in cap ex, from 1995
to 2000. The forecast range of K is from 2 to 2.6.
SEVERN TRENT
Severn has escaped the cost burden of coastal regulation but argues strongly
it must spend to maintain standards of discharging into inland waterways.
Cap expenditure estimated at Pounds 2.25bn to the year 2000, with estimates
for K ranging from a negative 2 to positive 0.3.
SOUTHERN
Southern's bias towards waste-water and its coastal exposure will encourage
a more generous K. Capital spending targets are estimated to have fallen
from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.1bn. K forecasts range from 2.5 to 4.55.
SOUTH WEST
Worth watching for capital spending reductions in this peninsular Tory
heartland. K forecasts range from 3.4 to 6.6.
THAMES
Unimpressive performance on efficiency could result in tougher targets.
Thames's capital spending is not estimated to rise significantly. The most
pessimistic are looking for a K of minus 1, while the optimists are going
for a positive 1.45.
WELSH
Most expect Welsh's strong balance sheet will give Ofwat more room to put
pressure on financial ratios such as debt to equity and interest cover.
Forecasts for K range from 0 to a negative 4.
WESSEX
Does well in the water-supply efficiency test. The group is making
significant strides in sludge disposal reducing its need to dump off-shore.
But there is still a substantial coastline to deal with. Forecasts for K
range from 1 to 1.6.
YORKSHIRE
The company's respectable performance on efficiency is expected to leave it
with an average target. The capital spending burden estimated at Pounds
1.75bn to the year 2000 is forecast to leave it with a K of 1.2 to 2.85.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Treasury panel puts growth at 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury's panel of independent forecasters yesterday painted a
relatively upbeat picture of the British economy during 1994 and 1995.
Economic growth and underlying inflation will each be just under 3 per cent
this year and next, according to the average of the forecasts published in
the panel's latest report. All panel members expect unemployment to continue
to fall, although at varying speeds.
The six members of the panel are Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute
of Economic and Social Research; Mr Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research;
Mr David Currie of the London Business School; Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman
Sachs International; Mr Wynne Godley of King's College, Cambridge; and Mr
Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Cardiff Business School.
The panel divided four to two on the question of cutting interest rates. The
majority - comprising Mr Britton, Mr Congdon, Mr Currie and Mr Davies - saw
'little reason to change interest rates from their present level'.
The four argued that 'a further cut now, unjustified by economic news, runs
the risk of sacrificing credibility in the financial markets and could again
result in a tightening, rather than a loosening, of monetary policy by an
adverse movement in long rates'.
The dissenters - Mr Minford and Mr Godley - argue for a substantial cut in
interest rates and Mr Minford is forecasting that such a reduction will
actually take place. He expects short-term rates to fall to 4.3 per cent by
the fourth quarter of this year.
Four of the panel are forecasting an increase in interest rates by the
fourth quarter of this year, albeit by only a quarter of a percentage point
to 5.5 per cent. In 1995, further increases in interest rates are expected.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Ministers to debate on disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers remain determined to block proposals outlawing discrimination
against the disabled amid signs that they could be debated in the Commons
today, James Blitz writes.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told MPs yesterday that the private
member's bill that became the subject of a row recently over government
wrecking tactics was 'unworkable in a number of areas'.
Mr Major told MPs that the government would instead proceed with its own
plans on rights for the disabled, offering proposals 'that genuinely will
work and will help disabled people'.
At question time in the Commons, Mr Major said that the bill, backed by a
Labour MP, 'would impose immense costs and it would open up enormous scope
for litigation'.
Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, may face renewed
difficulties over the bill today as Labour MPs attempt to bring it back to
the Commons.
Mr Scott has admitted that he inadvertently misled the House when he claimed
that his department had not helped backbenchers draw up wrecking amendments.
Friends of Mr Scott said yesterday that the minister would not bow to
pressure to resign. He insists that, although officials in his department
helped parliamentary counsel to draw up amendments, they did not directly
advise backbench Tory MPs.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Ofwat outlines flow of price increases: The water industry's
likely battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofwat, the water industry regulator, will today tell the 31 water and
sewerage companies in England and Wales how quickly it thinks water bills
should rise in the next 10 years.
During the next 10 weeks the water companies have a chance to respond to the
proposed K factors - the rate above inflation at which prices may rise.
The final K factors, which Ofwat will set at the end of July, will have more
implications for the industry's structure and investment than any policy
decision since privatisation in 1989.
The difficulty for Ofwat is that the companies have embarked on huge
investment programmes - which could reach a total of Pounds 40bn this decade
 -to compensate for years of under-investment and to comply with European
environmental directives.
However, public concern about water bills, which have been rising faster
than inflation to pay for the spending, has been growing.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, has been under pressure from
consumers and the government not to allow further high price increases. He
is clearly sympathetic to that concern.
As a result some expect Ofwat to issue K factors of up to 70 per cent less
than that requested by some companies.
The water companies, however, have been stressing that if Ks are set too
low, customers will still suffer. Although customers judge drinking-water
quality primarily on colour, taste and smell, such spending might be
sacrificed to pay for legal obligations, one water industry executive said.
The tussle between the industry and Ofwat will turn on the complex detail of
the calculations. Companies have made it clear that they disagree with the
regulator over some of its assumptions.
In particular they have clashed on the method of valuing companies' assets,
and on the rate of return companies should be allowed to earn on that
capital.
In their detailed submissions to Ofwat this year, setting out the Ks they
want, many companies will have used their own valuation principles.
'The factors (such as rate of return) the companies will have put into their
version of the models will certainly be higher (than Ofwat's),' said one
water executive. 'They will not want to give away the arguments on cost of
capital, for example.'
Mr Byatt has said that he is determined to avoid 'horse-trading', and the
next 10 weeks will allow companies to point out mistakes or oversights.
However, many in the industry assume that the eventual Ks could differ
greatly from the figures sent to companies today.
Some companies have taken a more aggressive approach. 'He has told us there
will not be any negotiation, so we have prepared our submission in terms of
what we can defend at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,' says one water
executive.
Analysts believe Ofwat's aim is to secure an overall industry K of between
zero and 2 percentage points. They argue that because the industry's capital
spending is concentrated on the 10 water and sewerage companies, these will
attract the highest Ks at the 'expense' of the smaller ones, which could see
negative Ks - that is, rises below the rate of inflation.
The smaller companies argue they deserve a higher cost of capital because of
the greater financial risk of being smaller. They say they face the same
legal obligations on drinking-water standards as the bigger companies and
the same criminal sanctions if they do not comply.
In the end, it is likely that some companies will be forced to go to the
commission. Most analysts point to Northumbrian Water as a certainty.
Northumbrian, with most of its population based on the coast or estuaries,
is particularly vulnerable to the urban waste-water directive, which demands
greater treatment of organic sewage previously simply filtered and dumped
offshore.
Northumbrian could face almost doubled capital expenditure of up to Pounds
200m a year during the next five years as a result. Yet it is unlikely to
achieve anywhere near the K of seven it was given in the first price review.
Most speculate that at least two other companies could end up at the
commission. South West Water and Southern, like Northumbrian, are heavily
exposed to the high costs of legislation on coastal clean-ups.
Any more approaches to the commission could seriously undermine Mr Byatt's
findings.
It is a balancing act. 'If everybody goes then Byatt will be seen to have
failed,' said one director. 'If nobody goes then he will be attacked for
being too generous.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / C&amp;G chief pledges action on cash bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Geoffrey Lister, chairman of the Building Society Association, said
yesterday that if the Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
building society was allowed to go ahead the association would immediately
press the government for a change in the law in time to affect any future
cash bids, Alison Smith writes.
Last month's Lloyds bid has led to intensified lobbying of the government by
societies who want to ensure that the Treasury review of the societies
legislation does not include allowing other organisations to approach
society members directly against the wishes of the board.
The bid has also raised the fear among building societies about the ability
to offer cash to society members of less than two years' standing, and
doubts about the effectiveness of drafting of legislation.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Societies urged to pay dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies were yesterday encouraged by their regulator to use their
surpluses to give dividends, better services and better prices to their
members.
Ms Rosalind Gilmore, who chairs the Building Societies Commission, said that
with the housing market recovering and provisions for bad and doubtful debts
falling, she could see no reason why societies should not narrow their
margins or reward members in other ways.
Addressing the Building Societies Association annual conference in
Birmingham, she also said the commission had bowed to opinion within the
sector on aspects of draft guidance on lending policy and on corporate
governance.
While she suggested that societies might need to develop better ideas about
how to be accountable to their members, in general her speech was a strong
endorsement of mutuality as a form of organis-ation.
Against the background of the impending publication later this month of the
first results from the Treasury's review of building society legislation,
she also underscored the government's commitment to mutual ownership.
In particular, she said the comment by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
that mutuality had a part to play in the financial sector of the 1990s,
although directed towards friendly societies, was equally true of building
societies.
Ms Gilmore said the capital strength of the sector had been built up in
difficult circumstances. In today's more favourable market conditions,
societies should consider other uses for their surpluses. Members'
preferences should drive what form the benefits took, she said.
Nineteen of the 20 largest societies for which 1993 results are available
recorded an average increase in pre-tax profits of just over 50 per cent
compared with 1992. Provisions fell by an average of 18 per cent.
Staff from building societies should be seconded to the Personal Investment
Authority to help protect private investors, Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman,
said yesterday.
His call came as he urged societies to take a full part in the development
of the authority, the new regulator, which is due to begin operating in
mid-July.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Retail sales reach record in April despite tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volume of retail sales reached record levels last month as consumers
took advantage of competitive pricing and carried on spending in spite of
the effect of tax increases.
April's seasonally adjusted retail sales were the highest since records
began in the 1950s.
The figures were 0.4 per cent higher than those for March and and 4.4 per
cent up on April last year, the Central Statistical Office announced
yesterday.
Sales values rose at a slower rate. The weekly value of retail sales was 2.8
per cent higher than last April.
The growth was seen in almost all sectors, showing the strength of this
underlying upward trend.
Food, non-food and mixed retailers all reported record volumes.
The strongest rise was in the food retailers sector. Sales were up 1.5 per
cent in the three months to April compared to the November-January figures.
Non-food retailers saw a more moderate rise of 0.7 per cent, but there was
divergence between sectors.
Some of the best results were recorded in areas with sharpest price
competition - suggesting that consumers remain highly price-sensitive.
Footwear and clothing, where price competition has been fierce, rose by 1.9
per cent in the three months to April, compared with the November-January
period - the highest growth of any sector.
Only the household goods sector saw a fall in volumes during April. Sales
were 0.9 per cent down on the previous month.
Some analysts suggested yesterday that this may point to a slightly slower
rate of house purchases.
This was disputed by the British Retail Consortium, which said that
furniture and carpets had performed well within the household goods sector
because of a more encouraging market.
Household goods were 0.5 per cent up on the previous three months and 5.8
per cent up on the same period a year ago - the highest yearly growth of any
sector.
This was a reflection of the volatile nature of the sectors.

FT  20 MAY 94 / C&amp;G case dominates behind-the-scenes talk: The Lloyds bid
has focused the attention of BSA delegates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The talks in the hall during the Building Societies Association conference
were about the housing market, the savings market, technology and
regulation. The talk in the bars and receptions, by contrast, was of next
week's court case in which the legality of the Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn cash bid
for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society will be tested.
On the platform, the few explicit references to the Lloyds bid consisted
almost entirely of the words 'sub judice'. But in a more coded form it lay
behind the vigorous defences of mutuality in some speeches.
The point most concerning societies if the bid clears the courts is the
ability to offer cash to society members of less than two years' standing.
The legislative intention to prevent speculative flows of retail deposits
seems to have been clear - the doubt is in the effectiveness of the
drafting.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, BSA chairman and chief executive of Bradford and
Bingley, told a press conference that if the deal was allowed to go ahead,
then the BSA would immediately press the government for a change in the law,
in time to affect any future cash bids.
Separately, Mr Andrew Long-hurst, C&amp;G chief executive, and Mr Brian Pitman,
Lloyds chief executive, who addressed the conference on 'creating
shareholder value', both expressed confidence in their legal advice.
More broadly, the Lloyds bid has led to intensified lobbying of the
government by societies who want to ensure that the Treasury review of the
societies legislation does not include allowing other organisations to
approach society members directly against the wishes of the board.
Societies are conscious that they face potential predators in a way they
have not previously done, even if they do not feel like an endangered
species.
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich building society, for
example, said that societies would have to give value to their members on a
continuing basis, in order to show the difference made by not having to pay
dividends to shareholders.
The BSA also took the opportunity to highlight some market research showing
that societies 'are perceived as more caring and customer-friendly than
either banks or insurance companies'.
Given the poor publicity that both the other classes of organisation
routinely attract, this is scarcely surprising. What seems more striking is
that this was the first piece of market research the BSA has ever
commissioned about attitudes to societies.
Apart from defining societies as the acceptable face of financial services,
it looked specifically at membership rights.
On one level, the results do bear out claims by societies that though mutual
they are sufficiently accountable, since almost two-thirds of customers were
aware they had membership rights, and about half could give an example of
one without being prompted.
At another level, however, they underline the strength of some of the
criticisms leveled at societies. Only 3 per cent said they had ever attended
an annual general meeting, only 17 per cent had ever exercised their right
to vote, and 42 per cent had never exercised any of their rights.
'It's a fiction to pretend that building society boards are not accountable
to their members,' Mr Lister said. If so, it is a fiction that appears to
have at least some basis in fact.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Output of cars shows 2.2% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK car production rose 2.2 per cent in April to 115,753 from 113,301 in the
corresponding month a year ago, according to figures released yesterday by
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Output in the first four months of the year was virtually unchanged at
478,289, an increase of only 0.1 per cent from the 477,822 cars produced in
the corresponding period last year.
Production by Nissan at its Sunderland plant was sharply lower and
production by Vauxhall and Ford also fell.
These declines were compensated by a strong rise in production by Rover and
the build-up of production from the new Toyota and Honda plants.
Jaguar and IBC Vehicles, the General Motors/Isuzu joint venture which
produces the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera, also increased output.
Production of commercial vehicles strengthened in April with a year-on-year
increase of 15 per cent to 17,535, while output in the first four months
rose 5 per cent to 77,892, albeit from a very low level.

compared with 1992. Provisions fell by an average of 18 per cent.
Ms Gilmore acknowledged the force of industry objections to aspects of the
proposed guidance on lending, and said that the proposal to set an
indicative limit of 20 per cent of a society's balance sheet for its
exposure to fixed rate lending would be dropped.
Instead, the commission is to discuss with each society its own limit for
fixed-rate lending, which will vary according to the sophistication of its
treasury operation.
The prudential note on corporate governance is expected to be published in
the summer, in a different form from the original version which caused
dismay among societies. Much of the advice will remain, but will be
incorporated into a code of 'best practice' rather than included in the note
itself. Prudential notes are binding on societies in a way that other forms
of guidance are not.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Life groups face compensation bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies could be forced to pay part of the costs of
compensating people who were wrongly advised by independent financial
advisers, even if the insurer did not employ the adviser directly, under
proposals from a City watchdog.
The Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulating body for
retail financial services, yesterday set out how its members should handle
claims for compensation for pension transfers from occupational pension
schemes sold by independent financial advisers.
Such advisers are often self-employed and have limited resources. It is
feared that many could be forced into default, leaving compensation to be
paid by others.
The proposal is likely to anger life insurers who, although they have
accepted pension-transfer business sold by independent financial advisers,
have said they are not liable because they do not employ or supervise
independent advisers directly.
The PIA said it proposed to 'ring-fence' liabilities from pension transfer
claims. In the event of default by an adviser, other independent advisers
under the same regulator would be required to help meet the bill up to a set
cap.
If the claims were larger than the cap, then life insurers who had accepted
business from independent advisers since the Financial Services Act took
effect in 1988 would be required to pay the balance.
The PIA also said it has addressed concerns about professional indemnity
insurance for advisers who found their cover suspended following revelations
of mis-selling of pension transfers.
It has convened a panel of insurers who will provide cover for those who
meet set standards. Those who cannot meet the standards can obtain insurance
through an 'assigned risk pool' where they can remain for up to 24 months,
ensuring that they are not immediately forced out of business.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Waste probe 'may be controversial'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A review of the disposal of radioactive waste will run in parallel with the
review of the nuclear power industry, the government said yesterday.
The 'separate but complementary' review will cover waste from hospitals and
research laboratories as well as from nuclear power stations.
Environmental pressure groups welcomed the review yesterday, but warned that
it could prove as controversial as the government's conclusions on the
future of nuclear power.
Environmental lobbying against nuclear plants has focused on the present
shortcomings of strategies for long-term disposal of waste.
Levels of radioactivity in nuclear waste take decades - or sometimes
thousands of years - to fall to levels not damaging to human beings. The
costs of handling and disposing of the waste safely are a large part of the
nuclear industry's financial liabilities.
The waste review, which will be run by the Department of the Environment,
will be the first wide-ranging examination of policy for a decade.
But it will not look at the suitability of specific sites for waste
disposal. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said yesterday these
questions were 'a matter for the planning and regulatory process'.
UK Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal company, which has been
given the task of finding a suitable site for storing waste, has been
investigating whether a chamber could be carved out of the rocks underneath
the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria.
The store would contain only low-level and intermediate-level waste.
Separate techniques would be needed for the highly radioactive fuel
extracted from reactor cores.
However, the government's Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee
has warned repeatedly that Nirex's investigations are falling behind its
original timetable. According to the committee, the need for further
geological tests means it is unlikely the repository will be ready before
2010, three years behind schedule, even if all concerns were adequately
answered.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday that the waste
review should have been carried out before the Thorp reprocessing plant at
Sellafield was allowed to start operating.
The plant, which will treat and separate used reactor fuel rods, will itself
eventually need decommissioning, and so will produce additional waste,
environmentalists have said. However, British Nuclear Fuels, Thorp's owner,
has argued that reprocessing waste makes storage easier because it separates
waste into its different constituents.
Greenpeace, the pressure group, said yesterday that the radioactive waste
review was one of the most important parts of the government's announcement.
'The nuclear industry is unable to deal with the waste it has already
created, let alone the waste it will create in the future,' it said.
The preliminary results of the investigation are due to be announced in the
summer and are likely to feed into the nuclear power review.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Date set for award of lottery licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The winner of the UK's National Lottery licence to run an operation that
will probably be the world's largest single lottery will be announced at
10am on Wednesday.
At 9.50am seven of the eight applicants will receive a fax informing them
that their bid has been unsuccessful. The eighth will get a press release
from Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the Office of the National Lottery,
due to be issued at 10am to the media and the Stock Exchange.
Mr Davis will then hold a press conference at the Institution of Civil
Engineers in Great George Street, Westminster.
At stake is the right to run a lottery that could be launched before the end
of this year and which many specialists believe could have revenues of
between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn a year.
It is not inconceivable that as much as Pounds 1bn a year could be raised
for five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the
national heritage and sport.
Mr Davis is the only person who knows the outcome of the highly complex
bidding process and has been in purdah for the past few months. The fact
that he alone has had access to all information on the bids has made the
lottery decision leak-proof so far.
However, two groups have emerged as firm favourites through a mixture of
hunch, judgment and gossip: Camelot, a consortium including Cadbury
Schweppes, De La Rue and G-Tech; and Lotco, Rank Organisation's in-house
bid.
The UK Lottery Foundation - a bid put together by Mr Richard Branson and
Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary - has emerged as the
bookmakers' favourite. But specialists are not so confident of its chances.
In the absence of hard information, few are prepared to rule out completely
bids from Games For Good Causes, which groups Ladbroke and MAI; The Great
British Lottery Company (Granada and Carlton Communications), or the
Rothschild Tattersalls Lottery Consortium.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Lobbyists deliver first-class service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a nationalised company it was without precedent. The Post Office
embarked on a lobbying campaign that was impressive by the standards of any
professional private consultancy.
In one year it persuaded enough Conservative backbenchers of the merits of
commercial freedom for the government yesterday to issue a green paper
widely expected to lead to the corporation's privatisation.
There are still about 12 Tory MPs opposed to the government's preferred
option of selling 51 per cent of Royal Mail and Parcelforce. But compared
with last year - when ministers estimated that about 50 of its MPs were
opposed to privatisation - it is quite a coup for the part-time lobbyists.
Mr Alan Williams, Post Office public relations director, spearheaded the
campaign. As the former head of the Department of Trade and Industry's
newsroom he knew his way around Westminster's corridors. He made a list of
MPs of all parties he wanted exposed to Mr Bill Cockburn, the corporation's
chief executive.
'We needed to mount an open lobbying campaign,' he said. 'There was always a
feeling that we should not do it because we were a nationalised industry.
But we felt the issue of commercial freedom was so important we had to do
it.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was informed of the
campaign, although his permission was not required.
Mr Cockburn always made clear to MPs that all he wanted from the government
was more commercial freedom. But as the campaign continued it was clear that
the 'only government show in town' was partial privatisation.
The Post Office chief then turned his attention to Tory backbenchers who
feared that rural post offices would close in the event of a sell-off. He
assured them that he was committed to the rural service.
Sir Donald Thompson, MP for Calder Valley, said he was 'greatly cheered' to
receive a letter from Mr Cockburn guaranteeing the rural network. Mr
Sebastian Coe, Falmouth and Camborne, said that after originally opposing
full-scale privatisation he was won over to the 51 per cent plan.
Mr Cockburn lunched and dined his way through meetings with more than 150
MPs, but was always careful not to be extravagant. 'We had to play it by the
book,' said Mr Williams. 'As a nationalised industry there is no point in us
asking for commercial freedom if we present people with a picture of free
living.'
It was never champagne, but usually beer and sandwiches. Where possible MPs
were asked to meet Mr Cockburn at the Post Office's headquarters in Old
Street, London. But if they wanted to be taken to a particular restaurant,
Mr Cockburn obliged.
'We were customer-friendly to the MPs,' said Mr Williams. 'We offered them
whatever was most convenient. Some of them had a particular favourite place
to meet for lunch while others just wanted to talk the issues through over a
cup of tea.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / The Review's aims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The future role of nuclear power in electricity supply will depend on it
proving competitive while maintaining rigorous standards of safety and
environmental protection.
The review will not consider whether Sizewell B should be brought on stream.
It will, however, take into account the decisions made on Sizewell B,
whether the consents are granted or refused.
The review will focus on the future prospects for nuclear power. It will
examine the economic and commercial viability of new nuclear stations
against the background of the government's energy policy. The government has
asked the nuclear generating industry to make the commercial case for new
nuclear generating capacity publicly available. Whether any new nuclear
station could be built with private-sector finance will be a key test of
that case. The government invites submissions from interested parties on
whether new nuclear power stations offer particular diversity, security of
supply and environmental benefits or disadvantages.
The review will examine options for introducing private-sector finance into
the nuclear industry. The government is prepared to consider representations
on whether privatisation would in principle be feasible, and what a
practical timescale might be.
The review will address the question of how best to manage the substantial
nuclear waste and decommissioning liabilities which are currently the
responsibility of the public sector, so as to secure value for money for the
taxpayer while ensuring necessary safety and environmental standards are
met.
The review will also assess the existing arrangements to enable the full
costs of nuclear power in the UK to be met. Submissions on these issues
should be made in writing to the DTI and the Scottish Office by September
30. All substantive submissions will be made publicly available, apart from
commercially confidential information, internal papers, advice and internal
reports, and advice from external advisers.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Nuclear power review given wider scope: The new terms
reflect persuasive lobbying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric yesterday finally won its year-long battle to persuade the
government that its privatisation should at least be considered.
But it could be many years before it and Scottish Nuclear are in the private
sector. Many observers believe they will remain state concerns for ever.
When the government promised in 1989 to hold a review this year, it was
assumed its main focus would be whether to lift the moratorium on building
new capacity. Privatisation of nuclear power stations had, after all, just
been withdrawn because the City said it would not buy them.
The wide-ranging terms of reference announced yesterday appear to put
privatisation back on the agenda, if only as a possibility later in the
decade. The government's decision to consider it is in part a recognition of
the extraordinary strides the industry has made in improving its efficiency.
It is also testimony to the persuasive lobbying of Nuclear Electric, which
wants to be free of ministerial interference and believes its only real
chance of adding to its 11 operating stations is to get money from the
private sector rather than a cash-strapped state.
The Treasury likes the sound of its arguments. But the Department of Trade
and Industry remembers the City's arguments of 1989: that the government
would have to underwrite future costs which could arise from regulatory
change and from decommissioning nuclear plants.
It is also acutely aware of the political damage which could be inflicted on
the government during a privatisation debate. Labour might be prepared to
reconsider its opposition to building new nuclear power stations later this
decade but it will remain implacably opposed to privatisation.
The stance of environmentalists will also play a part in government
thinking. Ms Bridget Woodman of the pressure group Greenpeace said yesterday
her organisation would not oppose a simple privatisation as that might be
the best way of ensuring that no more nuclear plants were built.
But privatisation of the nuclear generation industry would be anything but
simple, as Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, acknowledged yesterday when he
said privatisation this side of an election was extremely unlikely.
Few analysts believe that a privatisation of Nuclear Electric would be
possible without a significant restructuring.
Mr John Reynolds, analyst at James Capel, said yesterday the issue of
liabilities from the six operating Magnox stations would have to be
addressed, either by splitting them from the five advance gas cooled reactor
stations and the soon-to-be-commissioned pressurised water reactor, or by
agreeing fixed-price contracts with British Nuclear Fuels for reprocessing
their fuel.
'Privatisation is possible but it would take a major effort of government
will,' he said.
But if early privatisation is unlikely, what about Nuclear Electric's plans
to build a series of pressurised water reactors on the model provided by its
Sizewell B reactor in Suffolk? It has already applied for planning
permission to build another there.
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear are likely to argue that it cannot be
left to the market, and in this they will play the environmental card.
'The UK will need to invest in new nuclear stations to ensure security and
diversity of supply, and to meet its global environmental commitments,' Mr
Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Electric, said yesterday. He said
Sizewell C was the 'most cost-effective way of doing that'.
Such claims will be attacked during the review by rival generators such as
National Power and PowerGen, which are building stations capable of
producing electricity at about 2.7p per kilowatt hour at present gas prices.
Nuclear Electric says it can produce power at 2.9p per kilowatt hour and
that the costs of the raw material - uranium - are less volatile than gas.
Even that estimate makes what most people regard as extremely optimistic
assumptions on costs of capital and potential load factors.
More important, it is considerably higher than the price of electricity in
the wholesale trading pool where the average price has been capped at 2.4p
for the next two years. There is no guarantee that they will rise
significantly above that level later in the decade. Even some industry
executives accept that attracting investors to Sizewell C may therefore
require some kind of intervention by the government.
Although they are not specific, this could come in the form of underwriting
liabilities; extending the nuclear levy on consumers beyond its proposed
1998 termination, or guaranteeing a fixed proportion of the power market for
the nuclear industry.
The Tory government would have to swallow pretty hard to accept any of these
ideas, particularly when other energy sources appear to be in such plentiful
supply.
One possibility is that the government will conclude the review by telling
the industry to see if it can attract private-sector funds to build new
power stations, leaving a decision on the role the state should play until
later in the decade.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Sky steps up war against pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, which runs Sky Television, has switched to a new
subscription card in an attempt to beat the pirates selling unauthorised
cards.
The cards are used by subscribers to decode the satellite broadcaster's
scrambled signals.
Sky said yesterday that the new cards would 'put all existing pirates out of
action'.
There has been evidence of a growing number of pirate cards becoming
available in the UK.
A year's subscription to all BSkyB's services costs Pounds 240 but some
pirate cards have been offered for just Pounds 40.
Some pirates have promised customers that for a small additional fee they
will send updated cards every time a change is made by BSkyB - a consortium
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Sizewell reactor 'will enhance coastal views'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN and JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversial plans for a Pounds 3.5bn twin-reactor Sizewell C nuclear power
station in Suffolk have been backed by the Royal Fine Art Commission on
aesthetic grounds.
Three nuclear reactor domes on the nationally important Suffolk heritage
coast landscape would look better than one, the government-funded commission
has said in a letter to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, and
local authorities.
The dome of the single-reactor Sizewell B plant, nearing completion, and the
rectangular block of Sizewell A, an ageing Magnox plant, stand side-by-side
on the coast, designated by the government as an area of outstanding natural
beauty.
The Countryside Commission and the National Trust - which has a property at
Dunwich near Sizewell, from which the nuclear station can be seen - have
argued that Sizewell C would be an intrusion in the landscape.
But the Royal Fine Art Commission, which advises on architectural matters
affecting the visual environment, says that, in the flat landscape of
marshland and sand dunes, coastal views of the station would be enhanced by
the addition of two domes.
'One dome just looks like a sort of bump,' Lord St John of Fawsley, chairman
of the Royal Fine Art Commission, said yesterday. 'Because the area is very
flat with long coastal views, it needs something longer to go with it. We
came to the conclusion that with three domes it looked much better.'
Lord St John, a former Conservative cabinet minister, said the commission
was not in a position to comment on whether the plant was needed, or whether
it should be built. It was passing a judgment purely on the architectural
design.
The commission had also been greatly impressed by the proposed landscaping
programme, he said.
However, the commission had expressed reservations about the plant's planned
security fencing, again on aesthetic grounds.
It had also emphasised the need to remove any temporary sheds.
The commission, which is funded by the Department of National Heritage,
employs nine salaried staff and has 17 commissioners - many of them
architects.
It has rejected an invitation from Suffolk County Council to qualify its
view.
Ms Julie Craven, who chairs the council's environment committee, said
yesterday she believed that the commission was looking at the buildings in
isolation, rather than considering their position in the surrounding
landscape.
The Department of Trade and Industry is considering Nuclear Electric's
planning application for the Sizewell C plant.
Approval of the plan will also depend on the outcome of a public inquiry and
of the government's review of the nuclear industry, the timetables for which
have yet to be announced.
Suffolk County Council this week voted to object to the plans for the
Sizewell C plant, making a public inquiry inevitable.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is in Britain's long-term economic interest to be part of a single
European currency, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said last
night.
Mr Ashdown used a speech to the cross-party European Policy Forum in London
to outline his party's stance on a range of European issues, including
defence and economic integration, before next month's European elections.
On defence, Mr Ashdown called for British resources to be pooled with other
European Union member states.
He said a common EU defence policy would produce better value for money and
a more effective response to conflicts such as the one in Bosnia.
But he said this did not mean that British troops should be sent to battle
without the consent of the UK government.

submitted to the nuclear review, and argued that no companies should be
allowed to hide behind the defence of commercial confidentiality.
Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow energy spokesman, said the review should be a
proper assessment of the industry's future and not a first draft of its
privatisation prospectus.
Labour, he said, remained committed to retaining the nuclear industry in
public ownership as the best means of ensuring the highest standards of
safety and environment.
Greenpeace, the environmental group which opposes nuclear power, welcomed
the wide-ranging nature of the reviews. Ms Bridget Woodman said the
environment department's review of radioactive waste management would cause
significant problems for the nuclear industry, parts of which had opposed
such a thorough approach.
However, Nuclear Electric said the radioactive review would help it resolve
issues on safe storage which it had been pressing the government to address
for some time.
Nuclear Electric said privatisation was certainly possible given its
impressive improvements in commercial performance over the last four years.
Scottish Nuclear, which is less enthusiastic about immediate privatisation
than Nuclear Electric, was delighted the review would be wide-ranging. 'It
is an opportunity to put to rest once and for all some of the outstanding
issues such as waste and decommissioning liabilities and to consider the
financial structures of the companies,' said Mr James Hann, chairman.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority said it did not believe the reviews would
affect the proposed privatisation of its technology division.
The authority's decommissioning and waste management arm will stay in the
state sector. 'Our structure may provide a useful model for the review to
consider,' it said.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Sky steps up war against pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company which runs Sky
Television, has switched to a new subscription card in an attempt to beat
the growing threat from pirates selling unauthorised cards.
The cards are used by subscribers to decode the satellite broadcaster's
signals, which are scrambled for transmission. The cards were switched on
Wednesday.
For several weeks, in a multi-million-pound exercise, the satellite
broadcaster has been distributing new cards to the 3.3m homes that pay for
at least one of the its scrambled subscription services.
Sky said yesterday that the new cards would 'put all existing pirates out of
action'.
There has been evidence of a growing number of pirate cards becoming
available in the UK, many manufactured in Germany.
A year's subscription to all BSkyB's services costs Pounds 240 but some of
the pirate cards have been offered for as little as Pounds 40.
Some pirates have promised customers that for a small additional fee they
will send updated cards every time a signal or card software change is made
by BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has
a significant stake.
One observer said that the pirates were already trying to make replicas of
the new card.
An indication of the potential scale of the problem came recently when a
German computer student grew frustrated that he could not subscribe to Sky
to watch Star Trek.
He set out on an international computer bulletin board - potentially
available to thousands of computer enthusiasts - details of how to break the
old Sky code by linking up a PC to a television set.
The student wrote: 'I don't want to cause any harm to Sky and I even asked
them for a regular subscription some time ago, but they refused to sell one
to Germany. So they have to live with the consequences of attracting the
interest of high-tech freaks to the technical details of their access
system.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Jobs go at Swans as frigate departs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland, the latest ship to be built at Swan
Hunter, left the Tyne yesterday to a subdued farewell from a workforce
facing yet more job losses.
Among the Swans men on board, satisfaction at the completion of the latest
of more than 2,700 ships built by the company since 1862 was mixed with
anxiety.
The Pounds 150m Northumberland, fitted with the latest warfare and
communications equipment, may be the penultimate ship built in a region
which once produced two out of every five in the world.
Northumberland is the second of three frigates Swan Hunter was fitting out
when receivers Price Waterhouse were called in last May, after the company
failed to win a crucial Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier order.
Northumberland's departure triggers 237 lay-offs and 148 redundancies.
Today, most of Swans' remaining 1,050 employees - cut from 2,500 since
receivership - will learn who is to be laid off next weekend.
Their only hope of return, and of work at Swans beyond November for the 660
remaining to complete the last frigate, HMS Richmond, rests on the company's
tender to the MoD for the Sir Bedivere landing ship refit, to be awarded in
July.
Eighty Swans workers will carry out final machinery trials on Northumberland
as she sails to Devonport.
All those facing redundancy will be told on Thursday and leave the next day.
'Swans' future is in the hands of the same men it was 12 months ago. I think
they'll make the same decision,' said Mr Eddie Heron, a 32-year-old fitter
For Mr Tom Scott, shipbuilding manager for the three frigates, the next few
days on Northumberland will be difficult. He knows which men are to lose
their jobs.
'It's bloody heartbreaking,' he said. 'The sad thing is, our performance
since receivership has been exceptional.'
Northumberland's marine engineer officer, Commander Andrew Young, said he
felt for Swans' workers in their 'beleaguered position'.
'There's no two ways about it, they build superb ships. It comes down to the
individual in the workforce. He's highly skilled, he has trained
craftsmanship.'
Joint receiver Mr Ed James said selecting the 148 for redundancy had been
very difficult. 'You're down to your best people.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Drug sector asked for costs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is asking the pharmaceuticals industry to publish cost
comparisons of different medicines and other treatments such as operations.
This means that doctors can take economic factors into account when
prescribing.
The intention is to study the 'long-term cost consequences of treatments for
the same condition,' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said
yesterday.
Guidelines on how the work should be conducted are published this morning by
the health department.
'This is a voluntary approach,' said Mrs Bottomley. 'Drugs companies will do
the work, and there will be pressure from (drugs) purchasers and prescribers
for this information.'
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry was involved in the
joint working party with the government which drew up the guidelines.
Dr John Griffin, the ABPI's director, said the studies 'will offer NHS
purchasers and prescribers recognised high quality information about the
cost effectiveness of medicines'.
The initiative is in line with developments in some other countries.
In the US, such economic assessments have become part of the drug industry's
marketing armoury.
In Australia, drugs companies are required to submit an economic analysis to
healthcare regulators alongside the clinical trials results.
Mrs Bottomley said that no decision had yet been taken about whether today's
guidelines would eventually be policed by the Medicines Control Agency, as
is the case with clinical trials results.
The ABPI said it would be opposed to the introduction of such an economic
'hurdle' to the existing drugs regulatory processes.
The guidelines go further than the Australian rules by the possibility of
including the effect on wider society. Would, for example, spending on sick
pay be cut by the use of better - if costlier - medicines that helped
patients recover more quickly?
Mr Adrian Towse, director of the drugs-industry financed Office of Health
Economics, said that the guidelines would come into effect immediately.
Under the guidelines 'any doctor will be able to demand the full (economic)
study from a pharmaceuticals company making a claim about the
cost-effectiveness of one of its products,' he said.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Compaq to boost spending by Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq, the US computer company whose European sales recently overtook those
of International Business Machines, is to spend a further Pounds 10m
expanding its manufacturing plant at Erskine near Glasgow. This will create
300 jobs by the end of the year.
The decision follows the announcement in January of a Pounds 7m investment
involving 250 new jobs at Erskine.
The company will install five production lines for the assembly of printed
circuit boards, the basic component of a personal computer.
The first two lines will come into operation in July and the remainder by
the end of the year. The expansion will take the plant's workforce from 800
to 1,350.
The latest investment decision will give the Erskine plant greater
flexibility and make it more vertically integrated. It previously assembled
desktop and laptop personal computers, importing printed circuit boards from
Compaq's plants in Houston, Texas, and in Singapore, and from third-party
suppliers.
Compaq said yesterday that the convenience of having much of its printed
circuit board assembly in the Erskine plant would outweigh any price
advantage of importing from the Far East.
The market research company Dataquest said this week that Compaq's share of
the European personal computer market in the first quarter of this year was
11.8 per cent, compared with IBM's 11.0 per cent. This compares with the
first quarter of 1993 when IBM's share was 12.8 per cent and Compaq's 10.8
per cent.
The Erskine plant is about 20 miles from IBM's European personal computer
plant at Greenock.
Electronics was the fastest growing component of Scotland's manufacturing
output in the first quarter.

FT  20 MAY 94 / KIO wins go-ahead for fraud case against former directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A prima facie case exists that there was a conspiracy to defraud Grupo
Torras, the Spanish subsidiary of the Kuwaiti Investment Office, the
external investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, of about Dollars 500m, a
High Court judge ruled in London yesterday.
Mr Justice Mance also ruled that the KIO could use the UK courts to pursue a
civil action against former KIO and Grupo Torras directors to recover the
money.
In writs issued in April last year, the KIO claimed the money was
misappropriated from Grupo Torras and a London subsidiary, Torras Hostench
London.
The claims also allege breach of directors' duties and breaches of trust.
The 22 defendants in the action include Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the former
KIO chairman, Mr Richard Robinson, a former head of the KIO's direct
investment department, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the former KIO managing director,
and Mr Javier de la Rosa, the financier who managed the KIO's Spanish
investments until May 1992.
The allegations centre around four complex transactions involving Grupo
Torras and Torras Hostench that took place between 1988 and 1992.
In all cases, the KIO alleges the money disappeared into 'black holes' and
was paid to third parties.
Mr Justice Manse rejected claims by lawyers for some of the defendants that
there was no prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to defraud Grupo Torras.
'The payment and disappearance were in each case covered up by sham
documentation and transactions whose only intelligible purpose must have
been to hide from enquiring minds the payments and their disappearance,' the
judge told the court.
Some of the defendants had also claimed that the case should not be heard in
the UK because Spain was the appropriate country for such a civil action to
be heard. They claimed that the Spanish courts had exclusive jurisdiction
because the dispute concerned the decisions of parts of the Grupo Torras
organisation.
This argument was rejected by the judge.
The defendants are expected to seek leave to appeal. Even if an appeal is
not allowed, it is thought it will be at least a year before the case is
heard.
The new KIO management has claimed that all Dollars 5bn invested by Kuwait
in Grupo Torras since 1986 has been lost due to mismanagement by the former
management of the Spanish subsidiary.

A majority of British voters will use next month's European election to pass
judgment on the government's policies, a survey published by the European
Commission shows.
The survey found that 56 per cent of voters consider the European poll to be
an opportunity to express their verdict on the performance of Mr John Major
as prime minister, while 38 per cent will be casting their votes on the
basis of European issues. Less than half of those surveyed thought EU
membership was a 'good thing' and 23 per cent said it was positively bad.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, has refused to appear before a
Commons committee investigating whether sales of defence equipment to the
Malaysian government were linked to an offer of aid to build the Pergau dam.
Lady Thatcher, who approved the aid offer in 1988, told the foreign affairs
committee last night she did not feel able to break the convention 'that
prime ministers and former prime ministers do not give evidence to select
committees on specific issues'.
Her decision came as a surprise to MPs - there were indications earlier this
week that the former prime minister was considering making an appearance
before the inquiry.
Mr Denis Canavan, a Labour member of the committee, said yesterday the
former prime minister had 'chickened out'.

Sinn Fein
The British government says, in the Downing Street Declaration, 'that they
will uphold the democratic wishes of a greater number of the people of
Northern Ireland'. What is the British government's precise definition of 'a
greater number of the people of Northern Ireland' and how would this be
measured in practical terms?
Government
The wish of a greater number of the people of Northern Ireland would be
determined by a numerical majority of those validly voting in a poll fairly
and explicitly organised for this purpose. Provision for such a poll is made
in section 1 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Glitz in short supply at tunnel launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's most prestigious engineering project this century, built at a cost
of Pounds 10bn, began its commercial life on a distinctly unglamorous note.
Among the cargoes carried by the 14 trucks on the first Channel tunnel
shuttle to leave Folkestone, Kent, were washing powder for Italy, steel coil
for Switzerland and bulb trays for the Netherlands. Trucks on the returning
shuttle were loaded with glass and industrial bleach.
The reaction of French lorry drivers making their first trip through the
32-mile long tunnel would have been better if the hot meal they had been
promised had materialised. Dutch drivers re-routed from the longer, more
leisurely Rotterdam to Hull sea crossing, complained that they would miss
the disco.
Mr Roy Clementson, the first British driver to manoeuvre his truck on to the
800-metre open-sided freight shuttle, welcomed the speed and convenience of
the 35-minute crossing. It is 'just like being on the tube,' he said. Mr
Julien Heuze, among the first of the French drivers, agreed it was
'impressive and, unlike the ferries, not too crowded'.
Unlike car passengers, who will stay with their vehicles, lorry drivers
travel in a 'club car' similar to a standard railway carriage. Once the
catering arrangements have been sorted out, they will be served a free hot
meal at their seats.
If the drivers enjoyed the experience, Eurotunnel's long-suffering
shareholders and bankers will have been even more pleased that some revenues
were finally coming in, even if the first half-dozen shuttleloads yesterday
travelled free.
Eurotunnel is starting with a limited service of one shuttle an hour in each
direction, rising to two an hour next month, mainly for invited account
customers. In the first few weeks hauliers will not be charged the full
fare. In July Eurotunnel hopes to start a full price, turn-up-and-go
service.
Freight tariffs are negotiated individually depending on the volumes shipped
and the type of cargo. Mr Christian Zbylut, Eurotunnel freight director,
said individual tariffs were confidential, 'but you cannot assume we are
lower than the ferries. Some quotes will be more, some less.'
For hauliers shipping only the occasional load, a single fare for a 40-tonne
truck would be Pounds 390, higher than the Pounds 315 Stena Sealink said it
would charge on its ferries. However, one truck driver who turned up
yesterday negotiated a rate lower than the quoted Pounds 390. Eurotunnel
said it had signed commercial agreements with 1,200 freight hauliers
representing more than 85 per cent of the cross-Channel market.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Joker in the pack for Labour's contest / A look at the
impact union members not belonging to the party will have on the vote for
John Smith's successor - Leadership Contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
None of the postal workers questioned at London's Mount Pleasant sorting
office yesterday knew it, but they are about to have the chance of electing
the next leader of the Labour party. Their union - the Union of
Communication Workers - is affiliated to Labour and its members who pay the
political levy form part of the affiliated organisation section of the
electoral college that contains a third of the votes.
Only a few of the Mount Pleasant workers said they might vote if they
received a ballot paper from the union. Most were indifferent to the
suggestion. 'I doubt if one in 10 here will vote,' said one worker.
Another said he would vote but was not interested in actually joining the
Labour party. 'I like the idea of voting for the leader but I don't want to
get involved in party politics.' He added: 'I will back John Prescott. He's
a strong character. The Tories would blow Tony Blair away.'
It has been estimated there are up to 4.5m levy-payers in the 30 trade
unions affiliated to Labour who will be eligible to vote in the leadership
election. The overwhelming majority are manual workers. But private opinion
surveys carried out inside the unions suggest that while they may be
instinctively Labour supporters and even prepared to give money to the
party, they do not want to get involved in party activities.
'Our levy-payers are ordinary, decent people who think party political work
is done by eccentrics, extremists and the lonely,' said one union official.
Initially John Smith was sceptical as to whether it made sense to have such
a large input of votes into the leadership election, almost entirely from
people who did not belong to the Labour party.
But Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, convinced him last
year that it would provide Labour with a splendid opportunity to mobilise
sympathisers to actually join the party.
'Our election would be like a US Democratic party primary,' enthused the
converted Mr Smith.
The logistics of the levy-payers' vote have not yet been finalised but union
leaders estimate it could cost them as much as Pounds 1.35m. The unions are
already holding postal ballots of their entire memberships this year as
required by law to secure agreement for their political funds. This has to
be kept as a separate exercise, not the least because having a political
fund is not the same as being affiliated to the Labour party. With 21 unions
not affiliated to Labour, about 1m political-fund contributors will not be
involved in the leadership election.
Labour's head office wants next Wednesday's National Executive Committee
meeting to endorse guidelines for the leadership contest which encourage
trade unions to delegate administration of the election to Unity Trust
Bank's electoral services to ensure efficiency and minimise costs.
The 30 unions involved will send out ballot papers (mostly by post, although
workplace ballots are acceptable) to their levy-payers whose names and
addresses they have at head office. Each will receive two papers.
The first will ask whether he or she is a Labour party sympathiser. If the
answer is yes, they can then fill in the second ballot paper on who they
want to elect as party leader in order of preference. The completed ballot
papers would then be returned to Unity Trust and a computer will be
programmed to distribute them under the single transferable vote principle.
One union official said: 'This is not going to be an election dominated by
the trade union barons but by the media barons. The levy-payers are going to
be swayed by what they read in the Daily Mirror or The Sun or what they see
on television, not what John Edmonds or Bill Morris (TGWU general secretary)
suggests they should do.'
Some unions are hopeful that 25 per cent to 30 per cent of levy-payers will
vote, drawing confidence from the political fund ballots. Privately many
union activists say they want either Mr Prescott or Mr Gordon Brown as
leader but they admit the outcome will be uncertain under the levy-paying
vote.
One thing is certain. The election is going to cost the trade unions a great
deal of money without much of an obvious dividend.

FT  20 MAY 94 / EU ruling hits contracting-out programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's compulsory competitive tendering and market testing
programmes suffered a severe setback yesterday when the Court of Appeal
ruled that European employment protection rules covered the transfer of a
public-sector contract from one private contractor to another.
The decision swept away one of the last remaining doubts about the extent to
which the European Acquired Rights Directive applies to contracting-out of
services.
The Business Services Association, a public-sector contractors' lobby group,
described the decision as 'a devastating blow to the government's policies
of market testing and compulsory competitive tendering'.
The government has no official line on whether the directive applies to
contracting out. Its advice to contractors is to look at each case on its
merits and bid accordingly.
It is known to be anxious for contracting out to be excluded from the scope
of the directive and has been lobbying hard in Brussels for change.
The directive, which protects the jobs and conditions of employees when the
undertaking they work for changes hands, was translated into UK law by the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 - known
as Tupe. When Tupe applies, contractors must take on the existing workforce
on unchanged pay and conditions.
This makes it difficult for private contractors to undercut public-sector
costs.
Yesterday's ruling was welcomed by Unison, the public-service union, which
backed the appeal of 12 hospital cleaners who sued for unfair dismissal when
the contract for cleaning Orsett Hospital in Essex changed hands in 1991.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison's general secretary, said the ruling was 'a
significant step along the road of bringing our laws into line with
civilised European standards'.
Eight supervisors and 98 cleaners were made redundant by Initial Health Care
Services when the company's tender to renew its contract with Basildon and
Thurrock Health Authority was rejected in favour of Pall Mall Services.
Nearly all staff were engaged by Pall Mall, but on less favour-able terms
and conditions. The 12 who sued claimed the two companies had failed to give
effect to Tupe.
Their case was rejected by an industrial tribunal on the grounds that there
was no transfer of an undertaking within the meaning of Tupe. That decision
was upheld by the Employment Appeal Tribunal last August.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Delay over start of race 'doomed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Labour politicians conceded yesterday that the shadow cabinet's
demand for a three-week moratorium on campaigning for the party leadership
is bound to fail.
Covert campaigning lapsed yesterday as MPs prepared for the funeral of John
Smith, the former leader, in Edinburgh today, which will be followed by
burial on Iona tomorrow.
But campaigning is expected to begin in earnest on Sunday, in spite of the
shadow cabinet's decision on Wednesday to ban electioneering until after the
June 9 European elections.
Shadow ministers said the moratorium was imposed because of fears that the
party's European effort would be distorted by demands for equal media
exposure
One senior shadow minister said the 'technical' ruling was intended to stop
candidates filing formal nomination papers until after the June 9 poll. That
would prevent squabbling about issues such as appearances at press
conferences and on radio and television programmes, he said.
Some shadow ministers said there would be 'an almighty row' if leadership
candidates spoke on issues outside their shadow cabinet portfolios.
Other MPs said the ruling would act as a challenge to candidates to find
coded ways of setting out their political philosophy.
The first test will come on Sunday when Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor,
addresses the Welsh Labour conference. Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader,
is also expected to give a television interview on the same day.
There is growing desire for a wide range of candidates rather than a
straight choice between two candidates from the modernist and traditionalist
wings.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Government treads fine line on Sinn Fein queries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early reaction to last night's government comments on Sinn Fein's questions
suggested that London had successfully trodden the fine line between
responding to genuine republican queries on the Downing Street Declaration
and not being lured into arm's-length negotiations.
The only jarring note in a chorus of positive or neutral remarks came from
the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, which
has put opposition to the declaration at the heart of its European election
campaign.
Mr Paisley accused the government of being 'in cahoots with Dublin while
Dublin is in cahoots with the murderers'. He was sick of the 'lying
duplicity' and arrogance of the government which had taken time to write a
20-page 'love letter' to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president.
But Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, was much more
positive, saying it was 'a very good thing that the government refuted and
rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr Adams's paper.'
He added: 'If that not been done it would have given encouragement to
republican terrorists and would have made the law-abiding people of Northern
Ireland uneasy. Now it has all been cleared up.'
There was 'no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and there is no
need for any further clarification,' Mr Molyneaux said. But he predicted Mr
Adams would 'go on rabbiting on until he devalues that device just as he has
devalued the phoney ceasefire.'
Mr David Trimble, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, called for political talks on
the province's future to resume as soon as possible. 'There is going to be
no change in government policy,' he said. 'There is nothing new in it.'
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, said the government was 'right to answer so
straightforwardly, comprehensively and honestly'.
He added: 'It was not a fudge nor was it a brush-off. The ball is very
firmly in the court of Sinn Fein. A line is drawn in the sand. The reality
is that they must make up their minds.'
Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'Sinn Fein
can no longer use clarification as an excuse to prolong their support for
and justification of the use of violence for political ends.'
'Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter political
negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on the basis of Irish
self-determination as specified in the Downing Street Declaration.'
Lord Holme, Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, called on Sinn Fein
to call an immediate end to violence and said the IRA's support deserved to
'dwindle even further if they procrastinate another day'.
In addition to answering one of the questions directly (see left), the
government spelt out a number of points more clearly than it has before.
First, it stated categorically that 'acceptance of the joint declaration is
not a precondition for entering the talks process.' Downing Street had edged
towards clarifying this point earlier in the week, saying an end to the
IRA's armed campaign was the 'primordial' requirement for Sinn Fein to enter
political talks.
Second, it emphasised that 'no political objective could properly be
excluded from discussion in the talks process.'
Third, it said that 'a lasting and general peace would render military
operations in support of the police no longer necessary'.
Whether the exercise is judged ultimately to be a success now depends on the
republican response. If it did decide to throw down its arms, the IRA would
face the difficult task of explaining why it had pressed on with its
campaign over the five months since December for the sake of one direct
clarification and a few supplementary comments.
London last night appeared to recognise this when it said there was 'no
conceivable justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least
of all a call for a textual explanation of the joint declaration'.
But Sinn Fein's guarded initial reaction suggested it at least welcomed
London's decision to take genuine queries over the joint declaration's
meaning seriously.
The ball is back in their court.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Loophole in BCCI case disallowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least 250 depositors to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International who exploited a legal loophole in efforts to gain additional
compensation yesterday had their case overturned in the House of Lords.
By a ruling of five to nil, the Law Lords ruled in favour of the Deposit
Protection Board in its efforts to withhold Pounds 3.7m in payments it
believed to be outside rules of the scheme.
The deposit protection scheme, which is administered by the board and
underwritten by all the British banks, pays three-quarters of the sterling
deposits in any collapsed UK bank to depositors, regardless of where they
live, up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000.
However, in the days after the closure of BCCI on July 5 1991, a number of
depositors attempted to gain more than this total by 'assigning' their
deposits in excess of Pounds 20,000 to family and friends.
Under an apparent loophole in the 1987 Banking Act, which established the
deposit protection scheme, this allowed each of the assignees to deposit
compensation of up to Pounds 15,000.
Pearlman, Kahan &amp; Joseph, a firm of chartered accountants based in north
London, wrote to depositors to encourage them to exploit the law.
The board has refused to pay the money assigned in this way to others,
although it lost its case in the High Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Bank of England moved swiftly to amend the act with a statutory
instrument that outlawed the principle of assigning claims from early August
1991. But the law could not apply retrospectively for the few weeks since
the closure of BCCI.
Total payments under the scheme in connection with BCCI are about Pounds 65m
to more than 17,000 depositors. The bank's liquidators estimate there may
also be a final dividend of 30p-40p in the pound.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Major adamant on disabled bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers remain determined to block legislation outlawing discrimination
against the disabled amid signs that it could be debated in the Commons
today.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told MPs yesterday that the private
member's bill that became the subject of a row recently over government
wrecking tactics was 'unworkable in a number of areas'.
Mr Major told MPs that the government would instead proceed with its own
plans on rights for the disabled, offering proposals 'that genuinely will
work and will help disabled people'.
At question time in the Commons, Mr Major said that the bill, backed by a
Labour MP, 'would impose immense costs and it would open up enormous scope
for litigation'.
But Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, may face renewed
difficulties over the bill today as backbench Labour MPs attempt to bring it
back to the Commons.
Mr Scott recently admitted that he had inadvertently misled the House when
he claimed that his department had not helped backbenchers draw up wrecking
amendments.
Friends of Mr Scott said yesterday that the minister would not bow to
pressure to resign. He insists that, although officials in his department
helped parliamentary counsel to draw up amendments, they did not directly
advise backbench Tory MPs.
It is understood that a number of disabled groups are supporting Mr Scott,
in the belief that he is one of the few government ministers who backs the
introduction of rights for the disabled.

The Department of the Environment has given planning permission for the
development of a Channel tunnel freight terminal, manufacturing and
distribution park at Hams Hall, east of Birmingham, in the green belt of
north Warwickshire, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The site is near Junction 9 of the M6 and the proposed junction of the
planned toll motorway around north Birmingham with the M6. The government
delayed approval until it was satisfied about the traffic impact on local
roads.
Trafalgar House, the shipping, property and construction group, is a partner
in the development of both the freight terminal and the new motorway.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Arms tenders save MoD Pounds 1bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence has probably saved more than Pounds 1bn a year from
its annual Pounds 10bn equipment budget through competitive tendering, a
National Audit Office report published yesterday says.
The report adds that the greater use of competitions for contracts, and
increasing the risks borne by contractors, have been the critical factors in
gaining better value for money from weapons procurement.
As a result Britain's arms industry has become more competitive, helping it
to win export orders worth more than Pounds 6bn in 1993.
But the report questions some aspects of MoD policy. Collaborative
development with other nations may mean lower costs than if each country
pursued a weapon design on its own, but there are cost penalties because
work is duplicated. Rationalising production of the Eurofighter could save
Pounds 625m on the UK's projected order of 250 aircraft - some Pounds 2.5m
per plane.
Constant changes of specification are also a problem, costing Pounds 112m on
important projects in 1992-93. One project had 193 changes of specification
at a cost of Pounds 9.3m - 20 per cent of the total project costs.
The report recognises that there are costs associated with encouraging
competition. Some 13,000 competitive contracts have been run by the MoD,
attracting an average of 6.4 tenders each. The audit office suggests that
companies will attempt to recover the costs of unsuccessful tenders through
other business.
Britain's defence industry is seen to have been squeezed since the end of
the cold war. The audit office estimates that the industry's workforce has
fallen from 625,000 in 1985 to 500,000 now.
Of 30 large defence contractors surveyed by the European Commission, 27 saw
a threat to their future profitability.
The arms industry needs government guidance if it is to focus its capital
investment and research and development programmes effectively, the audit
office says, noting that efforts have been made to improve communication
between government and industry.
The report applauds the transfer of risks to industry, but suggests that the
MoD could also refine those passed on to contractors by not insisting on
fixed prices for some very long-term projects, avoiding the expense of
insuring companies against inflation risks which may be overestimated.
The 'formidable force' of the Russian air force must remain the yardstick
against which the RAF and allied air forces are measured, the cross-party
Commons defence committee said yesterday.
'We cannot conceive that further cuts would be acceptable in an RAF
strike/attack force of fewer than 100 frontline aircraft,' the MPs said.
Following the Options for Change defence review, the Tornado force is 104
aircraft.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Cost scare spikes reformers' guns: The economics of civil
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday spelt out to the House of Commons the hard
economics which lie behind the political furore over the Civil Rights
(Disabled Persons) Bill.
Mr Major cited the official estimate of Pounds 17bn in non-recurring costs
(plus Pounds 1bn a year in subsequent costs) and the potential bill from
litigation as reasons for the government's opposition to the private
member's bill.
But are these cost figures realistic? The Confederation of British Industry
and the Institute of Directors, which have been lobbying effectively against
the bill, believe that they are. Disability lobbyists say they are not.
The IoD argues that the bill is loosely drafted and does not properly
address the issue of who pays. It says that the cost of compliance could
close thousands of small businesses across the country, and even interfere
with the privatisation of British Rail (the government estimate of the costs
to the rail system is Pounds 2.85bn).
Mr Ira Chalphin, a re-searcher with the IoD, points to the dangers of
following the US experience. He says that the Americans with Disabilities
Act 1990 will turn out to be the second most costly piece of business
legislation to be enacted in the country, after the Clean Air Act.
Both the CBI and the IoD stress that they are not opposed to
anti-discrimination legislation for the disabled, and accept that business
will have to bear some of the cost. The CBI says, however, that this should
happen through the 'normal legislative channels' after full consultation
with business.
The government has been encouraging business lobbyists to make public their
arguments and its own cost estimates. But the figure of Pounds 17bn is more
than double the true cost, according to Ms Victoria Scott, the disability
lobbyist and daughter of Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister responsible for the
disabled.
Dr Roger Berry, the Labour MP who introduced the bill, says the figure is
'absurd' and takes no account of the cost savings from employing more
disabled people.
Dr Berry, who has made no estimates of his own, says several government
departments have produced summaries of costs which include a large number of
'guesstimates' as well as being based on the recommendations being
introduced within five years.
Dr Berry says: 'The bill as amended says that the timescale would be subject
to the decisions of the secretary of state. So the government could control
the costs.'
The heaviest costs, according to the government estimate, would be incurred
by improving access to and within non-domestic buildings, including state
schools, shops and business premises. Here the cost 'guesstimate' for the
private sector alone is around Pounds 10bn.
The next heaviest bill falls on the transport industry, with changes to
land-based vehicles estimated to cost Pounds 5.5bn-Pounds 6.2bn. The
Department of Transport says that for a typical bus operator the proposed
changes would cost about Pounds 20m.
But the operators of rail services would face the heaviest cost burden.
While only 712 of the 2,796 trains on the heavy rail network remain
inaccessible to wheelchair users, the replacement costs for them would be
Pounds 2.85bn.
Changes to airlines are not included in the estimates but the department
says costs would vary greatly.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Aviation talks resume despite US
opposition
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade about a new
multilateral trade accord, governing civil aircraft, were resumed yesterday
despite opposition from the US and Canada.
Deep divisions remain between the US, which wants to limit the scope of any
new aircraft agreement, and the European Union, which is pressing for a
wide-ranging accord to discipline state supports.
The talks, originally designed to extend the 1992 bilateral deal between the
US and EU on state subsidies to the European Airbus, broke down last
December.
Just before the end of the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations, the
US rejected a chairman's draft accepted by the other 20 or so governments
taking part in the aircraft talks.
The draft agreement, a revision of Gatt's existing civil aircraft code,
would have tightened controls on subsidies for all types of civil aircraft
and components, including subsidies via space and military contracts of the
type used by Washington. This has met vigorous opposition from the US
industry, especially engine manufacturers.
It was agreed in December that talks would resume, with a view to conclude
an accord by the end of this year. However, the US now argues that changes
should be confined to uncontentious amendments needed to bring the Gatt code
into line with other Uruguay Round agreements, such as that on dispute
settlement.
US officials said yesterday that the subsidies accord agreed to in the
Uruguay Round, and due to take effect next year, should be allowed to
operate before any decision to make specific subsidy provisions in the civil
aircraft code.
The EU argues that the subsidies agreement is inadequate and wants specific
provisions in the aircraft code, partly to put stricter controls on US
support for aircraft development, and partly to discipline aid by other
governments to their aircraft industries.

Nearly three years after the entry into force of the fourth Lome Convention
between the European Union and almost 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has still not decided
whether the pact is consistent with international fair trade rules, writes
Frances Williams in Geneva.
A Gatt working party set up last year to examine Lome IV has been unable
even to agree to disagree on the issue. The EU and ACP nations are refusing
to brook any hint of criticism in the report, fearing that this could lead
to a direct challenge to Lome under Gatt's disputes settlement system.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Reluctant US leans to China - Clinton
ponders sanctions to show concern on human rights

<TEXT>
The process has been something of a fiasco, but in the next week or so
President Bill Clinton is expected to announce he has decided to renew
China's continued privileged trade access to the US market.
Mr Clinton will not evince much enthusiasm for extending China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status.
This is because he knows Beijing has hardly fulfilled conditions laid down
in his executive order of May last year for 'overall, significant
improvement' in its human rights behaviour.
The vexed question for the administration is what conditions it might attach
to MFN renewal this year to assuage likely criticism of US capitulation to
China, or whether it should attach conditions at all.
Among the options are restrictions on US imports of items made by the
People's Liberation Army, including assault weapons, or, more broadly,
selective bans on goods made by Chinese state enterprises.
While sanctions against the PLA may have some appeal politically in the US,
such a step would not inflict much harm on the overall trading relationship,
beyond antagonising an influential element of the Chinese heirarchy.
PLA-made exports to the US total about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) out of
Chinese exports amounting to more than Dollars 30bn.
The bulk of these PLA items are civilian products such as textiles and toys
and would therefore be difficult to distinguish from run-of-the-mill Chinese
exports.
The administration would also face immense difficulties applying selective
sanctions against state enterprises.
Not least of the problems would be arriving at a suitable classification for
such enterprises, since many are in the process of being transformed into
corporations, stock-holding companies and joint ventures.
Mr Clinton and his advisers, principally Mr Warren Christopher, the
secretary of state, have no easy choices in arriving at a face-saving
formula for MFN renewal that would on the one hand penalise Chinese human
rights misbehaviour and on the other avoid actions jeopardising US business
prospects.
Judging by Mr Clinton's public statements recently, he is leaning towards
renewal. He said earlier this month that withdrawal of MFN would harm both
China and the US.
The administration's fumbling performance on the MFN issue contrasts sharply
with Chinese self-confidence. China has yielded little to US concerns about
human rights in spite of Mr Christopher's attempts to put a favourable gloss
on developments.
While there may have been progress on issues like an end to the Chinese
export of prison-made goods and access to jails for the International
Committee of the Red Cross, Beijing has shown little restraint in pursuit of
dissidents.
Human Rights Watch/Asia reported this week the number detained after the
1989 Tiananmen Square killings was much greater than hitherto recorded. It
also reported widespread torture of political detainees.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: UK minister prepares Cuba mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first visit by a British government minister to Cuba since at least the
1970s is being planned for later this year, reflecting a warming of
relations between the UK and the government of President Fidel Castro.
The visit by Mr Patrick McLoughlin, parliamentary under-secretary of state
for trade and technology, is likely to go ahead in September.
It is a reflection of growing interest among British companies over
investment prospects in Cuba, a small market but one from which US companies
are excluded by the US embargo. It also indicates a Foreign Office
perception that the Castro government is not about to collapse, despite the
deep economic problems which the country has faced since the fall of the
Soviet Union.
A group of deputies from Cuba's National Assembly is also to visit the UK
next week. They are led by Mr Ricardo Alarcon, president of the assembly and
often described as Mr Castro's deputy, who will meet foreign office minister
David Heathcoat-Amory.
Mr McLoughlin, who may be accompanied by British businessmen, will aim, says
the Department of Trade and Industry, 'to develop trade and investment
opportunities' and may also sign an investment promotion and protection
agreement currently under negotiation. The US government has been informed
of the visit.
A number of unofficial British trade missions have already visited Cuba
under the auspices of the Caribbean Trade Advisory Group. Mr David Jessop,
Caritag director, said that 'a number of agreements are in the last stages
of negotiation' between British companies and the Cuban government.
He declined to be specific, although at least one investment ran into tens
of millions of pounds sterling. Some companies were trying to incorporate
debt owed to them by Cuba into their agreements, and there was a possibility
of debt-equity swaps being used.

<TEXT>
Johnson Matthey, the UK-based precious metals technology group, has tackled
two key elements of its corporate strategy in a deal with Mitsubishi Kasei,
the Japanese chemical company, writes Kenneth Gooding, mining correspondent,
in London.
They are to set up a joint venture to supply sputtering targets to the
Japanese semiconductor industry.
Mr David Davies, JM's chairman, said yesterday the deal would enable JM
immediately to have profitable operations in Japan while at the same time
expanding its Electronic Materials business to become worldwide market
leader in sputtering targets.
Sputtering targets are made of very high purity metal - aluminium or
titanium - and used to deposit a thin film on semiconductor chips and
computer processors. The market is conservatively forecast by JM to grow
from Dollars 170m in 1992 to Dollars 200m by 1995 because the semiconductors
are used in the fast-growing personal computer and portable telephone
markets.
The partners will merge their existing Japanese operations into the new
joint company, Ryoka Matthey, which will continue to manufacture at a plant
in Noetsu. Ryoka Matthey is expected to employ 50, have sales of Dollars 18m
and net assets of about Dollars 15m.

<TEXT>
Negotiations on Taiwan's application to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade are making slower progress than expected, virtually ruling
out the possibility of membership by the end of the year, writes Frances
Williams in Geneva. Talks in Geneva, which ended yesterday, failed to start
drafting detailed entry terms. No date has been set for the next meeting.
Taiwan's Gatt application was accepted in September 1992 on the
understanding that China would join first (even if only just before).
However, negotiations with China are also proceeding at a more sedate pace
than the Beijing government would like.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director general, on a visit to Beijing last
week, said it would be 'extremely difficult' for China to join Gatt this
year. Negotiations are due to resume next month, after the decision by the
US on the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Ex-colony preferences set to be wound down
 -A review of the aid and trade treaty between the EU and African, Caribbean
and Pacific countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As ministers from European Union governments and the African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) group meet in Swaziland today to review the Lome Convention,
they could be writing the first words of its epitaph. There is tacit
agreement on both sides that the trade and aid treaty, in its present form,
will be the last of its kind.
There is disagreement, however, on the nature and extent of changes to the
treaty, which expires at the end of the decade.
The Lome Convention was once hailed as a model for trade treaties: it was
negotiated, rather than being imposed by one side; and it was generous in
the opportunities it offered the ACP countries.
Its mid-term review comes at a time of increasing globalisation of world
trade. The EU says it wants changes to the treaty that fit in with the
redefined principles and patterns of commerce set out in the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But ACP countries believe the
Lome Convention is not yet anachronistic and that some of the proposed
amendments are too radical.
ACP officials admit that for many of their economies, disengaging from Lome
in its present form would be painful. With the deregulation of international
trade, and with changes in the patterns of private investment flows and
official aid, guaranteed markets for commodity exports and development
finance through the treaty are invaluable.
While most agree that the crutch offered by preferences will go, they differ
on the timing. Economies are weaned on trade preferences ostensibly to
enable them to stand on their own. But senior officials at the European
Commission say the longer preferences are in place the less able recipients
are to stand unaided. And they argue that some countries have done better
without preferential treatment at all.
The EU wants to move away from considerations of special relationships based
on colonial ties to a less emotional foundation for trade. The 'real needs'
of developing countries are more important than their history, the EU
argues. Most ACP governments agree, but they do not fully accept the EU's
interpretation of the measures needed to meet those needs.
The EU also wants changes in the management of its development funds to
reduce delay, waste and corruption. It is seeking changes in the
administration of aid to support human rights, 'good governance' and
democracy, as reflected in more open government and increased
accountability. ACP states say they are in favour of all this, but they
question the EU's motive in introducing conditions which, they say, the
Union does not demand in its relations with other states.
There is concern in the ACP over what the EU would use as the final arbiter
and how these principles can be coherently defined when dealing with varying
political systems and cultures. ACP states want joint determination to avoid
the danger of discriminating against some countries.
Ministers will also argue over whether Brussels or the recipient states
should have greater control over the management of aid funds. EU officials
argue that countries should not expect continuing access to funds they fail
to take up, and that disbursements should be denied if it believes money has
been misspent.
ACP states say in response that recipient governments do not always have
complete control over the rate of spending and that the flow of funds often
depends on tortuous decision-making in Brussels. They add that changes to
control over aid could undermine relations between ACP states by provoking
arguments over limited resources.
ACP officials fear that some of what they consider the more pressing issues,
such as trade in sugar and bananas and in services, may get pushed into the
background.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Cardoso revival lifts Brazil index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's stock market closed about 12 per cent higher yesterday, amid
renewed hopes for the presidential election chances of Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso.
The former finance minister, who is well behind the front-running
left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in opinion polls, has endured a bad
couple of weeks because of bickering among his political backers.
Yesterday, though, Mr Cardoso was lifted by news that Mr Jose Sarney, a
former president who was level in opinion polls with Mr Cardoso and
threatened to take some of his votes, had pulled out of the campaign.
Last week, Mr Sarney failed to win the backing of the country's largest
political party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB). On Wenesday, a
court refused to let him switch parties. Yesterday, he said he was no longer
a candidate.
In the latest soundings, both Mr Cardoso and Mr Sarney have about 15 per
cent support, compared to nearly 40 per cent for Mr da Silva. Many of Mr
Sarney's supporters are from the country's north-east. These are now
expected to shift to Mr Cardoso because he is allied with the Popular Front
party, strong in that region.
However, Mr Cardoso's campaign for the election, due in October, faces
severe challenges. Also, it seems badly organised and lacking ideas. Some
analysts point out that many of Mr Sarney's supporters are among Brazil's
poor, who may choose the more radical and populist Mr da Silva rather than
Mr Cardoso, a member of the ruling elite.
Brazil's stock market, always volatile, has fallen more than 20 per cent in
recent weeks on concerns about Mr Cardoso. He is preferred by investors
because of his pledges to open the economy further.
The rise yesterday - the Sao Paulo stock market index closed up 2,176 points
at 20,085, a climb of 12.2 per cent - was also partly due to Congressional
approval, late on Wednesday, of measures towards the introduction on July 1
of a new currency, the real. It is hoped this will curb inflation, now
nearly 50 per cent a month.

<TEXT>
Argentina is hoping to attract UK investment in its soon-to-be privatised
nuclear industry, as a result of a series of contacts at government and
company level, according to senior officials.
Mr Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, has been in London this week on
an official visit which marks a further step in the normalisation of
UK-Argentine relations since the Falklands War in 1982.
Mr Bastos, who was invited to the UK by the foreign office, met his
counterpart at the department of trade and industry, Mr Timothy Eggar.
The department described the talks as 'friendly and constructive,' but
refused detailed comment.
Argentine officials say their country has no political objections to British
companies operating its two nuclear power stations, Atucha I and Atucha II.
Argentina has also offered to co-operate with international research and
development of a cost-effective, safe standard nuclear reactor.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Kennedy clan gathers at bedside of ailing Jacqueline Onassis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Kennedy clan were yesterday gathered at the bedside of Mrs
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was apparently close to death as a result of
complications from cancer.
The 64-year-old widow of President John F Kennedy and of Mr Aristotle
Onassis, the Greek shipping magnate, was given the Catholic rites for the
dying at her home, after she had been told by doctors there was 'no more to
be done.'
Mrs Onassis had been receiving radiation and chemotherapy treatment all year
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, normally a curable form of cancer. But she was
admitted to hospital on Monday with what were described as 'serious
complications' before discharging herself 48 hours later.
Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachussetts, who visited her on Wednesday
night, did not attempt to disguise the gravity of her condition. 'I think
all members of the family are distressed by the medical reports,' he said.
In the popular eye, Mrs Onassis is probably the closest the American
Republic has come to producing something like royalty. As Miss Jacqueline
Bouvier, she married the then Congressman John F Kennedy in 1953. They had
five children together, but three died shortly after birth.
When JFK became the 35th president, she brought to the White House a
youthful style and glitter not previously seen there, especially in her
emphasis on cultural activities. Her appeal was global, starting with a
sensationally popular visit to Paris in the summer of 1961.
The tragic nobility of her demeanour when her husband was assassinated in
Dallas in November 1963, while sitting next to her in the presidential
limousine, moved the country to tears and admiration. Great sympathy was
also extended with the assassination of her brother-in-law, Senator Robert F
Kennedy, in 1968.
Some of that lustre was lost when she married Mr Onassis later in the same
year and spent much time outside the US. But after his death in 1975, she
quietly re-entered public life, working for a New York publishing house and
shunning the limelight to the extent that she could.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Mexican opposition advances
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's centre-right opposition has been lifted greatly by the television
debate last week between the country's main presidential candidates and is
now leading the governing party in some opinion polls. The leftist
opposition has been relegated to third.
Mori of Mexico gives Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action
Party (PAN) 25 per cent support, against 20 per cent for Mr Ernesto Zedillo
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), with 41 per cent
undecided.
An internal poll for the PRI gives Mr Fernandez de Cevallos 40 per cent and
Mr Zedillo 39 per cent. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Party of
Democratic Revolution (PRD) trailed with 12-13 per cent.
PRI officials expect the popularity of Mr Fernandez de Cevallos to decline
as the impact of the debate fades. They argue that the polls are biased in
his favour because they do not include the rural areas where his party has
little support. Even so, the PAN surge is causing anxiety in the governing
party and contributing to deep divisions in the PRD.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is less known than Mr Cardenas but the former's
party offers social conservatism and pro-business policies which may be more
palatable to many voters than the left-of-centre platform of Mr Cardenas,
and may make the PAN candidate a more credible alternative to the PRI. One
PRI official said: 'We now have to concentrate on winning the election, not
just on obtaining legitimacy for the result.'
Government officials say they much prefer to have Mr Fernandez de Cevallos,
rather than Mr Cardenas, as the principal opposition in the August
presidential election, in the belief this could make the post-electoral
situation more stable.
If Mr Cardenas does come third, officials reckon his capacity to organise
allegations of electoral fraud will be much reduced.
The PRI's aura of invincibility has been damaged by the televised debate, in
which Mr Fernandez de Cevallos was judged the clear winner. Mr Zedillo has
been criticised for failing to defend the policies of President Carlos
Salinas, for not mentioning his own party, and for mean-spiritedness during
much of his time on air.
Members of the PRD are increasingly frustrated at Mr Cardenas's lacklustre
campaign, encapsulated by his poor performance in the television debate.
Yesterday, the party leaders held an emergency meeting to resolve
differences between factions and refocus the campaign, according to press
reports.

Foreign observers of the Dominican Republic's presidential election believe
there were widespread irregularities. They said there are indications of a
deliberate effort to tamper with the election, held on Monday.
Mr Steven Solarz, a US former congressmen and one of the observers, said
thousands of Dominicans had been denied a vote because their names were not
on electoral rolls. The observers said that a disproportionate number of
people disenfranchised were opposition supporters.
Tension rose in the Dominican Republic yesterday as the electoral board
rejected a request by Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the main opposition
candidate, for a halt to the count and for an investigation of his charges
against the ruling party of President Joaqun Balaguer.
With 92 per cent of the vote counted, the board showed Mr Balaguer leading
Mr Pena Gomez by only 22,000, the total electorate being 3.3m.

Mexico's gross domestic product grew by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter,
the first indication of an economic recovery after the recession of last
year, reports Damian Fraser. However the manufacturing sector contracted by
1.7 per cent, with some sectors such as textiles, paper and wood especially
hard hit.
The government said that growth had been dampened by most of Easter Week
falling in the first quarter this year, unlike last year, which reduced the
number of working days in the quarter. An adjustment to take account of the
consequent variation in numbers of working days would have shown expansion
in the manufacturing sector year.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Bentsen argues for caution in drive to police derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, yesterday warned the US
Congress against 'interfering in markets in too heavy handed a way' in its
efforts to regulate more closely the risks posed by trading in financial
derivatives.
The warning came as congressional committees began to chew over the findings
of a report by the General Accounting Office, Congress's audit agency, which
warned of gaps in the supervision of derivatives dealing, especially by
securities business affiliates and insurance companies.
Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance, said the GAO report had 'identified some
serious gaps in the current legal and regulatory structure relating to
derivatives,' and argued that regulatory and legislative reforms were needed
'to successfully avert the potential for a future derivatives Dunkirk.'
In the light of the findings, he said, 'I cannot agree with those who would
argue that the thousand points of light of industry volunteerism and a few
incremental changes by regulators can effectively address the risks posed by
exotic derivatives.'
Mr Henry Gonzalez, House banking committee chairman, said he saw 'eye-to-eye
with the GAO report on the need for increased disclosure, for improved
supervision and for stronger international co-operation on derivatives
regulation and supervision'
Mr Gonzalez said he planned soon to introduce derivatives legislation in
co-operation with Congressman Jim Leach, his Republican counterpart.
Republican members of Mr Markey's subcommittee yesterday took immediate aim
at some of the proposals in the GAO report, warning they ran the risk of
meddling in normal company decisions that were no business of government.
'In the process of protecting stockholders from the consequences of bad
business decisions in derivatives, we need to make sure that we don't drive
companies to foreign derivatives markets, said Congressman Dennis Hastert of
Illinois.
Even some Democrats feared they might end up mollycoddling multinational
companies well able to handle the complexities of derivatives.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Argentina seeks UK N-investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina is hoping to attract UK investment in its soon-to-be privatised
nuclear industry, as a result of a series of contacts at government and
company level, according to senior officials.
Mr Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, has been in London this week on
an official visit which marks a further step in the normalisation of
UK-Argentine relations since the Falklands War in 1982.
Mr Bastos, who was invited to the UK by the Foreign Office, met his
counterpart at the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Timothy Eggar. The
DTI described the talks as 'friendly and constructive', but refused detailed
comment.
Argentine officials say their country has no political objections to British
companies operating its two nuclear power stations, Atucha I and Atucha II.
Argentina has also offered to co-operate with international research and
development of a cost-effective, safe standard nuclear reactor.
Last month, Babcock Energy, based at Renfrew in Scotland, was awarded a
Pounds 5.5m (Dollars 8.25m) contract to supply computer-controlled,
ultra-sonic equipment for the reactor pressure vessel of Atucha II. National
Grid and British Gas have also invested in Argentina's energy sector.
Since announcing in 1991 that it was scrapping its controversial Condor II
missile project (originally aimed at the Falklands), Argentina has set out
to reassure the international community about its nuclear ambitions. Last
November, it ratified the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty banning nuclear weapons in
Latin America.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Mexican opposition advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's centre-right opposition has been lifted greatly by the television
debate last week between the country's main presidential candidates and is
now leading the governing party in some opinion polls. The leftist
opposition has been relegated to third.
Mori of Mexico gives Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action
Party (PAN) 25 per cent support, against 20 per cent for Mr Ernesto Zedillo
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), with 41 per cent
undecided.
An internal poll for the PRI gives Mr Fernandez de Cevallos 40 per cent and
Mr Zedillo 39 per cent. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Party of
Democratic Revolution (PRD) trailed with 12-13 per cent.
PRI officials expect the popularity of Mr Fernandez de Cevallos to decline
as the impact of the debate fades. They argue that the polls are biased in
his favour because they do not include the rural areas where his party has
little support. Even so, the PAN surge is causing anxiety in the governing
party and contributing to deep divisions in the PRD.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is less known than Mr Cardenas but the former's
party offers social conservatism and pro-business policies which may be more
palatable to many voters than the left-of-centre platform of Mr Cardenas,
and may make the PAN candidate a more credible alternative to the PRI. One
PRI official said: 'We now have to concentrate on winning the election, not
just on obtaining legitimacy for the result.'
Government officials say they much prefer to have Mr Fernandez de Cevallos,
rather than Mr Cardenas, as the principal opposition in the August
presidential election, in the belief this could make the post-electoral
situation more stable.
If Mr Cardenas does come third, officials reckon his capacity to organise
allegations of electoral fraud will be much reduced. The PAN has generally
co-operated with the PRI.
The PRI's aura of invincibility has been damaged by the televised debate, in
which Mr Fernandez de Cevallos was judged the clear winner. Mr Zedillo has
been criticised for failing to defend the policies of President Carlos
Salinas, for not mentioning his own party, and for mean-spiritedness during
much of his time on air.
Members of the PRD are increasingly frustrated at Mr Cardenas's lacklustre
campaign, encapsulated by his poor performance in the television debate.
Yesterday, the party leaders held an emergency meeting to resolve
differences between factions and refocus the campaign, according to press
reports.
Many of Mr Cardenas's problems seem of his own making. Last weekend he met
Sub-comandante Marcos, the rebel leader in the southern state of Chiapas,
and seemed to play into the hands of those who attack him for extremism. The
meeting turned into a fiasco as Marcos, rather than offer his support for Mr
Cardenas, criticised him for his failings.
The meeting conflicted with Mr Cardenas's recent move to the political
centre. Some government officials are worried that he may move back to the
left, in an effort to shore up support from the party faithful, if his
popularity ebbs away. A newly radicalised Mr Cardenas, even in third place,
could make the electoral process more tense.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Drugs liberalisation attacked: Colombian court decision
leads to defiance on streets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of the Colombian Supreme Court decision to decriminalise the
personal use of small amounts of drugs is already evident on the streets of
the country's capital, Bogota.
Social workers dealing with children and young prostitutes say drug
consumption has climbed since the first announcement of de-criminalisation
two weeks ago. More teenagers are trying out cocaine base (a low-grade form
of the drug), thinking: 'If it's legal it can't be bad for us'.
Critics of the court decision say this is evidence that such
decriminalisation opens the door to a massive increase in marijuana and
cocaine consumption, in a country where these drugs are cheap and readily
available.
A recent government survey found there were more than 500,000 regular drug
abusers among Colombia's 30m people, including 6,000 heroin addicts. Drug
abuse is an important factor in Colombian urban violence. The country has
highest murder rate in the world.
The court this week issued a lengthy statement in support of its decision,
but it has failed to still the controversy.
A majority of the justices decided it was unconstitutional to violate a
person's freedom to decide whether to use drugs. However, the court left
room for congressional legislation to limit drug use in schools and other
public places, and said that education, not repression, is the way to combat
consumption.
Four of the nine justices have stated they deplore the majority's ruling,
describing it as ingenuous and anachronistic, based on 19th century
liberalism, and doing 'incalculable harm to Colombian society.' The
government, presidential candidates (the election's first round is due on
May 29), church, business and education leaders have condemned the
decriminalisation.
President Cesar Gaviria said this week he would issue a decree to ban the
use of drugs in public places, as the first step to overturn the ruling. He
also announced moves towards a plebiscite to revoke the ruling and return
any kind of drug use to illegality. Opinion polls have all shown a large
majority for penalties against possession and consumption.
Critics of the court decision also see it as undermining the police and
other authorities fighting drug production and trafficking. Marijuana users
in the centre of Bogota are now taunting police by blowing smoke in their
faces.
By legalising the consumption part of the drug business, the critics
believe, the court is in danger of giving the illusion of legitimacy to
production. There may now be greater pressure in Colombia to realise a
proposal previously aired by Mr Gustavo de Greiff, the attorney-general, to
legalise the whole trade.
The decriminalisation will also damage Colombia's image abroad, even though
the US and other foreign governments recognise that the court's decision
does not reflect the Gaviria administration's stand against drugs. The US
has already suspended exchanges of evidence with the Colombian authorities
on the grounds that Mr de Greiff was too ready to reach plea-bargains with
drug traffickers.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Wounded Maoists remain armed and dangerous: The Huallaga
valley, where the Peruvian armed forces are mounting an assault on Shining
Path guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fourteen years since the left-wing Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) movement
erupted from clandestine political agitation into overt military action in
Peru, army chiefs and the pro-government press claim that the 'final
offensive' against the Maoists is under way.
The principal 'battle zone' is deep in the semi-tropical jungle, on the left
bank of the Huallaga river, 300 miles north-east of the capital and long
notorious as being near where most of Peru's coca leaf, the raw material for
cocaine, is grown.
Reports of hundreds of troops mobilised, of helicopter attacks against the
civilian population and of fleeing terrorists have dominated Peru's
newspapers for the past three weeks. Human rights organisations, meanwhile,
have presented testimony alleging rape, torture and summary execution of
civilians by government troops. Visits to the zone by journalists and the
Congressional commission forhuman rights have failed to clarify the picture.
In this inaccessible and lawless area, the truth is hard to discover. But
several facts do emerge: first, the military operation involves no more than
a couple of hundred soldiers, a similar number of guerrillas and a maximum
of two elderly helicopters; second, the combat area is sparsely populated,
making large-scale air attack impossible; third, there have been innocent
victims.
This is a low-technology conflict, largely entrusted to 16- and 17 year-old
recruits who must foot-slog through mud and dense undergrowth for perhaps a
week before encountering the enemy. In this terrain, which they have
controlled for a decade, Sendero guerrillas have the upper hand. Jungle
paths are mined and ambushes easily laid. The wounded must usually be
carried out on stretchers.
The left bank of the Huallaga is now one of the last real bastions for
Sendero, severely weakened since the capture in September 1992 of Abimael
Guzman, the movment's founder and leader, and the subsequent arrest of most
of its known, high-ranking leaders.
Along the Huallaga, Sendero has sustained a long and profitable co-operation
with drug traffickers and coca-growers, many of them migrants from the
impoverished Andean highlands.
Sendero's war chest, swollen with proceeds of protection rackets and landing
charges for drug traffickers' flights from small airstrips, has allowed the
guerrillas to acquire relatively sophisticated arms, including
rocket-propelled grenades and Soviet-made machine-guns.
Now, for the first time, the Peruvian government is making an attempt to
clear the area. Prior to operations, a massive propaganda campaign - via
leaflets dropped by helicopter, radio and television broadcasts - called on
subversives and sympathisers to 'repent'.
Many residents of the small, Sendero-controlled towns on the right bank of
the river saw the security forces regaining the upper hand and complied.
Entire villages have turned themselves in and been given a clean bill of
health by the army.
Much of this repentance, of course, is false. 'Sendero would come around
sometimes and demand food,' said one tearful local shopkeeper. 'You have to
help them or they kill you. But why should I have to repent for that?'
Repentance, and the safe-conduct pass which comes with it, helps the
security forces to distinguish friend from foe. But many locals say they are
'friends' from necessity, complaining meanwhile of widespread army abuses,
including petty theft, rape and other physical maltreatment.
Arrepentidos (those who have repented) with more clout get lenient treatment
in return for surrendering weapons and informing on former comrades-in-arms.
Some, though, like 17-year-old Comrade America - now a guide for the army at
Tingo Mara - seem genuinely disillusioned: 'It's an awful life with Sendero
 -you sleep in the undergrowth and eat like an animal. If you lapse from
party discipline three times, they kill you. They pull out your tongue with
pliers.'
Battles in the backlands of Peru against similar, well-established pockets
of resistance may be expected for some time.
At the national level, the government of President Alberto Fujimori can
point to numerous successes in counter-subversion. Statistics show that
political violence continues to decline. This year so far, both the number
of guerrilla attacks and the death toll have dropped to about a third of
last year's already reduced levels. Another indicator of enhanced security
is the number of foreign miners and geologists moving freely throughout
remote Andean areas considered no-go zones 18 months ago.
Some of this success is due to the creation of rondas, armed community
self-defence groups supported by, and sometimes directly under the control
of, the army.
The capture of Guzman, however, has not resulted in the hoped-for final
capitulation of Sendero. He has said he is ready to 'negotiate'; Mr Fujimori
has insisted on full surrender first.
Guzman clearly wields power over other imprisoned party leaders but no
longer controls those still at large. Recent Sendero documents show him
still revered as an ideologue but, as several sources underline, 'an
imprisoned Maoist is a dead Maoist'.
The mantle of logistical command has fallen to Oscar Ramrez Durand, known as
Comrade Feliciano. His faction, now widely called Red Sendero, seems
incapable of large-scale, co-ordinated action, but remains dangerous. (Black
Sendero is what they call the members in jail.)
The government and the armed forces stick to what Mr Fujimori calls 'the
radical change in counter-subversive strategy - winning over the
population'. According to the president, 'the war is not yet over (but) the
situation is under control'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign observers monitoring the Dominican Republic's presidential election
have concluded that there were widespread irregularities. The observers said
there are indications of a deliberate effort to tamper with the election,
held on Monday.
Mr Steven Solarz, a US former congressmen and a member of the observers'
team, said that thousands of Dominicans had been denied a vote because their
names were not on electoral rolls.
The observers believe that these were deliberately excluded, he added.
'It may be that these irregularities have changed the result of the
election,' he said.
The observers said that a disproportionate number of people disenfranchised
were supporters of opposition parties.
Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party,
who is aiming to become the country's first black president, has charged
that 150,000 to 200,000 people were denied a vote on Monday, and that most
of these were his party's supporters.
Tension rose in the Dominican Republic yesterday as the electoral board
rejected a request by Mr Pena Gomez for a halt in the count and for an
investigation of his charges against the ruling party.
Military patrols in Santo Domingo, the capital, and in other cities were
increased and many Dominicans stayed home, fearing violence between party
factions.
Mr Pena Gomez's allegations that the Social Christian Reform Party of
President Joaqun Balaguer, had perpetrated a fraud in the election, have
been rejected by the 87-year-old president, who is seeking a seventh term.
Mr Balaguer, claiming victory yesterday, said he had confidence in the board
and that the voting had been 'clean and orderly.'
The board's latest returns indicate that, with 92 per cent of the vote
counted, Mr Balaguer had a lead of only 22,000 over Mr Pena Gomez. About
3.3m million people were entitled to vote.
It is not known when the electoral board will formally declare a winner. The
result of the 1990 election, narrowly won by Mr Balaguer amid charges of
fraud by opposition parties, was announced two months after election day.

FT  20 MAY 94 / US trade deficit declines to Dollars 7.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit fell to Dollars 7.5bn in March against Dollars 9.2bn in
February, but the underlying trend remained adverse, official figures
indicated yesterday.
The drop in the deficit was larger than most Wall Street analysts expected,
but partly reflected special factors. Exports rose 9.6 per cent from
February, with large increases in volatile items such as gold bullion,
aircraft and telecommunications equipment. Imports rose 5.4 per cent,
reflecting the strength of US domestic demand.
In the first three months, the overall deficit was Dollars 23.3bn against
Dollars 14.7bn in the same period last year. The deterioration reflected a
9.5 per cent gain in imports that more than offset a 5.1 per cent rise in
exports.
Analysts expect the deficit to continue widening until the rate of economic
growth in overseas markets catches up with that in the US. This is unlikely
to occur until next year.
The widening of the overall US deficit continues to mask sharp differences
in the performance of different sectors. In March a surplus of Dollars 4.6bn
in trade in services contrasted favourably with a Dollars 12bn deficit on
trade in goods.
The trade figures left analysts scrambling to revise estimates of growth in
the first quarter. The preliminary official estimate of growth at an annual
rate of 2.6 per cent assumed a larger trade deficit in March than reported
yesterday. It also underestimated the strength of consumer spending in
March.
However, other components of demand, such as non-residential construction
and inventories were weaker than expected. Economists at Merrill Lynch, the
financial services group, yesterday predicted the net effect of these
changes would be a small downward revision to first quarter growth - to an
annual rate of 2.2 per cent.

Lawyers for congressman Dan Rostenkowski were reported yesterday to be
trying to negotiate a legal bargain under which the powerful chairman of the
House ways and means committee might plead guilty to misdemeanour offences
relating to the House post office scandal unearthed in 1991.
Mr Robert Bennett, the congressman's lawyer who is also representing
President Bill Clinton in the civil sexual harassment suit brought by Ms
Paula Jones, declined to comment yesterday. So did Ms Janet Reno, the
attorney general.
The outcome of the legal bargaining could have a sizeable impact on the fate
of healthcare reform in Congress. Mr Rostenkowski's committee is an
important drafting panel and the chairman is committed to bringing a bill to
the floor of the House.
Were felony charges to be brought, Mr Rostenkowski would be forced, under
the rules of the House Democratic party caucus, to step aside as chairman
until the case is resolved. A misdemeanour indictment involves no such
automatic removal, although there would undoubtedly be calls for him to
resign his post.
Next in seniority on ways and means is congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida,
who believes in universal health insurance coverage, but along the lines of
the Canadian 'single payer' system which has been explicitly rejected by the
Clinton administration. He also has nothing like Mr Rostenkowski's legendary
powers of political persuasion.
At a session of the 39-member committee on Wednesday, Mr Rostenkowski
described his mission in typically blunt terms. 'I will do whatever I need
to to get at least 20 votes on this committee' - the minimum number needed
for a bill to reach the floor of the House.
Last month, Mr Eric Holder, the federal attorney in Washington, sent to the
justice department a draft indictment of Mr Rostenkowski.
Details of the proposed indictment have never been made public. But last
year Mr Robert Rota, the former House postmaster, pleaded guilty to
misdemeanour embezzlement charges and implicated Mr Rostenkowski in the
scheme to disguise theft by post office cashiers as payments for the
purchases of stamps by the congressman.
Since then, Mr Rosentowski's offices and campaign accounts in Washington and
his Chicago district have also been investigated. He has continued to insist
on his innocence of all charges.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Business interests are increasingly shaping the content of official aid
programmes to the detriment of the poor, according to a report by aid
agencies from 22 donor nations.
The practice of tying aid to the purchase of goods and services in donor
countries is growing, obliging developing countries to pay more than
necessary for their supplies, it says. Tied aid also results in purchases of
inappropriate goods suited to the donor rather than the recipient and holds
back development of Third World industries debarred from competing for
aid-funded projects.
Tied aid has been running at about Dollars 15bn in each of the past five
years, rising to nearly Dollars 18bn in 1991, the report claims. It
estimates developing countries are paying on average 15 per cent more than
necessary for tied aid supplies, amounting to a subsidy to exporters in
donor nations of more than Dollars 2bn a year. This compares with total
development assistance by OECD countries of Dollars 60bn in 1992.
Governments tend to favour projects that serve the interests of their own
industries because they are visible, easy to administer and relatively quick
to implement. Projects designed to reduce poverty often centre on slowly
building up local capabilities, using local resources rather than importing
goods, services and know-how from outside.
The growing use of aid to promote enterprise and investment in developing
countries also appears to be driven more by the desire to give donor country
industries a toe hold in developing markets.
More broadly the rich industrial nations are sharply reducing development
assistance. Only about 10 per cent of aid goes directly on reducing poverty.

FT  20 MAY 94 / North Korea 'violating' nuclear pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Atomic Energy Agency last night called on North Korea
immediately to stop removing spent fuel rods from a reactor at its Yongbyon
nuclear complex, condemning its action as a 'serious violation' of an
agreement on nuclear safeguards.
The IAEA said it was reporting the violation to its board of governors and
to the United Nations Security Council.
An agency inspection team, currently in North Korea, provided the first
official confirmation that the North Koreans had started removing spent fuel
rods from the five-megawatt reactor in defiance of the IAEA. The US and the
IAEA have voiced fears that North Korea may extract plutonium from the spent
fuel to produce a nuclear bomb.
Washington has warned that extensive removal of the fuel rods would force it
to ask the UN to apply economic sanctions against North Korea. Earlier
yesterday President Clinton said it would be 'an error for North Korea to
continue to thwart these inspections ..'
On Wednesday Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US would
increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if
it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea.
Pyongyang informed the IAEA it had started to refuel the reactor on May 12 -
an operation which requires replacing old fuel rods - in spite of earlier
requests by the agency not to undertake discharging the fuel without
enabling agency inspectors to take appropriate safeguards measures.
'As of today, it still seems possible to implement the required safeguards
measures,' the agency said. But to continue the discharge operation without
these measures, would result in 'irreparable loss of the agency's ability to
verify whether all nuclear material subject to safeguards in (North Korea)
is in fact under safeguards and that no such material has been diverted,' it
said.
Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, adds from New York: The controversy
presents difficult diplomatic problems for the UN Security Council.
While the US has threatened tough action against North Korea, any measures
proposed through the UN could be blocked by China, which has the right of
veto as a permanent member of the Security Council. Japan, too, is reluctant
to force the issue to a confrontation.

Some Japanese banks have stopped transferring dollars to North Korea, a move
that highlights the growing sensitivity towards charges that money flowing
from Japan is helping to support North Korea's nuclear programme.
The finance ministry said yesterday it had been informed of the move by
several banks, but emphasised that the action was purely voluntary. Japan
has faced charges in the US and at home that money remitted to North Korea
by Korean residents of Japan may be helping to fund the nuclear programme.
The US has said, and Japan has acknowledged, that if the United Nations
votes to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, the flow of funds from
Japan would have to be dealt with.
'If there were problems with North Korea, or if there were to be sanctions,
then we would look at remittances (of funds from Japan), the US embassy in
Tokyo said yesterday.
The finance ministry said it had not asked the banks to stop transferring
funds to North Korea but that 'if the UN decided to impose sanctions, the
government's policy is to take responsible action and that would have
applied to money remittances, too.'
Under current Japanese rules, however, there are no restrictions on sending
money to North Korea and about 20 Japanese banks have arrangements with that
country allowing them to transfer funds. The exact amount of money involved
is not known.
The Japanese authorities have refrained from taking any overt action to curb
money transfers for fear of alienating Koreans in Japan with ties in the
North. There is a 700,000-strong Korean community in Japan as a result of
Japan's invasion earlier this century.
Ashikaga Bank, which has been transferring funds to North Korea for its
customers for at least 20 years, said it had stopped transferring dollars
from other banks since the beginning of this year. The bank, located north
of Tokyo, continues to transfer funds for its customers, as a service to
them, it said. It was a 'business decision' to stop transferring funds from
other banks.

Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, speaking at an international business
conference in Singapore, described his country as growing fast but still a
low-income land at least two generations away from the medium level of
development, Reuter reports from Singapore. He said China lagged behind
because of the huge population, weak economic base, uneven development and
disparity between urban and rural areas.
As China sticks to reform and opens up, he said, 'the enormous potential for
attracting foreign capital into China will be tapped more quickly and
effectively, making available tremendous opportunities for foreign business
people.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Losses in Philippines securities scandal put at Dollars 23m:
Central bank has moved to allay public alarm

<TEXT>
Losses incurred by Philippine financial institutions from investments in
government securities placed through a collapsed investment company were
officially estimated yesterday at 938m pesos (Pounds 23m).
The country's monetary authorities announced the figure to allay fears of
severe damage from a scandal surrounding Bancapital Development Corporation,
which was little known in Manila's financial community until it closed last
month having failed to deliver large amounts of Treasury bills purchased by
banks and other financial institutions.
The affair became public this week following the death of an executive of
Bank of Commerce, a medium-sized commercial bank which is among those which
have suffered losses.
Bancapital, an unlicensed trader in the secondary market for government
securities, had lured investors with an offer of yields of up to 3
percentage points above market rates.
A special meeting yesterday of the monetary board, the policy-setting body
of Bangko Sentral, the central bank, decided to pursue investigations on
possible violations of bank internal controls in the acquisition of Treasury
bills.
The board said the estimated losses compared with total resources of 1,290bn
pesos held by banks and non-banks with quasi-banking functions at the end of
1993. The banking system, the board said, 'is stable and. . . . there is no
reason (for the public) to panic'.
A wave of deposit withdrawals was reported to have hit Bank of Commerce on
Wednesday, forcing it to seek emergency loans of up to 1bn pesos. Yesterday
the tension had apparently eased and no other banks reported unusual
activity.
Officials of Bankers' Association of the Philippines, which groups the
domestic private commercial banks, said Bancapital had been buying
securities in the secondary market and selling them 'more than once' to
other investors. Actual deliveries of the securities were not made and
instead 'custodial receipts' were given to investors.
Recent fluctuations in money market rates triggered the company's troubles,
according to bankers, who were surprised, however, at the investments made
by bigger financial institutions in Bancapital. Banks can participate in
weekly auctions of Treasury bills conducted by the central bank. The
Philippines' trade deficit was Dollars 1.13bn in the first two months of the
year, up by 54 per cent over the same period of 1993, according to the
central bank.
Exports rose 14 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn, and imports were up 26 per cent
to Dollars 2.99bn.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Pakistan falls short of growth target

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan is finishing the current fiscal year, which ends next month, with a
growth rate of 4 per cent, compared with a target of 7.5 per cent, a senior
government official said yesterday.
Worst hit was the agriculture sector which grew only 2.6 per cent because of
a virus which affected the cotton crop. Between 50 and 60 per cent of
Pakistan's exports consist of items made from cotton. The country produced
only 7.5m bales of cotton against a target of 12m bales.
Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's top adviser on finance acknowledged at a
seminar in Islamabad that inflation had been running at 10.5 per cent up
against a goal of 8 per cent. Despite the setbacks, he said the government's
efforts to improve macroeconomic stability, had been fruitful and he was
confident of keeping the deficit within the target of 5.4 per cent of gross
domestic product.
He added that foreign exchange reserves had risen to Dollars 1.9bn, more
than six times the level last summer at the height of a political crisis. He
claimed that despite a 3.1 per cent drop in exports, the country's trade
balance had improved thanks to a 12.6 per cent fall in imports. 'Our key
priority is to attain macroeconomic stability. We consider it a prerequisite
for future growth,' he said.
Independent economists monitoring the economy ahead of next month's annual
budget, give credit to the government for improving fiscal discipline in an
effort to reverse years of uncontrolled spending.
But budget-makers are under pressure to find more resources for development
as almost two-thirds of the budget goes towards debt servicing and defence.
Some officials fear that a recent 20 per cent increase in defence
expenditure by India, Pakistan's arch enemy, may force Islamabad to spend
more on the military.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Money supply up 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's key measure of money supply grew by 2.1 per cent in April from a
year before, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. The figure shows a slight
quickening in the rate of growth of M2 - cash in circulation, and time and
demand deposits plus certificates of deposit - which is up 0.2 per cent from
the previous month's revised increase. The year-on-year rate of growth was
the fastest since November 1991.
But the growth rate of broad money declined slightly from March and the bank
warned that the rise in the narrower money rate did not suggest an overall
acceleration in liquidity.
The likely explanation is the transfer in April of money from money
management funds, which are not included in the benchmark figure, into bank
deposits, which are.
Bank officials said the figures were consistent with their own forecast of a
sluggish year-on-year increase in money stock of 1-2 per cent throughout
1994, a rate that indicates that monetary conditions remain tight.
Meanwhile, the deflationary pressures at work in the economy were
highlighted by producer price figures released yesterday. Domestic wholesale
prices fell by 0.1 per cent in the first 10 days of May. Export prices fell
by 2 per cent from a year earlier. The strong yen continues to depress
import prices which are now 10.1 per cent lower than they were a year ago.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Ray of light on the road to Damascus / Review of US
torch-bearing efforts between Israel and Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than two and a half years after the Madrid conference began the present
Middle East process, Israel and Syria have finally reached a mutually
acceptable way of negotiating their track of a regional peace through the
Americans and, in particular, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state.
Mr Christopher said before leaving the region on Wednesday that he would be
back if both sides felt it would be useful, and repeated the cautious
leitmotiv of his second shuttle within a fortnight, that talks were at an
'early stage'.
Few doubt he will be back within weeks or that what he is directing is the
start of finely detailed negotiation which both sides appear determined
should become a final agreement.
There remain, as the state-owned Syria Times emphasised yesterday, 'wide and
big' gaps between Israel which wants Syria to pledge a 'full peace' before
it will commit itself to withdrawing from the Golan Heights, and Syria,
which will do so only after an Israeli promise to pull its troops out from
'every inch' of the land it occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Mr
Christopher's task is to produce the clever piece of diplomatic engineering
which will resolve this chicken-and-egg situation that has been at the heart
of the impasse from the outset.
The crude architecture of a deal has long been apparent. It will include
statements which each can interpret to their satisfaction: something from
Israel which Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, can trumpet as a
commitment that Israel will return all of the Golan to Syrian sovreignty;
something from Syria which Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, can
sell as the start of full diplomatic and economic relations.
Any withdrawal from the Golan would be phased - a concession Syria hinted it
is prepared to offer. Israel has offered an eight-year timetable, Syria
apparently wants three years at most. Israeli settlements on the Golan will
be dismantled, something Mr Rabin has already publicly addressed.
There will be a host of mutual security arrangements, including a US
monitoring force on the Golan to which Washington has in principle agreed.
US officers will likely staff early warning stations on the Golan. Both
sides are expected to create demilitarised zones either side of the Golan in
their own territory.
All this, of course, needs to be nailed down. But detailed work appears
already under way. Diplomats in Damascus say position papers exchanged by
the two sides this week already cover 'all the issues, addressed in a minute
manner.' It also appears that, unlike the Israel-PLO or Israel-Jordan talks,
there is no intention first to announce a 'declaration of principles' before
negotiating the final deal.
Syria, in particular, is deeply averse to discussing anything but a
finely-argued agreement, having watched with distaste the PLO's problems in
turning its vague declaration into an implementable agreement.
This is Mr Christopher's chief achievement. His tight-lipped shuttling
appears to have created a negotiating framework acceptable to both sides.
Israel has long sought high-level, secret talks with Syria, something Syria
has resisted because of distrustful fear of negotiating alone with the
Israelis. Mr Christopher's intervention thus reassures the Syrians that the
US will act as a guarantor, and perhaps arbiter, in any agreement.
His radio silence satisfies Israel's desire for secrecy. The fact he is
effectively conducting talks directly between Mr Assad and Mr Rabin answers
the call for high level negotiations.
Moreover, now that the Palestinians have gone it alone with Israel in
reaching their Gaza-Jericho deal, Mr Assad no longer feels he need tie
progress on his own negotiating track to progress in others - previously a
totem of his desire to be seen the Arab champion of a 'comprehensive' peace.
Indeed now, perversely, Mr Assad has some stake in seeing the PLO deal
succeed - whatever his conviction of its flaws - since its failure might
threaten Mr Rabin's ability to secure a separate peace with Damascus.
Mr Christopher appears thus to have broken the stalemate into which
bilateral Israeli-Syrian talks had lodged during the Washington peace talks.
But given the desire to maintain secrecy, progress in the private exchanges
is now more likely to be discernible through public signals than in
revelations of the contents of further rounds of US-mediated talks.
Mr Assad has already offered several peaceable gestures, including the issue
of exit visas for Syrian Jews shortly before January's Geneva summit with
President Bill Clinton. He co-operated with a US investigation into the fate
of Israel soldiers missing in Lebanon, and recently allowed a delegation of
Israeli Arabs to visit Syria. Further signs might include permission for a
delegation of Jewish Israelis to visit, or Syria's agreement to participate
in multilateral talks on regional issues which also began in Madrid.
Most observers in Damascus believe both Mr Rabin and Mr Assad know what they
need to deliver the other to achieve peace, however canny they are being in
public. Mr Christopher's willingness to devote such time and resources to
the talks, meanwhile, appears the clearest gauge of each sides' resolve to
achieve progress.
All three participants have good reason to press ahead. Mr Rabin must know
that his best chance of reaching an cast-iron deal lies in forging it with
Syria's present leadership. Mr Assad also knows the political climate may
never be more propitious for a deal to return the Golan - perhaps his single
greatest political ambition. He is also keen to reap the political and
economic rewards which the US might bestow if peace is agreed - not least in
removing Syria from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and perhaps
encouraging economic assistance.
For the US, there is the knowledge that real peace in the Middle East cannot
be accomplished without Syria, with the associated belief that bringing
Damascus on side will help further in its 'containment' of Iran. More to the
immediate political point, however, for an administration bogged in such
mires as Haiti and Bosnia, a Syrian-Israeli peace would be a rare foreign
policy victory. Which is one of the best reasons to expect Mr Christopher's
team to book two floors at the Damascus Sheraton before June is out.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malawi's autocratic president Hastings Kamuzu Banda conceded victory
yesterday to opposition leader Bakili Muluzi after ruling the small central
African nation for more than 30 years.
In a halting voice, Dr Banda congratulated Mr Muluzi, a 51-year-old
businessman and leader of the opposition United Democratic Front, over state
radio for winning the country's first multi-party elections since
independence from Britain in 1964.
Tens of thousands of singing, chanting Malawians poured into the streets of
the commercial capital Blantyre in festive celebration, many waving the
yellow flag of the UDF.
Mr Muluzi, will seek to form a coalition government with Chakufwa Chihana's
Alliance for Democracy (Aford), if, as seems likely, he fails to secure an
overall majority in the 177 seat assembly.
Mr Maluzi said yesterday he was concerned about the north-south polarisation
demonstrated by the poll where most of the electorate voted along regional
lines.
'I don't want to be president of a divided country,' he said, adding that he
would rather work with Aford than lead a minority government or approach
President Banda's Malawi Congress Party.
Publication of final results was delayed by logistical problems in the count
and by allegations of rigging in three Shire Valley constituencies.
In the parliamentary ballot, Aford has taken all 33 seats in the northern
region, mostly by huge majorities. The MCP vote held up well in rural areas
of the centre, but urban areas fell to the UDF, which swept most seats in
its southern base.
With counting nearing completion a spokesman for the Electoral Commission
said that 'unofficial figures' give Mr Muluzi's party 85 seats against 57
for the MCP and 35 for Aford.
The danger of the north becoming futher isolated may encourage Mr Muluzi to
offer Mr Chihana the vice presidency. This is in Mr Muluzi's gift, since he
did not name a running mate, apparently trying to avoid conflict between
various contenders within his own camp. But Mr Chihana stated before the
election he would not accept a UDF cabinet post because the party leadership
was tainted by former association with the MCP.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Pretoria seeks to calm fears on spending
</HEADLINE>

   PRETORIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's government of national unity yesterday sought to play down
fears of a sharp rise in public spending on socio-economic development, with
top finance officials promising to maintain fiscal discipline and fight
inflation.
Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister charged with implementing the reconstruction and
development programme, said in Pretoria that the government was aiming to
maintain macroeconomic balance and reduce public debt while improving the
delivery of public goods and services.
He was reacting to estimates released this week showing that the
reconstruction programme will cost R80bn-R90bn (Pounds 14.6bn-Pounds 16.5bn)
over five years, more than double the R39bn cost which the African National
Congress put on the programme during campaigning for the all-race elections
which it won last month.
Mr Naidoo stressed that the programme had to be funded, at least in its
early stages, from savings within the current budget rather than through
'add-on' expenditure. While he insisted that an adequate amount would be
available this year to kick-start the programme and to show that 'we will
visibly be able to deliver something to our people', most of the money would
come from redirecting spending and improving government efficiency.
This commitment to fiscal discipline is expected to be reflected in the
government's first budget, to be submitted to parliament on June 22. It is
understood that the budget will not deviate fundamentally from a 'mock
budget' released in March which provides for a real cut in government
expenditure and a budget deficit of 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product,
just below last year's 6.8 per cent figure.
Expenditure of R124.8bn would be just over 8 per cent more than last year's
R115.2bn, well below the inflation rate of nearly 10 per cent. No increase
in the general level of taxation is foreseen, though there could be rises in
so-called sin taxes on tobacco and alcohol, a new capital transfer tax and
possible changes to value added taxes to exempt basic foodstuffs but raise
taxes on luxury items.
Mr Derek Keys, the former industrialist who was reappointed finance minister
last week, is expected to present the budget plans to the cabinet on Monday.
President Nelson Mandela will give some details of economic policy when he
delivers his state of the nation address to parliament the following day.
Mr Keys' economic team includes Mr Naidoo as minister without portfolio and
Mr Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister. While both are ANC members and
former trade unionists, the team appears unanimous in endorsing the need for
fiscal discipline.
However, independent economists question whether sufficient savings can be
made to fund the programme as planned. Officials give no details of where
savings will be found, though it is understood that spending on security
forces will be targeted. At the same time, however, there will be pressure
on government spending from the creation of nine new regional bureaucracies,
as well as demands for affirmative action within the public service coupled
with pre-election commitments not to sack white civil servants.
Government spending will also be slightly increased because of the extra
costs of the recent election, which officials put at under R1bn.

The Greek government yesterday attempted to divert attention from the plight
of the drachma, still under pressure following the lifting of capital
controls this week, by announcing a new investment incentives law. Mr Yannos
Papantoniou, the economy minister, said the law was intended to help larger
Greek companies become more competitive in European markets. Greece has had
little success in attracting investment either in industry or tourism over
the last decade, when total foreign investment amounted to less than Dollars
3bn.
The announcement had no impact on financial markets where one-month interest
rates remained at around 60 per cent. Dealers said the market was waiting
for a comprehensive package of economic measures to tackle the rising public
sector deficit, projected at over 17 per cent of gross domestic product this
year.

<TEXT>
The European Commission is receiving more and more complaints about
restrictions on competition, its annual report on competition for 1993
reveals. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said complaints had
doubled since 1980, and the trend was likely to accelerate as companies
insist on a level playing field in the single market. In particular, the
commissioner took aim at restrictions in competition in Europe's energy
market. Mr Van Miert promised to press ahead with efforts to create a single
market in energy which was lagging behind telecoms liberalisation.
Commission officials hope that private sector complaints could be a tool for
attacking state monopolies, particularly powerful operators in the gas and
electricity industry.

The Spanish parliament yesterday approved legislation giving the Bank of
Spain a degree of Bundesbank-style autonomy, along with amendments
establishing strict rules to prevent illicit enrichment by the bank's
officials. The move reflected the intense public debate over the central
bank prompted by tax evasions and fraud allegations linked to the disgraced
former governor Mr Mariano Rubio who was freed on bail yesterday after two
weeks in prison. The law, first drafted in 1992, lays down that investments
by senior bank employees must be independently administered and closely
supervised by the market regulator, the National Securities Market
Commission.
Mr Rubio is being investigated in connection with tax evasion and falsifying
public documents when he was central bank governor in the late 1980s. The
law gives the Bank of Spain the responsibility of setting monetary policy
and prohibits it from financing the treasury and other public institutions.
The government, in consultation with the Bank of Spain, nevertheless retains
control over exchange rate policy.

Mr Paolo Berlusconi, younger brother of Italy's new prime minister, has
become implicated in a fourth corruption investigation by Milan magistrates.
According to press reports yesterday, Mr Paolo Berlusconi admitted two weeks
ago paying L800m (Pounds 334,000) in 1988 and 1989 to facilitate a
development project in the suburbs of Milan. The payments were allegedly
made by Edilnord, his construction group, to a local Socialist mayor and two
planning officers. Previously Mr Paolo Berlusconi has acknowledged another
L1bn payment by Edilnord for property developments in the Milan suburbs, but
said he was forced to pay the money. Until transferred to Mr Paolo
Berlusconi in 1992, Edilnord was part of the Fininvest empire controlled by
his elder brother, Silvio.
In another development yesterday the Milan public prosecutor demanded prison
sentences of four years eight months for two former Socialist mayors, Mr
Paolo Pillitteri and Mr Carlo Tognoli, for alleged corruption related to
contracts with Aem, the municipal energy company. The prosecution also
called for prison sentences of between two and three years for four former
politicians and six businessmen. Mr Pillitteri is a brother-in-law of Mr
Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. Mr Craxi was yesterday reported
to be recovering in a Tunis clinic amid reports that Milan magistrates will
soon seek his arrest for alleged corruption.

Crimea's rebellious regional authorities last night claimed Ukrainian
special forces had occupied strategic and administrative points in the
capital of Simferopol and the naval base of Sevastopol in an attempt to
impose Kiev's choice of regional interior minister. The reports were denied
by the Ukrainian government. The Crimean parliament confirmed in office its
own choice as interior minister of the region, and the attempt to impose the
Ukrainian candidate was called off. However, Ukrainian officials insisted
that the forces of law and order in Crimea fall under Kiev's jurisdiction. A
number of Ukrainian officials are believed to have entered the Crimean
interior ministry yesterday.
The reports on the deployment of Ukrainian troops came from Mr Yuri Meshkov,
the Crimean president. They follow weeks of growing animosity between
Simferopol and Kiev over the appointment of the interior minister and over
the growing links between Crimea and the Russian authorities. Mr Meshkov was
elected earlier this year by the large Russian majority in the region on a
ticket of union with Russia - a goal which he has since played down but
never abandoned.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Swiss trade slides into deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's trade balance in April recorded a deficit of SFr6.8m (Pounds
3.17m) following a surplus of SFr125.3m in March, the government customs
office announced yesterday. In April, both imports and exports declined
substantially from March and from April 1993. Imports totalled SFr7.55bn,
down from SFr8.92bn in March and from SFr8.0bn in April 1993. Exports
amounted to SFr7.54bn, down from SFr9.05bn in March and down from SFr8.01bn
in April 1993. For the period January to April, the surplus was SFr1.55bn
against SFr1.185bn in 1993. Exports rose slightly to SFr31.55bn, while
imports were little changed at SFr30bn.
Spain's finance ministry confirmed that the central government budget
deficit on a cash basis shrank 20 per cent to an accumulated Pta598bn
(Pounds 2.89bn) in the first four months of 1994 compared with Pta744bn in
the same period of 1993. The Bank of Portugal yesterday lowered its key
injection rate to 10.375 per cent from 10.75 per cent and its key absorption
rate to 9.375 per cent from 9.75 per cent. The Danish finance ministry
reduced its forecast of the 1994 state budget deficit to DKr51bn (Pounds
5.2bn), down from DKr54.4bn in its last forecast in December.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Why Finland's PM should be smiling but isn't: Lionel Barber
detects an ambivalence about membership of the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Esko Aho, Finland's youthful prime minister, ought to be smiling. The
polls show solid support for membership of the European Union, and his
country is looking at a once-in-a-century chance to slip out of Russia's
orbit and join the west.
Yet here is Mr Aho sitting in his spartan office offering mild apologies
about his country's (and his own) lack of Euro-phoria. His coalition
government has yet to decide when to hold a referendum on EU membership. He
is worried about a backlash from Finnish farmers who stand to lose heavily
under lower EU farm prices. And no one quite knows how to handle the
referendum.
Mr Aho's nightmare is a repeat of the Maastricht treaty referendums in 1992
when the French and Danes turned their back on their political elites. He
worries that a hard-sell Euro-campaign could turn off voters renowned for
their stubborn streak: 'It's a very complicated process,' he sighs.
The timing of the referendum reveals much about the Finnish psyche. Finns
fret about the possibility that Sweden might vote No, prompting a Norwegian
No, undermining Nordic co-operation and leaving Finland stranded.
EU supporters such as the recently elected President Martti Ahtisaari want
to hold the referendum before the Swedish poll. They hope a Yes vote will
create a bandwagon behind membership in sceptical Scandinavia. But Mr Heikki
Haavisto, foreign minister, and Mr Pertti Salolainen, deputy prime minister
and foreign trade minister, want to wait until after the Swedish poll -
ostensibly on the grounds that Sweden applied first for membership. Mr Aho
prefers the 'neutral' option of holding it on the same day.
The poll date will be resolved next week, but in an interview Mr Aho
suggested that some (unnamed) EU member states might be tempted to block
ratification of all four enlargement treaties if rich, populous Sweden
rejects membership.
According to the chief executive of one of Finland's largest manufacturing
companies, Mr Aho is haunted by divisions over Europe within his own centre
party and has one eye on next year's general election. 'Industry is giving
him a beating (for not speaking up on membership),' he says.
For Finnish industry, EU membership is vital. Mr Georg Ehrnrooth head of the
Metra conglomerate who chairs the Finnish employers federation, says the
European Economic Area is not a satisfactory substitute for full membership:
'It is just a stepping stone.'
Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive of Nokia, the mobile phones manufacturer,
agrees. EU membership offers the chance for Finnish business to shape new
European industrial standards and norms now under discussion in Brussels.
Without membership, Finland risks being marginalised, weakening its role as
a magnet for international investment.
Mrs Sirkka Hamalainen, governor of the Bank of Finland, welcomes the
external economic discipline offered by EU membership and the project of
European monetary union as a means of weaning industry and unions off
currency devaluations - a useful tool to pull a commodity-driven economy out
of recession.
Yet Mr Aho's caution may turn out to be smarter than it looks now. Much
depends on the 'national package' settling the cost of compensating Finnish
farmers for reducing producer prices overnight to EU levels - an average 40
per cent cut which will force the Finnish government to raise an extra
FM4.3bn (Pounds 531m) next year with, it is hoped, the sums reducing
gradually over the next five years.
These sums trigger the best of Finnish black humour. One member of
parliament joked that the government was certain to lose the referendum
either way: the package was too generous and Finns would object to the cost;
or it was too mean, in which case the public would vote No in sympathy with
the farmers.
In the past, EU policy allowed new EU members such as Spain and Portugal
generous periods of transition. Now, virtually the whole of Finland will be
eligible for special EU regional aid. And however much Brussels and Helsinki
offers in compensation, more than 30 per cent of Finnish farmers are likely
to be wiped out by the end of the decade.
President Ahtisaari likens the challenge to the resettlement of 423,000
Karelians (representing 11 per cent of the population) who were driven off
their land by the Russian forces during the second world war. The war
reference is telling because it offers the biggest single clue as to why
Finns are likely to plump for membership later this year.
Finns deny they are searching for extra security. Ministers bristle when
asked whether Finland would like to join the West European Union or the Nato
alliance as an insurance policy against a resurgent, nationalist Russia; and
they play down the importance of the common European foreign and security
policy set out in the Maastricht treaty.
But they reject the idea that EU membership and its future foreign and
security policy obligations risk provoking Russia, or that it could impose
obligations down the road which are too high a price to pay. The message is
that Finland's traditional neutrality is no longer relevant.
In the end, the best indication of Finnish interest in the EU is the fact
that the president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the
foreign trade minister all intend to be at the European summit in Corfu next
month. And that is not purely to do with the weather.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission is receiving more and more complaints about
restrictions on competition, its annual report on competition for 1993
reveals. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said complaints had
doubled since 1980, and the trend was likely to accelerate as companies
insist on a level playing field in the single market. In particular, the
commissioner took aim at restrictions in competition in Europe's energy
market. Mr Van Miert promised to press ahead with efforts to create a single
market in energy which was lagging behind telecoms liberalisation.
Commission officials hope that private sector complaints could be a tool for
attacking state monopolies, particularly powerful operators in the gas and
electricity industry.
In 1993, the Commission eliminated its backlog of old competition cases.
Some 1,250 cases involving cartels or abuse of a dominant position were
being examined on December 31, 1993, compared with a little under 1,700 a
year earlier. Mr Van Miert signalled that the Commission is examining how to
develop the idea of a common competition area extending to prospective EU
members in eastern Europe.

FT  20 MAY 94 / GM and VW resume skirmishing

The legal struggle between Volkswagen and General Motors blew up yesterday
into a head-on confrontation involving senior executives, politicians and
legal officials.
Mr David Herman, head of GM's local operations, accused Mr Gerhard Schroder,
prime minister of Lower Saxony and a member of the VW supervisory board, of
trying to use his political weight to influence the investigations by state
prosecutors in Hesse into claims of industrial espionage against GM. The
case is based on suspicions that Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and
close associates collected secret data while working for the US group,
taking it with them when they moved to VW last March.
Mr Herman said GM's Adam Opel subsidiary would resist all 'insinuations,
slander, cover-up attempts and other defamatory plans.'
Mr Schroder later repeated his suggestions - which sparked Mr Herman's
attack - that the probe should be stopped.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, said he wanted an independent assessor to
examine the conduct of the case.
Yesterday's outbursts were sparked by a sequence of related events,
culminating in a television programme on Wednesday night, which suggested
that evidence might have been planted, and that private detectives used by
Opel's lawyers had used subterfuge in the hunt for evidence. Lawyers
representing Mr Lopez, now VW's production chief, and his colleagues had
earlier implied that the official investigation might be biased and impaired
by evidence possibly obtained by subterfuge. However, Mr Hans-Christoph
Schaefer, attorney for the state of Hesse, said there was 'not the slightest
reason to doubt' the objectivity or neutrality of his investigators.
Contrary to suggestions from VW lawyers, he said the official investigators
knew private detectives had been appointed. Their findings were in the
files, clearly marked as coming from outside sources, and accessible to VW
legal representatives.
Such information would obviously undergo a critical examination, Mr Schaefer
added. If it turned out that illegal methods had been used to gather the
information, that would bring its value into question, and possible criminal
offences would be investigated.
Tom Burns adds from Madrid: Volkswagen was told yesterday that the Spanish
government would not inject funds into Seat, the group's ailing Spanish
subsidiary, but that it was prepared to help the restructuring programme
initiated by the Barcelona-based auto producer through complementary
measures.
The firm stance against any bail-out for Seat was delivered to VW chairman
Mr Ferdinand Piech during talks with the Spanish prime minister, Mr Felipe
Gonzalez. Specific help to Seat could involve credits to help finance a
Pta50bn (Pounds 241m) early retirement scheme.

FT  20 MAY 94 / French growth forecast improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's official statistics agency yesterday raised to 0.9 per cent its
estimate of economic growth in the first half of this year, while the
central bank brought its intervention rate down by another 0.1 percentage
point to 5.4 per cent.
The two moves spell good news for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. His
standing in the opinion polls - a key element in any decision he takes to
contest next year's presidential election - recently rallied slightly, after
a steady drop in the wake of his controversial and abortive attempts at
labour market reform,
In making its fifth small interest rate cut in a month and so tracking the
monetary easing in Germany, the Bank of France also reduced its higher
'repurchase' rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 6.40 per cent. Societe
Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris yesterday led a move by commercial
banks to trim their base rate from 7.95 to 7.7 per cent.
Insee, the statistics agency, had in March forecast that growth in the six
months of this year would be 0.7 per cent above that of the last half of
1993. Insee economists said yesterday that even in the unlikely event that
economic recovery flattened out entirely in the second half of 1994, the
'carry over' effect of first half growth would put year-on-year growth for
1994 at 1.3 per cent, in line with the government's own target.
The statistics agency also said it was effectively scrapping its December
1993 forecast that the unemployment rate would rise by a further 0.5
percentage point this year, as the jobless rate has stuck at 12.2 per cent
since the start of the year. Several thousand public employees demonstrated
yesterday in Paris against possible restructuring moves, even though Mr
Balladur has decreed a freeze on public sector redundancies.
The three major factors in recovery, according to Insee, have been:
Increased demand for consumer goods, led by the 40 per cent rise in car
sales between January and April. This was largely due to special government
financial incentives for car purchases, but Insee now sees higher foreign
demand for French cars.
A stabilisation in industrial producer prices, whose fall last year led
French companies to get rid of stocks of declining value. But consumer price
inflation, which hit an historic annual low of 1.5 per cent in March, is
predicted to remain low, an expectation the Bank of France shares.
An increase this year in companies' investments which fell by a very sharp
17 per cent last year.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Russian MPs threaten to revise budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian budget, the centre of the government's efforts to retain a grip
on inflation, is again under severe pressure.
At the same time, President Boris Yeltsin has harshly criticised the
government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - though he will
not insist on any cabinet changes.
The threat to the budget came yesterday when Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, chairman
of the defence committee, announced that the committee had approved extra
budget expenditure of Rbs17,000bn-Rbs18,000bn (about Pounds 6.6bn) all of
which is to be spent on defence. Mr Yuzhenkov said that the previous vote by
the parliament's lower house to approve the budget without the increase
could be overturned - and since the membership of the committee contains
representatives of all main parties, it seems likely that it will.
The decision for increased expenditure has followed sustained and passionate
lobbying from the defence ministry, which had seen its demand for military
spending to be set at Rbs87,000bn slashed to Rbs37,000bn. Mr Andrei
Kokoshin, the deputy defence minister, said yesterday that such a level
would bring a 'tragic end to some unique defence technologies', while Mr
Yuzhenkov said that the increase would bring the budget up to 'the minimum
below which the army would disintegrate'.
The effect will be to push budget spending up to around Rbs200,000bn, and
the deficit to around Rbs80,000bn - a level Rbs20,000bn above that which the
government agreed with the International Monetary Fund when receiving the
second half of the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) so-called systemic
transformation facility loan earlier this year. If further pressure on the
budget weakens still more the restrictive stance of the government, the
danger is that inflation - brought down to around 8 per cent a month
presently from highs of 30 per cent a month - will again begin to climb.
The political consequences of the continuing and very large fall in
production are now becoming more obvious at top levels of government. Mr
Yeltsin on Tuesday summoned Prime Minister Chernomyrdin for what seems to
have been a dressing down on the ineffectiveness of his economic strategy.
On Wednesday, Mr Chernomyrdin in his turn severely criticised his economic
ministers and senior officials, stressing the need for discipline and harder
work.
Mr Vyacehslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, said yesterday that
Mr Yeltsin had been displeased with the slow results of reform and the
splits and disagreements in the cabinet.
However, he said that Mr Yeltsin had 'no intention to press for changes',
and he denied all rumours of resignations and sackings.
According to Mr Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin had agreed with Mr Chernomyrdin that
bankruptcies should be instituted in the hopeless enterprises which had no
chance of becoming profitable - as long as these were 'under strong
control'. Mr Chernomyrdin has in the past few weeks laid increasing accent
on the need for bankruptcies, saying he has a list of enterprises slated for
closure.
The political climate has been heated following the dismissal of Mr Sergei
Shakhrai from the post of nationalities minister and his own resignation
from his parallel post as deputy prime minister. Though Mr Kostikov said
yesterday that Mr Yeltsin had not accepted Mr Shakhrai's resignation, he
also scolded him for his 'capriciousness and tendency to accumulate too many
jobs'.
Mr Shakhrai later said he had had no contact with the president.

FT  20 MAY 94 / US talks map out a new Bosnian future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Western and Russian negotiators convened in Washington yesterday to map out,
in the literal sense, a new partition of Bosnia which they will press the
warring parties to accept.
Yet with sanctions daily waning in effectiveness, and mounting domestic
controversy over Bosnia in the US, France and Russia, the window of
opportunity created by the new diplomatic initiative is a small one. The
contact group on Yugoslavia - made up of the US, Russia, Britain, France and
Germany - is fine-tuning a peace plan with the help of the US government's
sophisticated map-making equipment which can reproduce any terrain.
They want the parties, who have not met since February, to convene next
week, possibly in France. Since Serbs, Moslems, and Croats all have a stake
in appearing constructive, these talks stand a fair chance of taking place,
diplomats say.
Yet a marked improvement in the Serbian economy, and the mounting evidence
of substantial arms deliveries to the Moslem leadership in Bosnia, suggest
that the big powers may be running short of diplomatic leverage. Diplomats
in Belgrade say that unless a phased lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia
begins soon, the world community could be made to look ridiculous. There are
more cars on the streets of Belgrade, real wages have risen and fears of
hyperinflation have receded.
In Bosnia, a senior military official last week confirmed that the
government had received airlifts of weapons from Iran. The Moslem-Croat
truce has also made it easier to pick up arms deliveries at Croat ports and
airfields.
These developments are making almost irrelevant the furious debates in
Washington - where a powerful lobby wants to lift the arms embargo - and in
Moscow, where parliament wants an end to sanctions against the Serbs.
Rows in Washington and Moscow have served, however, to undermine the efforts
of the contact group to knock heads together. Moslem and Serb hardliners can
now reject the group's new proposals in the confidence that their stance
will find backers in Washington and Moscow respectively.
Moslems who favour fighting on will also take heart from events in France,
where the Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, the philosopher, has mounted a campaign for
an unequivocal support for the Bosnian government. France said yesterday
that a 'moment of decision' for its own presence on Bosnia might come on
June 13, when foreign ministers from the leading powers review progress.
Paris has already threatened to withdraw 2,500 of its 6,800 soldiers if
there were no movement.
In London the Foreign Office said an 'eight-week' deadline set by a UK
minister this week referred to the probable lifetime of the new diplomatic
initiative. A failure of the current drive would not automatically lead to a
troop pull-out, but it would bring such a step closer.

Crimea's parliament yesterday backed away from a vote on separating from
Ukraine and reuniting with Russia in the face of threats from the central
government and rumours of a troop build-up on the Black Sea peninsula, AP
reports from Kiev. 'It is a very hard moment for Crimea,' said Crimean
President Yuri Meshkov. 'We are being humiliated and forced to tolerate
illegal, unconstitutional actions,' he said, in reference to more warnings
from Kiev.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Flynn hits back in works councils row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner for social affairs, has accused critics of
Brussels' plans for trans-European works councils of misrepresenting the
facts.
Mr Flynn was taking aim at British employers' organisations he believes
sabotaged efforts to get voluntary arrangements for information and
consultation between both sides of industry.
The Irish commissioner said the cost of the directive - estimated at most at
Ecu10 per year per worker - was 'only a drop in the ocean when compared, for
example, with the corporate entertainment or sponsorship budgets' of up to
1,500 large EU companies likely to be affected.
Mr Flynn's broadside, on Tuesday night at the Irish-Belgian business
association's annual dinner, came a day after a vitriolic attack on him and
the Commission by Sir Michael Angus, the outgoing president of the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
It also comes before a keynote speech from Mr Jacques Delors scheduled for
next Thursday, at which the Commission president plans to go on the
offensive on European social policy for the first time since the UK won its
opt-out from the Maastricht treaty's Social Chapter in December 1991.
Mr Flynn said that after 23 years of discussion on works councils, the
Commission was under a clear mandate from 11 of the 12 member states and a
large majority in the directly-elected European Parliament to bring forward
legislation.
Despite this, it had activated the Social Chapter provision for unions and
employers to negotiate a voluntary framework, as preferable and more
flexible than a EU directive. This effort, Mr Flynn insisted, was scuttled
by the UK and its employers' organisations.
The modified directive, expected to be EU law by the end of the year, 'was a
logical complement to the single market,' the commissioner argued, and there
was no disagreement between Brussels and business about the need for it.
As we move into the 21st century, he said 'no measure which seeks to improve
information and consultation of employees can be incompatible with
competitiveness - it is quite the contrary.'
The Commission directive provides for minimum requirements on consultation
with elected works councils, but only if companies fail to agree a voluntary
arrangement sought by 100 employees or their representatives in at least two
member states. British companies in continental Europe, but not in the UK,
will be affected.
Employers confident that their workforce is happy with present arrangements
can relax, Mr Flynn said tartly: 'This proposal allows companies to do
nothing, it does allow them to continue their existing procedures. The only
thing it requires companies to have in order to do that is the consent of
their employees.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Bonn coalition split on president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With only three days to go before the election of a new state president,
Germany's governing coalition is in disarray over support for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's favoured candidate, constitutional court president Roman
Herzog.
The minority Free Democratic party, junior partner in the coalition, is
deeply divided between Mr Herzog and Mr Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic
party (SPD) candidate, who is a clear favourite in popular opinion polls.
At the same time, east German members of Mr Kohl's own Christian Democratic
Union are also grumbling openly about the choice of candidate, and
threatening to vote either for Mr Rau or for Mr Jens Reich, an independent
and the only east German of the four contenders.
The divisions have left the issue, to be decided on Monday by the
1,324-member federal assembly, still very close, although Mr Herzog remains
favourite.
The assembly, consisting of 662 members of the Bundestag, the directly
elected federal parliament, and the same number from the 16 state
parliaments, meets once every five years to elect a state president. The
vote is secret, and can consist of three ballots, requiring an absolute
majority for the winning candidate in the first two ballots, but only a
simple majority in the third.
The FDP's 111 votes are certain to decide the outcome, but if the party
splits, it could go either way. Neither the CDU and its Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union, with 619 votes, nor the SPD, with 502,
can gain the necessary majority on its own.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, former economics minister and FDP chairman in North
Rhine-Westphalia (where Mr Rau is premier), yesterday restated his support
for the SPD candidate, accusing Mr Herzog of being 'too conservative'.
At the same time Mr Gunther Krause, former transport minister and spokesman
for east German CDU members in parliament, expressed doubts about Mr
Herzog's identification with the east. He said that the judge, a close
associate of Chancellor Kohl, could not count on 'unconditional' eastern
support.
FDP officials confirmed yesterday that Mr Herzog had written a long letter
to Mr Werner Hoyer, party secretary-general, seeking to clarify his position
on foreigners living in Germany, and his opposition to any system of dual
nationality. He denied saying in press interviews that those who were not
prepared to take out German citizenship should leave the country - a
suggestion which had alienated many party members.
The greatest danger for Mr Herzog is that he will emerge with a bad result
in the first round of voting, in which he will also be opposed by the FDP's
own candidate, Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucher. If a significant number of
potential CDU/CSU members do not back him, he might reconsider his
candidacy.
However, a victory for Mr Rau requires solid support not only from his own
SPD, but also from the 44 Greens (who plan to vote for Mr Reich in the first
ballot), from a significant number of the FDP, and almost certainly from the
Democratic Socialists, the former East German Communist party.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and FDP party leader, is known to favour
Mr Herzog, to demonstrate his faith in the present Bonn coalition. If his
party does back Mr Rau, it would be seen as a death blow to the coalition,
and a clear bid by the FDP to switch partners in favour of the SPD after the
October general election. In the interim, the coalition would be fatally
undermined.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Lufthansa sell-off plan approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday approved plans for the progressive
privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline, and promised to reduce its
stake in a first step from 51.4 to 38 per cent, by not participating in a
DM515m (Pounds 206m) rights issue.
The three-phase process of privatisation would be completed as rapidly as
the capital markets allowed, possibly by the end of 1995, said Mr Matthias
Wissmann, transport minister.
The agreement thrashed out by Lufthansa, the transport and finance
ministries, and the state pensions fund (VBL) was approved by the cabinet
yesterday, after winning the support of unions and employees at the airline.
Lufthansa shareholders will be asked to approve the first step of the
process, the capital increase of DM515m, as well as an unspecified number of
special shares for employees, on top of the existing DM1.52bn nominal
capital, at their annual meeting on July 6.
Mr Wissmann confirmed that the government hoped to encourage the widest
possible range of shareholders in the privatised airline, but precise
details had yet to be worked out. He declined to comment on whether or how
foreign ownership of shares might be restricted, except to confirm that the
matter was under discussion.
He said that after the capital increase, the government hoped to sell a
first tranche of its remaining shareholding before the end of the year. A
second tranche to dispose of the entire state shareholding could be sold
before the end of 1995.
Lufthansa announced on Monday it expected to return to profit this year, and
paid its first dividend to ordinary shareholders since 1989. The European
Court yesterday rejected an Air France appeal against a decision by Brussels
in 1992 to authorise the purchase by British Airways of 49.9 per cent of
Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), a French airline. Air France had
claimed the acquisition could cause access problems on French air routes.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Retail sales defy tax increases: Treasury 'wise men' upbeat
on recovery - Bank warns against rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs that Britain's economic recovery is withstanding April's tax increases
were reinforced yesterday after an unexpected rise in monthly retail sales
and an upbeat verdict from Treasury advisers.
But although figures from the Central Statistical Office strengthened the
picture of subdued price rises, Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
governor, further damped hopes of an interest rate cut, stressing that now
was not the time 'to take risks on the side of inflation'.
Retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in April,
compared with March, and 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The British Retail
Consortium, the main industry body, said preliminary reports from retailers
indicated that the rise was continuing this month.
The figures surprised the City, which had predicted that April's tax
increases, coupled with the impact of an early Easter holiday, would depress
consumer spending.
Meanwhile, the Treasury said there was now a 'steady upward trend in retail
sales, which is further evidence of economic recovery'.
However, it warned that it was still too early to assess the full impact of
April's tax rises on consumer spending. Analysts stressed that the real
impact would not be known until the summer, when the full range of tax
increases began to bite into households' monthly budgets.
A report from the so-called 'wise men', the Treasury's panel of independent
forecasters, predicted that the recovery would withstand the tax rise, and
that growth in gross domestic product would be 2.9 per cent this year -
ahead of the government's forecast - and 2.8 per cent in 1995.
But although this optimistic message was supported by yesterday's sales
data, City analysts doubted whether the seasonal adjustment used in
calculating April's figure had accurately reflected the fact that Easter -
and the heavy pre-Easter shopping week - had occurred in March, not April,
this year.
The CSO admitted this meant 'there was more uncertainty surrounding the
figures than usual'. But the three-month figures, generally regarded as the
more accurate indicator of trends, showed that retail sales' volumes rose by
1 per cent between February and April, compared with the previous three
months. The data also underlined the low level of retail inflation, with the
total value of sales virtually unchanged between March and April, in spite
of the volume growth.
Nevertheless, Mr George warned against the danger of further cuts in
interest rates. Speaking to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, he
warned against easing policy 'in anticipation of a weakening of activity . .
. which may not materialise'. The governor pointed to the rise in average
earnings, announced on Wednesday, as a dangerous sign of inflationary
expectations.
His caution was echoed by the Treasury panel, four of whom said they saw
little need for a change in interest rates. However, all bar one of the six
panellists expect underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest
payments, to remain within the government's target range this year and next.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel failure to raise funds jeopardises rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel will be unable to raise much more than Pounds 600m of the Pounds
700m of senior bank debt it requires, according to its principal banking
creditors.
Its board must therefore decide whether it can launch a Pounds 850m rights
issue with less bank finance than planned.
'I simply do not know whether Pounds 600m of senior debt is enough,' said a
Eurotunnel director.
One company adviser said: 'The banks have got to come up with the extra
Pounds 100m.'
However, one of the leading bank creditors said: 'The syndicate (of 200
banks) has done what it can. After all, Pounds 600m is a lot of money.'
At the moment, banks have provided commitments for slightly more than Pounds
500m, and some of those holding out have indicated that they will make
contributions today. The new senior debt would take precedence over all
existing debt.
Bankers are planning to end their part of the fund-raising exercise early
next week, in the hope that the company can make do with less than Pounds
700m.
Leading corporate stockbrokers have advised Eurotunnel, however, that
underwriting the planned Pounds 850m issue will not be easy and increasing
the amount would be extremely difficult.
One positive development yesterday was that the required 90 per cent
majority vote of the banks has at last been achieved in favour of the
refinancing and a change in loan agreements, so that the company will no
longer be in breach of its covenants. The official deadline for this vote
was on Monday.
Eurotunnel runs out of cash next month. It needs to receive the necessary
funding from its banks by early next week, so that it can complete its
rights issue before the French holiday season begins in July.
Fund managers said valuing the shares was difficult given that the company
will not be generating enough cash to cover interest payments until 1998 and
paying nodividend until 2003.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Major steps up pressure on IRA to end violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government last night stepped up pressure on the IRA to halt its
25-year campaign of violence as it published a detailed commentary on
questions from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about last December's
Downing Street Declaration.
London's carefully worded text, which followed detailed consultations
between senior ministers including Mr John Major, the prime minister,
answered just one of the 20 questions directly, confirming that a referendum
on Northern Ireland's future would be the mechanism used to establish the
wishes of the province's people.
It said the rest of Sinn Fein's questions 'range much more widely' than
seeking elucidation of the text of the joint UK-Irish declaration.
London's response was warmly welcomed as 'comprehensive and positive' by
Dublin. Sinn Fein welcomed the fact that the government appeared to have
taken some trouble over its comments as a sign of its 'serious intent'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said later that the
remaining questions 'to some extent were invitations to negotiate', but
London was 'not going to negotiate, that is made very clear'.
By answering one of the questions and hence modifying its previous
insistence that the declaration did not need clarifying, London appeared to
be attempting to encourage republican doves, by giving them grounds for
proclaiming the exercise a success.
But ministers will hope to have reassured unionists and Conservative
backbenchers with its punctilious refusal to be drawn into negotiations.
Earlier this week, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to
portray the government's decision to respond at all as a victory, saying it
was 'gratifying' that people had now accepted clarification was needed.
Last night, Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman,
said he was 'pleased' that each of the questions had been addressed.
Sinn Fein would work 'in precise detail' through each of the answers and
provide a response in 'relatively quick time'.
Sir Patrick said he thought people would have been 'rather critical' if the
government had decided to leave the questions unanswered.
He added: 'We are facing something of great seriousness.' This was the
continuation of political violence when both the British and Irish
governments had agreed that the future should be decided by consent.
Praising London's response as 'comprehensive and positive', Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said it should 'help to clear the road'.
He was supported by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, who said:
'Sinn Fein should be able to welcome it . . . We feel very strongly that
this effort by the British government should end the logjam.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Minister rules out nuclear sell-off in current parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nuclear power industry is unlikely to be privatised before the next
election, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday.
Launching a wide-ranging review of the sector's future, Mr Eggar said of the
possible privatisation: 'It would not be practical to do it in this
parliament.'
His comments are a significant setback to the hopes of Nuclear Electric,
operator of nuclear power plants in England and Wales, which has been
pressing strongly for privatisation.
Although Mr Eggar did not elaborate on why an early sale was impractical,
the Department of Trade and Industry - where he is a minister - is already
preoccupied with privatisation of the Post Office, among other issues.
Privatisation of the nuclear industry would lead to a highly charged
political debate. Tories fear the Labour party could make political capital
of the issue in the run-up to a general election.
But Mr Eggar's dismissal of an early privatisation could annoy some in the
Treasury, where ministers are much more enthusiastic about a sell-off.
Differences of opinion between the Treasury and DTI are believed to have
been a factor in delaying the review, which the government had hoped to
start last year. The DTI's review of the nuclear power industry will run in
tandem with a Department of Environment inquiry, also announced yesterday,
into the disposal of radioactive waste.
The preliminary results of this investigation are due to be announced in the
summer and are likely to feed into the nuclear power review, which will
probably last longer.
Environmental organisations welcomed the waste review yesterday, saying it
would expose problems that would make the power industry more difficult to
privatise in the long term.
In spite of Mr Eggar's caution, the DTI has agreed to consider privatisation
as a key element of its review, which will also focus on the economic and
commercial viability of new nuclear stations.
The government imposed a moratorium on building nuclear power stations other
than Sizewell B in Suffolk when it excluded nuclear power from its plans to
privatise the electricity industry in 1989.
The government said its review would not consider whether Sizewell B should
be brought on stream as planned by Nuclear Electric later this year. This
was a matter for 'appropriate ministers and authorities'.
The review will also consider nuclear waste and decommissioning liabilities.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Brussels to scrap steel industry rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission threw EU steel producers into confusion yesterday
after a surprise announcement that it was scrapping its plans to rescue the
crisis-stricken industry.
The announcement came from Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner,
and co-architect of the 12-month-old steel rescue plan, who left the
industry uncertain as to whether this was a tactical move or the end of the
plan.
Hopes for achieving an essential 5m extra tonnes of capacity cuts from Italy
were scuppered after Mr Van Miert suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands
of his fellow commissioners at a meeting on Wednesday evening.
They were alarmed by the dubious legality of the use of state funds for
restructuring at the privately owned Bresciani steel mills of northern
Italy.
Mr Van Miert said the Italian reductions represented the last hope for
achieving a minimum 19m tonnes of capacity cuts considered necessary to save
the industry.
'The plan is dead,' said Mr Van Miert. 'It is obvious we are not going to
get near the target. But don't blame us. We tried.'
But during the meeting, Sir Leon Brittan, the external affairs commissioner,
backed by the commission's legal department, pointed out that the deal would
be difficult to reconcile with European law. It would also jeopardise
negotiations for a multinational steel agreement and contravene the
subsidies code of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Sir Leon's case rested on the fact that state aid offered to the Bresciani
mills in return for the capacity cuts contravened European law. This says
that state aid can only be offered to steel companies in return for
permanent closure. At Bresciani the aid was destined for companies proposing
only partial closure.
In spite of Mr Van Miert's strong words and obvious anger, senior Commission
officials yesterday stressed that the steel plan's so-called death had been
exaggerated. With the crisis in the industry far from resolved,
commissioners are unlikely to throw out the package entirely.
Nonetheless, big doubts about its viability remain. The 11m tonnes of
capacity cuts achieved so far fall well short of the plan's aim for minimum
cuts of 19m tonnes. Even if the Commission had accepted Mr Van Miert's
latest proposals, this would only have achieved, at most, a further 5m
tonnes of cuts - still well short of the target.
In addition, the private, unsubsidised steel sector has been leery of
accepting a rescue package that involves giving state aid to subsidised
enterprises.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK reply to Sinn Fein welcomed by Dublin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government last night called on Irish republican leaders to halt the
IRA's 25-year campaign of violence as it published a detailed commentary on
questions from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about last December's
Downing Street Declaration.
London's carefully worded text, which followed detailed consultations
between senior ministers including Mr John Major, the prime minister,
answered just one of the 20 questions directly, confirming that, if
necessary, a referendum would be held to establish the wishes of the
Northern Irish people concerning the province's future. It said the rest of
Sinn Fein's questions 'range much more widely' than seeking elucidation of
the test of the joint UK-Irish declaration.
London's response was warmly welcomed as 'comprehensive and positive' by
Dublin. Sinn Fein said it would examine the government's comments and reply
to them later.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said later that the
remaining questions 'to some extent were invitations to negotiate', but
London was 'not going to negotiate, that is made very clear'.
By answering one of the questions and hence modifying its previous
insistence that the declaration did not need clarifying, London appeared to
be trying to encourage republican doves, giving them grounds for proclaiming
the exercise a success.
But ministers will hope to have reassured unionists and Conservative
backbenchers with its punctilious refusal to be drawn into negotiations.
Earlier this week, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to
portray the government's decision to respond at all as a victory, saying it
was 'gratifying' that people had now accepted clarification was needed.
Asked last night why the government had decided against leaving the
questions unanswered, Sir Patrick said he thought people would have been
'rather critical' of such a decision.
He added: 'We are facing something of great seriousness.' This was the
continuation of political violence when both the British and Irish
governments had agreed that the future should be decided by consent.
Praising London's response as 'comprehensive and positive', Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said it should 'help to clear the road'.
He was supported by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, who said
that London had made 'a very serious effort' to meet the concerns of Sinn
Fein.
'Sinn Fein should be able to welcome it . . . We feel very strongly that
this effort by the British government should end the logjam.'
Lord Holme, the Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, urged the IRA
to declare an immediate ceasefire. 'The IRA has seriously misjudged the mood
in Britain and the Irish Republic,' he said. 'Their support deserves to
dwindle even further if they procrastinate another day.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hungarian rescue costs WestLB
DM32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB), the German bank, said yesterday its
investment in WestLB Hungaria had grown to DM72m (Dollars 42.3m) because of
the cost of bailing out its troubled Budapest-based subsidiary.
In addition to the DM40m purchase price paid in 1992, WestLB injected DM32m
into the bank in December, diluting minority shareholders and lifting
WestLB's stake to 96 per cent from 60 per cent.
This was necessary because provisioning for bad loans and investments
dragged WestLB Hungaria to a loss of Ft1.89bn (Dollars 19m) in 1993 and left
its capital adequacy well below the Ft1bn minimum set by Hungarian
regulators.
Mr Dieter Falke, board member of the Dusseldorf-based regional bank, denied
the investment in the bank was a mistake: 'We undoubtedly came two years
earlier than we should have.'
WestLB blamed last year's results on the hangover from its Hungarian unit's
earlier incarnation as Altalanos Vallalkozasi Bank (AVB), a joint venture
bank in which WestLB took a minority stake in 1992.
Hungary's state banking supervisor closed down AVB on discovering the bank
was unstable. WestLB rescued AVB, changed the bank's name and is turning it
into a subsidiary.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oleksandr Moroz was yesterday elected chairman of the new Ukrainian
parliament in a secret ballot. The selection of Mr Moroz, leader of the
Socialist party, is the first important decision taken by Ukraine's new
legislature, but its significance is unclear. On one hand, Mr Moroz's
election to one of the most powerful posts in the Ukrainian government
suggests that most MPs lean towards the Socialist party's anti-reform
platform and favour the restoration of closer ties with Russia. However,
Socialist MPs do not hold a majority of the seats in parliament.
Ukrainian observers have suggested that Mr Moroz, who is known to be a
Ukrainian patriot, may have entered into an unlikely alliance with Rukh, the
pro-reform, democratic nationalist faction in the legislature. No matter
which political line Mr Moroz eventually takes, it was apparent from his
acceptance speech that the new parliamentary chairman aims to continue the
heated constitutional battle in Ukraine. In a veiled attack on President
Leonid Kravchuk, who is struggling to retain his grip on the nation, Mr
Moroz said that the legislature, rather than the presidency, should be the
centre of governmental authority.
Ukraine still has no post-Soviet constitution and is ruled by a Soviet-era
document, amended so many times that it is unclear which branches have which
powers.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Russia fails to persuade Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato ambassadors yesterday rebuffed Moscow's demand for an alternative to
the Partnership for Peace arrangement, in a move that casts a shadow over
next week's visit to Brussels by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence
minister.
Gen Grachev has stated that Russia is not prepared simply to join the queue
of east European countries which are signing up to PFP, an arrangement that
provides for joint exercises and an exchange of military knowhow.
At a meeting in Brussels yesterday, the ambassadors said the most they could
promise was 'dialogue and co-operation' of a kind that reflected Russia's
importance in European security.
However, this dialogue would be in addition to Russian adherence to PFP, not
a substitute. An alliance spokesman said Nato 'looked forward' to Russia
subscribing to the partnership, which already has 18 members.
'We do not like the term special relationship,' said a Nato official, adding
that any links between Russia and the alliance must be transparent and stop
short of giving Moscow a veto over future decisions by the alliance.
The official said that there could be no question of Nato and Russia
exercising a condominium over the smaller states of central and eastern
Europe.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, is understood to be pressing
for some concession to Russian sensitivities. He was impressed by the
arguments put forward in Germany last week by President Boris Yeltsin, who
said he was under increasing pressure from hardliners.
Mr Volker Ruhe, Bonn's defence minister, is believed to be pressing a
tougher line, insisting that Russian objections should not be allowed to
obstruct the growing relationship between Germany and its neighbours to the
east.
This week's German-Dutch initiative to upgrade the 52-nation Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe - a move which Moscow will warmly
welcome - prompted speculation that Mr Yeltsin had negotiated some sort of
trade-off in Bonn.
However, the contrast between the stated positions of Nato and Russia
remained so wide after yesterday's meeting that considerable effort will be
needed to paper over the cracks. It is conceivable that the Russians will
present Nato's promise of an upgraded 'dialogue' as a concession to their
demands, and that some western countries will save Russia's face by publicly
concurring.
But the position sketched out by Nato ambassadors yesterday - which did not
amount to a formal decision - falls far short of meeting Russia's demand
that it become a co-designer of any co-operation efforts. Gen Grachev, a
former paratrooper who won prominence in the war in Afghanistan, is thought
to be a pragmatist in matters of links with Nato: keen to derive any
possible advantage if this can be done without exposing Russia to
humiliation.
The defence minister would not want to miss any opportunity to receive a
western blessing for its 'peace-keeping' forces in the smaller ex-Soviet
republics, where Russian influence remains strong.
Among the older generation of officers who continue to dominate Russia's
general staff, hostility to the Atlantic alliance, which they spent most of
their careers confronting, runs much deeper.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Europe threatens clash with US over aircraft subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European aerospace manufacturers are threatening to call on the European
Union to tear up its two-year-old agreement with the US on civil aircraft
subsidies unless Washington accepts tighter curbs on support to the US
industry.
The threat follows extensive consultation between the European industry and
the European Commission ahead of today's resumed negotiations in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on international rules covering aircraft
subsidies.
If the EU renounced the bilateral agreement, it could trigger a serious
transatlantic trade dispute. US manufacturers say they would respond by
renewing complaints in the Gatt that government support to the four-nation
European Airbus programme is illegal.
In that event, European manufacturers say they would consider invoking Gatt
dispute procedures and pressing for action against US aircraft sales under
hitherto unused EU rules designed to punish subsidised foreign exports.
The EU-US agreement can be abrogated by either side at one year's notice. If
the EU renounced it, the grace period could allow further attempts to
negotiate a settlement.
The European manufacturers' threat reflects growing frustration with the
workings of the bilateral accord and what they consider US refusal to
negotiate seriously on a wider and more comprehensive Gatt agreement.
The main stumbling block is Washington's reluctance to accept tighter curbs
on 'indirect' support for purposes such as research and development.
The European manufacturers - Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and
Dasa of Germany - claim the US has not fulfilled obligations to limit such
support under the bilateral agreement.
They say Washington is balking at a Gatt agreement because that could limit
extensive US government support for aero-engine manufacturers and call into
question large commercial aircraft research programmes funded by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The Gatt talks were adjourned in December after the US rejected a draft
agreement acceptable to the 21 other governments.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Berlusconi narrowly wins vote in Senate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new prime minister, last night cleared a major
hurdle when his rightwing cabinet narrowly won a vote of confidence in the
Italian Senate.
Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance lacked an absolute majority in the 326-seat
senate, and he was forced to rely on the absence of some senators and the
abstention of others during the motion, which he won by a handful of votes.
With the vote behind him, Mr Berlusconi can now begin to flesh out the
details of deregulating the economy, relaxing Italy's rigid labour laws and
reforming taxes which he announced earlier this week would be the
centrepiece of his first 100 days.
The closeness of the vote yesterday underlined the difficulties facing the
media magnate turned politician in sustaining his government in office over
the medium term.
The three-day debate in the senate showed many politicians were concerned
about the composition of the new government with its five ministers drawn
from the neo-fascist MSDI/ National Alliance and the presence of the
populist Northern League.
The small but influential group of senators belonging to centrist parties
spawned by the demise of the Christian Democrats were those most clearly
caught in a dilemma. They did not wish to be seen responsible for bringing
down the government before it started operating. Equally they did not wish
to be seen giving Mr Berlusconi a helping hand. It was thus convenient that
some chose to be discreetly absent.
Before yesterday's vote, the combined strength of the opposition in the
progressive block led by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS) and the centre headed by the Popular Party (PPI) was 152 against the
government's 156.
The debate produced few surprises with the parties defending already well
publicised views. However, Mr Berlusconi went some way to reassure trade
unions that he would respect a wage and productivity agreement signed with
the employers and government last July.

<TEXT>
Mr Dale Hanson is to step down as head of the California Public Employees
Retirement System (Calpers), the biggest US public pension plan with around
Dollars 80bn under management, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Hanson, 51, announced his intention to resign at a board meeting in
Annaheim, California yesterday.
While Calpers declined to give further reasons for Mr Hanson's departure, it
said: 'It is of his own choice. The resignation was not forced or asked for
by the board.'
Mr Hanson will explain his reasons publicly today, Calpers added.
His departure signals an upheaval in the senior management at one of the
world's biggest investment institutions. It comes just six weeks after the
retirement of Mr DeWitt Bowman, Calpers' long-standing chief investment
officer, who had built a reputation as the US's most activist shareholder.
Mr Bowman's job has in effect been left unfilled. His successor, Ms Sheryl
Pressler, a former fund manager at the McDonnell Douglas pension fund, is
not due to start work full-time at Calpers until July.
Mr Hanson is expected to announce that he will continue as chief executive
until a replacement has been found.

FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oils pressured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil shares met increasing pressure as the session wore on, hit by a further
decline in crude oil prices, which stayed firmly below the Dollars 16 a
barrel level, and following persistent selling pressure by US investors. The
US selling was thought to have been triggered by a shift of stance on
Chevron by Dean Witter Reynolds, one of the influential US broking houses.
British Petroleum shares were badly affected by the US selling, sliding 8 to
394p amid heavy turnover of 14m. Shell Transport lost 5 1/2 at 736 1/2 p on
relatively high volume of 7.6m.
The Enterprise/Lasmo bid battle rumbled on, with the former easing 2 to 425p
on minimal turnover ahead of this morning's annual meeting. Lasmo was
unmoved at 153p.
Hopes of good news from Argentina continued to drive Monument Oil &amp; Gas,
which edged ahead  1/2 to 73 1/2 p.
British Gas's move to sell its stake in Bow Valley had little effect on the
share price, which softened 2 to 279 1/2 p, but pleased sector analysts, who
expect the group to report first-quarter net income little changed at Pounds
650m this morning.
Brewing, betting and hotel group Bass unveiled figures ahead of market
expectations, but the shares were pulled back by profit-taking as well as by
continuing concerns over the brewing operations. The stock fell 8 to 535p in
turnover of 3.9m. There were good performances from the hotels division and
the pub retailing side.
NatWest Securities lifted its figures for the full year by Pounds 14m to
Pounds 549m, while Kleinwort Benson increased its forecast by a similar
number to Pounds 534m. Both houses have the stock as a hold.
The weak brewing figures hit Whitbread, off 11 at 548p, although a switcher
into Scottish &amp; Newcastle helped the shares recover slightly to finish a net
3 down at 550p. Guinness firmed 1 1/2 to 493 1/2 p ahead of today's annual
meeting.
Across the board demand for the UK clearing banks helped Barclays move up 6
to 543p and National Westminster firm 4 to 458p.
Standard Chartered failed to maintain good early progress, which followed a
profits upgrade by Cazenove, and settled 3 lighter at 258p, with the stock
hit during the afternoon by selling carried out by Hoare Govett.
Strong support for the Hong Kong stocks by NatWest Securities helped HSBC
move ahead 11 to 732p.
General Accident was the pick of the composites, the shares climbing 12 to
583p after a bear squeeze and strong support from Hoare Govett.
Lombard Insurance made a satisfactory debut, with the stock holding rock
steady at the placing price of 161p.
There were no real surprises for the market in National Power's preliminary
results, which came out at the very top end of market estimates. The 18 per
cent increase in the dividend was well received by the market, where
NatPower shares touched 442p before closing a net 2 firmer at 439p. Turnover
was a hefty 7.5m, the highest single day's business in the stock this year.
PowerGen rose 11 to 495p, while Scottish Hydro added 8 at 347p and Scottish
Power 3 at 362p. In the 'recs', East Midland appreciated 18 to 582p and
Southern 5 to 594p.
Further acquisition talk buoyed Airtours shares, which added 15 1/2 at 490
1/2 p. The tour group, which recently bought a Scandinavian travel outfit,
is said to be eyeing another European purchase.
A gloomy trading statement from Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the discount food
retailer, contributed to a general retreat across the sector. Nurdin shares
finished 9 cheaper at 200p.
Among stores stocks, Kingfisher's good run continued, underpinned by strong
buy notes from UBS and Robert Fleming on Monday. Dealers said that Gerrard
Vivian Gray had also been positive. The shares jumped 18 to 582p.
Turnover in freight group NFC stood at 31m shares by the close and the stock
was a penny firmer at 220p. An integrated broking division of one of the
large UK clearing banks was believed to have attempted a placing of around
15m shares. The move was thought to have been only partially successful.
News that USAir is delaying the delivery of 40 aircraft weakened sentiment
in 25 per cent stakeholder British Airways, which retreated 6 to 379p in
volume of 4.4m shares.
British Aerospace receded 9 to 475p, with overseas investors said to have
led the selling. The company announced for the second time this week that
holdings by overseas investors had exceeded the 29.5 per cent level, the
maximum allowed under its articles of association.
Turnover in Lucas Industries rose to 11m and the shares shed a penny to
188p. The Seaq screen indicated that a single block of 9m shares was dealt
at 190p.

FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reckitt upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman nosedived after the
company's chairman gave a grim message to shareholders at the annual
meeting.
Sir Michael Colman said the year had 'started slowly' and that trading was
turning out to be as difficult as in 1993.
Reckitt, trading 3 higher at 677p immediately before the meeting, dropped
sharply as the news filtered into the market, eventually closing a net 40
down at 634p. Turnover in the shares reached 3.2m, the second highest single
day's business this year.

FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: US West moves on telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was strong demand for the big telecoms stocks throughout the day and
ahead of the startling news, released after the market closed, that US West
International, the American telecoms group, is to announce 'a major UK
acquisition' this morning.
Analysts said there were no strong rumours to link US West with any of the
big quoted stocks in London. A bid for Vodafone was ruled out, as was a move
to acquire Mercury, telecoms subsidiary of Cable and Wireless.
US West has a half-share in the One-to-One cellular phone business, along
with C&amp;W, and is involved with various cable television groups.
BT, scheduled to announce preliminary figures this morning, edged up 2 1/2
to 379p, and Cable and Wireless, helped by buy recommendations from
Cazenove, NatWest Securities and Merrill Lynch, put on 6 1/2 at 464 1/2 p.
Vodafone held at 527p on its highest daily volume this year, 9.8m.
Securicor, which along with Security Services has a 40 per cent stake in
Cellnet, advanced 9 to 865p.

FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reversed after latest
earnings data - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The joy with which the London stock market yesterday greeted the decisive
action overnight by the US Federal Reserve proved shortlived. Early gains
soon melted away when the latest data on UK average earnings undermined any
lingering hopes for a base rate cut and US markets opened the new session on
the downside.
The FT-SE 100 Index jumped to 3,157.5 as soon as trading opened, but it was
soon clear that investors were not prepared to buy shares at these levels.
The news that average earnings in the UK had risen by 4 per cent in March
hit the market early, and although British government bonds remained very
firm, shares gave further ground as base rate hopes were well-nigh
extinguished.
By the close the FT-SE 100 was a net 7 points off at 3,116.5, virtually the
day's low. Gloom deepened at the close when the Dow Industrial Average was
showing a fall of 14 points and US Federal bonds were struggling to hold
early gains.
The very modest buying support at the opening was replaced in the second
half of the session by some determined selling. Seaq volume of 722.4m shares
compared with only 638.5m in the previous session. Tuesday's equity business
was worth Pounds 1.25bn at retail level, maintaining the healthy turnover
levels of recent sessions.
In technical terms, it was a disappointing day. Dealers noted that there was
heavy selling of stock index futures when the Footsie index reached the
3,150 area, which is seen as the top end of the current trading range. The
past few trading sessions have seen selling of put options on the FT-SE 100
Index, and yesterday's performance appeared to be a further indication that
investors remain cautious on UK equities.
London was caught between the move to higher rates in the US and to lower
rates in Europe. German money market repo rates were trimmed again and hopes
rose of a cut in rates in France today.
But the increase in domestic earnings levels, which is known to be one of
the Bank of England's chief concerns, provided a sharp reminder for the
market that the next move in domestic interest rates will probably be
upwards. Nervousness over the interest rate outlook was heightened by
publication of details of the routine meeting between the Governor of the
Bank of England and the UK chancellor of the exchequer at the end of March.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less affected by stock index futures
considerations, held on to part of its early gains to finish a net 4.5
higher at 3,711.7.
Analysts said that the near-term outlook for equities will depend on how the
bond markets settle down now that the Federal Reserve has suggested that it
has achieved its preferred stance on US monetary policy. Stable yields on UK
bonds are seen as the necessary underpinning for any sustained advance by
equities beyond the Footsie 3,100 mark. Traders were prepared to see
yesterday as a day of technical manoeuvring following the widely expected
move by the Fed. Some profit-taking was inevitable and it may take the
market several sessions to stabilise itself.
While corporate statements played a less prominent role, there was strength
in the generating sector, where a higher dividend from National Power
emphasised the safe yield attractions of the utility sectors.

FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher than expected UK average earnings, together with initial weakness on
Wall Street, reversed early strength in the derivatives sector, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,145 on the back of
the firm overnight performance on Wall Street that followed the increase in
US interest rates. Within minutes of the start of business, June was trading
at 3,160, with sentiment boosted by a steady performance in other European
markets.
However, a further advance was cut short with the release of average
earnings data, interpreted as a further blow to chances of a reduction in UK
interest rates.
The contract drifted lower on concerted selling, with the poor start to
trading in New York only serving to increase the downward pressure on June.
Having fallen to a low of 3,106, the contract closed at 3,110, down 14 from
its previous close and at a 10-point discount to the fair value premium of
about minus 3. Volume at 18,009 lots was good.
Healthy turnover was also recorded in traded options, where 44,895 lots were
dealt, In the index options, 16,224 were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and
3,682 in the Euro FT-SE option. BT was the busiest stock option with a total
of 4,802 contracts.

Toronto closed slightly higher in moderate trading, extending its advance to
four straight sessions. The TSE-300 index added 8.9 at 4,278.0 and rises led
declines by 422 to 346. Volume was 66.5m shares.
Eight of the 14 stock groups rose. The golds, banks, industrial products and
mining sectors were firmer, while energy stocks recorded the day's biggest
decline, a fall of nearly 1 per cent.

A mild inflow of foreign money to the market due to expectations of stable
US interest rates left share prices 8.6 per cent stronger on the Sao Paulo
stock exchange. The Bovespa index ended 1,425 points higher at 17,909.
Volume came to Cr296.5bn (Dollars 183.8m).
Analysts said that lower inflation forecasts, which have dragged down
Brazilian nominal long-term interest rates over the last few days, also
helped the stock market's performance. Brazil June inflation forecasts were
revised down by a full percentage point to 45.5 per cent.

<TEXT>
Emerging markets continue to suffer setbacks, with Greece the latest
casualty, writes John Pitt.  After a rapid increase in interest rates as the
government struggled to defend the drachma, the country's equity market went
into reverse.  Shares fell a further 2 per cent yesterday, closing at the
lowest point this year and down 22 per cent since the start of the year.
Little wonder then that some commentators are highlighting potential growth
areas in others parts of the world.  Kleiman International Consultants notes
that and 'acceleration of planned economic liberalisation programmes has in
recent months reversed bourse stagnation throughout the Mediterranean
region'.  Kleiman says securities activity was picking up on the informal
Cyprus OTC market, and in Lebanon through the recent over-subscription to
Solidere, which plans to rebuild central Beirut.

FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow further improves on Fed's
action
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices improved yesterday as the welcome response to the Federal
Reserve's bold move to tighter money carried over into a second trading
session, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 12.28 higher at 3,732.89, after
pulling out of a modest mid-morning decline, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
gained 4.32 at 453.69. Advances outnumbered falls by 1,632 to 664 after
heavy volume of 337.7m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE
composite was 2.92 up at 434.90. A solid rebound by slumping technology
stocks boosted the Nasdaq composite by 10.37 to 721.89.
In spite of a 49-point advance by the Dow industrials in the previous
session, the market was spared a round of widespread profit-taking. In early
activity, most issues held close to their opening values as investors sifted
through the implications of the Fed's decision on Tuesday to lift two
short-term interest rates.
The central bank's move encouraged the rally in equities because it was
accompanied by an announcement suggesting that the Fed would suspend a
series of monthly tightenings which began in early February. The policy
shift had set off a decline of more than 9 per cent in share prices.
One reason stocks failed to make further headway yesterday morning was a
modest decline by the benchmark 30-year government securities stock.
Treasury investors were somewhat concerned by the dollar's failure to
respond positively to Tuesday's rate increases. Its continued weakness
raised the possibility that the Fed may have little choice but to take
further action to prop up the currency.
But in the equity markets, a late wave of program-guided buying was enough
to offset weakness in a few pivotal stocks depressing the Dow for much of
the day. British Steel ended Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 18 1/8, AT&amp;T
added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 and Sears rose Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 49 1/8.
Chevron closed Dollars 1 3/4 down at Dollars 86 3/8 after Dean Witter
Reynolds trimmed its second-quarter earnings estimate for the company by 10
cents to Dollars 1.25 a share. The securities house said the same weakness
in refining and marketing which was hurting Chevron could affect other
energy groups.
Financial issues were actively traded following Tuesday's move by many
commercial banking groups to raise their prime lending rates in response to
the Fed's policy adjustment. Citicorp put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 5/8
in heavy trade of 3.3m shares. BankAmerica was Dollars 1 1/8 better at
Dollars 49.
In technology, International Business Machines was near the top of the
NYSE's most active list. The stock dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 on
reports that Compaq Computers had become Europe's leading computer marketer.
Compaq jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 104 5/8 .
The Nasdaq, a laggard in Tuesday's general advance, played catch-up
yesterday, largely because of a rebound by software stocks which were hit
hard in the previous session. Lotus Development recovered Dollars 3 7/8 to
Dollars 55 7/8 and Wellfleet gained Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 30 5/8.

FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volvo ahead after better than
expected results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in US interest rates overnight on Tuesday provided markets with an
early opportunity to advance, but this was not sustained in many cases.
STOCKHOLM featured Volvo, which gained SKr10 at SKr768 in the 'B' shares
after the vehicle manufacturer came in with results that exceeded
expectations. The shares had been actively traded prior to the results,
rising by some 5 per cent.
Commenting on the figures, James Capel in London said that it had increased
its full year forecast from SKr11bn to SKr13bn and expected 1994 earnings
per share to reach SKr80, rising to SKr95 in 1995.
The Affarsvarlden General index finished 9.00 down at 1,543.50. Turnover
amounted to SKr3.6bn.
FRANKFURT just failed to breach its record high, with the Dax index closing
the official session up 7.70 at 2,267.41. In the post-bourse the index
declined to close at 2,254.21. Turnover came to DM8.8bn.
Among the active stocks, BMW fell DM17.50, or 1.8 per cent, to DM939.50
ahead of results due out today.
In contrast Linde put on DM17.00 or 1.8 per cent to DM943.00 after the
engineering group said that it might lift its dividend this year. It said
that it expected a rise in sales of 10 per cent this year.
Daimler-Benz, which held its annual meeting yesterday, lost DM3.50 to
DM890.00. The group reported a rise in first quarter turnover of some 20 per
cent.
ZURICH gave up most of its early gains as a weak futures market and Wall
Street's hesitant mood triggered late profit-taking.
The SMI index finished 13.5 ahead at 2,740.6, after positing an earlier high
of 2,773.8.
Roche certificates paused after their strong performance earlier in the
week, giving up SFr25 to SFr6,680, although it was still the day's most
actively traded issue.
Banks and insurers put in a strong performance on hopes for steady or lower
long term interest rates. UBS bearers rose SFr18 to SFr1,151 and Zurich
Insurance was SFr32 higher at SFr1,372.
CS Holding, which said it had no immediate comment on a report quoting its
chairman as saying he hoped to make a written offer for
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, added SFr6 to SFr621.
Brown Boveri finished SFr13 higher at SFr1,288 after ABB released first
quarter results that were near the upper end of analysts expectations.
Among the smaller issues, Saurer rose SFr40 to SFr3,050 after the company
reported that 1993 profits more than doubled than said that it planned a new
corporate and capital structure.
PARIS was hit by profit-taking following a string of upward moves in recent
days. The CAC-40 index slipped 11.18 to 2,183.99 in turnover of FFr4.5bn,
having opened higher in reaction to the overnight news from the US.
Oil stocks continued to ebb, with Elf Aquitaine down FFr2.70 to FFr427.00.
MILAN moved strongly ahead at the opening before profit-taking emerged to
trim gains as the Comit index appeared to be heading for resistance at the
815-820 level, and ahead of the the parliamentary vote of confidence on the
government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, scheduled to come after the market
closed. The Comit index finished 4.66 higher at 806.28.
Blue chip industrials felt the effects of the change of mood with Fiat
losing L50 to L7,138, Pirelli L22 to L3,000 and Montedison L13 to L1,520.
But the telecommunications sector was mixed. Sip rose L65 to L4,689 ahead of
today's vote to give the go-ahead to the Telecom Italia fusion, but Stet
fell back L19 to L5,689.
AMSTERDAM edged higher in the absence of major domestic news. The AEX index
added 2.33 to 416.04.
Profit-taking was in order on a number of major issues, such as Royal Dutch,
off Fl 1.40 at Fl 206.20, while PolyGram slipped Fl 1.30 to Fl 79.00.
However, strength was provided from financials and publishers in general,
with Wolters Kluwer adding Fl 5.50 to Fl 117.90 and Elsevier Fl 2.40 to Fl
177.40.
MADRID saw late profit taking take the shine off the day's performance
although prices still extended their rally to seven days. The General index
rose 1.87 to 336.78 in volume of Pta44bn.
Banks were out of favour as investors switched their attention to electric
and motorway stocks. Santander fell Pta120 or 1.9 per cent to Pta6,230 but
Banesto was Pta5 higher at Pta1,125.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg posted its third consecutive decline as the market continued to
correct from recent highs. This week's lethargic performance has been
attributed to gold price weakness, light foreign and local selling and
nervousness about future economic policy.
The overall index fell 69 to 5,388, industrials ended 62 lower at 6,571
after Tuesday's 74-point drop, and golds also lost 62 to 1,773.
De Beers was R1.25 softer at R107.75, Anglos shed R4.50 to R228 and Gold
Fields dipped R3 to R103. But rand hedges Richemont and Lonrho both posted
gains, rising 15 cents and 22 cents to R40.65 and R10.37 respectively.

FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei sees gains eroded
as Hong Kong surges 4.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in US interest rates and the strong rally on Wall Street initially
encouraged investors, but later arbitrage selling and profit-taking due to
the higher yen eroded most of the earlier gains, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average finished 19.20 up at 20,152.73 after a day's high of
20,285.96 and low of 19,965.79. The yen rose against the dollar in spite of
previous expectations that the yen would ease against the dollar on a rate
cut.
Institutional investors stepped up selling in the afternoon session, but
buying by overseas investors provided underlying support.
Volume totalled 300m shares, against 249m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks lost 1.74 at 1,634.69 and the Nikkei 300 eased 0.25 to
298.88. Falls led advances by 517 to 460, with 195 issues unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.55 to 1,329.19.
In spite of the immediate reaction on the financial markets, some economists
said the US discount rate and federal fund rate rise would have positive
effects on the yen and the economy in the medium term.
'The real yield differential between Japan and the US will mean that capital
flows will support the dollar,' said Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at
James Capel. The yen's easing, which may start around the end of July,
coupled with the apparent softening stance on trade of US officials, could
also help consumer confidence, he said.
Sanyo Electric, the most active issue of the day on foreign buying, rose Y5
to Y525 on reports that it would start marketing portable telephones in the
UK from September.
Hitachi firmed Y10 to Y1,010 and Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y10
at Y1,720, but Sony fell Y60 to Y5,940 and Victor retreated Y40 to Y1,360 on
the higher yen.
Arbitrage selling depressed banks. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened Y50 to
Y3,220 and Mitsubishi Bank shed Y20 to Y2,740.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for investor confidence, fell
Y10,000 to Y879,000, while East Japan Railway receded Y3,000 to Y504,000.
Companies which have announced favourable business results over the past few
days were strong. Aiwa, the consumer electronics company, moved ahead Y80 to
Y2,680 and Uni-Charm put on Y30 at Y2,960 and Ajinomoto advanced Y20 to
Y1,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 43.08 to 22,323.85 in volume of 21.5m
shares.
Roundup
The Fed's move to tighten US monetary policy was in line with expectations,
but still gave a fillip to some Pacific Rim markets. Seoul was closed for a
holiday.
HONG KONG surged 4.8 per cent, cheered by the US interest rate developments
and the announcement of plans to resume Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's
airport.
The Hang Seng index rose 431.94 to 9,476.64, just below its peak for the day
of 9,477.33, in turnover that jumped to a hefty HKDollars 6.71bn, from a
revised HKDollars 5.04bn on Tuesday.
Property issues led the rise. Cheung Kong advanced HKDollars 2 to HKDollars
39.75, Henderson Land HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 43.50 and SHK Properties
HKDollars 4.25 to HKDollars 53.
KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by institutional buying of Tenaga Nasional which
left the composite index up 18.31, or 1.9 per cent, at 1,010.27.
Tenaga, which accounts for 20 per cent weightage on the index, rose 70 cents
to MDollars 14.10 in volume of 1.6m shares after the company clarified
details of its foreign exchange losses.
BANGKOK advanced 1.7 per cent, the SET index rising 22.62 to 1,325.47 in
heavy turnover of Bt12.2bn.
Construction materials and electronic component issues saw some early
profit-taking, but bargain hunting sent the finance sector 5.2 per cent
ahead in turnover of Bt5.4bn.
SYDNEY faltered in afternoon trade but still ended firmer in response to
buoyant commodity prices and positive news from overseas which had sparked
strong morning gains. The All Ordinaries index finished 11.8 higher at
2,107.8, but profit-taking took the index off the day's peak of 2,120.4.
Volume was 237.7m shares.
WELLINGTON saw demand from Asia and Australia which took the NZSE-40 capital
index 37.06 higher to 2,155.10 in healthy turnover of NZDollars 52.7m.
SINGAPORE saw some institutional demand for blue chips, and the Straits
Times Industrial index rose 18.67 to 2,323.16 in volume of 144.9m shares.
Yeo Hiap Seng shares were actively traded, aided by news that Orchard Parade
Holdings had raised its stake. The YHS shares closed 8 cents stronger at
SDollars 3.90.
TAIPEI continued its consolidation, the weighted index losing 32.58 to
5,983.25 in turnover that fell to TDollars 62.8bn from Tuesday's TDollars
67.29bn.
MANILA was worried about investigations into Bancapital Development
Corporation, an unlicensed investment house that appeared to have closed
down, leaving a trail of undelivered Treasury bills and some banks with
large losses.
The composite index fell 37.08 to 2,899.35 in volume of 1.88bn shares,
compared with Tuesday's 2.34bn.
KARACHI moved ahead in active trade in energy shares after reports of
government incentives in the 1994/95 budget, which is due on June 9.
The KSE 100-share index closed 25.34, or 1.2 per cent, up at 2,214.83.

The dollar finished lower on the foreign exchanges yesterday as investors
took profits after the US Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy on
Tuesday, writes Philip Gawith.
It was a classic case, said dealers, of the old stock market adage of 'buy
the rumour and sell the fact' or, in the words of one wag, 'buy the mystery,
sell the history'.
The US currency ended in London at DM1.6596, down from its Tuesday close of
DM1.6683, before the rate increases. Against the yen it finished at Y103.665
from Y104.380. In New York it closed at DM1.6567 and Y103.50.
While the dollar's response was seen as disappointing, analysts said it had
been so widely expected that it was discounted in the market.
Elsewhere, the Bundesbank surprised observers by cutting the repo rate by 12
basis points to 5.23 per cent - the second week in succession that it has
cut by more than the market was expecting.
Sterling finished easier at DM2.5002 from DM2.5095, weighed down by the
weaker dollar and comments in the UK monthly monetary minutes.
While few observers had expected the dollar to rally immediately upon higher
rates, the tepid response did leave the market wondering what was required
for the US currency to appreciate.
The dollar is now at the same level against the D-Mark, and only Y2 firmer,
compared to its position at the end of April. In the interim, it has enjoyed
the support of concerted central bank intervention, a 50 basis-point fall in
official German rates, and a similar margin rise in US rates.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that over
the past 25 years the dollar has weakened three out of the four times that
the Fed has embarked on a path of sustained monetary tightening.
While fear of renewed central bank intervention is probably limiting the
downside, there are still analysts pred-icting that the dollar will test the
Y100 level.
The fundamentals underlying this position have been clearly laid out by Mr
Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. He
notes that during the first quarter of 1994, Japan's surplus on the current
and portfolio capital accounts equalled Y9.1trillion, double the equivalent
1993 figure.
The effect, says Mr Weinberg, was to 'reduce the supply of yen in the world
by Y9.1trillion, or roughly Dollars 84.3bn. In Economics 101, we teach that
a reduced supply of a commodity leads to a run-up in its price.'
Mr Weinberg predicts that these flows will continue, and therefore that the
yen must appreciate. 'The Fed cannot avert yen appreciation,' he concludes.
The dollar also failed to gain any support from the sharp fall in the German
repo rate. Even the bulls were surprised by the extent of the cut. Mr Nick
Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said if the bank were to only cut at an
average five basis points per week in the weeks ahead, it would have to
consider reducing the discount rate again before its July summer recess.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said
the Bundesbank was giving markets what they wanted, but in a slightly novel
fashion. In the past the central bank has often used fixed rate repos to
take rates quickly lower. This time it was following a more 'stepped'
approach, preferring variable repos.
German call money rates eased to 5.30/5.40 per cent, from 5.40/5.45 per
cent, after the repo cut.
The D-Mark was barely changed in Europe, in spite of the repo, ending
unaltered against the French franc at FFr3.426, and a shade firmer against
the Italian lira at L956.8 from L956.6.
Greek interest rates stayed high to protect the drachma. The Greek currency
was under pressure yesterday morning, with dealers reporting heavy orders
for the D-Mark, driving the currency up to about Dr148.57/62 from the
opening Dr148.25/32.
The one month Athens Interbank Offered Rate (ATHIBOR) jumped to 121.36, from
77.69 on Tuesday. The National Bank of Greece raised bids to 60 per cent for
overnight to one week deals, and 50 per cent for two weeks to one month,
both up from 35 per cent.
Markets believe that the high rates are unsustainable, but government
spokesmen have ruled out a devaluation.
Sterling showed little response to the plethora of economic data released.
But analysts said comments in the monthly monetary minutes, suggesting that
rate cuts might not be out of the question, caused a slight weakening.
The futures market fastened on to the 4 per cent year-on-year growth in
average earnings for March, and this caused a minor sell-off. The December
Eurosterling contract finished at 93.91, from 93.96. Volumes were strong in
the September and December contracts.
In the money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds
20m. Earlier it had injected Pounds 491m liquidity on forecasting a Pounds
700m shortage.

<TEXT>
Speculative and Japanese buying took the three months ALUMINIUM quotation
near to a three-year high of Dollars 1,394 a tonne in early trading at the
London Metal Exchange yesterday. But the move quickly ran out of steam and
heavy bouts of profit-taking ensured that the price closed at Dollars 1,378
a tonne, up just Dollars 3.50 on balance.
Other base metals closed lower, having followed the early fall in copper.
Among the precious metals gold and silver prices ended little changed, but
PLATINUM crept back below the Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce mark following the
overnight fall in New York.
At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA prices, like coffee, recovered from
an early fall, though less spectacularly. The July position ended unchanged
at Pounds 947, having dipped to Pounds 927 at one stage.
Traders drew some encouragement from the fact that the July contract had
filled a chart gap, but noted that September and December also had unfilled
gaps about Pounds 10 below yesterday's lows.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: France outlines farm export
reform for EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday served notice of its intention to increase its share of the
European market by becoming more competitive and Europe's share of the world
market by making more sparing use of subsidised food exports now constrained
by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Jean Puech, the French agriculture minister, told the National Assembly
that his new ideas would be contained in a memorandum to go to Brussels and
France's European Union partners just before France takes over the EU
presidency for the first half of 1995.
In addition to a series of structural and financial changes to French
agriculture, Paris will be also suggesting that:
The EU should abolish export rebates on sales to richer countries or on
products like poultry where the subsidy is of marginal impact;
Concentrate cereal sales in the winter months when the world price generally
rises to nearer that of the EU, so that less subsidy is needed;
Exploit Gatt requirements that Europe increase other food producers'
'minimum access' to the European market by using these imports as a cheap
input material for re-export. One example is that the melting down of cheese
imports for re-export without subsidy;
Introduce differential pricing so that European farmers would only get
guaranteed prices on a percentage of their production, the rest of which
could exported without the benefit of subsidies.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thailand wants quality, not
quantity, from rice crop - The favoured strategy for contending with fiercer
competition in the export market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai authorities want farmers to upgrade to higher qualities of rice as
part of a long-term restructuring of the industry that is partly designed to
counter the competitive threat from Vietnam's surging rice exports.
The plan is for Thailand - easily the world's largest rice exporter with 30
per cent of all trade - to forego some production in favour of superior
fragrant rice, which is in great demand on the open market.
Although two-thirds of Thai rice production is already of the high quality
category the government hopes that hardier traditional varieties, which
require less fertiliser than high-yield strains, will flourish even during
the country's increasingly debilitating water shortages.
'We can't compete with Vietnam with low quality rice. Yet many many
foreigners know that fragrant rice comes from Thailand so it's right for us
to do what we do best,' says Mrs Anchalee Ooraikul, director of policy and
planning at the Ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. She admits that
in laissez-faire Thailand it remains to be seen whether farmers can be
persuaded to change. 'We do not have any concrete means of making the
change,' she explains. 'We can only advise - the farmers, the private
sector, can do what they want.'
Nevertheless the government's target is to more than double the area planted
with fragrant rice to a quarter of the total rice-growing area of 24m acres
by 1999.
Although the domestic demand from fragrant rice alone outstrips supply it
does not yet command the premium to offset its lower yield; if high-grade
paddy fetches Bt3,500 (Pounds 140) a tonne then fragrant rice will sell for
Bt5,000. The yield from fragrant rice in the fertile central plain is
typically 400kg per rai (1,600 square metres) - only half that of high yield
rice.
To raise farmers' income from premium grades the agriculture ministry is
attempting to raise prices and customer recognition by promoting branded
fragrant rice.
This has been a good year so far for Thai farmers who are highly efficient
at squeezing high yields of quality rice from the family land, but are still
a prey to the vagaries of the world market. They produced three years of
abundant crops before this last harvest, yet exports fell by 20 per cent and
prices slumped to below USDollars 200 a tonne because of global oversupply.
The drought caused this year's main crop to be 10 per cent down at 16.483
million tonnes; the second crop due to be harvested in a couple of months
may be higher than anticipated at 2m tonnes because of recent rain.
Many farmers were in desperate straits until Japan took the almost
unprecedented step last year of importing rice to compensate for a poor
harvest. Japan has imported more than 660,000 tonnes of Thai rice and more
importantly caused prices in the wholesale market for 100%-B rice to nearly
double from its dire May lows to USDollars 400 a tonne by the end of the
year. The price has slipped this year to about Dollars 330. The UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation expects Thailand to increase exports this year from
4.8m tonnes ago to 5m tonnes because of the price increase.
Yet because Japanese consumers shun long-grained rice like Thailand's
'Indica' Japan's appetite for Thai rice is limited by the demand from
processed food manufacturers like the makers of rice crackers. China, by
contrast, recently sold Japan a further 300,000 tonnes of 'Manchurian' rice
which suits the Japanese palate and makes China well placed to sell more
than the total of 900,000 tonnes it has sold to Japan in last 12 months.
Vietnam's abandonment of co-operative farming in 1988 led not only to sharp
rises in production (last season's crop was a record 25m tonnes) and exports
(from just 150,000 tonnes to 1.7m in seven years) but also to a gradual move
up to higher qualities, with substantial quantities of 15% and 10% grades
now being offered. (The percentages refer to the amount of broken rice, so
the lower the figure the better, except that 100% is the highest quality).
Once result is that Vietnam's has usurped Thailand as the dominant supplier
to South America where middle-grade rice is popular. 'Vietnam is very, very
strong competition. I think Thailand, Burma and Pakistan are very worried,'
says Mr Siripol Yodmeungcharoen, the director of Thailand's internal trade
department, who recently inspected Vietnam's rice industry.
Vietnam can hardly hope to see rice production boosted much further and the
country has problems with its state-controlled purchasing network which may
have caused exports to slip 6 per cent last year, yet while costs are
picking up they remain modest enough to give the country a significant
advantage.
As part of a Thai agriculture ministry's campaign to stop rice cultivation
on marginal, arid or saline land farmers in the 22 provinces of the Chao
Praya basin have been urged to grow soya or mung beans instead of the minor
second rice crop.
This harvest of high-yield rice, which was heavily-promoted by post-war
governments, is now seen as an illogical use of treasured water and costly
fertiliser.
Preliminary data suggests that 1.1m acres have been given over to this
year's second crop compared with 1.62m a year ago. Officials admit, however,
that this may be due as much to the severe water shortage as much to
government advice. One Bangkok-based rice trader says that simply removing
the second crop's 2m tonnes from the global market of about 14m tonnes could
boost prices of high grade rice. Thai officials say a lack of enthusiasm
among exporters has hitherto killed any proposals to try to influence the
trend of international prices.
Rationalising rice growing in Thailand is a delicate process as more than
half the population still work at least part of the year harvesting and
planting rice in cycles that are deeply embedded in the national psyche.
Ultimately the government is likely to have to offer effective intervention
programmes to persuade farmers who have grown rice for generations to switch
to new, and from the farmer's viewpoint riskier, crops.
Ironically this year's unexpectedly high-prices may have delayed the
re-adjustment process. 'We've been trying to tell the farmers not to make
too much of this year's high price - if the drought gets worse or the world
market moves against us we'll very quickly have another crisis,' says Mrs
Anchalee.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee and copper get
over the jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London coffee and copper prices, leaders of the recent commodities boom, got
over bad cases of the jitters yesterday to end with their bull runs
basically intact.
As coffee futures plunged Dollars 113 a tonne in early trading at the London
Commodity Exchange and the London Metal Exchange copper price lost Dollars
50 it looked like the long-awaited technical 'corrections' had finally
arrived.
But the opening strength of the New York market rescued coffee prices, with
the July position finishing at Dollars 2,119 a tonne, down Dollars 24 from
Tuesday but Dollars 89 off the day's low. And copper prices actually rallied
to fresh 15-month peaks.
'The market went in search of the buying and found it,' one coffee trader
told the Reuter news agency. 'It looks very constructive but I don't know
how far we can go on the upside.'
'In a rally like this we will see bouts of profit-taking which will knock
the market around, especially in New York, but it's still the same story -
buy on the dips,' said another.
The emergence of fresh investment fund buying in New York, after an early
sell-off, was also instrumental in reviving flagging spirits among LME
copper traders. At the LME close the three months position was still more
than Dollars 20 down at Dollars 2,201.50 a tonne, but after hours it climbed
as high as Dollars 2,255, beating Tuesday's peak by Dollars 25.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp and paper makers urged to
collaborate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global pulp and paper industry was yesterday urged to put aside its
rivalries and join forces to deal with long-term challenges and provide
shareholders with decent returns.
Mr Ronald Oberlander, president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based
Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, told a Financial
Times conference in London: 'Taking a collaborative approach may be an
unusual step for this industry. But, while the outlook for the next few
years is buoyant, we face common challenges over the long term and the time
has come for uncommon approaches'.
Offering to spearhead the initiative, Mr Oberlander told the conference on
world pulp and paper that he was motivated by concern at the industry's
'inability to create shareholder value over any reasonable period of time'.
A recent 10-year study of 17 Canadian forest products companies found an
average return on capital employed of just 2.6 per cent, he said. Another
study of European pulp and paper companies from 1983 to 1991 showed only one
of the 10 biggest groups had a positive return on capital.
The industry had been criticised because of its failure to spend money
wisely during periods of prosperity, he said. 'I am concerned, on the eve of
an upswing, that unless we change our behaviour we too will invite the
criticism of future generations.'
Mr Oberlander called for collaboration between companies in tackling the
competition from multi-media technologies, developing new manufacturing
methods, fighting trade barriers, promoting the industry and meeting growing
environmental demands.
'All of us, to varying degrees, face increasingly rigorous environmental
legislation,' he said. 'While it is possible to meet these standards through
current technologies, the cost is enormous, making it even tougher to
achieve a decent return on capital.
'Surely there are more innovative and cost-effective technologies that could
be developed, and we are more likely to arrive at such solutions by
collectively pooling our substantial R&amp;D funds and expertise for the task.'
The environmental pressure on the pulp and paper industry was highlighted by
Mr Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud, forest conservation officer for the Worldwide Fund
for Nature (WWF), who urged companies to accept independent verification
that their wood products came from well-managed forests.
Credible certification schemes would give producers and manufacturers who
participated in them 'a clear market advantage', he said.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries mixed as fresh trading range
sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and GRAHAM BOWLEY AND CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday as the market sought to establish a
fresh trading range in the wake of the Federal Reserve's aggressive
tightening of monetary policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at
87 21/32 , with the yield rising to 7.268 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note gained  3/16 to 99 15/32 , to yield 5.773 per cent.
The pull-back at the long end of the maturity range reflected a modest
adjustment after the previous session's powerful rally.
On Tuesday, prices on the 30-year issue jumped nearly 2 points when the
central bank announced a decision to lift the Federal Funds and the discount
rate by 50 basis points each, to 4.25 per cent and 3.50 per cent
respectively.
In addition to easing traders' concern over inflation, the Fed removed the
cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market by strongly suggesting that no
further rate increases were likely until the end of the summer.
Although the market was generally encouraged by the Fed's action, there was
fresh concern over the continued weakness of the dollar, which failed to
gather strength against the yen and fell against D-mark on the foreign
exchange markets. Traders are worried about the failure of the currency to
respond to the Fed's rate increases because a weak dollar discourages
investment in US-denominated securities.
As a result the long bond failed to extend Tuesday's gains but finished well
off its lows reached in early afternoon.
UK gilts held on to initial gains despite a sharp fall early in the day
triggered by data showing an unexpected increase in average earnings.
Gilts rallied initially, fuelled by overnight gains in the US market
following the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest
rates. But they fell back after the publication of a raft of economic data
and the minutes of the March 30 meeting between the chancellor and the
governor of the Bank of England.
Average earnings rose at an annual rate of 4 per cent in March, higher than
expected, and a sign of growing inflationary pressures. The Bank of England
has highlighted wage growth as one of the main risks to the UK inflation
outlook.
Other data however pointed to a more optimistic prospect for inflation.
Headline inflation increased at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in April  -
which was below expectations - and the minutes of the meeting showed no
serious disagreement between the chancellor and the governor. Analysts said
it was significant that they had discussed the possibility of cutting
interest rates further and that neither had even mentioned raising rates.
This information caused the market to recover before it eased slightly in
later trading on profit-taking. The long gilt future was up  1/2 point at
105 29/32 in late trading.
French bonds put on a strong performance, boosted by hopes of an interest
rate cut at today's meeting of the central bank's monetary policy council.
Traders are hoping for a 10 basis points reduction in its 5 1/2 per cent
intervention rate.
Switching out of German into French bonds continued, causing the yield
spread of the benchmark 10-year OAT over its German counterpart to narrow
further to around 33 basis points, from 41 on Tuesday.
The June notional bond contract on Matif rose 1.12 point to 122.22.
Italian bonds also shone, spurred by hopes that the confidence vote in the
Senate for prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government would pass
successfully. While some traders said a positive vote for the government
would push prices even higher, Mr Andre de Silva, bond strategist at
PaineWebber in London, said such an outcome 'was already reflected in
(yesterday's) price action' and would lead to a knee-jerk reaction, at best.
The June BTP futures contract on Liffe rose about 0.90 point on the day to
113.40.
German bonds put on a lacklustre performance, despite the Bundesbank's
12-basis-point cut in its securities repurchase rate to 5.23 per cent.
Traders reported continued switching out of bunds into French, UK and US
bonds. Mr Carl Haeling, head of the futures and options group at Deutsche
Bank in Frankfurt, recommends short-term trading strategies, rather than
longer-term commitments.
'We still see upside potential, but just as many downside risks - any
rallies we'll get are more likely to be a continuation of the overall
sideways pattern rather than any sustained upwards trend in prices.'

Arranger Morgan Stanley said the programme allowed full flexibility with
regard to maturities and currencies, including guilders, D-Marks and French
francs, and allowed for both unsubordinated and subordinate instruments.
Morgan Stanley GmbH is arranger for D-Marks, Societe de Banque Swiss
(France) is arranger for French francs, and there are nine banks in the
dealer group.
Aegon plans to use the programme both for private placements and public
Eurobond issues, which would allow the company to accommodate specific

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB expected to join Globex
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The DTB, Germany's financial futures exchange, is expected to make a
statement today on whether it intends to join Globex, the electronic futures
trading system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information
and news group.
The DTB board met yesterday. Discussions between the DTB and Globex have
been described as 'promising' and observers say it is likely that the DTB
will join Globex, especially now that Liffe, London's financial futures and
options exchange, has decided against joining the system.
With Liffe out of the way, the DTB would enjoy an exclusive listing on
Globex for its German government bond futures contract.
Competition between the two exchanges for volume in this contract is fierce.
To date, Liffe has the upper hand with around 70 per cent of the market.
However, the DTB may see Globex as a way of increasing its market share by
making its contract more accessible to international investors.
Earlier this week, Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe chairman, said the bond contract
was unlikely to trade in meaningful volume outside European hours due to the
lack of a developed cash market in bunds in east Asia. He noted that the US
T-Bond futures contract, the most likely to succeed on an international
scale, had failed to attract much volume on Globex.
The DTB's close links with Matif, the French futures exchange whose
contracts make up around 80 per cent of Globex volume, may also encourage
the German exchange to join.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Fed decision on interest rates prompts
rush of new issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates on Tuesday
removed a significant uncertainty from the Eurobond market yesterday and
encouraged the launch of a spate of issues in several currencies.
However, there was a feeling that a lot of unwanted bonds were still
cluttering up the system and until underwriters had cleared their books, the
rush of new supply would have to wait.
Credit Local de France, the triple-A rated French municipal financing
agency, came back to the market for the second day running to raise Pounds
150m via a 10-year bond priced to yield 37 basis points above the equivalent
gilt.
Joint lead manager Samuel Montagu said the decision to plump for sterling
had been prompted by good overseas and UK demand for the UK currency
following the US rate rise.
However, some syndicate managers said that the pricing on the bonds should
have been set around the 'low 40s'. When the paper started to trade, the
spread widened to 39 basis points over gilts.
Frequent borrower Eurofima, the Swiss-based group which funds the purchase
of railway rolling stock, launched its well-flagged French franc deal
yesterday, raising FFr1bn through an offering of 10-year paper priced to
yield 16 basis points above the equivalent French government bond. The bonds
were taken up principally by continental and Japanese investors. Lead
manager CCF said it was possible that the deal would be increased at a later
date.
Elsewhere, the Swiss franc sector was active with five deals amounting to
the equivalent of Dollars 420m. Dealers said at least four more deals were
in the pipeline, mainly from double-A and triple-A rated companies.
European Investment Bank set the ball rolling when it issued a SFr200m bond
maturing in June 2001. DSL Finance offered SFr100m of 10-year paper while
Abbey National Treasury Services made a private placement of SFr100m of
bonds maturing in December 1997. There were two further domestic deals by
German banks which were thought to be swapping the proceeds into D-Marks.
The Hungarian National Bank issued Sch1bn of seven-year paper while Bank
Austria offered DM250m of similarly dated paper with attached warrants
through Morgan Stanley.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand plans to tighten settlement regulations,
Reuter reports from Bangkok.
From May 25, a client buying and selling the same stock in one day will have
to pay the full amount of the transaction on the third working day while
receiving proceeds on the fourth.
Brokers said the change was intended to stamp out contra trade in the same
stock - whereby the client pays or receives only the difference between the
buying and selling amounts - and dampen excessive speculation.
The new ruling does not affect foreign stock- brokers who settle purchases
on the third working day while getting paid on the seventh.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Molson earnings flat despite
asset sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings at Molson Companies, the diversified Canadian consumer products
group, were little changed in fiscal 1994. This was in spite of the sale of
a part-interest in its brewing arm and a disappointing performance by the US
operations of Diversey, its cleaning services unit.
Earnings before unusual items slipped to CDollars 110.2m (USDollars 79.8m),
or CDollars 1.87 a share, in the year to March 31, from CDollars 113.7m, or
CDollars 1.90 per share, a year earlier. Revenues declined to CDollars
2.97bn from CDollars 3.09bn.
Unusual gains totalled a net CDollars 15.5m, or 26 cents a share, compared
with CDollars 51m, or 86 cents, in 1993. The latest gain was due largely to
the disposal of a 10 per cent stake in Molson Breweries and a 75 per cent
stake in Aikenhead's, a hardware retail chain. These gains were partly
offset by restructuring costs totalling CDollars 42.5m.
Mr Marshall Cohen, chief executive, forecast a 'significant' rise in
earnings this year, stemming mainly from an improved performance at
Diversey, rising beer exports to the US, and stronger retail business.
Profits from brewing operations fell almost 30 per cent. The drop was blamed
on the sale of the Molson Breweries stake to Miller Brewing of the US, the
growth of the discount beer market and a lower market share. Molson, in
which Australia's Foster's Brewing is also a partner, had a 49.6 per cent
share of the Canadian beer market in the three months to March 31, down from
50.1 per cent last year.
Molson is the second-biggest exporter of beer to the US. Its sales there
jumped 31.7 per cent in the past year.

return to euromarkets

<TEXT>
Indian companies, forced to postpone plans for euroissues following the
failure of the Dollars 1bn offering by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), India's
international telecommunications carrier, are preparing to return to the
market.
The finance ministry has given preliminary approval to 12 companies to tap
the markets in the next three months.
They include Telco, the lorry and bus maker belonging to the Tata industrial
grouping, with a Dollars 300m deal; Bajaj Auto, the scooter and motorcycle
manufacturer (Dollars 160m); JK Synthetics, a plastics company (Dollars
100m); and Straw Products, a paper and board manufacturer (Dollars 100m).
These four groups alone aim to raise Dollars 660m, so the total for the
three months could reach Dollars 1bn.
Under guidelines announced this month, the ministry has powers to regulate
the flow of companies going to the market. Would-be issuers must seek
preliminary approval and then return to the ministry for final approval once
terms are set.
Investment bankers in Bombay said yesterday the prices of Global Depository
Receipts issued by Indian companies, which had fallen heavily before VSNL's
abortive issue, had recently recovered.
As well as the 12 companies approved for the coming three months, several
others which secured approval before the VSNL issue went to the market are
expected to resume their attempts to raise funds. Among them is Ballarpur
Paper, a papermaker and flagship company of the Delhi-based Thapar
industrial grouping.
Meanwhile, leading state-owned banks are about to secure permission to tap
the capital markets for the first time. A parliamentary bill allowing these
banks to raise private equity and dilute the government's 100 per cent stake
is expected to receive the president's assent and become law in the next few
days.
About six banks are expected to try to raise between Rs2bn and Rs3bn
(Dollars 95.7m) each in the next few months. They include some of the
best-performing state-owned banks, notably Punjab National Bank, Canara
Bank, Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce.
They will be following the State Bank of India, the largest publicly-owned
bank, which last year raised Rs32bn in stocks and bonds. SBI was able to go
to market without enabling legislation because its ownership structure was
different. SBI cut the state's shareholding from 98 per cent to 66 per cent.

CSM, the Dutch-based food group, reported a 12.2 per cent rise in first-half
net profit and announced an agreement in principle to acquire a US company
to strengthen its ingredients sector.
Net profit rose to Fl 75.3m (Dollars 40.3m) in the six months to March 31
from Fl 67.1m in the first half of 1992-93. Sales in the period advanced by
9.1 per cent to Fl 1.31bn, with much of the increase due to the full
consolidation for the first time of Westco Products, market leader in
supplying ingredients to bakeries on the west coast of the US.
In the previous reporting period, Westco contributed to results for only
three months.
CSM's acquisition is Henry &amp; Henry of New York state, which sells fillings,
icings and other speciality products to the bakery industry.
The US company, which has a workforce of 100, posted an undisclosed profit
on sales of Dollars 31m last year.
In addition to Westco, CSM also owns American Ingredients, which makes
ingredients for industrial bakers, and QA Products, also of the US, which
sells decorations in the form of sugar vermicelli to the baking and
ice-cream industries.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Merck buys into generic drugs
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merck AG has become the latest German pharmaceuticals concern to buy into
the generic drugs business. It said yesterday it would buy 51 per cent of
the capital of Amerpharm, a generic drugs manufacturer controlled from the
Netherlands.
The price of the deal was not revealed. Merck said Amerpharm had sales of
Dollars 104m in 1993 and earnings before interest and taxes of Dollars 15m.
Generics manufacturers specialise in launching products whose patents have
expired. The business is growing quickly because of the number of
big-selling drugs whose patents are running out.
Mr Hans Langmann, Merck executive management president, said the company
might have to finance the acquisition through capital markets or
'equity-linked measures'.
Merck will be taking control of Amerpharm from the South African Tabatznic
family, which has a long association with the generics business. The family
would continue to hold a significant stake in the operation, said Merck.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley reveals 41% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley, the securities house, yesterday became the latest Wall
Street casualty of rising US interest rates and volatile international bond
and currency markets. It revealed a 41 per cent decline in first-quarter
profits to Dollars 199m, or Dollars 2.40 a share.
Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, said that 'a rising interest rate environment
in the US and difficult conditions in both the foreign exchange and European
fixed income markets contributed to an overall decline in client activity'
during the quarter, which ran from February to the end of April.
Total net revenues fell 16 per cent to Dollars 888m.
Although the drop in Morgan Stanley's earnings tallies with results from
other Wall Street firms, it suffered slightly in comparison with its rivals.
This was because its fiscal quarter excluded January, a busy month for the
industry, and included April, when securities underwriting business tailed
off sharply amid continued turmoil on US debt and equity markets.
The biggest downturn in business at the firm was reported by the investment
banking division, where a fall in demand for debt underwriting services and
a drop in the number of advisory assignments contributed to a 31 per cent
decline in revenues, to Dollars 260m.
The firm said the decline would have been larger were it not for its equity
underwriting calendar, which remained busy during the quarter.
Morgan Stanley's principal transactions business also suffered. Amid hostile
debt and foreign exchange markets, earnings from the trading of the firm's
own capital fell from Dollars 370m a year ago to Dollars 258m, in spite of
an increase in revenues from the trading of equities and commodities.
On a more positive note, revenues from brokerage commissions climbed 31 per
cent to Dollars 119m, and revenues from asset management, global custody and
clearing businesses increased from Dollars 52m a year ago to Dollars 81m.
These figures reflect growth in customer assets under management and
administration, to Dollars 52bn and Dollars 80bn respectively.
Non-interest expenses fell slightly during the quarter, blamed on a 16 per
cent drop in performance-related compensation payments to Dollars 440m.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Maple Leaf Foods hit by higher
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher costs and unusually cold weather have been partly blamed for
first-quarter earnings at Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's biggest food processor,
down by 21 per cent.
Maple Leaf, which is 56 per cent-owned by the UK's Hillsdown Holdings, also
ascribed the setback to strong competitive pressures in some of its
businesses, notably bakeries and flour milling.
Net earnings dipped to CDollars 8m (USDollars 5.8m), or 10 cents a share,
from CDollars 10.2m, or 13 cents, a year earlier. Sales climbed to CDollars
659.9m from CDollars 632.4m.
The bottom line was also hit by a fall in interest income, to CDollars
870,000 from CDollars 2.9m, resulting from lower interest rates and smaller
cash balances.
Mr Brent Ballantyne, chief executive, predicted improved earnings for the
rest of the year. Businesses which posted improved first-quarter profits
included fresh pork and animal feed.

licence deal

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic Data Systems, the computing services company, and Computer
Associates, the provider of systems and application software, have ended a
28-month legal dispute and announced a software licensing agreement they
claim to be the largest.
Computer Associates sued EDS in 1991, alleging it had obtained unauthorised
access to its software and used it without paying fees to process data for
third parties.
The centrepiece of the agreement is a 12-year licence, renewable for a
further five years, giving EDS broad and flexible use of all current
Computer Associates products for itself and its customers throughout the
world. Where appropriate, EDS will standardise on Computer Associates
products at all its information processing centres.
EDS will become a value-added reseller of Computer Associates software. It
will initially have the right to resell Dollars 100m of CA-Unicenter, a
systems management package for the client/server market.
The two sides are discussing an agreement for Computer Associates to
outsource the information technology support for some of its administrative
and financial functions to EDS.
Both refused to put a value on the settlement. Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of
EDS, said the deal was unrelated to Monday's news that General Motors, which
owns EDS, was considering spinning it off to facilitate a possible merger
between EDS and Sprint, the telecommunications group.
Mr Alberthal said EDS had long believed an alliance with a leading software
group would be of benefit.

KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group, posted net profit of Fl 50m
(Dollars 26.7m) in the first quarter of 1994, reversing a F 113m loss before
extraordinary items recorded in the same period of 1993.
The figures confirm forecasts made at the recent annual shareholders'
meeting.
Operating profit in the quarter was up 87 per cent at Fl 129m, reflecting
cost-cutting, an improvement in performance by all sectors, and a rise in
sales volume. Turnover rose 13.8 per cent to F 13.1bn, against Fl 2.74bn a
year earlier.
KNP BT reiterated that it expected to see a substantial improvement in net
profit for the full year. In 1993, the company recorded a net loss of Fl
343m, reflecting Fl 320m in extraordinary charges related to restructuring.

satellite TV venture

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several of Canada's biggest broadcast, cable-TV and telecommunications
companies have joined forces to develop a satellite-based TV service.
The proposed alliance is largely a response to the competitive threat from
DirectTv, the fledgling US service, nicknamed Deathstar, which aims to beam
as many as 500 TV channels directly into North American homes.
The new venture is a defensive move for the cable-TV operators, which have a
monopoly in their licence areas. Satellite services are expected to be far
more loosely regulated than cable-TV, and can be picked up by any household
with a receiving dish.
However, the consortium also includes BCE, holding company of Bell Canada,
the country's biggest telephone company. BCE has recently begun to broaden
its horizons in the multimedia sector. It is also the majority shareholder
of Telesat Canada, which operates Canada's communications satellites.
The other seven participants include Rogers Cablesystems, Canada's biggest
cable-TV operator; WIC Western International Communications, which is the
largest private broadcaster; and Cancom Satellite Communications, which
distributes TV signals by satellite to 2,500 cable systems, mostly in remote
rural areas.
The group plans to set up a national 'direct-to-home' (DTH) service within
the next 12 months. It will deliver pay-per-view - pay TV and other
programming in digitally-compressed form - to cable systems as well as to
DTH subscribers. The cost of setting up the service is estimated at CDollars
85m (USDollars 62m).
The plans also include a central authorisation facility which will enable
small cable-TV systems to offer pay-TV services to their subscribers.
A 5 per cent equity stake in the new venture has been left for outside
investors.

Lafarge Corporation, the US arm of Lafarge Coppee, the French building
materials group, is to sell a cement plant and related assets in Texas to
Cemex of Mexico for about Dollars 100m.
Mr Michel Rose, chairman of Lafarge Corp, said the sale of the cement plant
and four cement storage silos was in line with the group's strategy of
withdrawing from non-strategic markets to strengthen its presence elsewhere.
The assets, which also include a 52 per cent interest in Parker Lafarge, an
asphalt and aggregate group, will be bought by Sunbelt Acquisitions, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cemex.
Lafarge Corp is one of the largest building materials groups in North
America, with annual sales of about Dollars 1.5bn and more than 7,300
employees.
It operates 15 cement plants in the US and Canada.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gutfreund, former chairman of Salomon Brothers who resigned amid a
bond market scandal three years ago, failed yesterday to get the Wall Street
firm to hand over Dollars 55.3m of salary, bonuses, stock options and other
penalties.
A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel decided against Mr Gutfreund and
in favour of Salomon.
Mr Gutfreund claimed Salomon unfairly withheld the compensation after his
resignation in August 1991. When he launched his claim in 1992, he sought
about Dollars 12m from Salomon, but the claim grew during the intervening
years as the value of the disputed stock options soared and as Mr Gutfreund
sought various penalties, unpaid interest and legal fees.
Mr Gutfreund stepped down as chairman of Salomon three years ago after it
was revealed that he and several senior executives had failed to report that
Salomon's chief bond trader had faked customer orders for government
securities in a series of Treasury auctions.
He was fined for failing to properly supervise his employees and banned from
running a brokerage firm.
Salomon declined to comment on the stock exchange panel's judgment.

<TEXT>
Southern Life, the South African life assurer, reports a 22.5 per cent
increase to R240m (Dollars 65.8m) in distributable earnings for the year
ended March.
It is stepping up its dividend to a total of 94 cents, an increase of 21.3
per cent.
Total income rose to R4.76bn from R3.5bn, of which premium income rose to
R3.57bn from R2.48bn, a rise of 44 per cent. Investment income increased 15
per cent to R1.2bn.
The increase was largely the result of new business, which rose 88 per cent
to R2.24bn. Single premiums accounted for R1.84bn while recurring premiums
accounted for R403m. Group total assets grew 29 per cent to R24.8bn.
Mr Jan Calitz, managing director, said the good results had been greatly
helped by successful cost containment. Operating costs had increased by just
13.7 per cent on the year while total income had risen 35 per cent.
'This is due to rapid expansion of new business, increased investment in
systems development and higher marketing expenses, not to additional
manpower,' Mr Calitz said.
Southern's two largest shareholders, Anglo American corporation and First
National Bank, plan to take their dividend in share form.
The year's figures do not include African Life, the subsidiary that was last
year spun off to a consortium of black investors.
Southern will retain a 25 per cent stake in African Life and has invested
R42m in Conslab Investments, a significant shareholder in the new holding
company, Real Africa Investments, which controls African Life.
Southern Life chairman Mr Neal Chapman said that he was confident about the
company's future given the success of South Africa's recent elections and
the improved economic outlook.
'We can face the future with confidence and with every hope that lasting
peace and a strong economy lie ahead.' he said.

Casio Computer, Japan's leading maker of digital watches, yesterday
announced a 36.1 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March,
but forecast a vigorous earnings rebound, reports William Dawkins from
Tokyo.
Pre-tax profits fell to Y7.37bn (Dollars 70.3m) last year on sales which
fell by 1.3 per cent to Y322.22bn.
Casio, which exports more than half its total sales, blamed its decline on
the yen's sharp appreciation in value.

<TEXT>
Woolworth, the troubled US retailer that last month restated last year's
figures to show a net loss of Dollars 24m for the first quarter, yesterday
said losses deepened to Dollars 38m in the three months to April.
Group turnover fell 18 per cent to Dollars 1.76bn, but excluding
discontinued operations - notably the loss-making Woolco chain in Canada,
sold to WalMart last year - turnover rose by 4.5 per cent.
Excluding discontinued operations, specialty store revenues rose 10 per cent
and general merchandise sales fell 3.5 per cent. At the operating level,
specialty stores made an operating loss of Dollars 11m compared with
operating profit of Dollars 1m last time.
General merchandise made an operating loss of Dollars 13m compared with a
loss of Dollars 14m last time. The disposal of Woolco was offset by lower
profitability at Woolworth in Germany.
Losses per share rose to 38 cents from 24 cents, but the dividend was
maintained at 29 cents a share.
Woolworth is investigating alleged accounting regularities that led to last
month's restatement of all the quarterly figures for last year.

<TEXT>
Olympus Optical, the Japanese camera and precision instrument maker,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Y6.32bn (Dollars 60.6m) for the year
ended March, down 32.5 per cent from the Y9.3bn of the previous year.
The company said it was suffering from the worldwide economic slump, weak
domestic demand and the yen's appreciation.
However, the board decided to maintain the dividend at Y13 per share.
Olympus' turnover declined by 5.8 per cent from Y187bn to Y17bn. This was in
spite of efforts to boost compact camera sales and to expand sales of
endoscopes and microscopes.
The scientific equipment business has been plagued by poor demand in the US
and the strength of the yen, which has made Japanese machines expensive.
For the current year Olympus predicts that pre-tax profits will rise to
Y6.5bn, while post-tax profits are also expected to increase, reaching
Y3.3bn.
Turnover is forecast to reach Y180bn.
In 1992, the group was forced to provide for a substantial extraordinary
item, following a Dollars 34.7m out of court settlement to Honeywell, the US
electronics group for infringing autofocus patents.

Casio Computer, Japan's leading maker of digital watches, yesterday
announced a 36.1 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March
but forecast a vigorous earnings rebound.
Casio, which exports more than half its total sales, blamed its decline on
the yen's sharp appreciation in value. The company made a Y20bn exchange
loss on its exports last year.
Pre-tax profits fell to Y7.37bn (Dollars 70.3m) last year on sales which
fell by 1.3 per cent to Y322.22bn.
The group has restructured in response to the yen's rise faster than many
Japanese exporters.
Casio has pushed up its overseas output dramatically, from 20 per cent of
the total in 1992 to 50 per cent last year.
It plans to keep overseas production at the higher level in the current
year. The company has also imported more foreign components.
The group said the restructuring is forecast to reduce costs.
The company plans that cost cutting will be the main feature of a projected
62.7 per cent recovery in pre-tax profits to Y12bn.
Casio also plans to increase its sales by 5.5 per cent to Y340bn. The
forecast is based on the assumption that the yen will hover at around Y100
to the dollar this year - close to its record high - said Mr Toshio Kozai,
senior managing director.
Casio's profits recovery will also be helped by the introduction of new
products, plus economic recovery in Europe and the US, said the group.
In the past year, sales of electronic notebooks for children and liquid
crystal televisions were steady.
But Mr Kozai admitted that digital watches sales in Europe were sluggish.
The group also makes calculators and and electronic musical instruments.

Dongfang Electrical Machinery, the last of the first nine Chinese state
companies to be listed in Hong Kong, yesterday said it would offer 170m
H-shares at HKDollars 2.83 each in an initial capital raising of HKDollars
456.3m (USDollars 59.1m).
Dongfang is China's second largest manufacturer of hydroelectric power
equipment and is located in Sichuan province in China's south-west.
It is coming to the market on a prospective price-earnings multiple of 11.94
times 1995 earnings.
Given the recent performance of H-share companies - shares listed outside
China and in which foreigners can invest - this may be considered expensive.
Concerns about the direction of the Chinese economy have made investors wary
of mainland companies about which they know little.
Last week, Tianjin Bohai Chemical's HKDollars 408m offering was barely
subscribed.
On its debut on Tuesday the company's share price fell below the offer
price.
Dongfang said it planned to use the proceeds of its share offer to upgrade
production capacity and production technology.
This would enable it to meet the demand for power generating equipment
required by plans to dam the Yangtze river.
Mr Yuan Changhe, chairman, said: 'With the huge demand for power and power
generation equipment in China, we believe the company is at a watershed in
its development.'

Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, yesterday promised shareholders
further 'energetic measures' to improve profits.
He told the annual meeting that group sales had risen 15 per cent to DM30bn
(Dollars 17.9bn), in the first four months of the year, but earnings were
'not what they should be'.
The Daimler group, which last year lost DM1.8bn, is expected to stay in the
black this year. Mr Reuter confirmed that a one-for-10 rights issue would be
made this summer.
However, he forecast that the AEG industrial division would not show
operating profits until 1996, while Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) was expected
to return to the black next year.
Consolidated turnover for the first quarter, revealed in an interim report
yesterday, rose 19 per cent to DM22bn, after a strong performance at
Mercedes, which accounted for 70 per cent of the total.
The Mercedes-Benz automotive division had increased sales markedly, but its
performance also had to be improved. The comparable period last year was
severely affected by recession and a sharp fall in car deliveries.
Among the smaller divisions, the Debis services operation increased total
revenues by 27 per cent to DM2.6bn.
Turnover at AEG rose 12 per cent on an adjusted, comparable basis to
DM1.59bn. Most of the growth came from Germany, up 11 per cent, and the US,
where sales rose 13 per cent. Rail systems and micro-electronics showed
strong improvements. Orders rose 59 per cent to DM3bn.
The interim report blamed cuts in defence and space budgets and difficult
conditions for airlines for an 11 per cent fall in turnover at Dasa, to
DM3.34bn. Revenues from European Union countries dropped 20 per cent.
Mercedes benefited more than its competitors from the recovery in world car
markets, the report said.
Turnover rose 28 per cent to DM16bn thanks to a 33 per cent rise in revenues
from cars and a 21 per cent improvement from commercial vehicles.
Worldwide unit sales of passenger cars increased 52 per cent while unit
sales of commercial vehicles increased 17 per cent.

Sal. Oppenheim, Germany's largest private banking house, will increase its
dividend by DM3 to DM15 after announcing profits up 15 per cent in 1993.
Profits rose from DM39m to DM45m (Dollars 26.9m) last year, after the bank's
concentration on corporate finance, asset management and financial
engineering. Total business volume rose by 17 per cent to DM10.3bn and
credit volume rose from DM5.6bn to DM5.8bn.
All sectors of the bank recorded growth, but it was consolidating its
interests in banking stakes acquired last year. These include MeesPierson
bank in the Netherlands and Bank Oppenheim Pierson in Switzerland.
The bank has not been directly affected by the collapse of the property
empire of Mr Jurgen Schneider. However, a consortium including Rheinboden
Hypothekenbank, in which Oppenheim holds a 51 per cent stake, had lent Mr
Schneider DM125m.
Axel Springer, the media group, is to pay a DM12 dividend. The company,
which publishes the daily newspapers Bild and Die Welt, reported a rise in
group net profits from DM57m to DM71m last year.

Aker, the Norwegian building materials and oil and gas technology group, has
paid NKr1.1bn (Dollars 152.2m) to acquire 27 per cent of Partek, the Finnish
building materials, minerals and load-handling equipment company.
The move is the latest step towards a far-reaching restructuring of the
Nordic building materials industry aimed at creating a business grouping
that can stand up to increasing competition and expand internationally.
The grouping, based around the Swedish Euroc group, has annual sales of more
than NKr25bn and a market value of NKr10bn, making it Europe's fifth largest
cement and building materials group. Partek acquired 25 per cent of Euroc
last year.
Finland's influential Bjoerneberg and Rettig families disposed of their
Partek stakes at FM89.50 a share. With Partek shares trading at FM70 a share
before the deal was announced, Aker has paid a premium of almost 30 per cent
to become the Finnish group's biggest shareholder.
Finland's Aabo Akademi Foundation holds 11 per cent of Partek, while Sampo
and Varma, two Finnish insurance groups, hold 9.6 per cent and 4.1 per cent
respectively.
Yesterday's deal gives Aker, together with the three other major
shareholders, control of 52.2 per cent of Partek and considerable influence
over Euroc.
In 1993 Aker's pre-tax profit was NKr851m on sales of NKr18.14bn. Partek
suffered a pre-tax loss of FM433.9m (Dollars 79.7m) on sales of FM6.61bn.
Euroc's pre-tax profit was SKr375.5m (Dollars 48.5m) on turnover of
SKr19.57bn.

<TEXT>
International bond issues net of amortisation reached an all-time peak of
Dollars 84bn in the first quarter of 1994 in spite of unsettled market
conditions, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in its latest
report on international banking and financial market developments.
The BIS said the record issue volume in January meant that overall financing
in the first quarter remained high.
However, turbulence in financial markets had an impact on the composition of
issues, with straight fixed-rate financing declining to its lowest quarterly
level since the fourth quarter of 1992 while floating-rate issues reached
their highest level ever.
Equity-related issues increased by the largest amount since the second
quarter of 1989.
Most of the increase took place in convertible issues for borrowers from
France, Japan, the Cayman Islands and the UK.
French issuers accounted for almost all of the large increase in issues
denominated in French francs, which rose from Dollars 200m in the fourth
quarter last year to Dollars 3.3bn in the first quarter this year.
The widespread increase in borrowing by OECD entities more than offset
reduced borrowing by developing countries and international organisations.
However, in spite of the less favourable issuing conditions created by
Mexico's domestic political situation, borrowing by Mexican entities
continued at a strong pace, displacing Argentina as the most important LDC
borrower.
In the syndicated loan market, total financing was relatively steady with
Dollars 52bn of new facilities, compared with Dollars 55bn in the previous
quarter.
The lower volume of facilities for OECD borrowers was partially offset by
higher volume for LDC borrowers, in particular large facilities arranged for
Indonesian borrowers.
The decline in margins on new facilities began to extend from prime names in
the OECD area to other groups of borrowers, particularly Asia.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Abu Dhabi to buy 20% of Austrian
oil group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi has agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in OMV,
the partially-privatised Austrian integrated oil and chemicals group, for
about Sch5bn (Dollars 413m) from the Austrian government.
Oesterreichische Industrieholding (OIAG), the Austrian state holding company
that owns 72 per cent of OMV, said its supervisory board had 'approved
unanimously' the offer by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment
Company (IPIC).
Two weeks ago, OMV said it was planning a one-for-eight rights issue to
raise about Sch3bn as part of the terms for bringing in a strategic partner.
OIAG will pass on its rights in the issue to IPIC and sell to IPIC some of
its existing shares.
Full details of the deal will be disclosed following the official signing in
the next few days.
The Austrian government has been searching for partners for OMV for nearly
two years as part of its privatisation policy. It was expected that partners
would be found quickly, as OMV has a dominant position in Austria and
appeared well placed to penetrate the emerging markets in central and
eastern Europe.
However, the group suffered a series of embarrassing reverses, including the
sudden departure of a chief executive and deterioration of trading
performance.
It lost Sch604.6m in 1992 and suffered a further loss last year of
Sch4.43bn, of which Sch3.5bn was for restructuring. For much of this period
the quoted price of the group's shares was below book value, making it
difficult for potential partners to agree purchase terms.
OIAG's stake in OMV would drop to 52 per cent following the deal. OIAG said
it hoped to bring in other strategic partners. Its goal was to reduce its
holding to under 50 per cent by the end of this year and ultimately to a
blocking minority of just over 25 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: ABB improves 20% to Dollars 246m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group,
posted a 20 per cent rise in first-quarter profit to Dollars 246m before tax
and extraordinary items.
New orders were up 8 per cent to Dollars 8.2bn, due to several large orders
for power plants.
Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said that the trend of orders was
continuing, with demand coming mainly from Asia and the Americas.
The group forecast a rise in 1994 profits before tax and extraordinary items
from last year's Dollars 1.19bn. It signalled that its tax rate would recede
to a normal 45 per cent. Last year, it soared to 87.9 per cent because of a
Dollars 596m restructuring charge.
Revenues in the first quarter eased 1.4 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn,
reflecting the recession in Europe, the group's most important region.
'Europe is still flat and we see no upturn until 1995,' Mr Barnevik said.
The main European subsidiaries were sustained by export orders.
The group's order backlog stood at Dollars 31.1bn at the end of March, 6 per
cent higher than a year earlier.
The increase in first-quarter profits was due to a 4 per cent reduction in
personnel costs and sharply lower inventories.
'We are starting to get the real impact from what we have done in the past
few years,' Mr Barnevik said.
Last year, ABB was shedding 1,000 jobs a month. That dropped to 400 a month
this year, he said.
Operating profits were up 18 per cent to Dollars 481m, reflecting a rise in
the operating margin to 8 per cent from 6.6 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Volvo underlines recovery with
strong first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of Volvo's recovery became clear yesterday when Scandinavia's
biggest industrial group announced a SKr3.30bn (Dollars 418m) first-quarter
pre-tax profit on higher sales, increased margins, cost-cutting and currency
movements.
The group has seized market share in many countries in spite of generally
weak demand, helping it to swing from a loss of SKr331m a year ago to
achieve its second-best quarterly result.
The improved trend was highlighted at the operating level, where the company
recovered from a SKr189m loss to a SKr1.96bn profit.
Volvo said the performance took it back to the peak days of the late 1980s,
even though the world car market was 10 per cent to 15 per cent below its
1989 level and truck demand was down 15 per cent.
Asset sales played a part, as SKr1.3bn in capital gains were included at the
pre-tax level. Volvo plans to sell off all its non-transport operations,
including its holdings in BCP, the consumer products group, and Pharmacia,
the drugs group, by the end of 1996.
Disposals have reaped SKr7.9bn, helping to lower interest costs and cutting
the group's net debt to SKr9.7bn at the end of the latest quarter from
SKr14.5bn at the end of 1993. Second-quarter results will include a further
SKr2.7bn in capital gains.
Group sales rose 63 per cent to SKr37.4bn, although adjusted for currency
effects and the acquisition of BCP the rise was 36 per cent.
Sales of Volvo cars rose by 25 per cent to 102,200 units, taking the car
group's quarterly operating income to SKr590m from a SKr150m loss.
Truck deliveries were 50 per cent higher at 16,200 units. This was due to
strong European demand for the new Volvo FH series and an expanding US
market. Operating income was SKr821m after a SKr53m deficit.
The performance helped lift Volvo B shares a further SKr10 yesterday to
SKr768. This is twice the level in November, before the collapse of the
group's planned merger with Renault.
Volvo said it would set up a special unit on July 1, AB Fortos, to handle
the sale of its remaining non-core operations. Excluding BCP, the market
value of its intended divestments was SKr11.4bn in mid-May, with Pharmacia
accounting for SKr8.9bn.
The sale of BCP should bring in more than SKr20bn, after the company has
completed its bid for the 26 per cent of BCP it does not own.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch posts DM30m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Krupp Hoesch, the merged steel and engineering group, made a DM30m (Dollars
17.6m) loss in the first quarter. However, the group said it hoped results
in the loss-making steel division would improve during the year and that the
company would break even in 1994 following a deficit of DM590m in the
previous 12 months.
Orders in the first quarter rose by 12 per cent and turnover was up 5 per
cent compared with the same period last year.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said 1993 was one of the worst years for
the two companies which were merged in December 1992.
Turnover fell 11 per cent to DM24.2bn from DM26.9bn the year before.
However, the unspecified savings resulting from the merger would enable the
group to generate sufficient earnings in the second half of this year to
offset the first-quarter losses, Mr Cromme said.
In spite of the projected break-even this year, Mr Cromme said no dividend
would be paid in 1994. 'What happens thereafter is speculation,' he added.
'We will still have to do something to shore up the internal structure (of
the company) so that a gust of wind doesn't blow us over.'
Mr Cromme said the better results were based on improving prospects in the
automotive industry, which accounts for about 20 per cent of Krupp Hoesch's
turnover.
The 1994 results would not be dragged down by redundancy costs, the bulk of
which had been included in the previous year's results.
A DM780m loss in the steel division was the main reason for the 1993 deficit
although the engineering unit made a small loss.
Mr Cromme said steel would be the only one of the company's six divisions to
make a loss this year and that the company's exposure to steel would be
further reduced below the present 25 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Married without a honeymoon -
Michael Lindemann and Quentin Peel talk to Krupp Hoesch chief Gerhard
Cromme, who insists that the merger came just in time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Krupp Hoesch, seems to be an
incorrigible optimist.
He has had to be, given the problems he has faced in the last two years,
consummating the marriage of Germany's second- and third-largest steelmakers
in the midst of the sharpest post-war recession in their main markets. He
never had a honeymoon.
The merged group is in the process of shedding at least 25,000 jobs, more
than one in four of its workforce. It had to shoulder a loss last year of
almost DM600m (Dollars 353m), and close one of its two main integrated steel
plants. It still carries a debt burden of almost DM5.8bn.
Mr Cromme insists the merger was an ideal industrial marriage, with
rationalisation and cost-saving possible in 70 per cent of operations. At
the same time, the depth of the 1993 downturn in steel, capital goods and
the motor industry, helped concentrate minds and accelerate the process, he
says.
'The merger came only just in time. The crisis in 1993 was so bad that both
Krupp and Hoesch alone would have had difficulties surviving in the same
form they are in today.'
The merger was confirmed in December 1992, and took a further six months to
begin putting into effect. It leaves the cumbersomely titled Fried. Krupp AG
Hoesch-Krupp with six broad divisions, ranging from its strengths in steel,
engineering and plant construction, to its expanding interests in trade and
services.
Mr Cromme singles out the automotive supplies division as a beneficiary,
because the joint operation can provide manufacturers with complete systems,
instead of individual parts. For example, it will for the first time supply
the complete front axle for the new Jaguar in the UK.
The cost savings from the merger are still working through, he says. The
combined data processing operation will be DM100m a year cheaper than the
separate operations, and DM60m of that has already been achieved.
The savings, above all in the group payroll, are an important factor behind
his forecast of returning to break-even this year. 'Turnover in 1994 will be
roughly the same as it was for the two companies in 1992, but we already
have 16,000 fewer people.'
It was not the merger which caused the real problems, he insists, but the
extent of the economic recession. And yet he believes that has been
beneficial for the industry.
'Everything that happened in 1993 brought the German steel industry for the
first time to the point of real rationalisation.' After a decade of
desultory and unsuccessful negotiations, Thyssen, the largest steelmaker,
and Krupp Hoesch are involved in the process of streamlining their
operations.
The outline of the plan, agreed last December, is for Thyssen to take
majority control in two areas - tinplate and electrical strip - and Krupp
Hoesch to lead in special steel flat products. The three areas make up 30
per cent of Krupp Hoesch's steel output.
Krupp's interest in special steels will be reinforced if it is successful in
its joint bid with three Italian partners - Riva, Falck, and Tadfin - for
AST, the special steels division of Ilva, the Italian state-owned steel
company.
'That means that in steel we will continue to develop those areas where we
see the chance of a competitive future,' Mr Cromme says.
At the same time, the closure of the Krupp steel plant at Rheinhausen,
cutting crude steel capacity by 4m tonnes, has left the group with 'a
virtual equilibrium' between all its parts of the steel-making process - and
no incentive to make any further large capacity cuts, he says.
Mr Cromme says he has no intention of seeking debt relief along the lines of
his competitor, Klockner, and in spite of the heavy debt burden. 'We will
have no Chapter 11 here.'
The overall debt burden did not increase last year and remained constant at
almost DM5.8bn. Mr Cromme denies plans for further large disposals to reduce
the debt burden, but says it would be cut by good cash flow.
The company's heavy capital investment programme has been curtailed, and the
money normally ploughed into investment will go to pay off some of that
debt.
Mr Cromme is optimistic about Germany's efforts to remain competitive as an
investment location. 'We have solved more problems in Germany in the past
year than many sceptics thought we could,' he says.
He believes the D-Mark will regain some of its competitiveness against the
dollar and other European currencies in the coming months.
The future for Krupp Hoesch rests heavily on its international markets, and
investing close to them, he says.

Galeries Lafayette, one of France's leading retail groups, yesterday
announced details of a financial restructuring package and reorganisation of
its activities into three divisions.
The restructuring follows a period of expansion for Galeries Lafayette.
The group, which owns the department stores, two years ago took over
Nouvelles Galeries, the general merchandise stores, and last autumn acquired
full control of Monoprix, the supermarket and hypermarket chain.
It is regrouping its interests into three areas: department stores, popular
stores and its service activities. The department stores will be renamed
Grands Magasins Galeries Lafayette and its Uniprix chain of general
merchandise stores will change its name to Monoprix.
Galeries Lafayette is streamlining its financial structure with a FFr15m
(Dollars 2.5m) capital increase and by consolidating the ownership of all
the holding companies within the group, including Monoprix.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Crabtree makes 69% advance to Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crabtree Group, the Tyneside-based manufacturer and supplier of printing
machines for cans and computer stationery, yesterday announced a 69 per cent
increase in interim profits.
The rise for the six months to March 31, from Pounds 768,000 to Pounds 1.3m,
came on turnover ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 8.92m).
Earnings per share doubled to 5.8p. An interim dividend of 3p is declared.
Mr Karl Watkin, chairman, described the performance as 'outstanding' and
said the full year would show an improvement on last year's Pounds 3m
profit, achieved on turnover of Pounds 23.4m.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, the company's broker, yesterday forecast profits of
Pounds 4m pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 26.5m for the current year, for
pros-pective earnings per share of 18.9p. The current 6p dividend forecast
is to be revised.
The group came to the market in June last year at 150p via a Pounds 19.4m
shares and cash reverse takeover of Crabtree Holdings by Somerset Trust. The
shares yesterday rose 6p to 354p.
It continues to look for a suitable acquisition; serious negotiations with
several companies are in progress, but Mr Watkin said; 'We aren't going to
be rushed into any acquisition just because people expect us to.'
The group, comprising Crabtree of Gateshead, which claims to be the world's
biggest supplier of printing and coating machines for the three piece can
market, and Crabtree Morgan, which manufactures printing equipment for
computer stationery, exports about 95 per cent of output to more than 50
countries; growth markets include Vietnam and Mexico.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Group Dev plans wind down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Group Development Capital Trust yesterday announced net asset value per
share of 55.3p at the end of the half-year to March 31, against 54.3p in the
previous first half.
Directors also recommended a scheme intended to wind down the company within
two years.
The intention is to enable investors to 'realise their investment for a sum
approximating to asset value'.
As investments have reached maturity in recent months the board has realised
them and proceeds have been reinvested in gilt-edged securities. Directors
aim to make a progressive return of capital to shareholders.
Approval for the plan will be sought at an extraordinary meeting. The
company hopes to return about 25p per share to investors by September 30,
with one or more further payments to come.
The board would, however, still consider any other proposals it received.
Gross revenue in the half-year increased to Pounds 266,200 (Pounds 137,800)
and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 115,200 compared with a Pounds 4,100 deficit
previously.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.41p against losses of 0.05p.
There is no interim dividend, but the company hopes to make a substantial
increase in the dividend for the year.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon to raise Pounds
30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon has became the third investment trust this week
to launch a substantial conversion share issue.
Following TR European Growth and Shirescot, which are to raise Pounds 38m
and Pounds 24m respectively, the trust aims to raise approximately Pounds
30.2m, net of expenses, through a placing and open offer. It is currently
capitalised at just under Pounds 32m.
SG Warburg, acting as sponsors and stockbrokers to the issue, have placed
some 21m C shares with existing and new investors and a further 10m are
available at 100p apiece to existing shareholders and warrantholders.
The trust stressed that the amount of shares being offered had been set
deliberately high to minimise the possibility of applications being scaled
down.
The C shares will be converted into ordinaries by October 31, or when 85 per
cent of the new funds have been invested.
New warrants will be issued with the new ordinary shares on a 1-for-5 basis.

FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ready and eager for the next
phase - The growth of DCC, which makes its market debut today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Mr Jim Flavin, the founder and chief executive of DCC, the
Irish industrial holding company which makes its debut on the London and
Dublin Stock Exchanges today, 'it is the end of the beginning'.
At its flotation price of IPounds 2.50 the company will have a market
capitalisation of IPounds 182m (Pounds 178m). It started out in 1976 as a
venture capital company with just IPounds 1m in equity and according to one
broking firm in Dublin, 'has achieved an annual 23 per cent compound return
for its shareholders since then'.
Evolving into an industrial holding company in 1990 and expanding rapidly
since, the flotation is the step that Mr Flavin hopes will enable DCC to
grow to a market capitalisation in excess of IPounds 1bn early in the next
decade.
'There is a sense of excitement here about the next phase' said Mr Flavin at
his headquarters in Dublin, where he heads a staff of 18 executives.
Together they run a group which includes snack foods manufacturing in
Ireland, waste oil recycling and natural gas distribution in the UK, and
health care services in the US.
Europe, however, is where DCC is planning its next phase of expansion.
Through its Printech subsidiary it is already a leading supplier of computer
manuals to the continental European market. Further expansion of that
business is under way following investment of IPounds 11m in plant and
machinery and the signing of large customers such as IBM, Apple, Digital and
Dell.
A computer products distribution division, with IPounds 70m turnover last
year, plans to expand through acquisitions in Europe, primarily in France
and Germany.
'Both divisions are becoming pan-European. US and Japanese companies
increasingly want to deal with a European-wide company rather than
individual companies in each country. We are developing that capacity,' he
said.
DCC's 11 per cent stake and a directorship in Fyffes also gives it a
substantial interest in the development of the European fruit distribution
business.
Mr Flavin said that the flotation, which is raising IPounds 6m in new
equity, is aimed primarily at giving DCC greater financial flexibility as it
plans its expansion on to the Continent. 'If you want to grow you have to
attract international investors,' he said.
The ones he has in mind are the European fund managers in the UK who he says
are now taking a much greater interest in Irish companies than they were a
few years ago.
No large rights issue is planned for the time being, however. Mr Flavin
points proudly to DCC's record of the past three years in which IPounds 114m
has been spent on capital investment and acquisitions without recourse to
shareholders, and yet the business still has net cash. About IPounds 25m has
been raised through the disposal of 18 non-core businesses in the past four
years, but Mr Flavin's secret is in cash flow.
'All our businesses are quite cash generative. It has been our strategy to
invest in cash-generative companies and which have strong positions in niche
markets,' he said.
The flotation will give DCC the flexibility to finance the next deals
through the issue of paper rather than by using cash, and which he expects
to be modest bolt-on acquisitions in the IPounds 5m to IPounds 15m range.
'We won't do anything which will unbalance the ethos of the company and we
are unlikely to make any acquisition larger than IPounds 50m,' he said.
A key part of that ethos is to keep management teams in place in the
companies acquired whenever possible. 'We are not hell-bent on taking
control . . . We seek to encourage and develop the businesses we are in. We
invest further, rather than slash costs and rake all the cash out.'
In most of the DCC subsidiaries, the management teams have retained a
significant equity participation, giving them a strong incentive to make the
businesses perform well.
Significantly, in four of DCC's six main subsidiaries the key executives are
also those companies' founders.
'Development of the businesses we are in is part and parcel of the group's
culture. We are long term in our thinking and believe that strong businesses
are built over the long haul,' Mr Flavin said.
Evidence of that is Mr Flavin's relationship with Fyffes. DCC first took a
stake in FII, an Irish fruit distributor run by the McCann family, in 1981.
He advised the McCanns on FII's flotation on the USM that year and later
advised them on the takeover of Fyffes in 1986. It is widely believed that
it was Mr Flavin who blocked the Dole bid for Fyffes last year.
If Dole were to return with a better offer Mr Flavin says he is unlikely to
be interested. 'Big businesses are built through constancy. We have a
long-term perspective on Fyffes and we are there to stay,' he said.
But while Fyffes will continue to have a role in DCC as the largest of its
associated holdings, Mr Flavin said that controlled subsidiaries would be
the main profit centres of the group. 'I do not anticipate that controlled
subsidiaries will contribute less than 80 per cent of group profits in the
future,' he said. At present they contribute 76 per cent.
He plans to keep DCC diversified across four or five divisions and not to
borrow heavily to finance acquisitions or investment. 'We like to manage
risk by spread and financial prudence . . . I would be uncomfortable to have
interest cover less than five,' he said.
That financial caution - mirrored incidentally by Fyffes' own aversion to
debt - has brought DCC to the market with a strong balance sheet, no net
debt, and total net assets of IPounds 101m for the year ending March 1994.
Pre-tax profits of IPounds 22.2m last year translate to earnings per share
of 19.6p, which at the flotation price gives an historic p/e of 12.8. Its
prospective p/e is about 11.4.
According to Goodbody stockbrokers in Dublin: 'For a company with DCC's
quality, financial strength and potential for growth, we believe its opening
multiple is very undemanding.'
The meritocratic Mr Flavin, who told reporters last week 'I was not born
with a silver spoon in my mouth,' could not wish for a better accolade to
mark the end of his beginning.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Nurdin &amp; Peacock warns on sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry specialist which is converting to trade
and business warehouses, yesterday warned of difficult trading conditions
and reduced sal-es.
Mr Richard Fulford, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that
sales to date in the current year were about 5 per cent down on last time.
The shares reacted with a 9p fall to 200p.
The chairman said that the transfer of traditional cash and carry outlets
was progressing well with 26 out of 45 being converted. The remaining
conversions should be completed by the end of June.
However, Mr Fulford said that trading conditions for traditional customers
remained difficult.
This situation reflected the lack of any significant increase in customer
spending, the Sunday opening of superstores and price discounting.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Baggeridge Brick shows fourfold gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Baggeridge Brick, one of the last independent UK brick producers,
jumped by almost 9 per cent yesterday, from 126p to 137p, after the company
announced a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.56m for the six
months to end-March, against Pounds 383,000.
The company benefited from increased sales as the housing market recovery
increased demand for bricks. Turnover rose from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds
16.8m. The pre-tax result was helped by a decline in interest payable from
Pounds 522,000 to Pounds 295,000.
Mr Peter Ward, chairman, said: 'Sales of our housing bricks have been
particularly strong in the six months as national housebuilders increased
their building activity.
'Our production volume was markedly higher than last year as all our
factories remained fully operational throughout the winter. Our stock levels
were also reduced.'
Earnings per share increased from 0.65p to 2.62p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.75p.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tadpole Technology calls for Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tadpole Technology, the Cambridge-based electronics company, rose
31p to 316p yesterday despite interim losses and a Pounds 7m cash call.
Indications are that the issue of 2.75m new shares at 260p apiece, through a
placing and open offer fully underwritten by Albert E Sharp, will be
oversubscribed.
Funds raised in this manner will cost the company less than a conventional
rights issue.
The group incurred losses of Pounds 1.35m (profits of Pounds 27,000) before
tax in the six months to March 31, on turnover ahead 19 per cent at Pounds
10.6m (Pounds 8.91m).
Losses per share were 5.2p, against earnings last time of 0.3p.
Analysts and investors were encouraged that the results were in line with
the company's business plan and expect pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 1m
for the full year.
They were also encouraged by the announcement that Tadpole has signed a
potentially lucrative contract with Digital Equipment to add to its existing
agreements with International Business Machines and Sun Microsystems.
The results reflected smaller sales of the market-leading portable
workstation in the first half as customers anticipated the launch of a new
version, the Sparcbook 3, and a decline in gross profit margins from 40 per
cent to 31 per cent because of a change in product mix and the set-up costs
of manufacturing a portable workstation for IBM.
Tadpole leads the world in the technologies necessary to shrink a high
powered engineering workstation to the size of a notebook computer.
Its notebook workstations, which now represent 60 per cent of its business,
are used by aerospace companies for maintenance and dealing houses for
remote trading among other applications. The market today is worth about
Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) and is reckoned to be growing at 100 per cent a
year.
Mr George Grey, chief executive, said the new money would be used to fund
inventory growth arising from increased sales, tooling expenditure for new
products and the repayment of bank borrowings, which stood at Pounds 1.83m
on April 29.
The order book was Pounds 7.9m at the beginning of the second half, 44 per
cent ahead of the same period last year. Mr Grey said that further cash
might be required from the market if growth exceeded expectations.
The company was investigating the possibility of listing its stock as
American Depositary Receipts in the US.

At December 31 1993 net asset value per share, excluding film rights, at
British &amp; American Film Holdings had risen to Pounds 11.81p, against Pounds
10.23p at the end of 1992.
The company said that by April 29 net asset value had risen to Pounds
12.01p.
Pre-tax profits of the investment company jumped to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds
380,000 restated under FRS 3).
Films and videos revenue fell to Pounds 79,000 (Pounds 144,000), but
investment income increased to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.31m). Other income
contributed Pounds 4,500 this time, but interest receivable fell to Pounds
10,000 (Pounds 35,500). The loss on the sale of investments was reduced to
Pounds 51,000, against Pounds 870,000.
The final dividend is raised to 9.3p, which makes an improved total of
13.575p (12.05p). After tax of Pounds 397,000 (Pounds 219,000) earnings per
share advanced from 5.75p to 28.78p.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Concentric rises to Pounds 4.76m -
Competitiveness increased by programme of running investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concentric, the Midlands-based engineering group which makes a range of
products including satellite dishes and valves, pushed up first half profits
by nearly 10 per cent and reported 'an encouraging start' to the second six
months.
In the half year to end-March, pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.76m, compared
with Pounds 4.35m in the same period of 1992-93.
Earnings per share edged ahead, from 5.63p to 5.89p.
The interim dividend is raised 5 per cent, from 1.77p to 1.86p. Total
payments for 1992-93 were 5.86p.
Sales during the first half climbed from Pounds 60.7m to Pounds 64.7m, and
the group managed to widen its margins slightly.
Mr Tony Firth, chairman, ruled out the possibility of price increases in the
present commercial environment: 'Prices at the moment are going down,' he
said.
The increase in sales and profits follows a programme of running investment
 -about Pounds 8m last year and the same again this time - which has
increased competitiveness.
'We're running round the world and trying to capture market share,' said Mr
Firth.
The group sells about 60 per cent of its output to the automotive sector and
30 per cent of its production is directly exported from the UK.
Although Concentric is still finding that demand is sluggish where its
products, like control instrumentation, are part of a customer's capital
expenditure, it is facing rising demand from original equipment
manufacturers in the automotive and white goods sectors: 'Inquiry levels
from potential customers are at an all-time high,' according to Mr Firth.
COMMENT
Concentric's pressure on its own costs and its willingness to invest, both
in and out of recession, are starting to show through in the figures. Its
future stream of profits is assured, but growth is likely to be steady
rather than exciting without a pick-up on the markets. Certainly it could
quickly absorb extra business; overall the group is working at about 80 per
cent of capacity. If the encouraging level of inquiries translate into
scheduled business, then there will be a quick effect on the bottom line.
With market conditions improving, the estimate by the group's brokers of
full year pre-tax profits at about Pounds 11m looks realistic. That would
mean earnings per share of 13.5p, putting the shares at yesterday's price of
241p on a modestly valued prospective multiple of 17.8.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures Hamble given Pounds 68.6m
price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerostructures Hamble Holdings, the former British Aerospace aircraft
components subsidiary, finalised its flotation yesterday, pricing the shares
at 120p to produce a market capitalisation of Pounds 68.6m.
The offer comprises 33.33m ordinary shares, of which 20.83m will be placed
firm with institutions. The remainder will be subject to a clawback to meet
retail demand through intermediaries.
Some Pounds 26.5m net will be raised from the issue of 23.33m new ordinary
shares. The money will be used alongside a new Pounds 10m unsecured
revolving credit facility to repay Pounds 35m of debt incurred during the
Pounds 47.6m management buy-out in 1990.
The directors will be selling 2.9m shares, reducing their holding from 29.9
per cent to 12.1 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
They are retaining 70 per cent of their existing holdings. Institutional
shareholders are selling some 7.1m shares, reducing their stake to 29 per
cent.
Aerostructures Hamble occupies the site near Southampton where Sunderland
flying boats were built.
It made operating profits of Pounds 7.98m on turnover of Pounds 70.4m in
1993, compared with profits of Pounds 7m on turnover of Pounds 71.3m in
1992. Pro forma pre-tax profits for 1993 are put at Pounds 5.6m, after
allowing Pounds 2m for restructuring.
The prospectus gives a notional dividend of 3.74p for 1993, and puts the
expected interim dividend this year at 1.44p. The notional historic gross
yield is 3.9 per cent.
Adjusted pro forma earnings of 10.10p for 1993 give a multiple of 11.9.
The company depended on BAe for 93 per cent of its business in 1990, but
reduced that to 78 per cent last year. New orders already won include a
substantial contract from Boeing for wing parts for the 737-700.
'The amount of new business we have won in the time we have been around I
would describe as extraordinary,' said Mr Andy Barr, chief executive,
yesterday.
Dealings are due to begin on June 9.
The flotation is sponsored by NM Rothschild and the broker is Smith New
Court.
COMMENT
The senior management, all with experience at Rover Group, has put into
practice in the aircraft industry some of the Japanese techniques learnt in
the car business. Margins have improved from 8.9 per cent to 11.3 per cent
in three years. The challenge now is to grow by increasing volumes, which
could prove tough going given the downward pressure on subcontractors.
Competitors - including BAe itself - will not be slow to copy Japanese
methods. However, the group is moving in the right direction, with a
broadening customer base, and the issue looks realistically priced.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Reckitt &amp; Colman shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and toiletries group,
fell 40p to 634p yesterday after Sir Michael Colman, chairman, gave a blunt
trading statement at the annual meeting.
A warning of no benefit to the group from economic recovery in 1994 led to
analysts cutting profit forecasts.
Mr David Saltmarsh, company secretary, said later that the group thought the
market had become too optimistic about current year trading and it had
decided to use the annual meeting to correct that view.
The statement was all the more surprising to the City as Reckitt is usually
regarded as a dull and reliable company, not known for causing shocks.
At the meeting Sir Michael said that the year had started slowly and
'trading in 1994 is turning out to be as difficult as in 1993'. He added
that there was no easing of the 'very tough and competitive conditions' in
Europe and North America and it was unlikely that economic recovery in those
markets would benefit the company in 1994.
He reminded shareholders that Reckitt's products hold up well in the early
stages of recession but are slow to pick up as recovery comes through.
Last year profits were boosted by the strength of the dollar against
sterling, and underlying pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 231.8m to Pounds
260.1m.
Analysts had been looking for profits to reach about Pounds 290m in 1994,
after stripping out Pounds 19m of interest on the group's convertible bonds.
Yesterday, forecasts were cut back by between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m.
Kleinwort Benson, for example, cut their forecast by Pounds 12m to Pounds
265m excluding the convertible bond interest. They said the particular
surprise in the statement was the caution on North America where profit
margins had risen sharply in 1993.

<TEXT>
Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust, which came to the market in November last
year via a placing which raised Pounds 48.5m, yesterday reported a net asset
value per share of 95p at March 31.
Net revenue for the period amounted to Pounds 387,000, giving earnings of
0.76p per share; an interim dividend of 0.5p is declared.
Lord Stewartby, chairman, said that by the end of December about 50 per cent
of the proceeds from the placing had been invested, and as markets began to
fall in February and March this year the programme was accelerated and was
completed by the end of March.
Income during the period therefore included a high level of deposit interest

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Investors back change of control at Brandon
Hire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brandon Hire, the USM-traded tool, catering and furniture hirer which last
month announced an acquisition that could lead to a mandatory offer being
made for the company, yesterday won the necessary approvals at an EGM for
the transaction to proceed.
Under the terms of the deal Brandon is to acquire - for 3.75m new ordinary
shares - JSL Fasteners, a company formed last year by Mr John Laycock.
At the same time Mr Laycock has agreed to acquire 2.25m Brandon shares at
55p apiece from Mr Colin Stone, Brandon's joint managing director, finance
director and co-founder, who will resign with compensation for loss of
office.
Following the passing of the resolutions Mr Stone has resigned as a director
of Brandon and Mr Laycock has been appointed as chief executive.
Mr Laycock now owns or controls 6m Brandon shares - 42.5 per cent of the
enlarged share capital - and is, under the terms of the Takeover Code,
required to make a mandatory offer for the remainder of the equity.
The offer, which is priced at 55p, will close on June 8 unless declared
unconditional as to acceptances, in which case it will remain open until
June 22.
Irrevocable undertakings not to accept the offer have been received from
directors speaking for 4.95m shares - 35.04 per cent of the enlarged equity.
Imperial Pension Nominees, Brandon's largest outside shareholder, has also
undertaken not to accept in respect of its holding of 785,000 shares - 5.5
per cent.
Brandon's shares closed up 3p at 71p.

group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockholm Energi said yesterday it planned to offer Yorkshire Electricity a
17.3 per cent stake in the municipally-owned power company.
Yorkshire last month signed a letter of intent to invest in the utility,
which was seeking a foreign partner in anticipation of deregulation of the
Swedish market.
Stockholm Energi said it needed the additional capital to meet new
competition in its established market and to enable it to seek new markets
for itself. It planned to float next year, if market conditions permitted,
or by 1998 at the latest.
Brokers in Stockholm estimate the stake will cost Yorkshire between SKr1.5bn
and SKr2bn (Pounds 150m to Pounds 172m).

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: National Power seeks clarification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power indicated yesterday that an early sale of power plants was
unlikely as it revealed profits for 1993-94.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, said that although a quick disposal was
possible, everything pointed to potential buyers and the company itself
waiting for clarification on three key issues.
These were the flotation of the government's 40 per cent share in the
company, probably next February, a review of emission standards by the
government's pollution inspectorate and a long-term review by the power
industry of the electricity trading pool.
National Power agreed a deal in February with the electricity regulator by
which it would endeavour to sell 3,000MW of capacity.
Mr Baker said the company was reviewing a range of options including assets
swaps with overseas companies, sales of individual stations and a demerger
involving several plants.
Mr Baker said it would be difficult to effect a subst-antial change to the
company ahead of the flotation of the government's stake next year.
Meanwhile, National Power is to ask its shareholders at the forthcoming
annual meeting for approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares.
Buying back shares is likely to be an increasing trend in the power industry
among companies with low debt. National Power finished the year with gearing
of 13 per cent.
However, Mr Brian Birkenhead, finance director, said the buy-back was just
an option. Seeking permission from shareholders did not mean the company
intended to take it up. There were no immediate plans for a buy-back.
The company is also considering taking part in an auction this spring by the
government in which companies will be given the chance to buy back their
debt. National Power's government debt is Pounds 350m.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brent Walker set 'to move on'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent Walker has reached the stage where its two main trading subsidiaries
can cover the cash interest due on its Pounds 1.4bn of debts, Mr John Leach,
finance director, said yesterday. This had been the purpose of the
refinancing and the group could 'move on from there'.
The bookmaking and public house group, which nearly foundered before its
refinancing in 1992, and a further adjustment to its funding terms this
year, yesterday reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 319.1m (Pounds
427.4m) for 1993. The deficit on shareholders' funds increased from Pounds
602m to Pounds 863.3m.
Sir Keith Bright, chairman, said the group expected to receive a decision
from the arbitrator in the dispute with Grand Metropolitan over the 1989
purchase price of the William Hill betting shop chain by the end of the
year.
Operating profits from continuing businesses were up 14 per cent at Pounds
56.4m (Pounds 49.5m) before exceptional items in spite of tough trading
conditions, Sir Keith said. Turnover from continuing activities was ahead by
9 per cent at Pounds 1.68bn.
Although the interest charge was Pounds 211.8m (Pounds 204.4m), the group
only paid about Pounds 54m of this in cash, with the restconverted into
preference shares.
Operating profits from William Hill rose by 16 per centto Pounds 47.5m,
although first-half profits had fallen after the Grand National fiasco last
year.
Mr Leach said the move to Sunday betting indicated a relaxation in
regulations surrounding betting which would be good for William Hill.
The Pubmaster chain of pubs made Pounds 11.1m, down from Pounds 12.5m, but
Mr Leach said volumes had risen in the first quarter of the current year and
business had stabilised.
The changes to the group's financing terms meant that proceeds from sales of
pubs could be reinvested in the estate.
The property and leisure activities, many of which are to be sold,
contributed operating profits of Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 4.31m). Central
expenses took Pounds 6.47m (Pounds 6.31m).
Mr Leach said the group hoped to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m
from disposals in the current year.
In March the Spanish businesses were sold, the main cause of a provision in
the 1993 figures of Pounds 42.1m. Others due to be sold included the two
casinos in Essex.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 246m) included Pounds 9.36m of
refinancing costs, which included the fees for the aborted flotation of
William Hill.
The group's accounts have again been prepared on a going concern basis,
which assumes that the group will continue to have the support of its banks.
The balance sheet includes the William Hill assets at Pounds 697.2m,
although a valuation of the assets at the year end showed they were worth
Pounds 486.1m.
The company said it would not change the figure in the books until it knew
the outcome of its dispute with GrandMet.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Manders in Pounds 38m Dutch purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manders yesterday grasped a bigger share of the European printing inks
market by agreeing to pay Fl 105m (Pounds 38m) in cash and shares for
Premier Holding, the Dutch specialist manufacturer.
The move is part of the Wolverhampton-based group's plan to shift from being
a paints, inks and property group to a specialist chemicals manufacturer
with an emphasis on printing inks. Manders shares yesterday were unchanged
at 368p.
The alliance of Manders' existing operations in coldset and liquid inks with
Premier's heatset inks production will create the sixth largest printning
inks supplier in Europe.
The biggest players are Sun-Dainippon, a US-Japanese group, BASF of Germany
and Total of France.
The Premier purchase is the fourth significant move in Manders'
reorganisation. It has sold its decorative paints division for Pounds 55m
and will next month complete the sale of its shopping centre in
Wolverhampton for Pounds 82m. It has bought the inks business of Croda
International for Pounds 26m.
The transactions have caused sharp but short term shifts in Manders'
borrowings, but once the Premier purchase and the shopping centre sale have
been completed, Manders expects to hold Pounds 25m of net cash, according to
Mr Robert Purshouse, a group director.
Premier is being bought from Colora, the private company owned by Premier's
managing directors, Mr Jaap Groen and Mr Albert Schuite. It owns 60 per cent
and the ABN Amro bank has the remaining 40 per cent.
Of the purchase price, Manders is paying Pounds 29.7m cash. The balance is
being settled with the issue of 2.15m new shares to Colora, which will then
hold 5.41 per cent of Manders. The shares are valued at 369.2p, a slight
premium over the present market level.
From a factory near The Hague, Premier supplies printing inks to 25
countries. It is the Benelux market leader and the second largest supplier
in the UK.
In 1993 the company made operating profits of Fl 13.3m from turnover of Fl
105.2m. Net assets at the year-end were Fl 25.7m.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: IBM UK moves into outsourcing business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines UK yesterday presented itself in the
unlikely role of championing the trend towards 'minimalist companies' -
organisations which contract out their non-core activities.
The UK market for contracting out, or outsourcing, business services is
worth Pounds 7.1bn a year, according to an independent report commissioned
by IBM, which said the Pounds 337m current value of outsourced activities
represented only a small fraction of the true market.
The UK subsidiary of the global computing giant has responded by putting
staff into two new specialist businesses, Financial Administration Services
and Business Administration Services.
They will offer to manage for external customers functions such as payroll,
vehicle fleet management, document design and accounts - the principal
activities currently outsourced.
About 550 of IBM UK's workforce of 11,000 come under the new businesses,
which until now have been providing these services within IBM. New staff
will be taken on as and when external contracts are won.
Mr Peter Cruttenden, director of finance and planning, said: 'We were
prompted by our own customers to investigate the outsourcing market after
receiving approaches from them to use our administration services.
Outsourcing is the way forward for organisations which need to concentrate
on their core businesses.'
IBM said last month that the group had returned to profitability after three
years of heavy losses and retrenchment.
Asked about IBM's credentials to advise other companies, Mr Cruttenden said:
'We have been through a character-forming experience in recent years. Our
track record speaks for itself. No other company has had to deal with such
technological change in an economic ice age.'
IBM UK's workforce had been cut by about 45 per cent over the past
three-and-a-half years, but the administrative side had shrunk by about 60
per cent.
Mr Cruttenden said IBM UK's exposure in this venture was low-risk, as
outsourcing was still a relatively embryonic market. He said the UK example
was being closely watched by other parts of IBM.
The report says growth of outsourcing is forecast to be 12 per cent this
year, increasing to 19 per cent in 1995. Outsourcing: The Future of

<TEXT>
High Gosforth Park, the quoted company which owns and runs Newcastle
racecourse, heard yesterday that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary,
has refused planning permission for development at its green belt site.
It wanted to raise Pounds 4.4m, by land sales for housing and offices, to
finance improvements to course facilities and had warned that without a
large capital injection it could not continue to trade beyond 1996.
Mr Gummer said it had not demonstrated the 'very special circumstances'
needed to permit green belt development.
All realistic means of financing the proposed improvements had not been
explored, he said; nor was there 'compelling evidence' that the proposed
development was the only way to secure Grade I racing's long-term future at
Gosforth Park.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Expansion fired with the personal touch -
How Denby has rejected the limits of technology in favour of its craft-led
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The view has been obscured deliberately by a row of trees, but it is hard to
ignore the open-cast mine opposite the Denby Pottery factory in Derbyshire.
Here, Joseph Bourne, Denby's 19th century founder, first extracted the raw
materials to make his ginger beer bottles and butter churns.
Denby, which now manufactures brightly-glazed table and cookware, has come a
long way since the factory was established in 1809. It has survived several
near fatal upheavals but one of them cost it its independence as a public
company in 1981.
Today, the company announces the price at which it will ask investors to
back its second attempt to survive as a public company and its plans for
international expansion.
The management, which bought into the group following the collapse of its
parent Coloroll in 1990, is confident that past mistakes will not be
repeated.
There is a sense of deja vu as Denby's management watches its larger
colleagues in the industry consider applying their brand names to products
such as glass and textiles.
Denby's unhappy foray into similar areas in the US in the 1970s left it
reeling under heavy stock losses, and eventually led to takeovers, initially
by Crown House, the engineering company, and then by Coloroll.
Denby is now taking a different view to others in the industry, and not just
on product development where it plans to stick with producing its glazed
stoneware.
Unlike some of the larger, more prestigious manufacturers, Denby has
eschewed the latest developments in technology. Mr Stephen Riley, managing
director, says emphatically that Denby intends to remain a craft-based
company. He proudly states that some 23 pairs of hands will have dealt with
a single Denby mug, and there are no plans for change.
Manufacturers such as Wedgwood and Royal Doulton have used technology to
reduce substantially the labour costs of producing fine china.
Whereas plates used to be made by individual 'throwers' using wet clay
pressed by a hand-driven machine, the process can now be fully automated.
Grains of dust are molded into plates by a high pressure press. Many
manufacturers have also introduced automated glazing machines, where cups
and plates pirouette through a spray tunnel before being fired.
Denby still retains its army of human 'dippers and rinsers' to meet the
particular demands imposed by its distinctive combination of
highly-volatile, coloured glazes.
Their skill lies in rinsing the inside of a vessel with one colour of glaze
and dipping the outside up to the edge in another. This must be done
repeatedly to the same thickness - just one-thousandth of an inch out and
the glaze will change colour completely in the firing.
Industry insiders also argue that the most modern technology limits
flexibility for smaller manufacturers. Once you introduce integrated flow
lines, and highly automated machinery, it becomes less easy to switch
between products to meet demand.
'All you do is create a very inflexible situation where you become a slave
to the machine,' says Mr Kevin Farrell, director of the British Ceramic
Confederation, the industry body.
Mr Richard Booth, Denby's production director, insists the company is not
complacent about technological improvements. However, initial attempts to
use some types of automation have convinced him that Denby is best served by
the more tried and tested methods.
Denby is seeking to turn this 'crafty' element to its advantage, as the
trend shifts towards more informal dining habits. But it has not been the
first to spot the opportunities this provides. Even the likes of Royal
Doulton have announced their intention to introduce more casual ranges.
If such a player decides to enter the market in full force, smaller
manufacturers, like Denby, could face increasing competition.
'With all their factories and spare capacity, they could make a serious
impact,' says one manufacturer. This is where smaller companies will have to
capitalise on image and brand. For Denby, that means selling its unique
glazing skills and rounded shapes.
'I don't think Royal Doulton, or even we, would be able to make that
transition overnight,' says Mr George Hesp, managing director of Portmeirion
Potteries.
While Denby makes the most of its niche in the UK, it must move quickly to
build exports. Compared to similar companies, such as Portmeirion, which
exports more than 50 per cent of sales, Denby's record of 20 per cent is
poor.
The company intends to move rapidly into the US, the world's largest market.
The key is distribution.
'If you want growth in the US, you have got to be in department stores,'
says Mr Hesp.
By securing 15 of the leading chains, Denby is moving down the right path.
The US, so far, appears to be responding to Denby's message. Sales have
doubled in the last two years and are set to double again in 1994. Yet it is
still early days.
'A lot of companies think if you can sell there you can make a fortune,'
says Mr Hesp, who has spent 13 years building up Portmeirion's successful US
business. 'The road to hell is paved with people who thought that and ended
up bust.'
Mr Riley is not expecting any quick fix. 'We are giving ourselves another
four years to get anywhere close to Portmeirion's level,' he says.
He is confident that Denby's efforts to identify itself with a craft-led
image and narrow product range, will carry the group successfully in what
promises to be a competitive market. 'You have got to specialise first, and
then spread your wings worldwide,' he says. 'There is no option anymore.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Warburg in South African link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the investment bank, yesterday announced a link-up with a
leading South African stockbroking firm to help it capitalise on a surge of
investor interest in that country following its first multi-racial
elections.
Warburg said it had reached agreement with Ivor, Jones, Roy and Co, an
agency stockbroker, for exclusive rights to distribute its research about
South African shares to Warburg clients around the world and particularly in
the US.
In addition, the parties have agreed in principle that Warburg will acquire
up to 50 per cent of the shares of IJR once this is permitted by the South
African Stock Exchange and domestic legislation.
Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, Warburg deputy chairman, said the company may also
pursue other activities in South Africa although the form of participation
has not yet been determined.
Warburg becomes the second leading UK investment bank this week to announce
plans to capitalise on the expected demand for South African equities.
With a multi-racial government in place, US public sector pension schemes in
particular are beginning to lift decades-long bans on investment in South
Africa.
However, US investment banks have little expertise in selecting South
African investments because of the absence of links and are thus poorly
placed to offer advice.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure buys site for Pounds 2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parkdean Leisure, the caravan park operator which floated last autumn, has
made its first acquisition as a public company.
It is paying Pounds 2.4m cash to the Marsh family for the Cherry Tree in
Burgh, Norfolk, close to its existing Summerfields site near Great Yarmouth.
Although acquisitions had been foreshadowed, the deal is larger than
expected. Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said that whereas earlier
acquisitions had been of sites needing development, the park already had
'cracking facilities'. Further it had planning consents over an adjacent 10
acres to take another 150 units, expanding from the current 350 units.
The assets being bought had been valued at Pounds 2.4m. Pre-tax profits in
the latest financial year, to end-November, were Pounds 120,000 on turnover
of Pounds 1.42m. Parkdean said margins should improve as the Cherry Tree
park benefited from its supplier discounts and cost controls.
The site trades for a shorter season than Parkdean's other sites, Mr Wilson
said, and could be added to the group's central marketing operation with
little extra cost.
Buying it now would give the group the benefit of current year trading, he
said, and enable Parkdean to assess the site in time to print its 1995
brochure.
The acquisition will be funded by debt, taking gearing to about 30 per cent
at the year end, Mr Wilson said.
The group repeated its view of cautious optimism for the current year with
Easter satisfactory, but reservations for the peak season were following the
trend for later holiday bookings.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Corporate Services calls for Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate Services, the USM-traded human resources group, yesterday
announced the acquisition for Pounds 10m of three businesses, to be funded
by a Pounds 7.5m rights issue.
Mr Jeffrey Fowler, chairman, said the acquisitions were in line with CSG's
core business of contract labour, employment services and training, and
would be profitable from the outset.
CSCT Holdings, which supplies training courses principally for counsellors
in both the public and private sector, will be acquired for Pounds 4m.
It has guaranteed profits of Pounds 750,000 for the year to April 5. CSCT is
currently the only company in the UK with full accreditation from the
Associated Examining Board.
HeMan Contracts, a supplier of contract labour for the construction
industry, has been bought from Rentokil for Pounds 3m. It incurred a pre-tax
loss last year, but is now profitable.
MTS Group Holdings, which provides technical personnel for the engineering
sector, is being bought for Pounds 3m.
CSG was formed by the reverse takeover of Southwest Resources by Mr Fowler's
ADG in 1990.
Mr Fowler said: 'We spent very heavily on systems and management controls,
and are capable of taking on twice the current level of business on the
existing management resources.'
It has launched a chain of small acquisitions, and Mr Fowler said the
company had paid an average acquisition cost of four times first year
profits.
Following the latest acquisitions, the group should achieve Pounds 80m in
revenues, with about 60 per cent coming from contract labour, and the
remainder fairly evenly split between training and employment services.
The rights is at 52p, on a 5-for-12 basis.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Critchley aims to expand with DM27.5m
German buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Critchley Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer, plans to
acquire Idento, a German cable identification products group, for DM27.5m
(Pounds 11m) cash.
The proposed deal will provide Critchley with a Ger-man manufacturing base,
access to the important German market, and a broadened range of cable
identification products.
Mr Ian McCallum, Critchley's chief executive, said the deal represented 'an
excellent opportunity' to expand overseas and to purchase a business with
good margins. The deal will enhance earnings immediately.
Critchley plans to fund the acquisition of the trade, assets and freehold
property of the German company, together with the assumption of about
DM900,000 of liabilities, through an open offer to shareholders designed to
raise about Pounds 10m before expenses.
The exact price of the open offer, which is underwritten up to a maximum of
370p a share by SG Warburg Securities, has yet to be determined. The shares
closed up 19p at 431p yesterday.
Critchley, which came to the market in November 1992 with a strategy for
over-seas expansion both through organic growth and acqui-sition, also
announced estimated full year results yesterday.
Pre-tax profits are expected to show a 26 per cent increase to Pounds 3.85m
(Pounds 3.05m) on turnover of Pounds 28.8m (Pounds 24m) for the year to
March 31. A final dividend of 5.5p (4.8p) is forecast.
Idento, which was founded in 1976, is owned by Berliner Elektro Holding, a
quoted investment fund and associate of Chemie Holdings.
In the year to December 31 the company reported operating profits of DM2.46m
on sales of DM7.75m.
About 60 per cent of its sales were made direct to mainly engineering and
electrical customers, and 22 per cent of its turnover was exported, mostly
to other European companies.

FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4m Lufthansa/Business Air link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German carrier, is to inject about Pounds 4m into Business
Air of Aberdeen, the Scottish regional airline. The deal will be Lufthansa's
first equity participation in a British carrier.
Mr Ian Woodley, chairman and co-founder of Business Air, said yesterday that
the injection, along with further investment from existing shareholders,
would take the company's capital base from Pounds 4m to Pounds 10m.
Lufthansa, which will hold up to 38 per cent of the company, signed a
marketing co-operation agreement with Business Air last summer in order to
develop traffic between the UK and Germany. Business Air's flights from
Scotland feed into Manchester, where connections have been timed to catch
Lufthansa flights.
Business Air - 39 per cent owned by Swiss carrier Crossair - operates five
turbo-prop 34 seaters, and a BAe 146, in partnership with Lufthansa, from
London City Airport to Frankfurt. The company, which employs 170 people, was
founded seven years ago. Last year it flew 140,000 passengers and had
turnover of Pounds 20m.
Mr Woodley said it had developed as a low-cost quality carrier offering
business class service. Lufthansa was making a strategic investment after
the success of last year's agreement.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Japan's Big Four bounce back
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Big Four securities companies - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities,
Nikko Securities, and Yamaichi Securities - have reversed the sharp profits
decline of the early 1990s.
Earnings for the year to March recovered on the back of increasing volumes
on the Tokyo stock market, the domestic bond market rally and aggressive
cost cutting.
Nomura, the industry leader, saw its pre-tax profits multiply 22 times,
while Nikko's increased by 14 times. Daiwa returned to the black, while
Yamaichi posted profits for the first time in three years.
Earnings were supported by a fourth-quarter jump in stock purchases by
overseas investors. Average daily turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
59 per cent from the previous year to Y396.7bn (Pounds 2.5bn), while lower
interest rates supported income from bond trading.
Investor interest in south-east Asia boosted investment trust sales.
However, activity on the stock market remains much more sluggish than in the
late 1980s, and earnings figures are still well below the 1989-90 peak.
Nomura made Y50.7bn pre-tax on a 15.7 per cent rise in revenues to Y398.7bn,
and an after-tax profit of Y24.9bn. Revenue from stock brokerage commissions
rose 50 per cent to Y111.8bn, while the company underwrote Y210bn of issues,
up 223 per cent. Bond trading gains rose 6 per cent to Y32.4bn, and it
underwrote and distributed Y1,500bn in bonds, up 26 per cent.
Daiwa posted pre-tax profits of Y52bn on a 20.2 per cent rise in revenue to
Y296.9bn. Commission income rose 45.4 per cent to Y209.4bn and trading
income increased 15.4 per cent to Y42.1bn.
Nikko reported a pre-tax profit of Y35bn on a 21.1 per cent rise in revenue
to Y279.4bn. Stock brokerage commission rose 45 per cent and earnings from
bond dealings rose 8 per cent to Y30.4bn. Bond underwriting rose 2 per cent
to Y2,845.4bn.
Yamaichi posted a pre-tax profit of Y17.9bn and a 25.3 per cent increase in
revenue to Y236.2bn. Stock brokerage commission rose 36 per cent to Y78.6bn,
while stock underwriting nearly doubled to Y67bn. Bond underwriting rose 25
per cent.

FT  19 MAY 94 / National Power drives annual payout up 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the UK's biggest electricity generator, yesterday shrugged
off a sharp decline in market share to increase its dividend by a higher
than expected 18 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 27 advanced
9 per cent to Pounds 632m, excluding a Pounds 45m exceptional gain.
The announcement sets the tone for what is likely to be an impressive
results season for electricity companies in England and Wales.
PowerGen, the other large generator, is expected to at least match its
rival's dividend growth when it unveils results on June 9. The regional
distribution companies may be slightly more restrained ahead of a regulatory
review of their prices in the summer, but are expected to increase dividends
by well into double figures in percentage terms.
National Power increased its final dividend to 8.75p (7.3p) to make a total
of 12.5p, against 10.6p. It confirmed plans to reduce dividend cover from
three times earnings to 2.5 times. Earnings per share before exceptionals
were 37.3p, against 32.9p.
Analysts upgraded forecasts for this year's dividend with, for example,
Kleinwort Benson pencilling in 14.6p instead of 14.4p, and SG Warburg
Securities moving to 14.5p from 14.3p.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, said the effect of the recent cap on prices
in the electricity trading pool would be 'less than material'.
National Power's pre-tax profits of Pounds 677m (Pounds 580m) included a
Pounds 45m exceptional gain related to pensions. Turnover fell 16 per cent
to Pounds 3.64bn (Pounds 4.35bn).
The company said it had reduced coal stocks by 7m tonnes to 12m tonnes and
cut jobs in the UK from 7,400 to fewer than 6,000.
It was about to start work on its fourth and largest combined cycle gas
station at Didcot, Oxfordshire. The 1,400MW project is likely to be followed
by a fifth at Staythorpe, Nottinghamshire, which would take the company's
CCGT capacity to 5,000MW by the end of the decade.
National Power emphasised its plans for overseas expansion following moves
last year into the US and Portugal. American National Power contributed
Pounds 1m after interest. Mr Baker said overseas profits would be more than
10 per cent of the group total by the end of the decade.
Last year UK market share fell from 41 to 35 per cent. The company expects
the level to stabilise at about 30 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 94 / JP Morgan set to salvage Banesto stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US bank embroiled in controversy over its involvement with
Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), is close to reaching a deal that would
allow it to rebuild its equity stake in the Spanish bank cheaply.
Morgan's Corsair investment fund, which has threatened to sue Banesto, is to
be offered an extra Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) stake in Banesto by its new
owner Banco Santander at a price of about Pta830 a share, compared with
yesterday's price of Pta1,125.
The deal would give Corsair options to restore its stake to near its
original 7.9 per cent. Corsair's Dollars 162m investment was heavily diluted
by the Banesto refinancing which gave Santander control.
The deal is seen by Morgan executives as a chance to repair some of the
damage done to its reputation by Banesto. Morgan acted as adviser to
Banesto's former management as well as selecting the bank as an investment
for Corsair.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, Morgan's chairman, was involved in talks with the
Bank of Spain and Santander. Morgan told the Bank that it might sue Banesto
over its alleged failure to give Corsair a true picture of its financial
state.
Morgan has placed itself in an awkward position because it chose Banesto as
the first investment for the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, in which it holds
10 per cent.
In the refinancing, Santander acquired 60.2 per cent of Banesto for Pta281bn
(Pounds 1.3bn). Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, is thought to have
wanted to give Morgan a chance to regain some value from its involvement in
Banesto because the US bank has faced severe criticism over its apparent
lapse of judgment.
However, Santander is also likely to present the deal as evidence that it
did not over-pay for Banesto. It bid Pta762 per share in the auction last
month, considerably more than its rivals, and its shares initially fell.
The exact price of Dollars 40m placing, and the terms and pricing of the
share options, have yet to be settled. An announcement is expected within
two weeks.
In return for the stake and options, Morgan would abandon any claim against
the Bank of Spain and the country's deposit guarantee fund, which would be
liable to pay compensation for any breach in Corsair's investment agreement.
Corsair investors which bought separate stakes in Banesto, including General
Electric Pension Trust, are likely to be offered options by Santander.
Santander has already placed shares with others including Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Morgan and Santander both declined to comment on details of discussions
yesterday. However, Morgan said it was considering a further investment in
Banesto on behalf of Corsair, and had been 'exploring legal alternatives'.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Bass rises 6% in tough market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim figures from Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, showed an unexpected 6
per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds 242m.
Mr Ian Prosser, chairman, said he expected higher profits for the year as a
whole, but was 'disappointed' that profits from UK brewing were unlikely to
maintain last year's level, as previously planned. Bass's shares fell 8p to
535p.
Operating profit in Bass pubs was up 6 per cent to Pounds 104m, despite
Pounds 6m profit being forgone through disposals. The volume of beer sold
through Bass Taverns, which operated 8 per cent fewer pubs in the period,
fell 9 per cent. Drink sales as a whole were up 6 per cent through Bass
Taverns, against a claimed average for the competition of 4 per cent, and
sales of food rose 8 per cent to pass the Pounds 100m mark on an annual
basis.
Brewing volume was down 0.2 per cent, in a market estimated to have fallen 2
per cent. 'Brewing remains tough, but Bass are winning,' said Mr Prosser. In
the off-licence trade, volume rose 8 per cent. Bass said underlying brewing
margins were down by around 1 percentage point, and brewing profits fell 7
per cent to Pounds 68m.
Profits from hotels rose 22 per cent to Pounds 61m, with a net 70 hotels
being added to the Holiday Inn chain in the half-year. In leisure, profits
increased 11 per cent to Pounds 42m, affected by an additional dividend of
Pounds 7m from Satellite Information Services.
Capital expenditure in the half-year fell sharply from Pounds 359m to Pounds
260m, with spending on brewing down from Pounds 72m to Pounds 45m. Bass said
its brewing investment had passed its peak with the recent opening of the
Pounds 34m Cape Hill brewery near Birmingham.
Group sales fell 1.5 per cent to Pounds 2.24bn, chiefly because of the sale
of pubs and of the Augustus Barnett off-licence chain. Underlying turnover
rose 3.8 per cent.
Group operating profit rose 6 per cent to Pounds 283m, after an additional
Pounds 5m of pension costs. Net interest payable was Pounds 41m (Pounds
39m), and tax was Pounds 82m ((Pounds 80m). Bass had previously expected its
tax charge this year to rise above last year's level of 35 per cent, but it
now expected the interim charge of 34 per cent to be maintained for the
year.
Earnings per share were up 8 per cent at 18.2p, and the dividend was raised
21 per cent to 6.6p. However, Bass emphasised that this was calculated as a
third of last year's total payment, and did not reflect a view on the year
as a whole.

FT  19 MAY 94 / British Gas ventures out of the comfort zone: A shift in
international plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of British Gas's 53 per cent share of Bow Valley, the Canadian oil
and gas company, for Pounds 348m is the latest evidence of a radical shift
in international strategy in one of the world's largest integrated gas
companies.
The Bow Valley sale comes just six months after British Gas announced its
intention to sell an 85 per cent stake in Consumers Gas - the main
distributor of natural gas to the domestic market of Toronto - to
Interprovincial Pipe Line System for CDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 570m).
Regulatory approval for that sale is expected this summer.
The two sales effectively end what some executives termed the 'commonwealth'
phase of the company's internationalisation. It was characterised by a focus
on countries such as Canada and New Zealand, where a shared language and
common legal system offered a high 'comfort factor' to a company just
emerging from privatisation in 1986, and seeking to reduce dependence on the
regulated British market.
Critics, however, claimed that in practice it meant British Gas paying
'first division prices for second division assets'.
For some the wisdom of the strategy seemed to be borne out by British Gas's
abortive attempt to enter Spain, a fast-growing market but one in which
national companies were determined to remain dominant. But the strategy's
weakness was that it offered few growth opportunities and little scope to
add value to the operations, the main explanation for the sale last year of
Consumers.
In addition, the Canadian businesses tied up large amounts of capital when
opportunities to apply the company's expertise were opening up in
high-growth regions such as Asia.
Mr Cedric Browne, chief executive, yesterday confirmed that the Bow Valley
sale 'forms part of the review of our activities. It is consistent with the
policy of focusing on international markets where we see the greatest growth
potential.'
The new international emphasis will be spelled out in detail in the
company's strategic review, expected to be completed within the next few
months. It is likely to include a shake-up of British Gas's international
structure, which is divided between exploration and production of gas and
oil, and Global Gas, which focuses on downstream operations such as
pipelines, distribution and power generation.
It is also expected to re-affirm its intention to become the world's first
'gas major', operating in much the same way as the oil majors. But it is
likely to put a priority on developing gas-related businesses in regions
where it sees the highest growth potential.
These include Asia, where it is involved in gas-fired power generation
projects in Indonesia and Malaysia and a planned gas distribution system for
Bombay.
The southern cone of Latin America will probably be another priority area.
British Gas already has 29 per cent of MetroGas, the Buenos Aires gas
distribution network, and a 45 per cent shareholding in a power generation
project. It is also part of a consortium studying the feasibility of piping
gas from Argentina over the Andes mountains to Chile.
The company is known to be keen to expand its role in building, owning and
operating gas-fired power plants, a sector which is expected to grow
strongly. Earlier this week it took a 51 per cent stake in the US-based Gas
Ventures Advisers, a company it helped set up in 1991 to identify investment
opportunities in large-scale power projects.
Europe remains a desirable area for expansion, but the dominance of state
monopolies offers limited scope outside the emerging markets of central and
eastern Europe.
                            *      *      *
MAIN OVERSEAS STAKES:

FT  19 MAY 94 / Court fines Ralph Lauren for copying rival's design: Yves
Saint-Laurent claims victory is important step for fashion world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, yesterday set a new trend in
the industry by winning FFr2m (Pounds 230,000) damages in a Paris commercial
court after suing Ralph Lauren, the leading US fashion designer, for copying
one of its dress designs.
It is commonplace in the fashion trade for leading designers such as
Saint-Laurent and Ralph Lauren, to sue counterfeiters, or 'knock-off
merchants', at the lower end of the business. But this is the first case of
its kind involving two such prestigious names.
The case, conducted with all the drama of the fashion world, concerns a
black tuxedo dress sold in 1992 by Ralph Lauren's boutiques which
Saint-Laurent claimed was copied from one of his 1970 designs.
Mr Pierre Berge, chairman of Saint-Laurent, was fined FFr500,000 yesterday
by the same court after Ralph Lauren complained about allegedly defamatory
remarks he made concerning the case in Women's Wear Daily, the US fashion
trade magazine. Ms Francine Summa, Saint-Laurent's lawyer, said after the
hearing that Mr Berge 'would have been better off keeping his mouth shut'.
Yet the Saint-Laurent camp's disappointment at that defeat was dwarfed by
its glee over its triumph in the main case. 'We're very satisfied with the
outcome,' said Mr Christophe Girard, company secretary. 'It's an important
step for us and the entire industry.'
The drama of the tuxedo dress began in late 1992 when Saint-Laurent's
lawyers spotted a magazine picture of a Ralph Lauren dress which was similar
to the 1970 design that the French designer had reinterpreted for his autumn
1992 collections.
Counterfeiting is a serious problem for the leading fashion houses of Paris,
Milan and New York, all of which have assembled heavyweight legal teams to
crack down on illegal copies of their designs and trademarks. Saint-Laurent
spends around FFr50m a year fighting counterfeiting. Chanel, another French
house, is believed to spend FFr30m.
However, the black tuxedo case is the first to have raised the sensitive
subject of designer 'copy-catting' in the law courts. Until now, designers
have balked at taking legal action over such issues because of the
difficulty of proving that one design was actually copied from another.
Ms Madeleine Cotelle, the judge in the black tuxedo case, summoned models
wearing the Saint-Laurent and Lauren designs to her courtroom so she could
inspect them.
Ralph Lauren declined to comment on yesterday's ruling. It said it would
wait until the judge's report is published later today before deciding
whether to appeal.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Record tax write-off as collection rate falls: Revenue says
high number of insolvencies to blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is writing off more in uncollected tax than at any time in
history, at a cost of billions of pounds to the Treasury.
Figures released this week show that collection rates for a range of taxes
have fallen sharply over the 13 years to 1992, the most recent for which
information is available.
The government is now remitting or writing off more than 3 per cent of the
sum it collects for three taxes: schedule D tax on the self-employed,
capital gains tax and corporation tax.
The taxes in question were assessed but were not collected.
The proportion of tax lost in this way has more than trebled since 1980.
A total of Pounds 1.36bn in 1992 alone was written off from all direct
taxes, which include pay as you earn and National Insurance contributions.
The rate of decline in tax collected has been particularly steep since 1990.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said the figures were 'a
two-fold failure' reflecting both the depth of the last recession and recent
Inland Revenue staff cuts.
'We knew the Tories are not the party of low tax; now we know they are the
party which cannot collect tax,' she said.
The Inland Revenue said last night that more than three-quarters of the
amount of tax written off was the product of insolvencies during recession.
This included a higher rate of failures associated with the growth of
self-employed businesses over the last decade.
'We aim to collect all tax that is legally due, otherwise it would be unfair
to other taxpayers,' it said.
Other large sums were written off because the taxpayer had gone abroad or
could not be traced, or because the costs of recovery had become too great
to justify pursuing outstanding tax.
The Revenue also changed its accounting policies in 1992. This resulted in
the immediate write off of any tax claims against insolvent companies.
If this is taken into account, the amount remitted or written off in 1992
rises to almost Pounds 1.7bn.
Ms Harman said she planned to write to Mr Robert Sheldon, MP, chairman of
the Commons public accounts committee, to urge him to investigate the
government's tax collection record.
The figures were released by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, in a series of parliamentary written answers to Mr Matthew Taylor,
the Liberal Democrat MP for Truro, and Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for
Hartlepool.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Dollar under pressure despite rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar came under pressure on foreign exchange markets yesterday despite
Tuesday's increase in US short-term interest rates and efforts by senior
Clinton administration officials to talk up the US currency.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said the Federal Reserve's decision
to raise short-term interest rates by half a point should help underpin the
dollar. Mr Lawrence Summers, the senior official on international affairs,
repeated earlier assurances that the Treasury saw 'no advantage to an
undervalued dollar'.
In late trading in New York, however, the dollar was down more than 1 1/2
pfennigs at DM1.6565 and down just over a yen at Y103.48.
Analysts said the dollar was being sold because the positive impact from the
tightening of US monetary policy had been more than offset by a Fed
statement signalling that short-term rates were now close to a 'neutral'
level. The belief that US short-term rates would not be raised again in the
near future had reduced the dollar's attractions relative to other leading
currencies, economists said.
Mr Henry Kaufman, bond market analyst, said the dollar's weakness also
reflected the US Treasury's failure to state categorically that further
depreciation was unacceptable. It was also depressed by capital outflows and
a perception that the German economy was recovering faster than expected.
The main aim of the Fed's statement had been to bolster confidence in the US
bond market by convincing investors that they did not face a sequence of
future rate increases.
Yesterday, however, analysts were worried that the Fed's remarks could
backfire in foreign exchange markets, where central banks are attempting to
stabilise the dollar. 'The downside risk for the dollar went up hugely
following the Fed's statement,' said Mr Paul McCulley, chief economist at
UBS Securities in New York.
He said traders speculating against the dollar had weighed the risk of a
rise in US short-term rates and the possibility of central bank intervention
to support the dollar. Now they faced only the risk of intervention.
US stocks were mixed yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up
12.28 at 3,732.89 as weakness in some key cyclical issues prevented the blue
chips from building on the previous session's 49-point rally.

FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In yesterday's speech to the CBI, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial
secretary to the Treasury, ruled out heavy-handed government measures to
restrict dividend payments. But he left the way open for tax reforms to
improve the efficiency of capital markets. The Treasury remains concerned
about the growth of dividends through recession, since that could imply that
equity is losing its role as a shock absorber in times of financial strain.
Reforms which encouraged fund managers to invest in bonds for income and
equities for capital growth might help. It is striking that UK pension funds
still hold on average less than 10 per cent of assets in fixed-interest
securities, compared with over 50 per cent in the US. If the government
could encourage institutions to buy bonds or preference shares, some of the
pressure for ever-rising dividends might be relieved. A more liquid
corporate bond market on the US model might also develop. That would provide
medium-sized companies with access to term debt.
Yet it is far from clear how all this might be achieved. Measures which made
equities less attractive as a source of income for institutions - by again
reducing the tax credit available to gross funds on dividends, for example -
would provoke a furious response. If the government is serious about tilting
the balance of investment away from equities the real answer is to keep a
firmer grip on inflation than has hitherto been the case.

FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: National Power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International diversification by privatised UK utilities has received a bad
name. That is why National Power is rather coy about its overseas investment
plans. Though its public goal is to invest Pounds 1bn in international
expansion by the end of the decade, the management's true ambitions are more
extensive. The group would, for example, be prepared to spend Pounds 500m on
a foreign privatisation in addition to the Pounds 1bn, which is earmarked
for green field site investments.
The group's financial strength will permit such investment levels. Net cash
inflow from operations - Pounds 832m during the last financial year - will
rise as economic recovery gathers pace and yet more costs are squeezed out
of the business. Meanwhile, capital expenditure in the UK will bob around at
the current level of Pounds 436m. Without foreign investments, National
Power's gearing of 13 per cent would soon turn into a cash pile. Even if the
whole Pounds 1bn was spent by 1998 and dividends are raised as envisaged,
gearing would still be modest.
Shareholders may feel they would do better if the pay-out was increased
faster than planned or the company bought back its own shares. But it would
be a mistake to tar National Power with the same brush as other utilities
such as BT and British Gas. Its international strategy is more focused. The
opportunities in global power generation look fairly attractive. Moreover,
National Power can already boast one success: American National Power has
contributed to earnings after financing costs in its first year within the
group.

FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After all that effort Mr Ian Prosser of Bass must be crying into his beer.
Despite his determination to gain market share, beer volume was down
slightly at the interim stage and the company's share of the overall market
went up by only 0.3 percentage points. The cost was a drop in brewing
profits of nearly 7 per cent. Despite a series of one-off factors, there is
no mistaking the remorseless pressure on margins.
The company's response has been to continue cutting costs and to reduce in
relative terms the resources allocated to brewing. Free-trade loans are
being scaled back and brewing is receiving less capital expenditure. But
given the company's position in the market it seems condemned to see out the
beer price war. While Allied-Lyons shares rose 1 per cent yesterday on the
growing conviction that beer need not form part of its long-term strategy,
those of Bass fell nearly 2 per cent on the realisation that as market
leader, it cannot afford to pull out.
That move may be overdone simply on the basis that Bass had already fallen
nearly 5 per cent against the sector so far this month. At least hotels are
doing better, though the extent of the franchise operation limits their
gearing to recovery. Government competition rules give Bass some scope to
expand its pub estate and any sale of the Britvic soft drinks business could
provide the resources further to improve its quality. Brewing looks set to
remain a drag for some time, though. With earnings and dividend growth both
in single figures, there is no reason why its shares should out-perform.

FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Sizing up the Fed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not long ago a half point rise in US interest rates would have provided
secure support for the dollar. The currency's weakness yesterday shows the
Federal Reserve is caught in a painful vice. It might have hoped that the
prospect of a hiatus in rate rises would calm the bond market. Yet on the
other side of the Atlantic financial markets are starting to take note of
Germany's incipient recovery. Notwithstanding yesterday's cut in the
Bundesbank's repurchase rate, the trough in German rates is now expected
earlier. The prospective growth and interest rate differential has moved
back in favour of the D-Mark.
A weak dollar, though, is hardly a tonic for US bonds. Coupled with the fear
that the Fed may still tighten further if the recovery remains robust, that
thought was enough to reverse the initial satisfaction with which markets
greeted Tuesday night's apparently decisive move. There can be no certainty
that US rates have stopped rising until the economy has clearly slowed. Even
then higher short-term rates may be needed to prop up the dollar and
encourage overseas funds back into Treasury bonds.
Such a prospect holds little comfort for global equities which remain in the
shadow of bonds. Only in continental Europe, which is further behind in the
cycle, is there much support left to come from earnings recovery. The UK
market must be feeling increasingly uncomfortable after yesterday's earnings
data. The Fed's example shows how difficult it is for central banks to
manage the turn in rates.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Privatise the Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even Baroness Thatcher baulked at the idea in the 1980s, yet the case for
privatising the UK Post Office is now overwhelming. Sensitive social and
political issues are at stake. But by comparison with those involved in
transferring the water and telecommunications industries into the private
sector, they are far from difficult to resolve, while the potential benefits
are considerable.
By international standards the Royal Mail has an impressive performance
record. It none the less suffers from the worst afflictions of the old
nationalised industries. Its capital spending and pricing are subject to
detailed ministerial control. It is milked as a cash cow by the government
with little regard to the long-term health of the business. This year it has
been set an arbitrary target to pay the government Pounds 230m, a sum higher
than the Post Office's current post-tax profit and nearly twice as much as a
reasonable dividend payment. Meanwhile, capital investment languishes and
the price of stamps is higher than it need otherwise have been.
Restrictions on the Post Office competing with the private sector, and
engaging in overseas ventures, threaten its future as anything more than a
house-to-house deliverer of paper protected by monopoly. The Dutch postal
service is about to be privatised; it is at the forefront of new
communications technologies and is selling hard in the UK, alongside a host
of private operators. The distinction between mail, telecoms and computing
is already blurred; within a few years it will be archaic.
Commercial freedom
To flourish, the Post Office needs entrepreneurial and commercial freedom.
In theory, that could be guaranteed within the state sector; in practice the
UK has never managed to make such a half-way house habitable. Privatisation
is the sensible way forward - accompanied by an obligation to deliver
letters daily across the country; by a continued monopoly over deliveries up
to a certain weight or value; by a regulator to protect consumer interests;
and by accounting separation to prevent the Post Office subsidising
non-monopoly operations from monopoly revenues.
To reassure consumers, the government might retain a 51 per cent stake in
the company and nominate a number of directors. The crucial decision is to
proceed to market; the proportion of the share capital to be floated is of
secondary importance. If the privatisation of BT is any guide, consumers
will soon be better off, not worse off. And not just as a result of
technology: there are nearly twice as many pay phones as a decade ago, and
they now work.
Understandable concern
That leaves the thorny issue of post offices - the 'counters' division of
the Royal Mail. There is understandable concern at the prospect of wholesale
closures among the UK's 20,000 post offices, the bulk of them sub-post
offices run as subsidised private businesses under contract.
Sub-post offices remain vital for rural communities and for benefits
recipients without bank accounts. In the short term, therefore, subsidies
should continue - both those in the form of cash paid to the franchisees,
and those in the form of agency work protected by the government (notably
benefits payments). Yet the point of principle is clear: post offices should
service social needs. As ever more pensioners and benefits recipients come
to possess their own bank accounts, the losers from a decision not to credit
payments directly into bank accounts will be taxpayers and the recipients
themselves.
However, only the faint-hearted should suppose that small post offices can
survive by subsidy alone. With privatisation should go a bonfire of the
senseless controls which forbid post offices from offering banking and other
private sector services under contract. In partnership with a bank, the
Dutch post office's outlets transact mortgages, offer banking, travel and
recruitment services, and more besides.
Britain's post offices could do a thriving private trade, particularly in
rural areas without banks or other services. If supermarkets are free to
sell stamps bearing the Queen's head, there is no earthly reason why post
offices should not be able to sell concert tickets and issue cash from bank
accounts.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Derivatives in the dock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislators in the US Congress have long been worried that trading in
derivative financial instruments such as swaps, futures and options might
confront them with another financial crisis to match the hugely expensive
savings and loan fiasco. Yesterday's report on derivatives from the General
Accounting Office (GAO) will no doubt strengthen their resolve to control
such trading. Yet the report's conclusion that there is a need for
substantial tightening of the regulatory system in relation to derivatives
runs counter to the more reassuring verdict of an authoritative, earlier
report by the Group of 30, an influential banking think-tank. Are the
politicians overreacting?
The dramatic growth in derivatives trading and the losses recently recorded
by such companies as Metallgesellschaft Kashima Oil, Procter &amp; Gamble and
Atlantic Richfield are unquestionably eye-catching. Yet the risks involved
in these novel financial instruments are the same, in principle, as those in
conventional banking such as credit risk, market risk or liquidity risk. The
differences are of degree.
Derivative instruments are intrinsically leveraged: a small movement in the
underlying cash market can produce a big change in the value of the
derivative. The mathematical complexity of the more exotic instruments calls
for heavy expenditure by banks and companies on appropriate systems and
skills.
Lack of transparency
Properly used, derivatives are a highly effective tool to manage and control
risk. But as the GAO rightly observes, they can be used to assume risk,
notably in proprietary trading, as well as to reduce it. While most central
bankers argue that the probability of a systemic shock is low, they cannot
deny that there is a lack of transparency in the system. The fastest growth
is in over-the-counter trade, not in organised markets. Accounting standards
have been slow to capture the impact of derivative activity both on and off
the balance sheet.
An essential discipline in the system consists of marking derivative
exposures to market value on a daily basis. Yet many of the contracts are
customised for individual institutions and valued on the basis of computer
models incorporating assumptions of varying boldness about the future
relationship between interest rates, currencies and markets. Since the
assumptions rely on past correlations, they can prove wrong.
Such complexity can make a nonsense of traditional checks and balances.
Losses incurred by a leading trader at Kidder Peabody, for example, went
unnoticed by his fellow traders, the back office, senior management and
auditors. Too often the trader's pay is related to a performance period
shorter than the duration of the derivative contracts. Most players in the
game are relying heavily on the monitoring provided by credit rating
agencies and regulators, who are not infallible.
Cross-infection
The threat to the global banking system stems from the possibility that in
this opaque trading world banks will make poor credit assessments of
counterparties who take lethal trading risks. The GAO emphasises that, in an
increasingly integrated and concentrated market, the investment banks' and
insurers' mis-assessment of risk in derivatives could be as dangerous for
the system as that of the commercial banks. Also that cross-infection in a
global market will be hard to contain.
Anything other than a global approach to regulation will be less than fully
effective. The thrust of supervision should thus continue to be chiefly
through the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, whose capital
adequacy regime will need constant upgrading in the light of experience of
instruments that are still relatively untested. Yet it is hard to argue with
the GAO's assertion that there are gaps in the domestic US system, in terms
of both data and oversight, which need to be plugged.
The GAO also raises a legitimate concern in questioning whether the present
level of proprietary trading is appropriate in a deposit-insured banking
system subject to a high degree of moral hazard. A comprehensive and
consistent regulatory approach is probably beyond the art of the possible.
But in the absence of that, a piecemeal approach is better than nothing at
all.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Favourites of the fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Illicit refunds. By pretending to channel food outside the EU while selling
it inside the Union, fraudsters can both gain an export subsidy and
capitalise on higher EU food prices. A favourite method is to forge customs
documents saying food is going to eastern Europe while selling it, for
instance, in Belgium.
Meat carousels. Frozen meat can be shipped between several different
countries to maximise refunds. One shipment of east European beef recently
went from Italy to Malta, back to Italy and then to Austria, with the
refunds gained twice.
Mayonnaise madness. Similar scams work for processed foods such as
mayonnaise or chocolate biscuits. By transporting the items several times in
and out of the Union, traders may be able to over-claim on export refunds
for the raw ingredients such as sugar.
Switched labels. With different categories of food being given different
export subsidies, traders may incorrectly describe specific foodstuffs to
claim higher refunds. This has happened, for instance, with cheese labelled
as Gouda when it was lower-quality cheese ineligible for a refund.
Shrunken stores. Crooks can capitalise on the 'intervention' payments made
to take foodstuffs off the European market. Fraudsters appear to have gained
Ecu200m (Pounds 153m) by invoicing for invisible wheat supposedly put in
Italy's intervention store.
Crop capers. With many crops grown in Europe eligible for subsidies, farmers
may inflate figures for the amount of land under cultivation with a
particular crop. This practice is believed to have been rife in the Greek
cotton industry.
Animal antics. Farmers may be tempted to give higher numbers for their
livestock than exist to claim larger subsidies. The Commission is attempting
to counter this with a computerised database of European cows.
Crooked roads. Substantial sums earmarked for infrastructure programmes may
have been diverted to fraudsters through false invoicing or money being paid
out for projects which never finished.

FT  19 MAY 94 / A labyrinth of loopholes: There will be no easy victory in
the EU's war against fraud in the payment of subsidies and grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To many people, the European Union represents not fraternal partnership, but
fingers in the till. Now, as the fraud bill mounts, Europe is getting tough.
At a meeting in Brussels of EU finance ministers this week, Mr Peter
Schmidhuber, the Union's budget commissioner, spelt out measures to stem the
flow of cash being wasted through fraud and other financial irregularities.
This is officially put at Ecu343m (Pounds 264m) last year, 63 per cent up on
1992, but is thought by many experts to be at least 10 times higher at about
5 per cent of the EU's annual Ecu70bn budget.
The full extent of the financial deception is difficult to calculate. But
the evident scale of the problem - often the result of loopholes in
labyrinthine EU spending rules - is triggering mounting concern in finance
ministries across Europe.
Nowhere is the angst felt more keenly than in Germany, the largest
contributor to EU funds. Reacting to public concern in this election year
that large amounts of this money are being wasted, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's
finance minister, has signalled that Bonn will take a tough line on EU fraud
when it takes over the Union's presidency on July 1.
Mr Per Brix Knudsen, a tough-talking Dane who heads Uclaf, the Commission's
anti-fraud unit, sums up Brussels thinking: 'The image that the European
Union is prone to fraud is used increasingly to discredit Union policies. We
must put more effort into protecting the EU's financial interests.'
Mr Knudsen is spearheading efforts to reduce the losses, including a
doubling in the staff of Uclaf (the word is a French acronym) from 50 to 100
by the end of the year. He is setting up a telephone hotline on which
members of the public across Europe can report instances of fraud in
confidence. The Commission is also on course to finalise by June 1 a package
of 'administrative sanctions' which would empower member states to impose
fines on companies and individuals suspected of misappropriating EU cash
before there has been any resort to court proceedings.
Mr Knudsen is not alone in his efforts. The Luxembourg-based Court of
Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog, has acquired new powers to take
legal action against the Commission and member states if it thinks they are
failing to act against fraud. Although he admits he faces an uphill
struggle, Mr Andre Middelhoek, the Dutch president of the court, promises to
be 'blunt and undiplomatic' in attributing responsibility. 'None of the
member states are keen enough' to tackle fraud, he says.
Instrumental in bringing the problem to the attention of member states has
been Professor Klaus Tiedemann, a criminologist at Freiburg University in
Germany who has studied pan-European abuse of government money for 20 years.
According to Prof Tiedemann, between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of the
Union's budget is wasted through fraud and improper exploitation of
loopholes. He bases his figures on detailed inquiries into sectors such as
agricultural goods, iron and steel, and social funds - all of which receive
EU subsidies and other funding. Prof Tiedemann admits his overall figure is
a 'guesstimate', but it is one viewed as broadly correct by other experts.
Commission staff admit the amount of fraud is higher than the published
figure, but say the full extent is impossible to assess accurately.
According to Uclaf, EU frauds worth Ecu976m were reported between 1990 and
1993. Of this, nearly half - Ecu446m - involved funds spent in Italy.
Germany accounted for Ecu204m, France Ecu97m, Britain Ecu85m, Belgium
Ecu32m, Greece Ecu29m and the Netherlands Ecu25m.
The reason most commonly given for the scale of the problem is the EU's
complex rules for administering subsidies, especially to farmers. This
funding accounts for half the budget despite attempts to reform the Common
Agricultural Policy.
With an estimated 3m farm-related cash transactions a year eligible either
for a direct payment to a farmer or an 'export refund' to a company
processing or transporting food, the opportunities for financial abuse are
immense. Various methods are used, some sophisticated, others touching on
farce (see box).
For instance, prosecutors in Rotterdam have started proceedings against a
gang of six arrested last year on suspicion of routing 120 lorry loads of
sugar, supposedly meant for Croatia and Slovenia, to Italy. By forging
customs documents, the gang - based in France, Italy and the Netherlands -
allegedly dodged duties worth about Ecu1.8m.
In the UK, two brothers, both farmers, inflated the number of sheep they
owned from 18 to 180, so gaining a higher EU subsidy. By repeatedly
pretending to be each other, the brothers sidestepped for some time
inquiries from the UK's Ministry of Agriculture. Ultimately they were taken
to court and fined a total of Pounds 6,000.
In another case, two cattle dealers based in Northern Ireland were jailed in
1992 for having made about Pounds 20m from smuggling 22,000 cattle backwards
and forwards across the border into the Republic of Ireland. They arranged
the transfers to tie in with shifts in the pound/punt exchange rate and so
exploit EU subsidies linked to currency movements.
More recently, the Italian authorities arrested a gang in southern Italy for
allegedly defrauding the EU of up to Ecu200m by gaining payment for wheat
which they claimed was in EU commodity warehouses but which, it appears, may
not have existed. The case is in the early stages of prosecution.
In another case, fraudsters in Rome and Naples are alleged by the Commission
to have claimed Ecu22m over several years by pretending to arrange
non-existent training programmes.
Many observers cite the lack of incentives (such as a significant financial
reward) for member states to report irregularities as a second reason why
fraud is rife. In some cases, there may even be disincentives to report
irregularities: EU subsidies, whether gained legally or not, may be playing
an important part in stimulating the economies of poorer regions.
A third reason, according to Mr Malcolm Levitt, a former EU official who is
now European adviser at Barclays Bank, is that the Commission has a
'collegial' culture with too few people taking responsibility for financial
controls.
As to which countries are most lax on fighting fraud, Commission officials
have been reluctant to assign blame. However, the mood in Brussels is
beginning to change, with a growing inclination to name countries suspected
of being less than diligent in this area. In the vanguard of this trend is
Germany, the EU's biggest paymaster with a net contribution in 1992 of
DM22bn (Pounds 8.8bn), a figure likely to grow to DM30bn by 1997, according
to Bundesbank forecasts.
With the country facing a DM112bn budget deficit this year (about 3.5 per
cent of gross domestic product), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition
government is under pressure to tackle any waste of money by Brussels. In
this, Bonn has found allies in Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the UK
government. Mr Waigel discussed the need to raise awareness of EU fraud with
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, last month.
While German government officials are reluctant to name those countries most
prone to fraud, Prof Tiedemann says 'empirical studies over the past decade
have shown southern member states to be more inclined to fraud than those in
the north'. Mr Peter Price, a British Tory member of the European Parliament
and a former chairman of its budgetry control committee, singles out Italy
and Greece.
Such observations, though echoing fraud experts, touch a nerve with the
countries named. An Italian government official responds that Italy takes
'an extremely serious' view of fraud, while a Greek government official
says: 'These comments are not borne out by statistics.'
A less restrained approach to discussing the problem is one way of
highlighting it. As for practical steps, Mr Schmidhuber is pressing for
closer co-operation between the Commission's fraud unit, Uclaf, and national
police and customs forces. Many of the 50 newcomers to Uclaf will be former
police or customs officers skilled in tracking international criminals. The
unit is currently co-ordinating investigations into between 30 and 70
large-scale European frauds.
Over the next few years, Uclaf may be helped by a shift in the pattern of EU
farm payments. By the end of the decade, according to Mr Brian Gardner, of
the Brussels-based farm consultancy EPA Associates, 80 per cent of the
payments - twice the current proportion - will go straight to farmers, and
only 20 per cent to companies processing or transporting food. He believes
the new system should be easier for the police because keeping track of
payments to fixed establishments such as farms should be simpler than
tracking payments to companies moving goods around Europe.
Despite these initiatives and the assertive mood in Brussels, the anti-fraud
effort faces several constraints. Today's enthusiasm may quickly give way to
ennui. One sceptic is Ms Annemarie Goedmakers, a Dutch socialist MEP and
member of the budgetry control committee, who says Brussels is putting on a
'big show' of talking tough about fraud but has not been resolute enough in
tackling it.
Other sceptics doubt the Court of Auditors has a suitably efficient
structure to identify the main perpetrators of fraud. Court policies are set
by 12 officials - one from each member state - who meet each Thursday, and
who may have different degrees of enthusiasm about following up specific
instances of alleged fraud. The court's reports (which never name parties
allegedly involved in fraud) are felt by some observers to lack the cutting
edge of, for instance, the General Accounting Office in Washington, which
monitors US government spending.
In addition, many frauds are inherently complex and difficult to prosecute -
especially given the current lack of harmony in anti-fraud legislation
across the EU. At present only about 10 per cent of the EU frauds reported
each year end up in the courts, and few observers expect the figure to rise
significantly.
All these difficulties suggest the EU's fraud fight is likely to be won only
slowly. Few insiders think there are merits in devising grandiose
initiatives - such as a pan-European police squad concerned with fraud  -
which could lead to a duplication of efforts and antagonise member states.
As EU officials contemplate what to do about fraud, the uncomfortable
thought occurs that the planned enlargement of the Union - Austria, Finland,
Norway and Sweden are lined up for entry next year - may make matters still
worse. The entry of these nations, whatever their commitment to fighting
fraud, will increase the complexity of the methods needed to decide and
supervise EU subsidies. Unless effective action is agreed soon to combat
irregular payments, what one observer calls the 'black hole' down which
money is now disappearing could soon develop into a chasm.

Things don't get better for the African Development Bank. Weighed down by
arrears, its recent AGM ended in a shambles. Now the regional development
bank has lost its treasurer, Kofi Bucknor, to Lehman Brothers.
A skilled negotiator and a fine ambassador for the bank, Bucknor apparently
became disenchanted when he was not made chief financial officer - a post
that has been vacant for some time - and for which he seemed perfectly well
qualified.
'So he has auctioned himself to the highest bidder,' as one banker put it -
even if Bucknor, a scion of one of Ghana's leading families, is not exactly
short of a bob or two. Moving to London, he will head up Lehman's African
investment banking operation.
James Ranaivoson, a Madagascan who previously worked for the Caisse des
Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution, is his most
likely replacement. With the AfDB suffering losses that could imperil its
very survival, the new man won't be bored.

The death of John Smith has not quelled talk of a leadership crisis in the
Tory party. Michael Heseltine's odds have lengthened sharply and Kenneth
Clarke's reputation remains in the doldrums. Indeed, the prospect of young
Tony Blair taking Labour into the next election has added to the Tory
turmoil.
Current wisdom has it that if Labour opts for Blair, then Michael Portillo's
chances will be greatly improved. Portillo is three weeks younger than Blair
and he has served in the cabinet, for what that's worth.
But another name is now being floated by MPs on the centre-left of the party
who can't abide Portillo's Euro-scepticism. Stephen Dorrell, 42, tipped to
enter the cabinet in the summer reshuffle, is being promoted as the man most
likely to beat the fresh-faced Blair.
Only problem is that most voters would find it hard to distinguish one
ex-public schoolboy from the other. The social democrat Blair and the
One-Nation Tory Dorrell tend to agree with each other more often than they
do with rivals in their own parties.

Until now, membership has been confined to permanent secretaries who,

Instead, Italy's new premier was on the terraces of the upper house of the

While the media magnate has publicly pledged not to give up the reins of the

FT  19 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: How to live with business ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival of a new book on business ethics that has something valuable to
say is such a rare event as to be worth celebrating even if it has its
faults. The volume in question is Just Business by Elaine Sternberg,
published today (Little, Brown, Pounds 20). The author was a lecturer in
philosophy at the London School of Economics before spending 14 years as an
investment banker and is now running her own con-sultancy.
The reader should move quickly through the embarrassing introduction - which
reads as if it were written at the behest of the publisher and tries to sell
the book by promising an 'ethical decision model' that 'resolves business
ethics questions whenever and wherever they arise'. The author's professed
intellectual mentors are Aristotle and the late Michael Oakeshott, but her
style in these early pages could not be more different from these weighty
authors. She might have come clean, too, on the low value that Aristotle
placed on business, instead of just a coy reference.
Once into the book, the self-adulation fades and one begins to appreciate
its clarity and directness. Sternberg has two theses. First, the sole task
of business is to maximise the long-term value of the owners' stake by
selling goods and services. It is not to exercise 'social responsibility'
for crime prevention, urban decay, the education of the young or the
provision of managerial advice to government. Thus she has no time for
fashionable ideas such as 'stakeholder theory' in which workers, customers
and suppliers count equally with shareholders.
Indeed, she argues that Milton Friedman is too modest in characterising the
use of a company's resources for non-profitable moral purposes as
unauthorised taxation. She regards such activities as 'theft: an unjustified
appropriation of the owners' property - as surely as if they had dipped
their hands into the till'.
Nevertheless her attitude is far removed from the 'devil take the hindmost,
anything goes' attitude. For her second main thesis is to insist that
everyone in business has a duty to behave ethically. The ethics show
themselves in the means used to achieve business objectives, and not in
deviating from them for supposedly worthwhile goals. Mercifully, she does
not believe that there is a separate body of ethics applying to business and
not to other spheres. For her business ethics is just the application of
straightforward ethics to one complex sphere.
Ethical methods involve 'ordinary decency', which she divides into honesty,
fairness, refraining from coercion and physical violence, and respecting the
law. By fairness she has in mind, for instance, not deliberately misleading
people or building up false expectations. The ethical businessman also
practises 'distributive justice'. The name could be misleading. For it does
not imply taking from the rich to give to the poor, or any other of the
socialist objectives. It means rewarding everyone according to the value of
his or her service to the business and is very close to the economist's
concept of the marginal value product.
Just Business explains many business issues usually shrouded in mysticism
and emotive language. For instance it made me feel at home with junk bonds
for the first time. These are simply fixed-interest securities with less
than investment-grade level rating. They are in themselves a borrowing
instrument, which are neither good nor bad, but have acquired a bad name
because of their use in certain criminal transactions.
The main problems with the book are with the philosophical foundations on
which human beings will always differ. Sternberg believes that ethics is an
objective discipline, as knowable as physics, and the same for everyone,
everywhere. She has no time for any degree of relativism or subjectivism.
She also appears to believe in essentialism, namely that all activities and
objects have essential natures revealed by careful definition. (This is not
a word she uses, but is one coined by critics of the approach.) She has
plenty of company here. For many politicians, businessmen and others believe
that the height of wisdom is to 'define your terms'. All of these should
take time off to read Chapter 11 of Sir Karl Popper's The Open Society and
its Enemies, in which this distinguished philosopher of science refutes the
idea that definition is a fundamental method of obtaining knowledge. A
quarrel about whether a definition is correct or not can only lead to an
empty controversy about words.
Do these theoretical reservations matter for the business practitioner?
Alas, they do. To take one example: Sternberg's objection to 'social
responsibility' is that it misunderstands the nature of business. But
suppose that law and practice are different? In Japan and parts of Europe
corporate directors may be in part responsible to other 'stakeholders'; and
there are non-profit making corporations in all countries. The author's
response is that such corporations are not true businesses. The question at
issue, however, is whether human needs are better served by maximising
equity value or by the stakeholder approach. This is a matter of political
economy, not definitions.
The view of ethics as a body of known and invariable principles can also
lead to trouble. An example is bribery. Sternberg is clear cut: it is wrong.
It is so more often than many defence contractors and governments believe.
But can one say on first principles that it is always wrong? The supposedly
planned Soviet economy could only function through side-payments to obtain
key supplies. These were second best to the more sweeping reform for which
we are still waiting; but were such payments really wrong when Russian
citizens were less badly fed and less badly clothed as a result?
The author's biggest mistake is to say that sound ethics is nearly always
good business. Honest dealing and respect for others will pay much more
often than macho-practitioners suppose. Ethical conduct need not always be
heroic. Nevertheless, some conflicts are unavoidable.
It may be true that practices such as that of the Russian business mafia
undermine the longer-term prospects for all business in that part of the
world. But so long as they prevail there will be conflicts between ethical
principles and the material well-being of an individual who would rather be
straight. This is no different from other walks of life where right conduct
may be personally costly.
Finally, what is one to make of the idea of corporate ethics audits and
external ethical auditors to which Sternberg gives her blessing? It is
misconceived. Ethical conduct is not something like management accounting or
computer systems, which experts can introduce. It involves personal choices
and decisions.
There is also the severely practical point that ethical consultants are
unlikely to confine themselves to Sternberg's limited objectives. They are
all too likely to develop into a form of thought police, promoting the fads
of the hour. Busy executives who do not have time to study political economy
or moral philosophy might instead take a short cut by studying as role
models, as they used to in the 19th century, other businessmen whose methods
and achievements they admire.
Doubtless companies would be more profitable, the gross national product
higher, and standards of behaviour better in a country where every manager
read Just Business and took it to heart. But the book will not provide a
painless tool kit for resolving moral dilemmas. Nothing will, whether in
business or anywhere else. Ethics concerns personal choice: and there can be
no experts in ethics in the way there can be experts in cost accountancy or
mathematical logic.

'THE WORLD IN 2020 - Power, Culture and Prosperity: a Vision for the Future'
By Hamish MacRae, Harper Collins, Pounds 20
With five years to go before the millennium, the futures industry is busy.
Books mixing wild predictions and crude extrapolations are appearing every
week. Within this slightly disreputable genre, Hamish MacRae's new book
stands out, bringing together a wealth of information, sound judgments and a
journalist's eye for the telling detail.
Most of the chapters offer a fairly familiar, but readable account of the
likely trends over the next 25 years. He shows, for example, how technology
creates not only new ways of doing things (such as derivatives markets) but
also problems such as the privacy issues raised by smart cards.
He explains why demographic shifts are likely to change political agendas in
rapidly ageing societies, such as Germany and Japan, towards tougher
policies on social order or inflation, and why global demographic pressures
are likely to create new lines of division. An example is access to water
supplies, where he anticipates battles over everything from dams on the
Danube to grandiose plans to divert the Yangtze.
But the book's central argument is about values and their role in promoting
economic success. Market economies, he argues, depend not only on production
but also on shared values: people's willingness to obey rules and behave
well. Such rules and values do not arise automatically, but are fostered
(and sometimes undermined). When they work well, policing can be light,
occasional and often internalised. When they work badly, penalties must be
harsh, and policing and regulation must be costly and pervasive.
In themselves these are not new arguments. Two hundred years ago many feared
that the values of an acquisitive, entrepreneurial capitalism would
undermine the moral foundations of good behaviour. More recently Daniel
Bell, the first theorist of post-industrial society, has argued that a
short-termist, hedonistic consumer culture is displacing the work ethic. But
it is the influence of east Asia that makes this type of argument more
pertinent in the 1990s. We may be shocked when Singapore canes a teenager,
but we deeply envy the rapid growth, the crime-free streets and empty
prisons which are its corollary.
Most in the west anticipate a steady accumulation of individual liberties.
But according to MacRae, associate editor of The Independent newspaper, the
pendulum may be swinging. Some governments are 'starting to become less
squeamish', with tougher measures on smoking, drinking and driving, and
abortion. The introduction of closed-circuit television in shopping centres
in the name of safety may be another telling sign. Behind this trend lies
greater public awareness of the trade-offs between liberties and social
goods, such as well-brought-up children or safe streets.
The argument becomes more ambiguous, however, when he links it to economic
success. A culture that is strongly committed to social order may be good
for 20th century industrial societies, but it may also mitigate against
creativity and individualism - the qualitative factors which MacRae sees as
increasingly essential to economic performance, particularly in service
industries.
This ambiguity makes it difficult to judge the prospects of different
regions. Despite the strengths of the US, including its prodigious
creativity, MacRae argues that if it is to retain world leadership it will
need to tackle not only low saving, social disruption and crime, but also
the bureaucracy and waste associated with having 760,000 lawyers
(three-quarters of the world's total), a vast political lobbying industry,
and overall regulatory costs estimated at Dollars 400bn each year. Each of
these is in part a symptom of lack of social cohesion. But whether the US
would really do better with a more conformist culture is impossible to
prove.
The same ambiguities arise in relation to education. Despite first-class
universities, most Americans perform worse than Europeans and far worse than
Japanese, Koreans, Chinese and Taiwanese. Interestingly the only factor
clearly correlating with performance (at least in maths and science) is the
number of hours spent in learning: the typical Chinese pupil spends 73 days
more in instruction each year than the typical American.
Although few would dispute the need to improve the lamentable performance of
most US (and British) pupils, MacRae suggests that the loose nature of UK
schooling may have something to do with British success in creative
industries such as advertising, financial services and television.
The converse applies to east Asia. Along with a strong work ethic,
industrial flexibility and high savings (38 per cent in Singapore compared
with 19 per cent in the UK), commitment to learning is one of its greatest
strengths. But if it remains predominantly learning by rote, it is hard to
see how east Asian societies will become world leaders, able to transcend
the weaknesses that result from a narrow product range, overdependence on
the north American market, and the underdevelopment of service industries.
In the past, wise minds have not been good at turning an understanding of
the present into accurate forecasts. Recent history is full of unexpected
events, such as the rise of personal computers and the fall of communism. In
the future, hard forecasts will be vulnerable to the unpredictable: new
diseases, a nuclear war or a severe earthquake in Tokyo.
This may explain the nagging doubt one has when reading this stimulating
book. In the era of chaos theory and non-linear systems, its tone of
Olympian optimism that most important trends can be predicted may be just a
bit too confident to convince.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Emphasis on Russian inflation
misplaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEFF SCHUBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As an economist and business analyst I spent a large proportion of 1992
and 1993 in Russia examining business opportunities. In April this year I
was asked by a major international bank to return to Russia and undertake a
detailed examination of a Russian regional bank.
The Russian bank was a well-run commercial entity, but there were two
significant problems in analysing its financial position and its general
business operations. The first was inflation which had rendered much of the
accounting information almost meaningless. The other was the bank's poor and
doubtful debt position, partly inherited from its days as part of a larger
state-owned bank, which was barely provisioned for.
Of these two problems, inflation was by far the easiest to account for. In
considering the future of this bank and its suitability for foreign equity
investment, I was more concerned about the ability of the bank's clients to
keep producing and selling goods and thus service the debt.
The clients' position echoed my experience in 1993 when I investigated the
possibility of investing in a Russian wool mill, supplying it with wool and
selling the resultant fabric in Russia. Inflation made estimation of
production costs and selling prices difficult. However, it was not inflation
that ultimately prevented the project from going ahead, but the potential
foreign investors' fears that the weakening economy would mean insufficient
demand for the fabric.
In my experience, the preoccupation of such institutions as the IMF and of
many Russian officials with reducing inflation is misplaced. The inability
of Russian enterprises to pay their debts and keep producing is the greatest
risk to the economy, the reform process and foreign investment.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: The value of valid tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HERBERT M. GREENBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with great interest your Recruitment article, 'Laying down the
laws of selection' (May 4). There are three kinds of psychological tests
that should not be used by industry for selecting new personnel or
evaluating existing employees. These are tests that have been constructed to
appear psychological, but have no validity; computer-produced tests that
have no relevance to job functions; and tests developed for clinical use.
None of these has real value in predicting job performance.
There are, on the other hand, good psychological tests that have proven
ability in predicting performance. Such tests will have a sound theoretical
basis, have developed a valid database over the long term, and will have
been periodically adjusted to account for changing business cultures. Also,
they will be evaluated by professional occupational psychologists matching
the test results to the functional requirements of the specific job.
It is management's responsibility to invest extra effort to select only the
valid tests. Not using scientifically proven and valid psychological tests
to help make those all-important hiring, promotion or job-shift decisions is
like refusing to use a word processor in favour of the traditional quill
pen.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fall in prep boarders due to parental
preference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES GREGSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While John Authers is correct that cost is a major factor in the
decline in numbers of boarders at independent schools, reported by ISIS last
month ('Sums don't add up', May 13), another equally important factor is the
increasing reluctance of parents to send their children (particularly in the
seven-to-13 age group) to boarding schools. This accounts for the small rise
in day pupils and the large drop in boarder numbers revealed by the ISIS
report.
Furthermore, there is a shortage, certainly in London, of independent day
schools with good facilities. The small increase in day pupils may therefore
be a function of supply rather than lack of demand. A drop in fees by
boarding preparatory schools and a substantial improvement in the economy
will then not halt the decline in the number of children attending boarding
preparatory schools.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rethink needed on investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS OUTRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Hanson's decision to increase its investment pay-back period highlights
the need for a much more sophisticated approach to investment by many UK
companies.
UK companies typically demand excessively high internal investment returns -
often twice the real cost of capital. We have found that those with the
lowest discount rates and good financial control of their business have seen
the greatest growth in profitability and shareholder value. Conversely,
those with the highest rates frequently face competitive problems in large
parts of their portfolios as profitable growth opportunities are
under-exploited and rivals are allowed to attack positions of strength.
For many American companies, investment appraisal techniques and hurdle
rates are a fundamental, explicitly-stated part of their communicated
strategy. This contrasts with the reluctance of UK companies to talk about
investment strategy in other than the most general and generic terms. Costs
of capital, discount rates and investment criteria need to be reviewed
regularly by the chief executive, the CFO and the board, with key underlying
assumptions clearly set out and debated, not delegated to 'technicians'
within the finance function.
Hanson's announcement recognises this, but may also signal a more general
shift by companies from an acquisition and short-term cashflow-focused
environment to one that needs to be more reliant on investment-driven
organic growth. The challenge will be to convince the investment community
that such companies possess the management style and skills required to
succeed in this new world.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Objective about BS5750
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From TF DOUGHERTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been intrigued by the recent interest in BS5750 in your pages, and I
would like to offer the following advice.
Those considering BS5750 should be aware of any benefit likely to accrue to
their customers.
If the customer is not going to perceive any noticeable difference, then
don't bother - there will undoubtedly be other more deserving challenges.
If you believe the customer is going to benefit, you must decide 'by how
much' and fix a means of measurement, to determine what you intend to
achieve and so you will know when you have got there. At this point, you can
identify a positive impact upon the bottom line - all well and good - and
you certainly should think about the cost of developing, implementing and
maintaining the system.
All too often BS5750 fails or disappoints because 'the business' doesn't
approach the task objectively.
Remember, BS5750 is not a quality system: you can have one of those without
the standard.
If you are employing a consultancy 'worth its salt', it will ensure that you
understand the standard before taking a fee. It can then help you to decide
whether or not it is worth going for.

If we worked out how much money we paid in to building societies for our
mortgages most of us would presumably abandon the system and go for rented
accommodation, or try to raise the money some other way. Taking Liberties
looks into a new wave of re-possessions and tells how building societies are
refusing to honour promises of a multi-million pound mortgage rescue scheme
(8.00 BBC2). Can it really be a good idea for BBC2 to be showing The Lost
Steptoes? It is not the poor technical quality that prompts the question but
the high quality of the writing. It makes today's comedies look so
hopelessly inferior. This week a pregnant woman arrives at the rag and bone
yard claiming that Harold is the father of her child (8.30). True Stories
comes up with yet another of those documentaries in which the programme
makers fail to get an interview with their subject and then try to turn the
absence into a virtue. Today's absentee is Margaret Thatcher who was
followed on her US book promotion tour but avoided and ignored the cameras
at every turn (9.30 C4).

FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: Francoise Pollet - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A first-class French soprano is like a rare wine. There are historically
very few of them and after a period with none at all, a thirst grows for a
voice that has the characteristic French quality and flavour.
For some years the lack of top French female singers reached drought
proportions, which has made the arrival of Francoise Pollet all the more
welcome. Her operatic career began in Germany in the early 1980s. From the
range of repertoire that she now has under her belt (Strauss's Marschallin,
Wagner's Sieglinde and Berlioz's Dido) it is clear that she is as near as
any French singer has come to being a successor to the much-loved Regine
Crespin.
Her soprano has amplitude, but is still feminine, not a
helmet-and-spear-carrying warrior Valkyrie of a voice. To judge from her
recital at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday she has less sheer power on board
than Crespin did at her last London appearances there, but Pollet naturally
has youth and flexibility on her side. In Debussy's Baudelaire songs she had
no trouble settling into that sensuous, hedonistic world, where 'sounds and
perfumes turn in the evening air'.
The heavily-scented warmth of her voice is ideally suited to this music,
while Roger Vignoles managed to combine clarity and deep sensuality in the
accompaniments. In her second Debussy group and some of the Wolf it was the
pianist, rather than the singer, who was looking for variety. Once Pollet
has relaxed, sinking into velvety, warmly rounded singing, she is reluctant
to stir herself; throughout a good part of this recital the dynamic range
was unvaried, the words did not tell.
A pair of big songs in the second half will have roused anybody who was
pleasantly slumbering: Wolf's 'Kennst du das Land' and Brahms's 'Von ewiger
Liebe' were conceived on a large scale and Pollet was generous with them,
unstinting in her outpouring of voice. But it was the final group of Duparc
songs that showed the singer back with the repertoire that she could make
her own. In the words of Baudelaire, what Pollet affords are three classic
French qualities: 'luxe, calme, et volupte'.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: The Bed before Yesterday - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1975, old Ben Travers - author of the between-the-wars Aldwych farces A
Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook and Thark - suddenly had a new West End
success with The Bed before Yesterday. Since he was then in his 90th year,
there was a 'Wonderful for his age]' factor in that, as well as the
unworldly quaintness of making an old-fashioned, paper-thin comedy serve as
a starry-eyed tract for sexual liberation (especially among divorced or
widowed persons of a certain age). The Almeida Theatre has chosen to revive
it now, probably rashly.
At the start of The Bed before Yesterday widow Alma Millett - almost
upper-middle, well-to-do, inexplicably lonely for a male companion - has
Victor Keene to tea. She is a prickly, contentious creature but eminently
sensible and good at heart, he a 60-year-old gentleman impoverished by his
ex-wife's gambling. Alma has engineered the meeting; after some fussing, she
soon puts the obvious proposition to him, and with only modest resistance he
soon accepts it.
Brenda Blethyn and Charles Kay play this charmingly, in period West End
style (it is Coronation Year) without the old, tiresome brittleness. But the
real theme has barely been hinted at: obliquely suggested, the question
'Bed?' gets a 'Don't mind if I do, but don't really mind' response from him,
a thumbs-down from her. Having had a Bad Experience on her first
wedding-night, she has taken care never to repeat it. They settle down
happily enough in chaste fashion; but in what seems no time at all, Alma has
encounters that stir her strangely.
First with Ella, the sex-happy, guilt-free girlfriend (Jacqueline Deferrary)
of Victor's feckless son Aubrey (hopelessly underwritten, but nicely
realised by Paul Reynolds as the 'What, me worry?' boy from MAD magazine);
then with a declassee cousin (a ripe, delicate cartoon by Lill Roughley) who
enjoys a vigorous erotic life with her transient lodgers in Ealing. The
light dawns. Alma entices Victor into a sensual afternoon - instantly,
improbably successful - which sets her afire, on the favourite model of male
wish-fulfilment.
In what seems no time at all, she is foraging boldly abroad, because old
Victor tires fast. He is mock-grumpily complaisant, whilst himself carrying
on with the liberated cousin. Ella slips into honest prostitution, and
Aubrey profits. Everybody is happy. That is the message: achieving good sex
is like getting your natural plumbing into full working order, without
hypocrisy nor serious implications for anything else in your real life.
Here we believe none of that, because the twists that nudge the action along
are so inconsequent. Alma is no less scatty than she is anxiously
self-possessed, Victor a tame, settled MCC type; yet their actions -
whenever they find themselves having to act - are those of enlightened,
arch-liberal souls. We do not know why, and if we are meant to admire them
we cannot at the same time find them eccentrically funny. The net result is
to hang a naive, irony-free plea for sexual freedom upon a desperately thin,
jerry-built farce: DH Lawrence meets What the Actress Said to the Bishop.
Peter Wood directs with faithful tact, and Johan Engels supplies what must
be the most reactionary set ever seen in the Almeida (a beautiful design,
neatly elegant and economical). Something more would be needed to rescue
this piece, for all its quaint appeal. I doubt that anything now could be
sufficient.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: Apres Gatt, the east moves in - Cannes Film Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerard Depardieu is in the nude. Terence Stamp is in drag. And Catherine
Deneuve is in a million-franc dress on the Palais steps. Who says that
Europe cannot put on a show without Hollywood's help?
This is the first Cannes Film Festival since the notorious Gatt round when
the French told Hollywood that they did not want its celluloid. Would the
Americans, having lost that important game in world movie diplomacy, refuse
to turn up for the 'friendly' on the Cote d'Azur?
At first, entente-watchers were hopeful. Clint Eastwood signed on as jury
president. US films would open and close the festival: the Coen brothers'
The Hudsucker Proxy and John Waters' Serial Mom respectively. And the
popular if costly American Pavilion - risk debt for a Coca-Cola, file for
Chapter Eleven if you have a hamburger and fries - would be back in place on
the sunny Croisette.
Then the bad news dribbled in. All but two major studios were staying away.
The only megastar who might come was Bruce Willis for something called Pulp
Fiction. And the only other American film in competition would be Alan
Rudolph's Mrs Parker And The Vicious Circle. With Hudsucker this last has
formed a pair of ornately empty folies de style for the first days, with
Jennifer Jason Leigh twice bidding to be the most tiresome actress in
Cannes.
In the Coens' film she does a feature-length Katharine Hepburn imitation,
while Tim Robbins and Paul Newman search for their chalk-marks in the vast
Deco-style sets. From the makers of Barton Fink  - which cleaned up major
awards at Cannes two years ago - here is another gaudy, eccentric period
piece. But this one has no inner life. The get-rich fairy tale, a pastiche
of the New Deal cinema of Capra and Sturges, has whizz-kid Robbins wooing
tycoon Newman by inventing the hoola-hoop. (All resemblances to real history
. . .) But Fate has some nasty tricks in store, for both movie and audience:
not least Miss Leigh's arrival to disrupt potential hoop-la with her grating
party-piece.
In Mrs Parker Leigh is Mrs Parker, alias Dorothy, and she has studied the
recordings. The voice is an acidic back-of-the-nose drawl and soon becomes,
like the film, deeply wearing. The famed wits of the Algonquin Round Table
come on like a pack of smart alecks dressed by Cecil Beaton. And the script
is in a well-known bio-pic mould, that of the 'Dorothy, have you met
Alexander (Woollcott) and Charles (McArthur) and Heywood (Broun)?' variety.
Only Campbell Scott as Robert (Benchley) beats the odds, offering a quietly
brilliant facsimile complete with funny monologues.
So. Is sulking Hollywood deliberately sending its underlings to the party?
If so, what better chance for Europe to answer back with quality? But there
lies the rub. Apres Gatt, is there a European cinema worth protecting, let
alone showcasing? Or have it and Cannes become a series of rituals in search
of a meaning?
The annual Gerard Depardieu event has been Giuseppe Tornatore's gaunt and
gimmicky A Simple Formality, a Borgesian fable of the after-life with the
usual scenes of Gerard in the nude. The annual French costume epic is
Patrice Chereau's lumbering La Reine Margot. And the annual European star
emigrates in despair event is Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, an Australian
drag comedy with our own Terence Stamp drowning his sorrows in mascara.
The good news at Cannes so far comes from neither Europe nor the US. It
comes from Canada with Exotica and Taiwan with Eat Drink Man Woman.
The first is a wonderful puzzle-picture from Atom Egoyan, the young mage of
Family Viewing and Calendar. A plot initially as baffling as a Rubik cube -
what can link the destinies of a widowed accountant, a strip-club owner and
an immigrant gay petshop assistant? - is snapped piece by piece into shape
and lucidity.
Egoyan's camera has the slyest grace in modern cinema, but its arabesques
are never vapid. They follow the curves of a plot about identity, passion,
and voyeurism. And they give the metaphorical settings - nightclub like a
jungle, petshop like an aquarium of the mind - their own life and
sensuality.
Ang Lee made the popular A Wedding Banquet, that AC/DC comedy of sexual
errors. Now he follows it with another masterpiece of misadventure. Eat
Drink Man Woman has a plot as simple as its title. A retired master chef;
his three daughters; and the attempts of all four to find life and love
outside the family circle.
The running gag is the 'Sunday dinner torture ritual,' as one girl dubs
Dad's weekly delirium of kitchenwork which ends in a table groaning with
carp, squid, ducks, noodles and enough Won Ton Soup to nourish all of
Taipei. Can one madman's wooden spoon keep a family together? It could have
a soap opera - or in this case soup opera - but it is much better. The three
sisters are picked out with a compassionate humour worthy (almost) of
Chekhov and the father is an indelible portrait of vocation ageing into
monomania.
But then the east has virtually taken over film festivals in this decade.
Already those who have seen it in advance are tipping Zhang Yimou's Live]
for Golden Palm. And Mr Zhang can also lay claim to the most startling and
resonant sight on the Cannes seafront. Towering over the Croisette is the
poster for the film he is now shooting - Shanghai Triad - which features a
ten-foot-long opium pipe blowing real smoke.
Is this image telling us festival goers to go on dreaming our beautiful
dreams? Or is it telling America that the new world order is 'east is best'
and that Hollywood may soon have to insert that in its pipe ane smoke it?

THE DARK HALF (18) George A. Romero
A HOME OF OUR OWN (PG) Tony Bill
NAKED GUN 33 1/3: THE FINAL INSULT (12) Peter Segal
THE DRAUGHTSMAN'S CONTRACT (15) Peter Greenaway
Could it be that Stephen King, arguably the most commercially successful
author of our time, wants us to feel sorry for him? His last two filmed
novels, Misery and now The Dark Half, have been about serious writers who
want to give up producing the potboilers that have made them rich. Can it be
that there is a kinder, gentler Stephen King trying to get out from beneath
all the horror and gore and money?
In The Dark Half, the writer with the bruised integrity is Thad Beaumont
(Timothy Hutton), a talented young novelist who resorts to writing nasty
crime fiction under a pseudonym when his sensitive 'real' work will not
sell. He becomes a million seller, only to have his ruse discovered by a
blackmailer who threatens to reveal that the supposedly serious Beaumont has
been writing trash. Instead of giving in, Beaumont announces his sins to the
nation and publicly kills off his alter ego, George Stark, in the name of
art.
But things soon turn nasty. Stark, none too keen about his enforced
retirement, comes to life and begins viciously murdering everyone associated
with Beaumont's decision to come clean. The troubled young author, who
becomes the only logical suspect in the crime wave, knows he must seek out
and do battle with his own darker half.
George A. Romero's film shows promise in its more graphic sequences,
particularly a gruesome flashback where the boy Beaumont is discovered to
have a mutant foetus growing in his skull. Fans of gory effects will also
lap up the exceedingly violent ending, in which a flock of killer sparrows
literally tear a man apart. And the film is not without its grim humour -
when Stark assails a literary agent with a straight razor, he explains that
publishing is, after all, a cut-throat business. But the film's plot is
largely ludicrous, relying too much on the actions of a monumentally dumb
cop and the absurd notion of an American writer who would be ashamed of
having sold a million copies of anything.
But what is most irksome about the film is that, once again, King seems to
be both having and eating his creative cake. After all, if he really feels
so compromised by writing bestsellers, is there not a better way of
expressing this than churning out yet another big-budget potboiler on the
subject?
Speaking of Misery, that film's star, Kathy Bates, can currently be seen in
A Home of Our Own, a movie which more than anything else serves to
illustrate the pitfalls inherent in winning an Academy Award. After pulling
in an Oscar for her truly scary portrayal of Misery's sadistic nurse, Bates
seems to have succumbed to a desire to achieve Screen Respectability. It is
hard to see what else would have drawn her to this cloying, lightweight
piece of American nostalgia.
The year is 1962, and Bates is a plucky widow trying to raise six kids on
minimum wages. After losing her job in Los Angeles, she sets out with her
brood in search of a place where they can have a house and a life of their
own. They wind up in a remote corner of Idaho, where Bates convinces a
Japanese-American widower (Soon-Teck Oh) to sell her a ramshackle cottage.
The family's travails, courage and ultimate triumph as they try to turn this
house into a home form the backbone of Patrick Duncan's slight and
predictable story.
The film's central problem is that it refuses to allow for the sort of
nuance and conflict that can occur in such stressful familial circumstances.
Everybody is so busy being loving and supportive that they forget to be
human. The occasional difficulties - a scrap between Bates and her eldest
son, an attempted rape - are all quickly swept away by copious waves of
sentimentality. The direction of the usually inspired Tony Bill fails to
generate any dramatic tension, even when fire threatens the homestead. Most
astonishingly, Bates turns in a downright poor performance, straining so
hard to be courageous that she forgets to act.
Rest assured that no one will try to tug at your heart strings in Naked Gun
33 1/3: The Final Insult. Its makers simply want you to laugh, and will do
just about anything they can think of to achieve that goal. This time out
they prove slightly less successful than in the first two Naked Gun efforts,
though the film is still as funny as anything else now showing on the
nation's big screens. The best thing about the series remains Leslie
Nielsen, who has honed his deadpan style to something approaching
perfection. Keep an eye out for the parody of the steps sequence from The
Untouchables and the send-up of the Oscars, where we are treated to the
unalloyed pleasure of watching Pia Zadora fall into the orchestra pit.
Finally, this week sees the re-release of Peter Greenaway's The
Draughtsman's Contract, perhaps as part of a salvage operation after last
year's repellent, unwatchable The Baby of Macon. It is now becoming
increasingly apparent that Greenaway's 1982 feature, which concerns
seduction and murder on a 17th century Wiltshire estate, represents the high
point of his controversial career. Here, at least, one can find a
comprehensible story underpinning the panache and pomposity. It makes you
realise how differently this undoubtedly gifted craftsman's career might
have turned out if he had chosen to film coherent narratives instead of his
own wearisome obsessions.

After a lukewarm reception for Windows NT, which Microsoft hoped would
expand its dominance of desktop computing to the broader field of network
computers, the company will soon release a new version - codenamed Daytona.
This will be a significant improvement on the original version of NT,
introduced last year, which has achieved only modest success in the
client/server market. Demand has been 'much slower than we or anybody
expected,' says Robert Palmer, chief executive of Digital Equipment, one of
NT's strongest supporters in the computer industry.
Daytona will address customer criticisms of the original Windows NT, says
Greg Lobdell, Microsoft's product manager for advanced systems. In
particular, it will reduce the amount of computer memory required. The new
version will also improve the performance of both the desktop and server
versions.
Daytona will enable Microsoft to target the workstation software market,
going head-to-head with Unix, the 'open systems' operating system now owned
by Novell, and the various implementations of Unix developed by Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and others.
Lobdell acknowledges that with its first version of Windows NT, Microsoft
failed to position the product clearly: 'Windows NT was the answer, but no
one knew what the question was.' But with the launch of Daytona, Microsoft
will be able to define more clearly the product's role, he says.
The new version has been heavily influenced by feedback from customers. They
criticised the size and performance of the original desktop version of NT
and its poor connectivity to other computers. The performance of standard
Windows applications, and in particular the new Microsoft Office
applications, was deemed too slow.
As well as addressing these problems, Microsoft promises several
improvements in the performance of Windows NT on network 'servers'.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Technology: High hopes / A look at South Korea in a series
on collaborative research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A glittering array of jumbo-sized display screens and three-dimensional
films greeted visitors to the international science and technology
exposition in Taejon, South Korea, last autumn.
The 14m South Koreans - a third of the population - who visited the Taejon
Expo, were presented with a grand vision of a high-tech future on a site
next to the Taedok science town, the main research and development centre,
which houses 37 government and corporate research institutes.
The Taejon Expo was based on a similar fair held by Japan at its Tsukuba
science town in 1985. But while the Tsukuba Expo celebrated Japan's
membership of the advanced industrial world, Taejon only expressed Korea's
intention to do so. Most of the promising technology on display in Taejon
was borrowed from abroad. The Expo illustrated the considerable challenges
South Korea still faces in creating a thriving technological base and the
failure of its government so far to achieve smooth research co-operation
with industry.
The government has promised to rectify these shortcomings with its long-term
Highly Advanced National (Han) programme. The Won37,000bn (Dollars 46bn) Han
programme - Han is also the Korean word for Korea - launched in April 1992,
aims to promote increased R&amp;D activities in 14 industrial sectors until
2001. Projects range from the development of a 256-megabit semiconductor
chip and high-definition television to electric cars and advanced
telecommunications networks.
Officials believe that the blueprint will solve several problems that have
hampered the country's R&amp;D efforts.
One has been a shortage of funding. Government and private industry spent a
total of Won5,000bn on R&amp;D in 1992, the last year for which full figures are
available. This ranks at the top of developing countries in the amount and
percentage of GNP spent on R&amp;D. But it is only slightly bigger than the
annual R&amp;D budget for General Motors or IBM. The government wants to raise
R&amp;D spending to 5 per cent of GNP by the end of the decade from the present
2 per cent.
Although the government has shifted more of the R&amp;D burden to industry,
which now accounts for 82 per cent of the national R&amp;D budget, companies
have generally preferred to fund expansion rather than research. The Han
project is meant to force companies to spend more on R&amp;D by requiring them
to finance 80 per cent of the programme. The government also hopes to
co-ordinate corporate research on individual projects through Han and avoid
unnecessary duplication. Intense competition among government ministries,
companies and universities on research programmes has been blamed for
wasting the scarce capital resources devoted to R&amp;D.
But critics say Han will increase bureaucratic rivalry. The Ministry of
Industry, Trade and Energy, for example, is promoting its own research
programme with industry, which is meant to develop 24 core technologies,
including some areas that overlap with the Han project.
Many leading companies are increasingly resisting government dictates on
R&amp;D, which they regard as an example of the country's outmoded 'command
capitalism' economic structure under which the state plays a dominant role
in guiding industrial policy.
Instead of the government trying to pick winners and losers in advanced
industries, executives argue that companies should decide their own research
priorities.
The industry ministry, for example, wants several aerospace companies to
collaborate on the development of a medium-sized passenger aircraft. But
industry remains sceptical.
'The whole programme can be criticised as far as I'm concerned,' says Ted
Kim, executive adviser to Korean Air's aerospace division. 'Realistically,
it will be very difficult to sell this aircraft when there are already so
many other passenger aircraft in the 80-100 seat range. By the time we
develop it in seven to 10 years, the advanced airline companies will be
making more sophisticated aircraft that will be hard to compete against.'
The government's R&amp;D goals are seen as too ambitious. Critics say it is
spreading resources too thinly by trying to finance research in as many
advanced technology projects as possible.
Moreover, many companies are reluctant to co-operate with rivals on some of
the leading research projects, as demanded by the government. Samsung
Electronics, the nation's largest semiconductor maker, for example, is
resisting collaboration with Goldstar and Hyundai on the development of a
256-megabit chip.
'We believe we are far ahead of Goldstar and Hyundai on semiconductor
technology and we see no reason why we should share our knowledge with
them,' says one official with Samsung Electronics, the country's top
corporate investor in R&amp;D with a total of Won414bn in 1992.
Companies believe the government should give more state funding to risky and
long-term basic research, while allowing industry to pursue applied or
pre-competitive research with less government interference.
Scientists at the government research institutes in Taedok say they are
forced to conduct research projects with strong commercial applications at
the expense of basic research. 'The government is constantly on our backs to
produce a product, but biotechnology is not suitable to produce quick
results,' says one senior official at the state-run Genetic Engineering
Research Institute.
Bioengineering has become the latest goal for the government, which this
year launched a Won1,600bn 14-year project, Biotech 2000, to make Korea a
leader in the field. Officials hope the programme, which will receive
two-thirds of its funding from industry, will enable Korea to capture a
significant share of the global market for bioengineering products.
Frustration is creating a 'brain drain' as scientists abandon the institutes
for better paid jobs with industry. But the government says the emphasis on
applied research is necessary for South Korea to narrow the technology gap
with the advanced industrial world. The commercial orientation of Taedok is
also needed to persuade industry to continue financing the state-run
institutes, officials explain.
They point to Taedok's commercial successes, such as the TDX automatic
telephone exchange developed by the Electronics and Telecommunications
Research Institute and shared among leading equipment manufacturers.
But even at this institute there is criticism: 'Our great weakness is the
theoretical. Industry should take care of developing technology and we
should concentrate on basic research,' says a chief researcher.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Technology: Microsoft's next big update - How the software
maker has responded to customer comments and complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, is set to unveil
plans for the next generation of its hugely popular Windows personal
computer software in Atlanta, Georgia, next week.
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, plans to demonstrate Windows 4.0 -
codenamed Chicago - to the public for the first time and detail plans for
its release.
Chicago is a big advance on the best-selling computer operating system
combination ever - Microsoft's MS-Dos and Windows software. Gates predicts
huge sales for Chicago next year. He hopes a 'significant proportion' of the
60m users of Windows will upgrade to the new software. In addition, most PC
manufacturers are expected to install the new version of Windows on PCs
shipped after the official launch. The date for that is yet to be fixed. But
the company expects the product to be available this year.
'Chicago will be the most popular systems (software) update we have ever put
out,' says Gates, who comments that he will be disappointed if Chicago does
not generate at least Dollars 500m in sales during its first year on the
market.
The Chicago upgrade package for existing Windows users is expected to sell
for between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100.
Microsoft suggests several reasons for PC users to buy the upgrade:
With the introduction of Chicago, Microsoft will merge its two top selling
products, MS-Dos and Windows, into a single PC operating system, providing a
better way to harness the power of the latest, high-speed PC
microprocessors.
Chicago, it claims, will also make PCs much easier to use than either Apple
Computer's Macintosh or PCs running existing versions of Windows.
The new program will make it easier to hook PCs up to a network.
Extensive testing of Chicago indicated to Microsoft that Windows users were
often befuddled by crowded, confusing screens and inconsistent commands. So
Chicago will look quite different from the existing Windows product. For
example, Microsoft found that the Windows Program Manager, File Manager,
Windows Setup and Control Panel systems were often confusing to users who
did not know where to start when they needed to make changes to the system,
by adding hardware or software. These elements have been made simpler and
more consistent in Chicago, so that adding a new printer or changing the
resolution on screen is much easier.
Microsoft has also made major improvements to the basic applications
incorporated in Windows, including word-processing, communications and
personal information management programs.
Yet despite these new elements, Microsoft faces some significant challenges
if Chicago is to live up to expectations. To start with, the new look means
many users may need retraining to take full advantage of its capabilities.
Some PCs used by companies or individuals do not have enough memory or
processing power to run Chicago. So corporate PC buyers face the choice of
upgrading all their PCs or supporting two generations of PC operating
systems.
Yet for new PC users and users of recently purchased PCs, Chicago represents
a breakthrough in performance and ease of use. With this new version of
Windows, Microsoft appears set to maintain its tight grip on the market.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Tequila refines its
image - Mexico's distillers are divided over whether to take their drink
upmarket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle is raging in Mexico over how to make and market tequila, the potent
cactus-based spirit which Mexicans take neat and often, and with which
Americans make margaritas and other cocktails.
The quarrel is between those who want to produce a high-cost tequila and
market it as a luxury drink akin to cognac or malt whisky, and those who
want to sell it cheaply in bulk around the world. At stake is not just the
future of Mexico's national drink, but an increasingly lucrative export
market.
Tequila was first fermented from the sugar of the blue agave plant that
grows in the valley of Tequila, near the city of Guadalajara, and until
recently was consumed almost entirely in Mexico. But in the last decade
exports have grown healthily, rising from 28.5m litres in 1983 to 47.3m
litres in 1993. Now more than two-thirds of production is exported.
The sudden popularity has led to growing international interest in the
industry. In 1991, International Distillers &amp; Vintners, part of Grand
Metropolitan, took a 45 per cent interest in Grupo Cuervo, the industry
leader. In March Allied-Lyons took control of Sauza Tequila, the second
largest tequila company, when it bought Domecq of Spain. United Distillers,
part of Guinness, has marketing rights with Herradura, a niche producer.
The quarrel in the industry centres on whether sugar cane or equivalents can
be substituted for agave in the fermentation of tequila. Agave takes about
10 years to ripen and must be picked by hand, making it an increasingly
expensive raw material. Bulk producers generally sell tequila fermented from
a mixture of sugar cane (or an equivalent) and agave. Government regulations
currently allow producers to use 51 per cent agave and 49 per cent sugar
cane.
Some of the lesser-known low-cost producers do not meet even this
requirement, according to the Tequila chamber of commerce. These bandit
producers sell their tequila to intermediaries, usually in the United
States, who bottle and brand the drink.
Guillermo Romo, the combative head of Herradura, is leading the fight
against cheap tequila. His tequila is made exclusively from agave, uses
natural rather than artificial yeast, and does not use chemicals that speed
up fermentation. Its premium image has made it one of the fastest-growing
tequilas in Mexico, although it exports little.
Romo wants laws - or enforcement of existing ones - that would require
tequila to be made with 100 per cent agave, and that would prohibit tequila
being sold on to intermediaries who bottle and brand the product. In the
long run, he says, branding and bottling on site is the only way Mexico can
make money out of tequila, and guarantee quality standards.
'Nature's most precious gift to Mexico is the agave,' he says. 'Our
inferiority to the Europeans made us believe we could not produce a superior
product, which is not true.'
Romo successfully blocked all tequila exports in February, after he claimed
that existing law, when interpreted correctly, prohibits unbranded tequila
exports. Since then, exports have been permitted, while Romo's case works
its way through Mexico's courts.
Romo took control of the Tequila chamber of commerce this year, which is
broadly backing his case. Mr Luis Margain, the head of the chamber and legal
director at Herradura, says low-quality unbranded tequila 'will threaten the
rule of national origin of tequila (which makes production exclusive to the
region of Tequila) as it becomes a cheap, commodity product'. He says the
fact that Spain and the Philippines are now making tequila show the dangers.
The industry heavyweights, Jose Cuervo and Sauza, which together account for
the majority of production, say that any abrupt change to the current
regulations would be extremely costly. They argue there is not enough agave
to meet current tequila demand, and prices would rocket if the regulations
were changed.
Furthermore, Sauza and Jose Cuervo believe cheaper tequilas do not damage
the drink's image. Both have several tequila brands and distinguish between
100 per cent and mixed agave products, and between tequilas of different
ages. 'What we have to have is two tequilas living side by side. One for
mixers like margarita and one for high-quality neat products,' says Jorge
Berrueta of Sauza.
There are also powerful interests in favour of non-branded exports. Jorge
Camacho, former head of the Tequila chamber and a Jose Cuervo employer, says
outlawing unbranded exports unilaterally would be unfair to American
companies that have invested heavily in marketing their own brands.
But Romo's fierce attack on the adulteraters of tequila is shaking up the
industry. The large producers appear to favour an eventual prohibition of
non-branded exports, and have set up a regulatory council to verify whether
tequila meets the 51 per cent agave requirement and whether tequila
described as a certain age is indeed that age.
Camacho, who heads the regulatory council, believes that as much as 30 per
cent of commercial tequila does not meet the 51 per cent agave requirement.
He admits that 'if the industry does not respect the norms, then we could
lose our claim as a distinctive product and all of us would suffer'.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Whisky's youthful
look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search is on for a lost generation of UK whisky drinkers. Over the next
few months, United Distillers and Hiram Walker will re-launch their two
best-selling brands to attract younger customers.
The move has been prompted by the rise of white spirits, such as vodka and
tequila, and the growing market share of foreign beers and wine. But there
is also a fear that whisky's reputation as a drink for older professional
men - an image promoted by the producers themselves - is alienating a whole
generation of younger customers.
'Most young people relate to whisky drinking in terms of their fathers,'
says Pat Doble, core brands development director at Distillers, which
manufactures the market leader, Bell's. 'Our challenge is to make them look
at whisky in a different way and to see it as an energiser, not a winding
down drink.'
Distillers plans to spend Pounds 30m over the next two years re-launching
Bell's. The twin themes of the campaign will be to promote whisky as a mixer
drink and to lower its customer age profile.
But in order not to alienate its core older customer base, Bell's is also to
be marketed as a more mature Scotch, with a guarantee that the blend is made
of whiskies which are at least eight years old.
Hiram Walker is to relaunch Teachers, the third biggest selling brand, to
attract younger drinkers. 'There will be no pictures of wildlife, claymores
or countryside. We have to recapture the aspirations of our customers,' says
David Jarvis, managing director of Allied Lyons, owner of Hiram Walker.
Underpinning the campaigns is the decline in sales in the UK, the product's
biggest market. UK off-trade sales dropped from 68m litres in 1983 to 60m
last year, according to Stats MR, the market research group. In the same
period, vodka sales jumped from 13.45m litres to 20.05m.
Distillers has been encouraged by its campaign to revamp Dewar's - the
biggest-selling Scotch in the US - which halted its sales slide.
The company also points to the remarkable rise of Venezuela, Thailand and
Greece as leading whisky markets which now contribute 20 per cent of
Distillers' profits.
'Whisky is seen as the young person's drink in these markets,' said Doble.
'If we can do it there, we can do it here.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): United in diversity
 -Europe should exploit its variety, argues Hugh Aldersey-Williams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will today make public plans to design a logo to
attract Far East and American tourists and businesses. The idea will bring a
shudder to many nationals of European countries. How can a region of such
cultural diversity possibly be abbreviated into one symbol?
The same dilemma confronts many European businesses. They are having to join
forces with other European businesses in order to compete against companies
from the more homogeneous trading blocs of Japan and North America. In doing
so, they must surmount their own cultural differences to present a united
front to the wider world.
Fons Trompenaars, director of the Centre for International Business Studies
in the Netherlands, points out in his recent book, Riding the Waves of
Culture (Nicholas Brealey Publishing), that national culture is treated as a
luxury or an inconvenience by many managers, especially perhaps by the
insular British.
'The main dilemma which those who manage across cultures confront is the
extent to which they should centralise, thereby imposing on foreign cultures
rules and procedures that might affront them, or decentralise, thereby
letting each culture go its own way . . . ' he says.
Corporate identity consultant Wally Olins - in the first in a series of
lectures on global companies to be published later this month by IMPR of
Henley on Thames - says: 'There is no European corporate tradition
comparable with the clear and comprehensible corporate traditions of the US
and Japan.' Attempts to carry on regardless of that tradition founder.
Alcazar and Volvo-Renault are recent reminders.
Olins sets out five models for how European companies might proceed, based
on what Europe does best and on how it is seen from the outside. Some models
expect to bring about such a fusion of corporate cultures that national
cultures become insignificant. Others will continue, like Airbus Industrie,
to overcome them with governments' help. But many will choose to remain
mono-cultural and will be so perceived within their own countries. Olins
writes: 'That, I suspect, is where most big European companies will stay
until the constraints become unbearable or their ambition grows
irresistibly.'
One difficulty is that people are at a loss to say what is the character of
Europe as a whole. One of the reasons why people perceive a threat to
national identity with each step towards closer European union is that no
other identity appears to be on offer.
However, could a Europe logo help us define ourselves? Olins believes this
is too simplistic. To a large extent, Europe's identity lies in its
diversity. With considerable effort, this attractive if hard-to-define
quality could be exploited for competitive advantage.
Many travellers no longer seek American-style homogeneity and European hotel
groups could trade more effectively on the fact that the hotels they own -
acquired over long periods and often with strong family or local histories -
are highly varied.
Likewise, Volkswagen - the maker of Seats in Spain, Skodas in the Czech
Republic, and Audis and VWs in Germany - could, if it so chose, position
itself as the maker of a mixed portfolio of European products rather than as
the German controlling interest in a scattered collection of car factories.
But 'Europeanness' will have to be authenticated by Europeans, and
recognised and appreciated by people from outside Europe whose impressions
of the place may have little to do with its realities.
'It's got to happen organically,' says Olins. 'Anything else will curdle.'
If Europe's identity is to be its diversity, it will not be easily captured
in any logo.

The government's Top Management Programme, which brings together high fliers
from the public and private sector, has a new programme director in Hugh
Taylor, a Grade 3 at the Cabinet Office.
Taylor, 44, is currently serving as head of the Cabinet Office Management
Development Group. Previously he was at the Home Office, with responsibility
for personnel management in the Prison Service.
Taylor replaces Marianne Neville-Rolfe who has become director of the
government's new north-west regional office. Neville-Rolfe's other job as
head of the Civil Service College has also been filled recently by Stephen
Hickey, formerly head of a planning and finance branch in the Department of
Social Security.
Hickey, 44, joined the DSS after leaving Oxford and has worked in the
department ever since, apart from a secondment to Rank Xerox (UK). In 1988,
he headed the team that recommended the creation of agencies to take over
most of the department's executive functions.

FT  19 MAY 94 / People: Hughes promoted to Mothercare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Storehouse is filling the gap left by the departure of Mothercare chief
executive Ann Iverson with Simon Hughes, presently logistics director at
BHS.
Iverson, recruited to Storehouse by former group chief executive David
Dworkin, is leaving next month to join Melville, one of the largest
diversified retailers in the US, as head of Kay-Bee, Melville's toys
division.
Hughes, 45, beat other internal as well as external candidates to the post.
Storehouse said it felt an internal appointment was appropriate in order to
promote stability and continuity in a company which has seen a string of
departures by senior executives in recent years.
He is already known inside Mothercare, as he is heading a project looking at
whether to integrate its distribution chain with that of BHS, which he
reorganised.
Hughes, a father of two teenage daughters, says his style may be different
from that of his predecessor, although the 'open' culture will not change.
'Ann went to Mothercare when it needed to be turned round,' he says. 'I am
going when the need is to build on the work that has been done. My job is to
get all the parts working together.'
Hughes adds that a priority is to ensure the sales staff are 'emotionally
involved' in their jobs, and in the Mothercare brand. 'The service and
emotion has to be there. That's when the brand comes to life.'
Otherwise, his main tasks will be to complete the conversion of the stores
to a new design, and overhauling the supply chain.
Hughes graduated from London University and worked for British Rail before
joining shoe retailers C &amp; J Clark, and then Chaussures Ravel.
He joined BHS in 1985 as a merchandise controller and was appointed to the
board in 1990. His existing responsibilities will be divided between other
BHS directors when he moves to Mothercare.

Sir Bryan Nicholson, 61, (above), a former chairman of the Post Office, took
over as president of the Confederation of British Industry yesterday. He
succeeds Sir Michael Angus, 64, chairman of Whitbread, who has served for
two years.
Sir Bryan, like his predecessor, started his career as a Unilever marketing
man, joined Rank Xerox in 1972 and became chairman in 1979. Five years later
he moved into the public sector as chairman of the Manpower Services
Commission and served as chairman and chief executive of the Post Office
from 1987 to 1992.
He led the CBI's taskforce on educational and vocational training and has
been heavily involved in the CBI's contribution towards bringing about a
skills revolution in Britain.
Meanwhile, the CBI appointed Peter Agar, 44, a management consultant, as a
deputy director general. He joins Maurice Hunt, 57, and succeeds Richard
Price, who died last December. Agar, who has an economics degree from
Cambridge and an MBA from London Business School, is a former civil servant
who joined Outram Cullinan &amp; Co, strategic consultants, in 1987.

FT  19 MAY 94 / People: General Cable encompasses Cleaver
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Anthony Cleaver (above), a former chairman of IBM UK, has been appointed
a non-executive director of General Cable, the fast-growing telephone and
cable TV company, which is planning to float its shares on the stock market
later this year.
Sir Anthony, who is chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, is one of
three new directors joining the board of General Cable. It was founded in
1989 to develop the UK cable communications interests of France's Compagnie
Generale des Eaux. It has interests in nine cable franchises and has a
presence in three of the UK's biggest markets - suburban London, Birmingham
and Yorkshire - covering 1.6m homes and 102,000 businesses.
General Cable and its partners have invested Pounds 275m in the cable
franchises and claim to account for 19 per cent of all residential cable
telephone subscribers and 14 per cent of all cable TV subscribers in the UK.
General Cable is believed to be one of the first of a group of cable
companies coming to the stock market to raise funds for expansion.
Apart from Sir Anthony, the other new recruits to the General Cable
boardroom are George Gray, chairman of Serco, and Nigel Walmsley, chairman
of Carlton Television.
Philippe Galteau, General Cable's managing director, says Sir Anthony has
been recruited for his knowledge of international information technology;
Gray's expertise lay in the service sector and complex high level software.
Walmsley has been brought on board for his broadcasting background.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: You don't have to be Australian but it
helps - Andrew Jack finds prospects for financial staff in the UK are
improving quickly - but not uniformly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: Antipodean accountants for part-time assignments in a growing number
of financially-related jobs in the south east ofEngland. Good salaries paid.
In the crazy world of financial recruitment in London, Australian cost
accountants and financial controllers from New Zealand are all the rage.
Chartered accountants from Croydon are less in demand.
After four years of gloom, prospects are brightening for the UK's
accountants. But the light is not being spread evenly across the profession,
and the pattern casts serious shadows for the future.
The annual salary survey produced this week by Robert Half, one of the UK's
largest recruiters of financial staff, suggests the worst effects of the
economic downturn are definitely past. Mr Jeff Grout, managing director,
says: 'Two or three years ago was about the bleakest job market ever for
accountants. That has changed very quickly in the last nine months. It is
very much the end of the recession.'
In its place, he sees an 'almost alarming' increase in accountancy salaries
of 2.91 per cent over the last year - with a peak of 3.1 per cent in the
Thames Valley - though this is still a long way from 1988, when the average
salary increase was 13 per cent.
Some 26 per cent of companies questioned said they expected to hire
accountants during the coming year, compared with 15 per cent a year ago.
Only 13 per cent - or half last year's total - expected to make further job
cuts.
Yet demand for financial staff is not consistently spread. Much of it is for
temporaries. Mr Denis Waxman, managing director of Hays Personnel Services,
says they are cheaper to employ and more flexible. 'Clients have also been
educated in their use,' he says. 'Before the recession they looked on them
suspiciously as people who could not get full-time jobs. Now they see there
are high calibre people doing temporary work.'
The growth of temporaries has, in turn, led to a dominance within the sector
(in London) of Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans. Mr Grout says
they are popular because of their energy and ambition, reflecting their
spirit as migrants. 'Boring people don't make the trip,' he says.
Another important caveat to the recovery in the job market is the
differential attractiveness of different qualifications. Formal or more
senior qualifications may not always be so necessary. 'Small companies call
us and ask for a chartered accountant because their auditor has suggested
it,' says Mr Waxman. 'We say do you really need one when all you want is
someone to do your bookkeeping?'
He says that the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy has
gained new ground with its restructured syllabus, aimed at accountants in
the National Health Service and other restructured public sector
organisations.
However, among the different qualifications, management accountancy emerges
supreme. 'The Cima qualification has come of age,' says Mr Grout. 'Chartered
accountancy was top of the tree but for the majority of blue chip companies
now there is a preference for a more well-rounded business training.'
The trend is borne out by figures for student registrations at the Chartered
Institute of Management Accountants (Cima). The numbers have risen nearly
consistently over the last decade. There was a temporary drop from a peak of
11,180 in 1991 to 10,202 in the following year. But in 1993 it recovered to
10,731 and the indications are it will rise again this year.
Mr Jake Claret, Cima's director of student and technical affairs, says: 'We
are seeing a reflection of a product which is seen as favoured for the
market in which it operates. Ours is a specialist syllabus for business. We
are not training auditors. We are turning out individuals more comfortable
looking forwards than backwards.'
The prospects are not so bright for everyone. Figures released last month by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales shows total
student entries were at their lowest level in 1992-93 for 20 years.
From a record entry of 7,063 in 1988-89, the trend has been steadily
downwards, slumping to 4,847 in 1991-92 and sinking still further to just
4,074 last year. With an appropriate lag for training, qualified accountants
admitted also fell from 5,692 in 1992 to 4,476 in 1993.
Given that student entries readily translate into membership subscription
income on qualification three or four years later, such a decline poses a
threat to the Institute - hardly what it needs just when it is reporting a
Pounds 1.2m deficit in its latest accounts.
Mr Phil Armitage, the Institute's director of education and training,
stresses the decline does not reflect a lack of interest by students in
becoming chartered accountants, but rather a lack of demand from firms.
At the end of the 1980s, it was said that accountancy firms recruited 10 per
cent of all UK graduates, and KPMG Peat Marwick alone hired 10 per cent of
all accountancy recruits.
The mood is now more sombre. Many senior partners say the trends of the
1980s will never be repeated. They argue that there will be a smaller, more
selective intake in the future; that they are looking for more highly
qualified, business-oriented students who will remain loyal. They want to be
rid of those simply looking for a salary and free training while they defer
a serious career decision.
Certainly that is one of the prime justifications they have used for hikes
in salaries which seem to defy all logic and laws of a market economy.
Arthur Andersen has built a reputation for paying more than its rival 'Big
Six' competitors, stressing to potential recruits that they will work a
slightly longer week.
But the traditional co-operation among the other firms broke down two years
ago when Price Waterhouse, in mid recession, upped its London graduate
salaries from Pounds 12,500 to Pounds 14,000 in a move reluctantly followed
by its rivals.
Most recently, Coopers &amp; Lybrand has done the same, offering its London
recruits starting this autumn Pounds 17,000 a year. By beating its rivals to
a high quote early in the recruitment season, it may gain better calibre
people in the short-term.
Other firms are also tweaking the figures, using a combination of bonuses on
qualification and perks to make applications more attractive.
Mr Peter Smith, the newly-elected chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that
the number of students hired by his firm is rising again in line. It is a
view shared by several of his fellow senior partners.
'The firms have been very short-sighted,' says Mr Waxman of Hays. 'They
over-recruited in the good days and then cut back dramatically. I guarantee
that in 18 months the partners will be going mad and accusing me of driving
up the market.'
Mr Grout says he expects the main losers as recruitment hots up to be the
smaller and mid-size accountancy firms, which may have to increasingly rely
on accounting technicians as their larger rivals snap up the better
graduates.
In general, it seems as though the next few months offer good news for
accountants hunting their first jobs or considering a move; and a little
more sober contemplation for those entering as a trainee.
In the accountancy firms, business and the professional bodies, there needs
to be more soul searching on the scope for revisions to training and
recruitment in the future.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: Economic policy will define Labour's
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing like a leadership battle. The blend of ideological conflict
and personal rivalries produces a unique chemistry. It is raw politics.
So Labour MPs are looking forward to the party's impending contest with
relish and trepidation. Relish because power is what motivates them - even
the humblest backbench MP has had to fight to get to Westminster.
Trepidation because the forces unleashed in such struggles are difficult to
control.
It is no discredit to Labour that preparations for John Smith's funeral
tomorrow have been accompanied by frenetic behind-the-scenes activity to
choose a successor. Politics abhors a vacuum. But Mr Smith would have
expected his colleagues to show the party has grown up: that it can conduct
its arguments without re-igniting the vicious factionalism of the past.
So far that has been the case. One or two animosities are visible. To say
that Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Robin Cook are not close friends is to be guilty
of serious understatement. But by and large there is little of the corrosive
malice which infected Labour during the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Mr Neil Kinnock, who shifted decisively the party's centre of gravity during
the 1980s, deserves much credit. Mr Smith healed many of the wounds
inflicted during that process.
But if the debate is now more mature, it has not gone away. Labour has still
to decide its future. The left, renamed traditionalists, has not
disappeared. The leadership contest will be a decisive test of the strength
of the modernisers.
The battleground will be the economy. It always is.
Mr Gordon Brown, vying for the modernisers' candidacy with Mr Tony Blair,
has done more than he has been thanked for to prepare the ground for a
credible economic strategy. Either man - and for now Mr Blair is well ahead
 -will build on the foundations.
The tax and spending pledges made at the last general election have been
dropped. Mr Brown has established that his party can no longer tax for the
sake of it. Nationalisation has been removed from Labour's vocabularly.
The new emphasis on private-sector infrastructure projects has implications
far wider than the provision of the odd high-speed rail link. Messrs Brown
and Blair are out to shift the focus from an historic obsession with
ownership to securing agreement on the objectives of policy. Making the
economy work well is more important to the unemployed than soaking the very
rich.
In spite of constant harrying from disgruntled union bosses, Mr Brown has
managed also to switch attention to the supply side of the economy.
Macroeconomic policy has ceased to be seen in terms of crude demand
management. Instead a stable macro-economic framework is offered as an
anchor for education, training and investment policies which would increase
productive capacity.
This fundamental emphasis on the ends, not means, is at the heart of the
modernisers' project. It has an application far beyond economic policy. It
would undercut, for example, Labour's traditional commitment to uniformity
and universality in welfare provision or state education.
But the left has become impatient. Mr Smith gave them a commitment to full
employment and to a national minimum wage. Neither Mr Brown nor Mr Blair
could easily abandon the pledges. But traditionalists now want more. The
battle lines have become blurred - but the constituencies represented by Mr
John Prescott and, to a lesser extent, Mr Cook want an ambitiously
expansionist strategy.
A Labour government should pull the macroeconomic levers to deliver faster
growth. Higher output and incomes and a fall in the jobless total would then
square the eternal circle between tax and spending.
Mr Prescott is unimpressed by his rivals' respect for Treasury spending and
borrowing rules or for their willingness to play by the government's
exchange rate rules. Look what happened when Labour backed the Tories on
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Cook is no friend of
the City. He sees the potential for an interventionist role in fighting the
British disease of short-termism.
The left wants Labour to lift its sights and inspire the electorate.
Promising to run the economy by Tory rules will not deliver a Labour
government. And should not the unions, the social partners, have a bigger
say?
Other important arguments will have to be played out over the next few
weeks: over the party's institutional links with the unions, over Europe,
over the welfare state.
But the issue which will define the contest is the economy. The party's
choice as leader will in turn define the ground on which it fights, and wins
or loses, the general election.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Civil service shake-up plan near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is finalising proposals for wide-ranging reform of the civil
service career structure, allowing greater external competition for top
posts and giving Whitehall departments more auto-nomy in senior staff
appointments.
Ministers will outline their proposals in a consultative paper next month
that will mark the most important stage yet in the government's plans to
reform the top levels of the service.
Among proposals under consideration is reform of the controversial
fast-stream entry system, which ensures that a select few entrants are
groomed for top Whitehall jobs at the peak of their careers. The system has
been accused of creating a self-replicating elite, of largely male, white,
Oxbridge generalists.
Officials have found that most large private-sector companies have some sort
of procedure for giving high-fliers a wide range of experience to prepare
them for top management jobs. But it is rare for fast-stream candidates to
be selected before they have entered the organisation - high-fliers are
normally identified according to their performance in the job.
New proposals may also give greater autonomy to departments in deciding who
should get fast-stream status. Under the present system, fast-stream
applicants are chosen by the Civil Service Selection Board. The document
will outline ways in which the government can recruit more people with
strong private-sector experience into the upper echelons of Whitehall. A
study by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit last year recommended opening
more jobs to outsiders and advertising top posts.
The report also called for regular assessments of how leading civil servants
perform their tasks.

FT  19 MAY 94 / 'Ties' between life insurers and banks to change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arrangements for 'ties' between life insurers and banks or building
societies would have to change in order to remain worthwhile, Mr Bill Jack,
general manager of General Accident Life, said yesterday. They had not
sufficiently benefited customers in the past, he added.
He argued that increasing competition meant that greater transparency should
be introduced into tied arrangements, and existing cross-subsidies could
end.
Mr Jack said that the new regulatory regime - which would allow differential
pricing - would increase the pressure for cost efficiency and highlight the
attractions of very low-cost distribution methods such as telephone sales.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Council spending on IT attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in England and Wales are spending almost twice as much as
they need to on information technology, the Audit Commission claims in a
report published today.
Annual spending of Pounds 290m on IT central functions such as the council
tax and the payroll could be cut by Pounds 130m, according to the
government's public spending watchdog. It says savings of Pounds 50m are
available in the short term. These are the biggest proportionate public
sector savings the commission has identified since it was set up 10 years
ago.
The report says that local government reorganisation, intended to take place
in 1996 and 1997, could add to costs with the increase in tasks. Failure to
prepare for the changes has put services 'at risk'.
The commission looked at seven core functions which require broadly
comparable information technology sys-tems for all councils: council tax,
national non-domestic rates, housing repairs, housing rents, housing
benefits, payroll and payments. Some authorities paid twice as much for
these systems as others.
The report does not cover the Pounds 210m that councils spend on information
technology for services such as planning and education, because these are
harder to compare and quantify.
Mr Bob Chilton, director of local government studies for the commission,
said that substantial savings could also be made in these areas. 'The
overriding issue is that users must take control,' he said. 'Providers have
dominated, and users have found it difficult to negotiate price or content.
Users have treated IT as a free good, because it's not on their budget.'
Many systems are under-utilised, or include functions that are never used,
he said, and most councils still treated IT as a separate central function.
The commission wants decisions on IT spending delegated to users, such as
education departments and direct service organisations.
It believes that compulsory competitive tendering for councils' IT
departments, which will be enforced for English metropolitan councils next
year, could help.
This will force individual departments to outline precise specifications of
their needs, it says, and eliminate waste.
Local authority organisations accepted the report's findings, which they
said would help to identify overspending. The Labour-controlled Association
of County Councils said, however, that the 'significant upheaval and cost'
of reorganisation would jeopardise any benefits.

FT  19 MAY 94 / One member, 0.0001% of the vote: Democracy it isn't, in the
first of a series on Labour's electoral college - Leadership contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not be misled by the terminology. They may call it one-member-one-vote;
the numbers involved may make it the biggest consultation exercise ever
carried out by a British political party; but democratic it is not.
Officially, Labour's leadership campaign is not yet under way. Formal
campaigning is being held up until after the funeral of John Smith in
Edinburgh tomorrow, and a meeting of the ruling national executive committee
next week.
But it is already clear that the complex electoral system, adopted last year
with the intention of reducing the role of union leaders, has had the
largely unintended effect of increasing the influence of Labour MPs.
The system uses an electoral college split into three equal parts: the
party's MPs and MEPs; its individual members; and members of unions which
pay the political levy.
Labour officials have been pointing out this week that ordinary party
members will have a much greater say in the election of their next leader
than their Tory counterparts. The claim is true, but the system is
considerably less democratic than that used by the Liberal Democrats, which
gives all party members a single vote of equal value.
In fact, the Labour process is highly inequitable because of the deliberate
distortions in voting power. Each of the 275 MPs and 45 MEPs accounts for
0.1040 per cent of the votes; each of the 250,000 party members accounts for
0.0001 per cent; and each of the 4.5m levy payers for just 0.000007 per
cent. Put another way, each MPs' vote is worth 800 times that of a party
member, and 14,500 times that of a levy-payer.
To the regret of some - notably Lord Healey, the former deputy leader - MPs
are unlikely ever to recover the sole power to elect the leader that they
enjoyed before 1981. But they wield far more influence in this election than
they did between 1981 and 1993, when union leaders controlled 40 per cent of
the electoral college votes.
The crucial rule is that the leader must be be nominated by 12.5 per cent of
the parliamentary party (20 per cent if the party is in government). In
practice, this means that the MPs conduct a primary contest which weeds out
candidates with little parliamentary support, even if they can mobilise
substantial backing among activists and union members.
The system works strongly in favour of MPs with strong backing at
Westminster, such as Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, Mr Robin
Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor. But candidates whose support is largely in the constituencies
and the unions, such as Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, and
possibly Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, risk being squeezed out of the
race before it starts.
The procedure also gives substantial influence to special interest groups
among MPs, who can get a candidate on to the ballot by collecting a mere 34
nomination signatures. Once in the race, the support of a special interest
group is worth its weight in gold: the Scottish group of 49 MPs, for
example, will dispose of 15 per cent of the MPs and MEPs' votes, and 5.2 per
cent of the total electoral college votes.
Unfortunately for the candidates, it may not be that simple because even
special interest groups can rarely be relied on to act as a bloc. Many of
the Scottish group, for example, will back Mr Brown, MP for Dunfermline
East, but a number of rightwing Scots will plump for Mr Blair, and
leftwingers may support either Mr Cook or Mr Prescott.
There are other potentially important groupings, many of which overlap. Many
women MPs will vote for Mrs Beckett, and there is support among the large
group of north-east MPs for Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary,
who sits for Copeland.
More formal groupings have less power than they did. Tribune, for example,
has been infiltrated by so many centre and rightwing MPs that it now
contains supporters of several different candidates.
There are other complications, too. The NEC has yet to decide whether the
ballot will be secret, as it was before 1981, or open, as it has since been.
The difference is important: a secret ballot makes promises of support
unreliable, but an open ballot would subject some MPs to pressure from
constituency activists.
The timing could also influence the prospects of some candidates. The NEC
will probably decide on Wednesday whether the ballot should be held
immediately after the European elections on June 9, or delayed until the
party conference in the autumn. A delay would ensure that both the
leadership and deputy leadership could be contested, increasing the options
for Mr Cook, Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett. The shape of the battle will
remain unclear, however, until the NEC fires the starting gun.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Tories rapped by Halifax chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The chief executive of Halifax building society yesterday attacked the
government's housing policy and called for new forms of subsidy to promote
choice.
In a speech that contrasted Tory commitment to choice with the absence of
policies likely to achieve this in housing, Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax
chief, argued there was a need for a better-targeted subsidy for
owner-occupation; more support for the private rented sector; and a mix of
subsidies for people on lower incomes.
He said support for people on lower incomes should be available both to
those buying and renting.
Addressing the annual Building Society Association conference in Birmingham,
Mr Blackburn said the government should not reduce mortgage tax relief any
further unless it was replaced with a subsidy that was more closely directed
to particular needs.
He cited the example of other countries that targeted tax relief by making
it available for a limited time only, or to families with children.
It was not satisfactory for the government to try to create a level playing
field by withdrawing all subsidies.
'It may have a certain simplicity and rightwing intellectual appeal, but it
is not a way of managing housing policy in an advanced country - in many
ways it is an abdication by government of its responsibilities for housing
policy,' said Mr Blackburn.
The kickstart needed to assist the private rented sector could be directed
either at encouraging the small landlord or promoting investment by
institutional funds through some form of tax-free investment trust.
He also criticised cuts made in the housing association grant and the
apparent short-term approach of government policymaking.
Mr Blackburn's approach was backed by Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive
of Nationwide, the second-largest society.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, the housing charity, also attacked
the government for its 'irresponsible policy' of promoting home ownership
across all classes, and called for changes in the tax and benefit systems.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Societies' life links questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arrangements for 'ties' between life insurers and banks or building
societies would have to change in order to remain worthwhile, Mr Bill Jack,
general manager of General Accident Life, said yesterday. They had not
sufficiently benefited customers in the past, he added.
He argued that the climate of increasing competition in life products -
particularly from telephone sales - meant that greater transparency should
be introduced into tied arrangements, and existing cross-subsidies could
end.
Mr Jack said that the new regulatory regime - which would allow differential
pricing - would increase the pressure for cost efficiency and highlight the
attractions of very low-cost distribution methods such as telephone sales.
Some life products could be suitable for selling over the telephone. Calls
could be recorded for the protection of the potential investor and to
satisfy the regulators, he suggested.
GA's tie with North of England Building Society is at risk following the
society's decision to merge with Northern Rock, which is already tied to
Legal &amp; General.
Other life insurers have seen ties ended as the largest societies have moved
to set up their own life operations. Mr Jack forecast further distancing as
those societies which had set up joint ventures moved to take greater
control of them.
While he underlined the benefits in terms of economies of scale from a bank
or society making an arrangement with an insurer to carry out its
administration in a life subsidiary, he acknowledged that even these were
'not necessarily designed to be long-term'.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Halifax chief slams Tory homes policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of Halifax building society yesterday made a
wide-ranging attack on government housing policy and called for new forms of
subsidy to promote choice.
In a speech that contrasted Tory party political commitment to choice with
the absence of policies likely to achieve this in housing, Mr Mike Blackburn
argued there was a need for a better-targeted subsidy for owner-occupation;
more support for the private rented sector; and a mix of subsidies for
people on lower incomes.
He said support for people on lower incomes should be 'tenure-neutral' and
available both to those buying and renting.
'It is a national disgrace that homelessness remains an issue in Britain in
the latter years of the 20th century,' said the chief of Halifax, the UK's
largest mortgage lender.
Addressing the annual Building Society Association conference in Birmingham,
Mr Blackburn said the government should not reduce mortgage tax relief any
further unless it replaced the sub-sidy with one that was more closely
directed to particular needs.
He cited the example of other countries that targeted tax relief by making
it available for a limited time only, or to families with children.
It was not satisfactory for the government to try to create a level playing
field by withdrawing all subsidies.
'It may have a certain simplicity and rightwing intellectual appeal, but it
is not a way of managing housing policy in an advanced country - in many
ways it is an abdication by government of its responsibilities for housing
policy,' Mr Blackburn said.
The kickstart needed to assist the private rented sector could be directed
either at encouraging the small landlord or promoting investment by
institutional funds through some form of tax-free investment trust.
He said, however, a commitment was needed not only from the government, but
also from the other main political parties to revive the private rented
sector for any such incentives to prove effective.
He also criticised cuts made in the Housing Association Grant, and the
apparent short-term approach of government policymaking.
This approach favoured looking at the immediate impact on public spending,
even at the price of higher costs and perhaps higher inflation in future.
Mr Blackburn's approach was backed by Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive
of Nationwide, the second-largest society.
The association will publish a paper on housing policy in the summer, in an
effort to bolster its lobbying of the government.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of the housing charity Shelter, also attacked
the government for its 'irres-ponsible policy' of promoting home ownership
across all classes.
She called for changes in the tax and benefit system to address the
consequences for housing policy of increasing instability in people's
employment prospects.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Channel 4 loses programme battle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 has failed in the first round of its battle to take the
Broadcasting Complaints Commission to judicial review over a programme
involving two former chancellors of the exchequer, Lords Lawson and Howe.
Mr Justice Popplewell has refused Channel 4 permission to go to judicial
review after looking at written submissions.
However Mr Michael Grade, Channel 4 chief executive, is determined now to
seek a full hearing.
The row between the channel and the BCC is over a programme on monetary
policy, A Brief Economic History of Our Times, made by Fulcrum Productions.
The commission found that the programme was accurate but decided that if the
two Conservative peers had known how critical the programme was going to be
of their handling of the economy, they would not have agreed to take part.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell is to spend Pounds 70m over seven years modernising and expanding its
main UK research centre at Thornton, Cheshire.
Thornton, which is one of the largest of Shell's 15 complexes of industrial
laboratories worldwide, currently employs 600 staff. By the end of next year
it will take in 140 scientists from a centre in Sittingbourne, Kent, which
Shell is closing.
The Cheshire centre's best known work is on automotive fuels and lubricating
oils.
It has also become one of the world's foremost centres for combustion
science and hazard analysis, where its work on gas explosions in confined
spaces has enabled safer design of offshore oil and gas platforms since the
Piper Alpha disaster in 1988.

FT  19 MAY 94 / MPs renew attack on Welsh Office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A committee of MPs today attacked 'unacceptable' standards in the Welsh
Office, alleging incorrect payments and missing audits covering millions of
pounds.
In the latest of a series of investigations in Wales by the public accounts
committee, the MPs said that records involving Pounds 120m were missing
while audited claims for Pounds 37m 'could not be located'.
Last week, the chairman of The Development Board for Rural Wales, Mr Glyn
Davies, resigned in the wake of a critical report by the committee on
housing policy and a staff car scheme. There was also a damning report on
the Welsh Development Agency last year.
In its report today, the committee notes with 'dismay' that accounts on road
spending at the Welsh Office could not be approved for five successive years
because they were not in proper order.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Company anger at results penalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies House, the government's corporate information depository, is still
receiving more than 1,000 calls a week about its late-filing penalty regime,
Andrew Jack writes.
It has handled 65,000 disputes since the regime was introduced in July 1992,
Mr David Durham, chief executive, told the Commons committee on the
parliamentary commissioner for administration.
Mr Durham admitted that the volume of calls and letters was greater than the
levels he had anticipated.
Mr William Reed, the parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - said he had
completed examinations of two cases concerning Companies House in 1993 and a
further six were still under investigation.
His report on one case - which led to Companies House paying compensation
and costs of Pounds 2,500 - referred to 'a chain of errors' from the agency.
Mr James Pawsey, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: 'There seems
to be a serious problem. This is an extraordinary number of complaints.'
Following changes to company law in 1989, Companies House began imposing
fines with a minimum of Pounds 100 for businesses failing to file their
annual accounts on time.
To date, 164,000 penalties have been imposed on companies, generating fines
of Pounds 33m, which are remitted to the Treasury. The annual administrative
cost of running the late penalty regime is Pounds 1.3m.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Checklist for pension buyers issued by SIB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Checklists to help people thinking of buying personal pensions were
published yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog, as part of its efforts to improve standards in this area of
business.
Two factsheets which list questions and issues that potential investors
should raise with sales agents or financial advisers will be given wide
distribution through outlets such as Citizens' Advice Bureaux and public
libraries by the end of the month.
They will also be publicised through the Trades Union Congress and the
Confederation of British Industry. These organisations are being asked to
make their members aware of the checklists.
Sample copies have been sent to all members of the National Association of
Pension Funds and to all public-sector pension schemes. Some 500,000 have
been printed so far.
One factsheet covers the position of people who are thinking of opting out
of - or not joining - a pension scheme for which they are eligible with an
employer. The other deals with people who are thinking of transferring a
lump sum from the pension scheme of a former employer.
The fact that the regulator is taking these steps directly to try to ensure
that customers take well-informed decisions suggests that it doubts whether
the life insurance industry can convey this information clearly and
effectively to potential customers.
The intensive programme that the regulators have undertaken relating to the
sale of personal pensions follows a pilot study published last December.
This suggested that the vast majority of pensions transfer cases did not
meet regulatory requirements. The survey led to widespread public unease
about personal pensions business, which appears to have been reflected in
the sales of pension transfers in the first three months of this year.
More than 500,000 people are estimated to have bought pension transfers,
while the number to have opted out of an existing occupational scheme is
thought to be much lower. Regulators believe that the guidance has to
address both types of investment because a decision to opt out of an
occupational scheme may make someone worse off in retirement.
Each factsheet focuses first on basic questions for customers to address in
considering the pension scheme they might leave. These include finding out
whether the scheme is based on final salary or on purchasing particular
benefits; and whether they realise that in leaving the scheme they might
give up some of the benefits for which they are eligible.
It goes on to a checklist of questions which potential investors should make
sure their financial adviser has answered. It also advises customers to
check what commission they will pay to the sales agent or adviser, and
specifically urges them to shop around.
The paper dealing with opting out also contains a clear warning that such a
decision is highly likely to be a bad one. 'You will nearly always be better
off if you stay in, or join, your employer's pension scheme,' it warns.
The next stage of the regulatory work on pension transfers will be the
issuing of guidance on how to deal with cases where a customer has suffered
as a result of following poor advice to transfer or opt out of an employer's
scheme. This is due to be published in July.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Dorrell critical of high dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dividend payouts by British companies may have become too high and too
inflexible, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury,
said yesterday in a speech to the council of the Confederation of British
Industry.
Mr Dorrell, who is conducting a review of savings and the movement of funds
through the economy, said that in the early 1980s companies were
distributing between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of their after-tax earnings
in dividends. This 'payout ratio' rose to more than 50 per cent by 1990 and
to more than 60 per cent in both 1991 and 1992.
'A long-term rise in dividend payout ratios necessarily implies reduced
availability to a business of its retained earnings, and greater reliance on
its ability to raise new capital from the markets,' said Mr Dorrell.
'It undeniably increases the cost of capital if the system requires a
business to employ professionals to secure access to capital which it has
just distributed.'
Mr Dorrell added that the system may inhibit the ability of smaller
companies to obtain capital, since they feel the same pressure to
distribute, but face disproportionately greater costs when raising new
capital. He said that the inflexibility of dividend payouts had disturbed
the balance of risk between shareholders and other capital providers.
Surprisingly little capital was provided in the form of term debt or
preference shares, Mr Dorrell said, and both businesses and investors might
benefit from a broader range of financing instruments.
However, he ruled out specific dividend controls and added that tax changes
would not be made until the government could 'first identify the improvement
we seek and secondly establish that tax changes are the best means of
achieving it'. He added: 'Neither of those two conditions have yet been
established.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / Clarke's subtle differences with George
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, agreed at their meeting on March 30 that a further cut in
interest rates might be warranted if the economy weakened and inflationary
pressures remained subdued.
But the official minutes of the meeting, released yesterday, show a nuanced
difference in their approach to lower rates, with Mr Clarke more supportive
of an eventual easing of borrowing costs than Mr George.
The meeting, which by all accounts was short, took place at a time of rising
long-term bond rates and turbulence on financial markets which overshadowed
evidence of continuing steady non-inflationary growth in Britain. It ended
with Mr Clarke concluding that 'it was not appropriate to change interest
rates at the moment, in particular because of current market volatility'.
According to the minutes, Mr George came to the conclusion that the latest
evidence did not justify a further cut in interest rates from the 5.25 per
cent base rate set in February.
The governor said it remained 'possible that a further cut would be
warranted in the future if there were hard evidence of activity turning out
weaker than expected and inflation projections were revised down'.
But he added: 'It would also be very unwise to consider an interest-rate cut
in current market conditions.' Mr Clarke agreed that market volatility was
an important factor and that a move on interest rates could put the
credibility of monetary policy at risk.
'However, he felt that the markets had overreacted to events' and that
'there was no evidence in recent data of a deterioration in the prospect for
inflation'.
The minutes show the chancellor taking a subtly different approach to Mr
George by setting less tough inflation conditions for a rate cut and
worrying about any delay in tackling a possible economic slowdown.
Mr Clarke 'felt that if activity weakened and inflationary pressures
remained subdued, there might be a case for a further cut in interest rates.
'He was also concerned that waiting for cast-iron evidence of a slowdown in
activity before moving interest rates would risk delaying too long.'
By showing broad agreement, the latest minutes supported Mr Clarke's denial
this week of a clash between himself and Mr George. Instead, they give a
picture of two men who relish intelligent debate over economic policy
issues.
As the chancellor told the Confederation of British Industry dinner on
Tuesday night: 'I share the same aim of low inflation and sound money. I
decide, but we discuss and seek to agree.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / Car sales only slightly dented
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
April's tax increases had only a slightly damping effect on the upsurge in
both new and used car sales, according to statistics from HPI, the vehicle
finance information agency.
Sales of new cars bought on hire purchase or other forms of instalment
finance were 11.2 per cent higher in April than in the corresponding month
last year, and finance sales of used cars 10 per cent higher, according to
HPI. However, both represented a slowdown compared with first-quarter growth
of 28.8 per cent year-on-year for sales of new cars bought on instalments
and 15.1 per cent for used-car sales.
The instalment purchase figures compare with a 4.8 per cent year-on-year
increase in total new-car sales in April. 'It seems that the market for cars
bought on finance terms has withstood the effect of April's tax increases
better than cash purchases,' said Dr Brian Bailey, HPI chairman.

April's public sector borrowing requirement fell to Pounds 4.35bn from
Pounds 4.66bn in April last year.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, which fell to Pounds 391m last month from
Pounds 1.36bn in April last year, the PSBR declined to Pounds 4.74bn last
month from Pounds 6.02bn in the first month of the 1993-94 financial year,
yesterday's provisional figures from the Central Statistical Office showed.
It also reported that it had revised downwards the 1993-94 PSBR by Pounds
100m to Pounds 45.84bn.
A breakdown of the figures disclosed that central government cash receipts
were Pounds 17.3bn in April, a 4 per cent decrease compared with Pounds 18bn
in April 1993.
While Inland Revenue receipts were 3.5 per cent higher at Pounds 6.7bn and
social security contributions up 5 per cent at Pounds 3.6bn, receipts from
Customs &amp; Excise were down 6 per cent at Pounds 5.5bn
Central government cash outlays totalled Pounds 20.7bn in April, compared
with Pounds 21.3bn in April 1993.

A pay deal worth about 2.5 per cent was agreed last night for Britain's
600,000 building and civil engineering workers between employers and unions.
The proposals will be put to the workers with a union recommendation that
they should accept it, Robert Taylor writes.
An employers' spokesman said: 'Both sides recognised the difficulties the
industry has gone through over the past four years of recession and they
regard the offer as realistic in the circumstances.'
Rates of pay for a normal 39-hour week would go up from June 27. The
guaranteed minimum earnings for a craft operative would rise to Pounds
163.41 from Pounds 159.51 and for a labourer to Pounds 139.23 from Pounds
135.91.
