FT  19 MAY 94 / Publishers agree code of practice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
More than three years after the publication of the Sadler inquiry into
cross-media promotion, newspaper and magazine publishers have finally agreed
a code of practice.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the Department of Trade and Industry corporate affairs
minister, announced yesterday publication of a code which has been endorsed
by the main publishing organisations.
One of the recommendations of the report by Mr John Sadler, former deputy
chairman of the John Lewis group and the new chairman of Pearl, the life
insurer, was that newspapers should establish a code covering both editorial
and advertising content.
The code refers to such areas as conditions of supply, non-discriminatory
rates for competitors' advertising and the publication of relevant ownership
links in editorial and advertising.
The Cross-Media Promotion Code was drawn up by the Newspaper Publishers'
Association on behalf of national newspapers, the Newspaper Society
representing local and regional newspapers, and the Periodical Publishers'
Association and their Scottish counterparts. Publications are being
encouraged to publish their own in-house guidelines on the coverage of
competitors.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Hunt issues fresh warning on pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday stepped up pressure on companies to exercise wage
restraint, after City bonuses and rising overtime helped push earnings
significantly higher in March.
Average earnings rose by an underlying rate of 4 per cent in March, compared
with the previous March, provisional figures from the Department of
Employment yesterday showed.
This was a quarter of a point higher than February's growth figure, which
was yesterday revised up from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent. It was also
higher than most market expectations, which had predicted a rise of about
3.75 per cent in March.
The Department of Employment said the increase was mainly due to rising
bonuses and overtime, rather than wage settlements.
These had accounted for about three-quarters of the 0.5 per cent difference
between the original February figure and the new March figure, the
department added, noting that bonuses in banking and finance had played a
particularly significant role.
But coming after the Bank of England's comments last week indicating that
average earnings could be a source of inflationary concern, the figures
triggered a round of warnings about rising wage costs.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said: 'We have got to get the message
over to business that they have to control their costs, especially their
wage costs, if we are to remain competitive.' Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of
employment affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, warned that the
rise suggested that 'employers will have to devote more attention to the
whole pay package, including bonuses and allowances, not just (wage)
settlements'.
The concern was echoed by City analysts, who pointed out that in spite of
the role played by bonuses, the fastest rise in average earnings in March
was in the production sector, where earnings were 5 per cent higher than the
previous year. This compares with an underlying increase of 3.75 per cent in
the service sector.
As a result, unit wage costs had continued to rise, and were 2.5 per cent
higher than the previous year - a level last reached in July 1992.
Meanwhile, productivity had remained fairly flat in the last three months,
some 2.6 per cent higher in March than the previous year.
Mr Paul Turnbull, chief economist at broker Smith New Court, said: 'In the
context of the Bank of England's remarks last week, these earnings figures
will bolster worries that interest rates will have to go up soon.'
Figures from Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation show that
private-sector earnings in March were rising at twice the rate of inflation
while continuing restraint in the public sector has held rises to 0.8 per
cent below inflation.
Mr Trinder said the government was being far too complacent about the upward
movement in private-sector pay.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Jobless figure at lowest for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of people out of work fell for the third consecutive month in all
regions of Britain in April, taking the unemployment rate to its lowest
level for two years.
Unemployment fell by 36,800 in April compared with March, bringing the
seasonally adjusted number of unemployed down to 2.682m, the Department of
Employment yesterday said.
This leaves unemployment running at 9.5 per cent of the total work force -
almost a percentage point lower than last April's rate of 10.4 per cent.
Coming after similar large drops in February and March, the figures also
suggest that unemployment fell by more than 100,000 during the last three
months, at an average monthly rate of 36,000.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, yesterday welcomed the figures as
evidence that unemployment was on 'a firm downward trend' at an accelerating
rate.
One of the most significant falls, he said, had occurred in the 18- to
24-year-old age group, where unemployment had dropped by 61,100 in the last
quarter, and by more than 100,000 in the past year. This trend was most
marked among males aged between 20 and 24, with a drop in long term
unemployment of 12 per cent in the last year. A drop in the number of young
unemployed men is usually regarded by economists as a key sign of recovery.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, denounced the figures,
claiming they concealed a 'huge army of missing millions' pushed off the
social security register.
'Since January last year the number of unemployed people on benefit has
indeed fallen by 289,000, but that does not mean that they are all finding
work,' he said.
This scepticism was echoed by some City economists, who pointed out that the
drop in unemployment did not appear to be entirely matched by evidence of
new job creation, not least because employment levels in production industry
had actually fallen recently.
Total employment in the manufacturing industries fell by 12,000 during
March, while employment in the energy, water and supply industries was down
by 5,000.
However, this was partly offset by a growth in vacancies and overtime,
analysts added. Seasonally adjusted vacancies at job centres rose by 5,300
to 145,900 in April, taking the number of vacancies to their highest level
since October 1990. Hours worked per week in manufacturing industries rose
to 9.72m in March, nearly 500,000 per week up on the previous month.
As a result, Mr Leo Doyle, economist at Kleinwort Benson, said that most
city analysts were now sufficiently convinced of the underlying downward
trend that they were prepared to discount small doubts about the details.
'I think there is an element of exaggeration in these unemployment figures,
but you can't dismiss them - the trend is clearly down,' Mr Doyle said.
Meanwhile, the number of work stoppages in the 12 months to March fell to
168, the lowest level since the department began keeping records in 1920.

FT  19 MAY 94 / BBC names partner for talks on US satellite deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is in talks with Cox Enterprises, the large US media group, over a
joint venture to take an international BBC satellite television channel into
the US market.
It is not yet clear whether the channel would be BBC World Service
Television News or a BBC entertainment channel of the sort to be launched in
Europe in the autumn.
Last week the BBC announced a 'global strategic alliance' with Pearson, the
media and entertainment group that owns the Financial Times, to develop a
range of satellite television channels around the world.
Pearson would be a potential partner for a US venture, although so far talks
have been between the BBC and Cox.
The BBC has said for some time that it wants to enter the US market with
World Service Television and was talking to a potential US partner.
Cox, a privately owned media group, is one of the largest US communications
groups with revenues of more than Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.53bn) annually and
interests that range from newspapers to cable television networks. The
Atlanta group is the sixth largest cable operator in the US with more than
1.8m cable subscribers in networks all over the US.
A deal between the BBC and Cox would give the BBC a toe-hold in the US with
immediate access to 1.8m homes. The hope would be that the BBC channel would
then be carried by other cable systems.
Cox, the BBC and Pearson, through Thames Television its independent
production subsidiary, already work together in the UK in two satellite
television channels, UK Gold and UK Living. UK Gold is based on the BBC and
Thames programme libraries, UK Living is aimed mainly at women.
Talks between the BBC and Cox are likely to come to a head within the next
few weeks, so the BBC could enter the US market this year if agreement is
reached.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Tax increases lift headline inflation rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax increases pushed up the headline rate of annual inflation to 2.6 per
cent in April, from 2.3 per cent in March, but there was an encouraging fall
in the underlying rate.
When mortgage interest payments are excluded, the annual inflation rate fell
to 2.3 per cent in April, from 2.4 per cent in March, according to the
Central Statistical Office.
This is the lowest level of underlying inflation since November 1967 and
means that the underlying rate has dropped below the headline rate for the
first time since February 1991.
With inflationary pressures generally subdued, the impact of tax changes
means that April is now by far the most important month for price increases.
The all-items retail price index rose by 1.2 per cent between March and
April, the largest monthly increase for two years. Prices rose more in April
than in the previous 10 months from May 1993 to March 1994 combined.
Although the Budget has been moved from March to November, April remains the
key month for many local and central government tax changes.
The introduction of value added tax on fuel was the most important factor,
adding 0.35 percentage points to the retail prices index. The CSO decided
not to take into account the pre-payment of fuel bills by consumers in
calculating the effect.
It cited a 1986 RPI advisory committee ruling which said that the 'time at
which the liability for payment was incurred', rather than the time at which
the payment was made, was the crucial factor.
The reduction in mortgage interest relief (Miras) from 25 to 20 per cent
added 0.24 percentage points to the index in April, while increases in local
authority rents and the council tax pushed up the RPI by 0.18 and 0.08
points respectively. A further 0.07 percentage points were contributed by
increases in water and sewerage costs.
This increase in housing-related costs obscured the improving inflationary
trend elsewhere in the economy. In April, the annual increase in all items
excluding housing, at 2.3 per cent, was the lowest since February 1964.
Individual sectors are still showing price falls. Prices of household goods,
such as furniture, fell by 0.5 per cent in the 12 months to April, the first
negative annual rate since records began in 1974. Prices of leisure goods,
such as audio-visual equipment, also fell.
Analysts generally welcomed the inflation figures, although they were
slightly overshadowed by the increase in average earnings.
Mr Ian Shepherdson of HSBC Greenwell estimated that the Bank of England's
measure of core inflation, RPI (Y), which excludes taxes as well as mortgage
payments, fell to 1.6 per cent in April from 1.9 per cent in March.
Mr Adrian Cooper of James Capel said that services inflation was collapsing,
with the annual rate now down to 2.3 per cent from 5 per cent during much of
1993.

</HEADLINE>

Union leaders pointed yesterday to the growing divergence between
private-sector and public-sector earnings.
Figures from Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation show that
private sector earnings in March were rising at twice the rate of inflation
while continuing restraint in the public sector has held rises to 0.8 per
cent below inflation.
Mr Trinder said the government was being far too complacent about the upward
movement in private sector pay. 'This is not just bonuses and overtime, as
the government says. The growth of performance-related pay seems to be
pushing up pay while basic settlements remain low,' he said.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Portillo hopeful on cutting deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government action to reduce the public-sector borrowing requirement should
serve in turn to cut Britain's large current account deficit, Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said last night, Peter Norman
writes.
But in a speech to the Lombard Association in the City, Mr Portillo warned
that the current-account deficit, which was an estimated Pounds 10.9bn last
year, was unlikely to improve as rapidly as the PSBR, which the government
expects to fall close to zero during the next five years.
In the first public speech about the current account by a Treasury minister
in several years, Mr Portillo said that people 'should not automatically be
alarmed' about whether it is in surplus or deficit. As long as British
investment opportunities continued to look worthwhile, the current-account
deficit could be financed, he said.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Vacancies rise in Birmingham press
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of job vacancies advertised in the Birmingham press has risen by
33 per cent since the lowest point of recession in October 1992, but is
still 57 per cent below the peak demand for labour in 1990, Paul Cheeseright
writes.
Figures published yesterday by Birmingham City Council show the number of
permanent full-time jobs increased sharply over the last quarter. Previously
the strongest demand was for temporary labour.
The council reported there were 9,499 full-time job vacancies in the first
quarter, 33 per cent more than in the 1993 first quarter. The main demand
has come the engineering and construction industries and from public and
miscellaneous services.
'The increasing number of vacancies in manufacturing are the first warnings
of skill shortages ahead,' the council said.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Insurer 'sick and tired' of Lloyd's losses hindsight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The series of catastrophes such as the Piper Alpha disaster which led to
enormous losses by Lloyd's Names could never have been foreseen, a former
Gooda Walker underwriter told the High Court yesterday.
Mr Anthony Willard, an underwriter with syndicate 299, one of those which
insured the North Sea production platform, admitted that the level of
re-insurance he had arranged had proved to be inadequate. But he insisted
this could not have been appreciated then.
Giving evidence in the legal action brought by 3,095 loss-making Gooda
Walker Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the
market - Mr Willard said he was 'sick and tired' of people looking at the
reasons for Lloyd's losses with hindsight.
'Everyone talks from the supreme heights of hindsight. We were down in the
valley doing our jobs. In hindsight, Hitler should never have invaded Russia
or Poland. Had I known what was going to happen, I would have done things
differently,' he said.
The Gooda Names are seeking compensation of Pounds 629m from members agents
who placed them with four syndicates, including number 299, managed by the
Gooda Walker agency. They claim Mr Willard was guilty of bad underwriting
practice in failing to arrange sufficient re-insurance for the business of
syndicate 299, which specialised in marine insurance.
Mr Willard said he felt 'bitterly disappointed' at the size of the losses,
but insisted these were caused by the unforesee-ably large scale of
disasters in the late 1980s, not incompetence. He insisted that syndicate
299 had a generally cautious approach to its business and that he had been
careful to avoid conducting a disproportionate amount of excess-of-loss
business.
Mr Willard said that before the Piper Alpha disaster he had considered the
syndicate had enough re-insurance.
However, he had thought improvements in technology and weather forecasting
techniques would reduce the chances of large marine catastrophes in the most
likely disaster areas.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Fresh calls for Scott to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister for the disabled, was under pressure to
resign last night after he admitted ordering 'wrecking' amendments to the
disabled civil rights bill shortly before a Commons debate.
Mr Scott apologised to MPs last week for misleading the Commons by denying
that his department had helped draft amendments moved by Conservative MPs
which effectively killed the bill.
Senior ministers defended Mr Scott's continued presence in the government on
the grounds that he had not intended to mislead MPs - traditionally regarded
as a serious parliamentary offence.
But in a written answer to a parliamentary question from Mr Alf Morris,
Labour MP for Manchester Wythenshawe, Mr Scott admitted that he authorised
the drafting of amendments just 16 days before the bill was debated.
Mr Roger Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood, said the short interval showed that
it was 'inconceivable that this could be an oversight'.
Mr Berry said Mr John Major should sack Mr Scott if he refused to resign
immediately. 'Clearly he knew what he was doing, and he lied to the House,'
he said.
Pressure on Mr Scott appeared to have eased last week after Miss Betty
Boothroyd, the speaker, decided not to initiate an inquiry by the Commons
privileges committee.
The civil rights disablement bill would have required a big increase in
facilities for disabled people.
Meanwhile ministers were yesterday being pressed to reconsider the
disablement bill as Labour MPs pressed to bring the legislation before
parliament for the second time in a fortnight.
The bill, which would force companies to provide facilities for disabled
employees, was again the focus of angry scenes in the Commons after Labour
MPs claimed that the government was trying to ensure that it could not be
debated.
Ministers have opposed the private member's bill, arguing that it would cost
industry around Pounds 17bn in capital expenditure, with an additional
Pounds 1bn in annual running costs.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow energy minister, yesterday accused the government of
trying to wreck an opposition bill to improve energy conservation by tabling
hundreds of amendments.
He said ministers should provide government time to debate the bill, which
has wide cross-party support. 'If they do not, they will have proved that
they are hostile to the very idea of energy conservation,' he said.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Labour keeps lid on leadership race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday attempted to clamp down on speculation about the party
leadership by extending a ban on campaigning until after the European
parliament election on June 9.
The shadow cabinet gave unanimous endorsement to demands from Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the deputy leader, for a three-week moratorium on leadership
statements.
The moratorium is intended to stop speculation about the leadership
undermining Labour's campaign for the election, in which the party hopes to
win up to 15 extra seats.
But officials said there would be no sanctions against candidates who break
the rules except 'a great deal of criticism from their colleagues'.
The decision was announced as it emerged that Mr Gordon Brown, one of two
modernist contenders, will make a major speech to the Welsh Labour
conference on Sunday.
Mr Brown, the shadow chancellor, whose unofficial campaign has flagged in
the week since the death of John Smith, the former leader, will be free
under the rules to set out his view of Labour's future.
Labour MPs were sceptical about the prospects of a successful ban on
campaigning. Some said it would simply encourage arms-length electioneering
by supporters.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, who was to have addressed the Welsh
conference during its cancelled Saturday session, has declined an invitation
to speak on Sunday.
But he and the two other main contenders - Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and
industry secretary, and Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary - are
free to give interviews as long as they do not announce formally that they
are standing.
Mrs Beckett, a potential leftwing candidate, will be interviewed by Sir
David Frost on BBC television on Sunday.
The problems the party will face in keeping a lid on public campaigning were
underlined by claims that Mr Peter Mandelson, MP for Hartlepool and Labour's
former publicity director, had been campaigning for Mr Blair. The
allegation, levelled by Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer affairs minister
and a supporter of Mr Brown, was quickly withdrawn after protests from the
shadow chancellor's office.
John Smith will be buried on the Scottish island of Iona on Saturday after a
funeral tomorrow at the church in Edinburgh where he was a regular
worshipper.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Names allegations 'damaging to market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday said allegations by a group of loss-making Names
were 'objectionable and potentially damaging to the interests of the Lloyd's
market and members' and warned that it was 'considering appropriate forms of
redress'.
In a newspaper advertisement headlined 'How many more people have to die
before Lloyd's is brought to account?', the Wellington Names Association
said that 'at least 30 suicides and premature deaths have been attributed to
the losses sustained by Lloyd's Names'.
The association accused Lloyd's of failing to discharge its duties under the
Lloyd's Acts of 1871 and 1982 and called on the Names - the individuals
whose assets support the market - and Lloyd's policyholders to demand an
independent inquiry into Lloyd's losses. Lloyd's said it totally rejected
the allegations.
The market this week reported losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year,
bringing its cumulative losses since 1988 to about Pounds 7bn.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Managers claim an end to long lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days of senior managers lingering over long and liquid lunches are over,
it was claimed yesterday by a group set up by brewers to promote sensible
drinking.
A survey by the Portman Group said that six out of 10 senior managers
claimed they never touched alcohol during their working day.
Dr John Rae, chairman of the group, said: 'The days of the liquid business
lunch are gone. Today, deals are more likely to be clinched over a bottle of
mineral water.'
But an examination of the drinking habits of executives at some of the
City's most fashionable watering holes showed that, while customers may be
drinking less alcohol they are still enjoying a glass, or two.
At Le Pont de la Tour - one of the City's most fashionable restaurants  -
137 sober-suited executives yesterday drank 55 bottles of wine and 72
bottles of water at lunchtime.
It is a similar story elsewhere in the City. The Corney &amp; Barrow restaurant
in Cannon Street sold 1,253 litres of water last month. But its customers
still managed to consume more than 2,000 bottles of champagne and 6,000
bottles of wine - though this includes evening drinking.
Portman Group researchers felt health awareness, fierce competition as a
result of the recession and stricter drink-drive laws were factors in a
corporate-culture change.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Major pledges to stay on as leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has told close colleagues that he is determined to fight any
challenge to his leadership whatever the results of next month's European
elections.
His decision to ride out the expected Tory defeats in the June 9 poll was
taken two or three weeks before the death of John Smith, the Labour leader.
It was followed by the strong pledges of loyalty offered by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, at last
week's Scottish conference.
Mr Major's assurance that he will not resign has since been reinforced by
the radical shift in the political landscape caused by Mr Smith's death. It
ended a period in which colleagues had been uncertain how he would react to
further assaults on his leadership. In earlier conversations the prime
minister had left the impression that he might stand down.
Ministers now hope the fall in the political temperature at Westminster will
head off a disastrous performance in the European elections. Few expect the
party to hold anything like the 32 seats it won in 1989, but talk of a
collapse has subsided.
Private opinion polling commissioned by Conservative Central Office suggests
the party might hope for a share of the vote several points above the 28 per
cent it recorded in this month's local elections.
In spite of the party's bitter internal strife over Europe the polls also
suggest it remains more trusted by the voters than either Labour or the
Liberal Democrats to handle Britain's relations with the European Union.
That has strengthened the resolve of ministers to focus as much as possible
during the campaign on European issues.
The party's manifesto - emphasising the government's commitment to a
decentralised free-market Europe - will be launched by Mr Major on Monday.
The opposition parties are expected to set out their platforms on the same
day.

Mr John Major has told close colleagues that he is utterly determined to
fight any challenge to his leadership whatever the results of next month's
European elections. His decision to ride out the expected Tory defeat in the
June 9 poll was taken two or three weeks before the sudden death of John
Smith, the Labour leader. It was followed by the strong pledges of loyalty
offered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, at the party's Scottish conference in Inverness last
week.
Mr Major's assurance that he will not resign has since been reinforced by
the radical shift in the political landscape caused by Mr Smith's death. It
ended a period in which colleagues had been uncertain how he would react to
further assaults on his leadership. In earlier conversations the prime

Ministers now hope the fall in the political temperature at Westminster will
head off a disastrous performance in the European elections. Few expect the
party to hold anything like the 32 seats it won in 1989, but talk of a
collapse leaving it with less than a dozen seats has subsided.
Private opinion polling commissioned by Conservative Central Office suggests
the party might hope for a share of the vote several points above the 28 per
cent it recorded in this month's local elections.
In spite of the party's bitter internal strife over Europe the polls also
suggest it remains more trusted by the voters than either Labour or the
Liberal Democrats to handle Britain's relations with the European Union.
That has strengthened the resolve of ministers to focus as much as possible
during the campaign on European issues in the face of efforts by the
opposition to turn the election into a referendum on Mr Major's domestic
policies. The Tories' main concern is that its supporters will stage a
protest vote by staying at home.
The party's manifesto - emphasising the government's commitment to a
decentralised free-market Europe - will be launched by Mr Major next Monday.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats are expected to set out their platforms on
the same day.
But the formal truce in national campaigning which followed Mr Smith's death
will end on Saturday when Mr Hurd will set out the basic principles
underlying the government's approach.
Mr Hurd, who will also unveil the party's advertising slogan for the
campaign, is thought to have warned Euro-sceptic members of the cabinet not
to undercut the government's positive message.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Labour poll silence broken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's silence on leadership campaigning broke down yesterday as the
party's former publicity director was accused of campaigning for Mr Tony
Blair by a supporter of Mr Gordon Brown.
The allegation, levelled by Mr Nigel Griffiths, consumer affairs spokesman,
at Mr Peter Mandelson, MP for Hartlepool, was quickly withdrawn after
protests from Mr Brown's office.
Aides said Mr Brown was 'upset' by the allegation, which was not approved by
his office. 'Gordon is trying to act with some decorum about this,' a friend
said. 'He can't stop MPs talking about the contest, but no one is authorised
to speak on his behalf.'
Mr Mandelson, who ran Labour's press and communications office until the
1992 general election, said he would make no comment about the leadership
until after the funeral of John Smith tomorrow.
The row illustrates the growing problems which Mr Brown and Mr Blair will
face in maintaining their long-standing alliance as leaders of Labour's
'modernist' wing.
The two men are expected to address Labour's Welsh rally on Sunday, but
neither has decided whether to launch their candidacy then.
A poll of 70 Labour MPs by Tribune, the centre-left weekly newspaper,
suggested that support is growing for Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and
industry secretary.
There was less support for the two other potential candidates of the left,
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett,
deputy leader.
There is growing support among MPs for a wide slate of candidates which
would ensure a full debate on the issues facing the party.
However, some MPs said the results would be 'too unpredictable' since the
winner could be a candidate who failed to gather more than 50 per cent of
first preference votes.
In a sign of increasing tensions among MPs, a leaflet was being circulated
urging candidates not to announce their candidacy until after the European
elections on June 9.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Ministers plan Sinn Fein reply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers will meet later today to finalise the government's response
to the demand by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, for detailed
clarification of the Anglo-Irish declaration.
Amid pessimism in Whitehall about the prospects for an end to the violence
in Northern Ireland, it was clear last night that the government would go no
further than to restate the principles underlying last December's
declaration.
Ministers agreed that the response should not be open to charges that it was
obstructing genuine peace overtures from Sinn Fein.
Downing Street is also anxious to avoid a serious rift with Dublin in spite
of irritation at comments in the US earlier this week by Mr Albert Reynolds,
the Irish prime minister.
Good relations with Dublin are vital if, after next month's European
elections, the government is to relaunch its efforts to secure a political
settlement in Northern Ireland and a successor to the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement.
But ministers agreed that the government could not be seen to be 'sitting an
examination paper' set by the IRA. Mr Major believes the government cannot
pre-empt any decisions or agreements reached in discussions with the
province's constitutional parties, which would give Sinn Fein an advantage
while the IRA continues its campaign of violence.
In spite of Mr Reynolds' apparent hopes that Mr Gerry Adams still wants an
end to the conflict, British ministers are sceptical about the Sinn Fein
president's intentions.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Labour promises help to rescue CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, CHARLES BATCHELOR and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday offered the government a way to rescue the Pounds 2bn
CrossRail scheme for a tunnel under central London but at a cost of at least
an extra Pounds 100m.
The scheme for a main-line rail link between Liverpool Street and Paddington
was blocked by a committee of four MPs under the obscure private bill
procedure.
Two of the MPs - Labour's Mr John Marek and Mr Ken Purchase - voted against
the bill mainly because it did not include connections to the proposed
Heathrow Express line west of London and the Channel tunnel high speed line.
The two MPs would have supported an amendment adding the connections to the
bill, but the committee was advised that such a change would not be legal.
Further legal advice obtained by Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport
secretary, suggests such an amendment would be binding if the bill went back
to the committee.
The committee could reconsider the bill only if asked to do so by the full
House of Commons - which would require the support of the government.
In behind-the-scenes discussions, Mr Dobson has promised Labour support for
such a motion to Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary.
'It is up to the government now to make sure that the committee is
reconvened,' Mr Dobson said.
Mr MacGregor is a strong supporter of CrossRail, as is Mr John Major, the
prime minister, who intervened to overall an earlier treasury attempt to
block the scheme.
But the terms of Labour's offer mean that the committee would only approve
the bill if the government agrees to finance the two extensions.
The Treasury is unlikely to regard such a prospect with enthusiasm. Mr
Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, has made clear his view that even the
cheaper scheme blocked by the committee would not have been economically
viable.
The government has held urgent discussions about the future of the project
with the promoters, British Rail, Railtrack and London Underground.
Ministers are also under strong pressure to rescue the scheme from London
and Home Counties Conservative MPs, led by Mr David Lidington, MP for
Aylesbury.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin, is preparing to join one of the five
consortia bidding to build the Channel tunnel high-speed rail link from
London to Folkestone, Paul Betts writes.
He said yesterday he had been approached by all five consortia and would
'definitely' join one within the next four weeks.
The winning consortium, to be selected next year, will run the British end
of the joint venture with the French railway SNCF and the Belgian railway
SNCB. They will operate Eurostar train services from London to Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam through the tunnel.
The five competing groups include consortia led by Hambros, GEC, Warburg,
Salomon Brothers and Mowlem.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Accounts body in disclosure campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board is considering lobbying the government and
the Stock Exchange to try to force greater disclosure of directors' share
options.
The action follows a legal opinion that has scuppered attempts by the board
 -which sets accounting standards - to introduce compulsory additional
information on directors' remuneration.
The board's urgent-issues taskforce yesterday unveiled a diluted set of
voluntary guidelines for companies to highlight the number and value of
share options granted to directors.
It began considering the topic last year at the suggestion of a number of
auditing firms following recommendations for greater disclosure in the
Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance.
It was planning to introduce a standard with which all companies would have
to comply. This comes as similar tough measures are being debated by the US
Financial Accounting Standards Board.
However, a recent legal opinion obtained by the board said that the wording
of existing legislation does not require additional disclosure unless there
is certainty over the value of the options.
Members of the taskforce are now debating whether to put pressure on the
Department of Trade and Industry to modify the law.
It may also suggest to the Stock Exchange modification of listing
requirements to boost disclosure.
The taskforce suggests disclosure of the prices that apply to directors'
options overall and to individual directors, together with market price
information at the year-end and at the date of exercise of the options.
A separate abstract published yesterday clarifies the treatment of benefits
used as incentives to encourage companies to sign leases - known as reverse
premiums.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Sell-off offers delivery from market pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office is a business suffering because of modernity. It delivers
pieces of paper and handles cash payments: services that have moved to the
rear in the world of communications.
Pensions can now be paid directly to bank accounts and bills paid by direct
debit. Conversations can be held on the telephone, and documents sent via
fax machines.
The Post Office has benefited from the growing demand for communication but
it has also come under increasing pressure to provide quicker, more flexible
and wider services. Its share of the UK communications market is between
just 14 per cent and 16 per cent in 1992-93.
For these reasons the Post Office management insists that it needs greater
commercial freedom to compete and, by implication, that it must be
privatised. Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, said yesterday: 'It's the
only show in town; we have got to get cracking with it.'
At the heart of its concerns lies Royal Mail, the source of more than 75 per
cent of its business and nearly all of its profits. The volume of mail
handled by Royal Mail has never stopped growing but its make-up has changed
significantly.
The growth in standard mail posted by individual consumers and small
businesses has ceased, with the business only just breaking even in recent
years.
The area of rapid growth and high profitability has been bulk commercial
pre-sorted mail. This business now accounts for a third of Royal Mail's
revenue and took its overall pre-tax profits to Pounds 252m last year.
The rub, says the Post Office, is the ease with which its competitors have
been moving into this lucrative market.
Although the Post Office holds a protected monopoly on the delivery of items
that cost less than Pounds 1 to deliver, it is not in a position to assert a
monopoly on pre-sorting.
With the planned privatisation of many European post offices, foreign
competition is becoming more aggressive and customised mailing services for
large companies and publishers a prime target.
The Dutch post office, which has set up sales offices in the UK, is offering
to take companies' bulk mailings in computerised form, and print, package
and accelerate their delivery to companies' own address lists - or even
supply address lists of target groups, take the text of a mailing and do the
rest.
This type of service has required link-ups with other private companies in
areas such as printing, freighting and direct marketing.
The Post Office is keen to set up similar joint ventures in order to
compete. But this has been repeatedly refused by the government.
Mr Heron says privatisation could enable the corporation to become 'the
European post hub'.
He hopes to attract the business of big companies from around the world that
want to distribute bulk mail, deliveries of magazines and direct advertising
to Europe. 'The opportunities for the UK Post Office are enormous,' he said.
The corporation is also considering leasing some or all of the 16 trains it
owns, the distribution of newspapers and the handling of private mail and
parcels, with potential savings of tens of millions of pounds.
Public-sector restrictions on private partnerships has also affected
Parcelforce, which has suffered fierce competition in the parcel delivery
market. Although its pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.1m in 1992-93 was down
sharply from a Pounds 24m loss the previous year, the Post Office is keen to
gain control of its investment budget.
Meanwhile, the debate over Post Office Counters has focused on its own
problems of declining business.
The government recently announced measures to make it more attractive for
pensioners to receive their pensions through the post offices, reversing
last year's move towards encouraging the payment of pensions directly to
pensioners' bank accounts. Pension payments account for 12 per cent of
counter business.
The Post Office only owns and runs 850 of the country's nearly 20,000 post
offices. Some 18,300 are sub-post offices, run as private businesses under
contract to the Post Office.
However, payments to sub-post offices are heavily skewed towards the
smallest businesses, generating subsidies to some 10,000 post offices of
between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a year. It is this element of maintaining
rural post offices, which rely on subsidy from urban post offices as well as
from the national Post Office, which has prompted the greatest resistance to
change.
The Post Office argues that it is not their status that needs changing, but
the restraints on the products they can trade.
To maintain or increase their turnover sufficiently to ensure survival, the
Post Office would like to introduce additional services, such as ticket
sales and financial services.
The Treasury opposes giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom while
it is in the public sector, arguing that taxpayers' funds should not be
exposed to the commercial risk inherent in diversification.
Decisions on investment and joint ventures have also been made with an eye
on the burgeoning public sector borrowing requirement, with the Post Office
contributing Pounds 181m to Treasury coffers in 1993-94, and a planned
Pounds 226m in 1994-95.
The plan before the cabinet today amounts to privatisation of Royal Mail and
Parcelforce, which would give the Post Office the greater commercial freedom
it seeks, allowing it joint ventures and control over its investment
programme.
The alternative to change, argues the Post Office, would have been declining
businesses, with large overheads, that would have had to charge higher
prices.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Doctors warn of disputes over pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service will face 'unseemly and divisive' local disputes
if proposals to introduce performance-related pay are implemented, the
British Medical Association warned the government yesterday.
Ministers want the NHS to begin moving from central to local pay
determination this year. Following a series of preliminary meetings with
Department of Health officials, the BMA yesterday expressed 'profound
objections' to doctors' national terms and conditions being changed.
BMA leaders say they have been told that, from next April, the Doctors and
Dentists Review Body will recommend only 'exceptionally modest' national
increases, leaving local NHS trusts to award any further rises under
performance related pay schemes.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the BMA council, warned in a letter to Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday that the degree of control
such schemes offered managers would introduce a dangerous principle to the
medical field.
Hospital consultants' first duty was to their patients, but there was a risk
of performance related pay forcing them to comply with a trust's business
needs.
The BMA has told Mrs Bottomley that it is willing to discuss alternative
remuneration structures for doctors, but it objects to being faced with a
'single dogmatic solution'.
The 1991 NHS reforms heralded a move from central pay determination. Many
doctors believe that the existence of national pay and conditions is an
important element in ensuring consistent standards of care across the
country.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Post Office raises fees for handling DSS payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office increased the charges it levies on the National Insurance
Fund for paying social security benefits by 57 per cent in 1992-93, a
committee of MPs heard yesterday.
Sir Michael Partridge, permanent secretary at the Department of Social
Security, told the Commons public accounts committee that Post Office
charges rose from Pounds 131m in 1991-92 to Pounds 206m in 1992-93. The
amount of benefits paid rose by just 6 per cent.
The charges are calculated by allocating a share of the Post Office's
expenses to the National Insurance Fund. This means that the fund's costs
rise when the amount the Post Office has to pay to the Treasury rises or if
the Post Office loses other business.
Charges made by the Inland Revenue for collecting national insurance
contributions also rose steeply, from Pounds 69.9m to Pounds 113.7m. The 63
per cent increase was largely as a result of 'a revised method of costing',
according to the Inland Revenue.
The charge for paying benefits through post offices is negotiated annually
between the Post Office and the Benefits Agency, the agency responsible for
almost all social security benefits.
Sir Michael said the charge reflects the amount of work done for the agency
but also the amount of other business the post offices handle. 'They add up
their costs and share them out among the customers,' he said.
Mr John Horam, a Conservative member of the committee, asked Sir Michael if
this meant higher charges if other types of Post Office business declined.
'That is so,' said Sir Michael. 'If their costs haven't fallen, they will
apportion more to us.'
Negotiating the contract was always a sensitive matter that went up to
ministers for final approval, Sir Michael added. Exchanges often went on for
the whole year before reaching a conclusion.
Sir Michael also expressed concern over the increase in the charges made by
the Inland Revenue for collecting National Insurance Contributions. He told
the committee that he had been unable to find out why the Inland Revenue's
costs had risen.

A move to change the car registration plate format, with its annual prefix
letter, is being launched by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
The current system, which will see the introduction of M-prefixed plates on
August 1, continues to create problems for motor traders and car makers
because of the huge sales bulge it causes in August, Mr Peter Ward, the
society's new president who is chairman and chief executive of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, said yesterday.
August accounts for nearly a quarter of the year's total sales, but Mr Ward
said the month had a depressing effect on sales as early as May.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Reynolds set to meet Major
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish Republic, is expected to
meet Mr John Major during a private visit to the UK next week. Sinn Fe'in's
response to the Downing Street declaration is likely to be at the top of the
agenda.
Senior UK ministers will meet later today to finalise the government's
response to the demand by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, for detailed
clarification of the Anglo-Irish declaration.
Amid pessimism in Whitehall about the prospects for an end to the violence
in Northern Ireland, it was clear last night that the government would go no
further than to restate the declaration's underlying principles. Ministers
agreed that the government could not be seen to be 'sitting an examination
paper' set by the IRA.

The government is objecting to the European Commission's planned budget for
the new Socrates educational exchange programme, due to be introduced under
the Maastricht treaty on January 1.
Mr Tim Boswell, the education minister responsible for international
relations, yesterday told the Commons committee on European legislation that
the commission aimed to spend Ecu1bn (Pounds 0.77bn) on the programme during
the next five years.
'The aims proposed for Socrates are important ones, but they are also, quite
rightly, modest and achievable ones,' he said. 'That is why the government
believes that the commission's proposed funding requirement is too high.'

<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, is to accept an invitation to
appear before a Commons committee investigating the link between arms sales
to Malaysia and aid for the Pergau dam, James Blitz writes.
Staff at Lady Thatcher's office said yesterday that she would announce her
acceptance of the invitation from the foreign affairs committee later this
week. She will be the first former prime minister to give evidence to a
parliamentary select committee.
As a member of the Lords, Lady Thatcher is not legally bound to appear. MPs
believe, however, that she can throw light on attempts to link an offer of
Pounds 234m of aid to Malaysia and defence equipment sales of Pounds 1bn.
Such a link is contrary to government guidelines on aid and trade.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Forestry Commission sale may be doomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is poised to abandon plans to privatise the Forestry
Commission after officials recommended earlier this week that its management
and accounting techniques were too inefficient for a sell-off.
Ministers met on Tuesday to examine whether the commission, which manages
1.1m hectares of Britain's forests, could be sold to the private sector.
The ministerial committee on industrial, commercial and consumer affairs
studied a report by the Forestry Review Group which examined options for the
organisation's future.
Although they took no final decision, it is understood that they rejected
privatising the commission because of what one official called 'a lack of
business efficiency in the organisation'.
In particular the report by the review group said that the commission had
old-fashioned practices which needed to be exposed to modern management and
accounting techniques before it could be sold.
Treasury officials have argued strongly for the commission to be privatised
in an attempt to hold down public expenditure.
A senior Whitehall official did not rule out yesterday that Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, could press again for that
option.
But it is understood that the Treasury's arguments have been undermined by
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, a rightwing backer of the free market.
Officials said he argued at the meeting for management changes to be
introduced before a sell-off.
Late last year three former top executives at the commission argued that
privatisation would produce a meagre sum and reduced income for the state.
They argued that only Pounds 500m might be raised in a sale, compared with a
1992 book value of Pounds 1.7bn. Those funds could be further eroded because
of the loss of revenue from timber sales.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Farmers criticise curbs on nitrate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans for compulsory restrictions to control nitrate pollution in
drinking water have been criticised by farmers' leaders.
A consultation paper yesterday proposed stricter controls on manure and
fertiliser use in 72 areas, particularly affecting livestock farmers in the
Midlands, the north-east and East Anglia. The Department of the Environment
also announced tighter sewage treatment controls in 33 urban and 58 coastal
areas of England and Wales under the 1991 European urban waste-water
treatment directive.
The 72 nitrate-vulnerable zones, due to take effect by the end of 1999, are
to comply with the European Commission's nitrate directive, which calls for
compulsory action in areas where nitrate in drinking water sources exceeds
50mg per litre at any one time.
Farmers and landowners criticised the 50mg level as too strict and pointed
out that the British government and the World Health Organisation had also
questioned the limit.
Mr Tony Pexton, National Farmers' Union vice president, said: 'We fully
accept that nitrate leaching must be addressed . . . but we can only be
expected to act on a sound scientific footing.'
The Country Landowners' Association said farmers should be compensated if
they had to take measures 'beyond sound husbandry and management'. A code of
good agricultural practice was established by the government in 1991.
The new controls would affect 1.6m acres - about 6 per cent of agricultural
land in England and Wales. About 25,000 acres are already designated
nitrate-sensitive areas where farmers voluntarily enforce even stricter
measures than envisaged for nitrate-vulnerable zones and are compensated for
this.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Pressure mounts for bill on disabled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers were yesterday under mounting pressure to reconsider a bill that
would outlaw discrimination against the disabled as Labour MPs pressed to
bring the legislation before parliament for the second time in a fortnight.
The bill, which would force companies to provide facilities for disabled
employees, was again the focus of angry scenes in the Commons after Labour
MPs claimed that the government was trying to ensure that it could not be
debated.
Ministers have opposed the private member's bill, arguing that it would cost
industry around Pounds 17bn in capital expenditure, with an additional
Pounds 1bn in annual running costs.
However, Labour and Tory MPs said yesterday that there was clear public
backing for the reforms after disabled groups held a vivid demonstration
outside parliament.
Disabled people threw themselves from their wheelchairs into the road and
handcuffed themselves to buses in an angry anti-government protest that
blocked Whitehall.
The civil rights (disabled persons) bill ran out of parliamentary time when
it was first presented to the Commons 10 days ago, after more than 80
amendments had been tabled by Tory backbenchers.
Last week, Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, admitted that he
had misled the Commons by claiming that the government had played no part in
framing those amendments. He has since resisted calls from Labour for his
resignation.
The bill is now due to be considered on Friday. But Labour MPs said
yesterday that a 'stack of amendments' had been tabled to the three
preceding bills to ensure that there would be no time to debate the civil
rights plan.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Accounts body presses ahead on disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board is considering lobbying the government and
the Stock Exchange in efforts to force greater disclosure of directors'
share options.
The action follows a legal opinion which has scuppered attempts by the board
 -which sets accounting standards - to introduce compulsory additional
information on remuneration.
The board's urgent-issues taskforce yesterday unveiled a diluted set of
voluntary guidelines for companies to highlight the number and value of
share options granted to directors.
It began considering the topic last year at the suggestion of a number of
auditing firms following recommendations for greater disclosure in the
Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance.
It was planning to introduce a standard with which all companies would have
to comply. This comes as similar tough measures are being debated by the US
Financial Accounting Standards Board.
However, a recent legal opinion obtained by the board said that the wording
of existing legislation does not require additional disclosure unless there
is certainty over the value of the options.
Members of the taskforce are now debating whether to put pressure on the
Department of Trade and Industry to modify the law to force greater
disclosure as part of its review of companies legislation.
They are also considering suggesting to the Stock Exchange that it modifies
the listing requirements for quoted companies in order to boost disclosure.
The taskforce suggests disclosure of the prices that apply to directors'
options overall and to individual directors, together with market price
information at the year-end and at the date of exercise of the options.
A separate abstract published yesterday clarifies the treatment of benefits
used as incentives to encourage companies to sign leases - known as reverse
premiums.
It proposes that these should be spread on a straight-line basis - by the
same amount each year - over the term of the lease, or over the period to
when the rent is first adjusted.
The ruling follows heavy losses reported by Pentos, the speciality retailer,
last year. In the previous year it had included reverse premiums in profits
of Pounds 6.3m. Without these it would have reported losses.
In a third abstract, the taskforce proposes that when a debt instrument
includes a call option that can be exercised only by the issuer, the payment
required on exercise of the option should not form part of the instrument's
finance costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson is preparing to join one of the five consortia bidding to
build the Channel tunnel high-speed rail link from London to Folkestone.
He said yesterday he had been approached by all five consortia and would
'definitely' join one within the next four weeks.
The winning consortium, to be selected next year, will run the British end
of the joint venture with the French railway, SNCF, and the Belgian railway,
SNCB. They will operate Eurostar train services from London to Paris,
Brussels and Amsterdam through the Channel tunnel.
The five competing groups include consortia led by Hambros, GEC, Warburg,
Salomon Brothers and Mowlem.
Mr Branson said he saw 'big opportunities' for his Virgin group in operating
rail routes to compete against short-haul European airline services.
There were more promising opportunities for Virgin to expand in the European
rail business than in the European airline sector. Speaking during his
airline's inaugural flight from London to San Francisco, Mr Branson said
Virgin's presence in the European rail market would complement Virgin
Atlantic's long-haul airline business.
'Our idea is to be basically in the long-distance airline industry and in
railway in Europe,' he said.
His investment in the hotel being developed on the site of London's former
County Hall building, near Waterloo station, was also tied to his ambition
to enter the Channel tunnel rail business. 'County Hall is next to the new
Channel tunnel terminal and would make an ideal base for our long-distance
air travellers before connecting into the new Eurostar network,' he said.
Mr Branson confirmed Virgin's intention to expand long-distance operations
with services to Washington DC, Johannesburg, Singapore and Sydney.
Virgin Travel Group, the airline's parent company, would show a small
pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m-Pounds 3m on turnover of Pounds 405m in 1993,
the company said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malawi's President Hastings Kamuzu Banda and his party last night appeared
to be trailing well behind his opponents as unofficial results came in from
the country's first multi-party elections on Tuesday, Reuter reports from
Blantyre.
Official results are not expected until today, largely because of delays in
counting ballot papers but the opposition United Democratic Front, a
grouping of former Banda aides expelled from his ruling Malawi Congress
Party, claimed victory in the parliamentary polls.
'I think it is time the MCP conceded defeat,' UDF secretary-general Harry
Thomson told a news conference.
He said ballot counts by the UDF showed the party had captured 69 of the 177
contested parliamentary seats, the MCP 52 and another opposition party, the
Alliance for Democracy (Aford) 34. State radio gave the UDF 56 seats, Aford
32 and the MCP 25. In the presidential poll, the radio said UDF leader
Bakili Muluzi had 961,980 votes, President Banda 418,222 and Aford leader
Chakufwa Chihana 436,860.
Mr Thomson said Mr Muluzi was confident of unseating Mr Banda in the
presidential poll but would not make any announcement until he had obtained
official results.
'Barring some miracle, he is out,' a veteran African diplomat said.
President Banda led the nation to independence from Britain in 1964 and ran
a harsh regime for 30 years. He is now in his 90s and unwell since
undergoing brain surgery last year. His grip on power began to slip two
years ago under mounting pressure from the west and internal dissent over
his human rights record.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Rival Yemenis pour forces into battle for military base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy artillery thundered through the key military base of al-Anad on the
road to Aden yesterday in the biggest battle between Yemen's rival armies
since civil war erupted two weeks ago, Reuter reports.
Rocket and tank fire added to the deafening noise of battle inside the
sprawling 10km by 5km army and air force base where troops of south and
north fought desperately to drive out their foe.
The base, 60km from Aden, governs the northern approaches to the city,
bastion of the southern leaders. Its capture would give the northern forces
a springboard from which to attack the port city.
Reporters based in Sanaa and Aden went inside its perimeter to try to verify
rival claims about who controls the base.
They saw only a small part of the huge encampment, but heard heavy gunfire
and saw evidence of some savage fighting inside and outside al-Anad.
One Reuter correspondent who entered the base from Aden in the south
yesterday said southern troops loyal to Vice-President Ali Salem al-Baidh
appeared to control most of the terrain.
At about the same time other reporters from Sanaa, the capital and
stronghold of northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh, saw northern troops
backed by heavy armour were well inside the base and said they were
tightening their grip despite stiff resistance.
Southern aircraft flew at high altitude overhead but did not appear to drop
any bombs and a northern army officer said they were apparently directing
southern artillery fire.
Northern commanders said the bloody pitched battle to enter the base started
on Monday.
One officer said: 'The troops of the mutineers (southern leaders) put up
bloody initial resistance.' Another estimated the southern troops in the
base at 10,000 but would give no figure for his northern forces.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new minority government is to delay until the end of the year an
estimated Y460bn (Pounds 2.9bn) worth of public sector price rises.
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision comes in response to intense
corporate criticism of increases in charges for a range of services, from
motorway tolls to telephone bills. They were put forward by several
government ministries during the political confusion of recent months in an
attempt to compensate for the decline in tax revenues caused by the
recession.
However, the Nikkeiren employers' federation had complained that the price
rises would be a blow to consumer confidence, which is struggling to recover
from the longest economic downturn since the second world war. Mr Takeshi
Nagano, the Nikkeiren's president, said yesterday he was 'glad for the sake
of the nation' that the government had changed its mind.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the chief cabinet secretary, said the freeze would only
apply to prices rises not already implemented, including telephone bills,
public housing rents, taxi fares, national motorway tolls and fire insurance
premiums. The government had not yet calculated the economic impact, but
expected consumer sentiment to benefit, he said.
Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at Morgan Stanley's Tokyo office,
estimated yesterday that Y460bn worth of charges would be frozen and that
Y1,841bn of price rises - including alcohol tax and postage stamps among
other things - had already taken effect or gone too far to be reversed.
If fully implemented, the price increases would have been worth Y2,301bn
net. This would have wiped out 40 per cent of the Y5,850bn tax rebate agreed
by the former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa in February.
'This shows how too much reliance on the bureaucracy can produce proposals
that are not politically viable,' said Ms Sasaki-Smith.
Clearly, the price freeze will improve the cabinet's weak popularity score,
42.4 per cent according to a poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic
newspaper yesterday.
The increases were hard for the public to accept when consumer prices are
rising by a mere 0.8 per cent annually and wholesale prices falling by 3 per
cent. Ironically, the last time the government froze public sector prices
was in 1974, in an attempt to curb inflation.
The price rises were believed to have the blessing of the powerful finance
ministry, keen to prevent an erosion of its revenues when a divided
coalition is unable to agree on ministry-inspired plans for a rise in
consumption tax.
According to finance ministry projections, the government must cut spending
by more than Y7,000bn annually in the three years from 1995, if it is to
keep expenditure in line with revenues and avoid 'excessive' dependence on
bonds. By that, the ministry means it wants to reduce bond revenues as a
proportion of total government income from the present seven-year high of
18.7 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade.
Separately, parliament yesterday agreed a second stop-gap budget for the
coming year, worth Y10,890bn and covering the period until the end of the
parliamentary session on June 29. The first provisional budget, which
expires tomorrow, was needed because the collapse of the Hosokawa government
last month has delayed the full-year budget, due to have come into effect on
April 1.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Israeli spending irregularities alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's state comptroller yesterday detailed serious allegations of
irregularities in government expenditure and appointments, and advised that
legal action be considered against some government officials.
In her annual report, Ms Miriam Ben-Porat singled out the Housing Ministry
for criticism of inefficiency, political allocation of resources, political
appointments and the continuation of building projects in the occupied
territories despite a government decision in November 1992 to freeze
construction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The report for the year 1993 also criticised the way money was transferred
to religious institutions by the Religious Affairs Ministry; the excessive
protection of agricultural products by the Ministry of Trade and Industry;
waste and inefficiency in Israel's Moscow embassy; the government's
attempted sale last year of Bank Mizrahi; and the lack of competition in
water supply.
'In view of the suspicions of criminal offences in my report, I will pass my
findings on to the attorney general,' Ms Ben-Porat said. On agriculture, she
said excessive government protection by import quotas and taxes prevents
competition, entrenches monopolies, stimulates inefficiency and increases
prices.
In the section on housing, the state comptroller said 'grave findings'
included the ministry's failure to prevent the continuation of five
construction projects in the occupied territories; serious under-performance
in meeting a target to build 23,000 apartments; and allocation of resources
in favour of Labour councils and discrimination against local government
headed by the right-wing Likud opposition.
The Housing Ministry is also under attack in Israel for failing to take
measures to reduce housing prices - the main component of rising inflation
which is undermining the government's economic policies. Mr Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, minister of housing, said yesterday the report was distorted.
'I won't resign,' he said. 'I am proud of my achievements. The government is
not corrupt.'
Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud party, said the government should
resign 'in view of its failure to keep up its promises to the voters to
abolish corruption'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Middle East has a long way to go before it can expect peaceful
co-existence between Arab and Jew.
Israeli soldiers, trying to complete their military withdrawal from the Gaza
Strip yesterday, spent the last minutes of occupation battling angry
stone-throwing youths. Even as the last military convoy of jeeps sped out of
Gaza City youths lobbed bottles and stones at the Israelis and taunted them
with insults.
The farewell clashes were an important reminder of the violence and
hostility which still characterises Arab-Israeli relations. Palestinian and
Israeli leaders may have signed an interim peace accord but decades of
hatred and suspicion on both sides will take years to overcome.
Although the 14-day transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho has gone smoothly
potential violent flash points are everywhere, particularly in the rest of
the West Bank which will not come under Palestinian control until elections
are held.
There has been tit-for-tat violence in Hebron and in Jericho armed Jewish
religious students threaten conflict with the new Palestinian security
forces by refusing to surrender their weapons or enter the synagogue
unarmed.
The potential for continuing violence remains high because of the very
limited way in which the interim peace agreement meets Palestinian
aspirations. The bulk of Palestinian demands - removal of Jewish settlements
on Arab lands, the right to establish a state, the right of return of all
refugees and, at the least, shared control of Jerusalem - have all been
shelved to a later date.
So long as the 125,000 Jewish settlers, protected by Israeli soldiers,
remain untouched in Gaza and the West Bank extremist groups preaching and
practicing violence will continue to flourish.
'The settlements are a time-bomb in the peace process,' said Mrs Hanan
Ashrawi, a Palestinian leader. 'Expecting Palestinians to live next to
settlers who are illegally occupying their land is like putting a flame next
to dynamite.'
Religious and secular Palestinian factions opposed to the peace process have
vowed to continue their struggle against Israel until, as a minimum, the
Jewish state withdraws behind the 'Green Line' - the disputed border before
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Hamas, a disciplined and well organised underground movement responsible for
the most devastating recent attacks, wants to go further and wage a
religious war against the Jews until all of the land of Palestine is
liberated under Islamic rule.
'Violence will continue so long as occupation and stealing of Palestinian
land remains,' said Dr Omar Farwana, a Gaza City Hamas sympathiser.
'Resistance and struggle will go on until the last day of the liberation of
Palestine. Anybody saying something else is lying. All Palestinians feel the
coming days will see more intense and violent struggle against the settlers
and the soldiers because we think the main reason why Israeli soldiers left
Gaza was our resistance.'
The ability of Palestinian extremists to continue violent attacks against
Israel will depend on how the incoming Palestinian security forces deal with
the extremists. The PLO have said they intend to disarm the factions and
confiscate up to 20,000 weapons in Gaza alone.
Yesterday the ten factions opposed to the peace accord warned such a move
might provoke an internal Palestinian civil war. 'If the Palestinian police
try to disarm our people they will be subjecting themselves to grave
dangers,' said Mr Abu Mohammed Mustafa, a Hamas spokesman in Damascus. 'Our
men. . . will kill anyone who tries to deprive us of the right to confront
the enemy.'
Israel hopes that trust may grow between Arab and Jew during an interim
period of Palestinian self-rule. But Palestinians say until Arab grievances
such as settlements and Jerusalem are resolved the Middle East will remain a
region of violence.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Progress seen in Golan talks: Christopher ends second
shuttle in two weeks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, wound up his second Middle
East shuttle in two weeks yesterday with US officials reporting clear
resolve from both Israel and Syria to negotiate away differences over the
Golan Heights, but stressing again that while there had been progress, there
remained long discussions ahead.
Mr Joubran Kourieh, Syrian spokesman, said President Hafez al-Assad had
reiterated that a settlement had to be based on UN resolutions calling for
total Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands.
'President Assad was briefed by Mr Christopher on the outcome of his talks
in Israel which showed the differences were still big because Israel's
position was still far from the basis and requirements of the peace process
which began in Madrid,' Mr Kourieh added.
Mr Christopher and his entourage kept the secretary of state's pledge on
arriving in the region four days ago that observers would be 'disappointed'
by what he could reveal of the content of his meetings. This silence is
taken in Damascus as a clear sign of the substantive nature of his proxy
negotiations between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and
President Assad with whom Mr Christopher held a further four hours of talks
yesterday.
Syrian officials said only that the two sides are now talking about 'core
issues' of a peace agreement.
Mr Christopher is understood to have exchanged what one diplomat described
as 'very, very detailed position papers on both sides.' Mr Christopher's
central task is to bridge the differences between Israel, which has so far
offered a phased and partial withdrawal from the Golan over five to eight
years, and Syria, which wants nothing less than a full withdrawal over a
'reasonable' timetable.
Diplomats in Damascus say Mr Assad would accept withdrawal over a maximum of
three years, but only after an initial pledge from Israel of Syrian
sovereignty over the whole area occupied in 1967.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Millions lost in securities affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The closure of an obscure investment company in the Philippines after some
of its staff absconded with investor funds estimated at up to 900m pesos
(Pounds 22m) has shaken the local banking community.
Securities traders at Bancapital Development Corp, owned by a group of
little-known investors in Manila and trading on the secondary market,
apparently persuaded several financial institutions to buy government bonds
through the investment company, but no actual delivery of the corresponding
certificates were made. The traders are now missing, thought to have fled
the country.
Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, yesterday identified one
commercial bank in a rare statement about the scandal. Bank of Commerce, a
medium-sized bank in which Bank of Boston has a minority stake, had sought
emergency loans of 1bn pesos to cope with a run on deposits, he said. It and
another bank he refused to identify had lost some 559m pesos worth of
investments in Bancapital.
The admission of the affair - and the resulting wave of withdrawals - was
prompted by news yesterday that a Bank of Commerce senior executive had
apparently committed suicide. Officials said the bank had been under quiet
investigation for its losses.
Mr Singson said assistance would be given to all banks that wanted it. The
Bankers Association of the Philippines, which groups all the domestic
private commercial banks, has also promised help for members to ensure that
the banking system 'remains stable.'
The runs on banks yesterday appeared limited only to a few suspected of
having placed investments in Bancapital.
The central bank investigation has so far been limited to banks that
invested funds in Bancapital. The investment company itself was not under
investigation because it was a 'non-accredited' institution, that is not
licensed to trade in securities.
This is the second big financial scandal in Manila this year. In January, a
Chinese-Filipino businessman disappeared with unpaid debts to both banks and
informal lenders in Manila's Chinatown of some 200m pesos.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Power investors near deals in India

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's bid to attract private investment into the power industry is about
to bear fruit with promoters of four projects together worth about Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) close to signing financing agreements.
Mr N. Ramji, joint secretary in the power ministry, said yesterday financing
deals could be signed in the next 'one or two months' for the schemes, which
could produce about 1520MW of electricity.
The projects are the most advanced of a total of 75 schemes in which private
investors, including foreign groups, have expressed interest. India opened
the industry to new private investment in 1992 as part of its economic
liberalisation programme.
Commercial negotiations have been complex because the government is
permitting investment, principally in power generation and not, generally,
in distribution which remains in the hands of 17 state-level electricity
boards. Operating under the influence of local politicians, state
electricity boards have been notorious for under-charging
politically-favoured groups and not paying their bills.
Potential investors have pressed central government for guarantees of
payment in the event of a default by an electricity board. Delhi has
reluctantly agreed to guarantee payment in the event of default by either
the electricity board or the relevant state government.
The first project to get the guarantee is a 695MW plant to be built in the
western state of Maharashtra by Enron, a US energy group, General Electric
of the US, which will supply equipment, and local partners. Enron originally
planned a Dollars 3bn 2000MW plant but has divided the project into stages.
The other companies expected to complete financing arrangements soon are GVK
Industries, an Indian mini-conglomerate, and ABB, the European engineering
combine, which plan a 235MW station in the central state of Andhra Pradesh;
Spectrum Power Generation of the US which plans a 200MW station also in
Andhra Pradesh; and AES, a US generating group, which wants to build a 420MW
coal-based station in Orissa state.
Mr Ramji said three other investor groups had also secured government
approval - Ashok Leyland, a diversified company controlled by the
London-based Hinduja trading family, and National Power of the UK, which
plan a 1,000MW station in Andra Pradesh; Cogentrix of the US with a 1,000MW
project in Haryana, near Delhi, and ST Power Systems and CMS of the US which
have proposed a 750MW station in Tamil Nadu.
In addition, the few existing Indian private generating companies permitted
to operate before liberalisation are expanding their combined capacity from
about 2,850MW to 4,200MW. Welcome as these investments are for power-short
India, they will not close the gap between supply and demand immediately.

FT  19 MAY 94 / S Africa's development plan costs soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African government yesterday admitted that its planned
reconstruction and development programme will cost more than R80bn (Pounds
14.6bn) over five years, more than twice its pre-election estimate of R39bn.
The increased costs will put a severe strain on the country's financial
resources and could increase inflation, reversing the recent trend toward
lower price rises. Inflation fell sharply under the previous government, to
below 10 per cent annually.
However, the political pressure on the ANC to implement the programme, in
which it promises to address a wide range of social and development issues,
will be strong. The plan was the centrepiece of the party's election
platform and President Nelson Mandela has committed himself publicly to full
implementation.
Mr Jay Naidoo, minister-without-portfolio charged with implementing the
programme, admitted that the cost would be higher than expected but said he
was confident it could be funded without compromising fiscal discipline. The
bulk would be financed by restructuring and rationalising present government
spending.
The revised figures are drawn from the National Institute for Economic
policy, an ANC think tank. Mr Max Sisulu, head of the institute, said that
the revised estimates of R80bn-R90bn included spending by both central
government and government bodies such as the electricity supplier Eskom. The
anticipated costs still remain well below the R700bn figure given in a
pre-election study commissioned by the outgoing National Party.
Mr Sisulu said that the research, the full results of which are due to be
released in the next few days, was based on the assumption that there would
be no foreign grants and no marked tax changes over the first two years.
The increased costs are unlikely to be reflected in this year's budget,
expected to be presented to parliament on June 22. That is not expected to
differ significantly from last year's as the previous government had already
begun to address many of the reconstruction programme's social spending
commitments in previous budgets. Mr Naidoo said the full effect would not be
felt until the 1995-96 fiscal year.
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange reacted negatively to the new cost
estimates, with the overall index falling 70 points to end at 5387. Dealers
expect no significant market movements until after President Mandela
delivers his state of the nation address in parliament next Tuesday.

<TEXT>
More foreign banks are to be allowed into the Philippines under a measure
signed yesterday by President Fidel Ramos.
The move ends a 45-year ban on the entry of foreign banks and is part of
reforms improving global access to the country's economy. It also meets one
of the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for
new credits of about Dollars 650m to support a three-year growth programme.
Tax measures to bolster the national government revenues and narrow its
chronic budget deficits have already been introduced.
Mr Ramos said the new law represented 'one clear signal. . . . that we are
deeply serious in our aim to put an end to protectionist tendencies that
have coddled many of our industries into inefficiency and
non-competitiveness'.
The local banking industry has often been criticised for its inefficiency in
mobilising domestic savings. Costs have remained high and real interest
rates on savings have consistently been below the annual inflation rate.
There are 32 commercial banks currently operating in the Philippines of
which only four - Citibank, Bank of America, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and
Standard Chartered - are branches of foreign banks.
The new banking law allows the entry of up to 10 foreign banks in the next
five years, after which the sector will again be restricted to
Filipino-owned new entries.
The foreign banks may come in either as owners (of up to 60 per cent) of new
or existing banks, or as full-service branches.
The new banks will be allowed up to six branches each, with a capital
requirement of not less than 210m pesos (Pounds 5.2m) for the first three
and 35m pesos for the others. The minimum capital requirement is among the
highest in south-east Asia, according to banking analysts.
The law also requires that, despite the entry of foreign banks, at least 70
per cent of the banking system's total resources must be owned by Philippine
entities.
The four foreign banks now operating had combined resources of 75.5bn pesos
at end of 1993, or 8.9 per cent of the total assets of the whole banking
system, according to industry records.
Sources in the banking community say Bank of Tokyo, Deutsche Bank and
Bangkok Bank are among the interested foreign institutions. The new law
welcomes only those among the top 150 banks in the world, and the top five
in their country of origin.
The four foreign banks currently operating in the Philippines were actually
in operation when the law restricting the industry to locally owned banks
was enacted in 1948.

<TEXT>
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, warned yesterday the US would
increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if
it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea.
This would be required, he told a group of foreign correspondents, because
of North Korean statements that sanctions would be equivalent to an 'act of
war'. He conceded that Pyongyang's assertions might be 'just rhetoric' and
he added that US forces would not be placed on 'a war footing,' but that
prudence dictated the US be ready for any eventuality.
Mr Perry emphasised that sanctions would not be sought if the International
Atomic Energy Inspection team now in North Korea reported back to the UN
that its safeguards against the diversion of nuclear material for military
purposes were being observed.
He said he had some 'hope but not optimism,' that a confrontation with North
Korea could be averted. He also refused to rule out the possibility that
China could support sanctions if it concluded that the US and its partners
had shown sufficient 'patience' in their dealings with Pyongyang.
'I believe the Chinese will make their decisions on sanctions based on where
their national interests lie,' he said. China did vote in favour of
tightened UN sanctions against Haiti earlier this month, but with the clear
caveat that that should not be interpreted as a precedent.

NCM, the Dutch-based international credit insurer, said yesterday it was

Mr Harry Groen, NCM's chairman, said the company hoped to have a 'presence

growth abroad that has seen the company buy or launch operations in six

Japan Airlines and Air France have agreed to share each other's aircraft and
staff in flights between Paris and Osaka, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The agreement between two large international carriers highlights pressures
in the industry to reduce costs.
JAL said joint flights with Air France would allow it to save on costs and
it was considering similar arrangements with other airlines. In particular,
flying into Kansai International Airport, which will have the world's most
expensive landing fees when it opens this autumn, will be extremely costly.
And given the level of demand expected on the Paris-Osaka route, joint
flights with Air France were better suited to the needs of both airlines.
The deal allows both JAL and Air France to offer flights between Paris and
Osaka seven days a week. They also plan to co-operate on code-sharing
arrangements for flights beyond Paris and Osaka.

A senior US official yesterday said the US is 'in a listening mode' and
optimistic about the exploratory trade talks due to begin today in
Washington with a Japanese negotiating team, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
'Obviously you don't send your officials all this way if there is not
something to be said,' the US official said. While not knowing what to
expect from the Japanese, the US negotiators expect to build on progress
achieved in bilateral talks in Marakesh when the Uruguay Round was signed.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Vice President Al Gore
then met at length with Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister. The
senior US official said progress was made on macroeconomic issues and US
demands for objective indicators' to measure progress in sectoral market
openings.
However, there was stalemate on the US demand to set goals in the sectors
for which the Japanese promise to improve access.
Despite the failure in the overall 'framework talks,' Japan has succumbed to
US demands in a number of sectors this year, including apples, cellular
telephones, chemicals, and copper. 'We've had more agreements with the
Japanese this year than in any year in our history,' the senior official
said.

FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Call to separate rights and China MFN
decision
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support is growing in Congress for a strategy to separate the annual renewal
of China's Most Favoured Nation trade status from demands that it improve
its human rights policies.
A letter has been sent to President Bill Clinton from 106 members of both
parties which called for creation of a US-Chinese human rights commission as
a 'constructive and effective alternative' to the yearly confrontation over
MFN renewal. The commission could include government and private sector
experts on human rights, jurists, and business and religious leaders.
Meanwhile, State Department officials yesterday seemed to confirm reports
that Mr Clinton had sent a secret envoy to Beijing to urge progress on human
rights so that the president could renew China's MFN status. Mr Mike
McCurry, the State Department spokesman, did not deny the reports and
affirmed that there were 'many aspects of quiet diplomacy that we have been
pursuing.'
On June 3, the president must determine whether China has met the human
rights and immigration conditions linked to the renewal. Business lobbyists
have also urged the separation of MFN and human rights, warning that loss of
MFN would be almost as blighting to the US economy as China's.
On Sunday Senator George Mitchell, Senate majority leader, said he was
drafting trade sanctions, to be introduced in the Senate, in the event that
China fails to meet the conditions.
The Administration has been arguing that progress has been achieved in human
rights. However, continued detention of dissidents and only marginal
advances in China's treatment of Tibetans has undermined those claims.

FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Commission censured over car agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court yesterday censured the European Commission for failing to
investigate a long-standing Anglo-Japanese market-sharing agreement covering
Japanese car imports into the UK.
The Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance said the Commission had made a
'manifest error' of judgment in March 1992 when it declined to investigate
the 17-year-old pact.
The deal, between the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers' Association and the
UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, was known as a 'gentlemen's
agreement'. It formally required only that the Japanese market its cars
'prudently' in the UK. Effectively, however, it limited the market share for
Japanese cars to 11 per cent.
The Court's intervention - which followed a complaint by BEUC, the European
consumer bureau, and the UK-based National Consumer Council - last night
appeared to throw the SMMT into confusion because the 'gentlemen's
agreement' was formally ended in 1992.
This followed completion of an agreement between the EU Commission and
Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry. This devised a formula for
controlling Japanese car imports on a Europe-wide basis during a transition
to a completely open EU market for cars by 1999 where informal import
ceilings for each country are reviewed twice a year.
Under the EU-Miti accord, all previous national restrictions on Japanese car
imports became illegal. Both France and Italy had much tighter restrictions
than the UK.
The SMMT said it was taking legal advice about the ruling but 'we don't
understand what the court is talking about. The agreement finished in 1992
and the Commission was duly informed of that'.
The Commission said yesterday it was digesting the implications of the
ruling.
BEUC brought the case on the grounds that the arrangement between the
British and Japanese manufacturers associations made prices higher and
infringed EU competition law.
The Commission argued that the pact affected only a small proportion of
trade between EU member states.

FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gap widens in aircraft subsidy talks - The
resumption of negotiations on limiting support for aircraft makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid modest hopes - and even more modest expectations - efforts get under
way in Geneva today to break a six-month stalemate in negotiations aimed at
agreeing stricter disciplines on government subsidies to commercial aircraft
manufacturing.
All the signs point to tough times ahead, likely to be marked by angry
verbal sparring between the US and the European Union, the main
protagonists. Few observers are optimistic about progress, and some fear the
talks could even degenerate into a renewed bout of transatlantic trade
hostilities.
Industry attitudes have hardened before the talks. Some in the European
industry say they may urge the EU to abrogate its two-year-old bilateral
aircraft subsidy agreement with the US if the American side does not show
more flexibility.
US manufacturers say that if that happened they would re-open disputes
procedures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade challenging the
legality of government funding of the European Airbus. The European industry
says it is preparing for that possibility by studying ways of invoking Gatt
rules and EU trade sanctions to hit back at US competitors.
Indeed, some European executives do not rule out acting first if the going
got really rough. 'I wouldn't say we necessarily have a no first-strike
policy,' says one.
US manufacturers are making less bellicose noises, but seem determined to
stand their ground. This month the chairmen of the country's biggest
airframe and aero-engine makers wrote to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, urging him to 'proceed with extreme caution' and yield few
concessions in the talks.
'The US and the EU remain far apart, and nothing we have seen suggests we
are likely to bridge the gap,' says Mr Bob Robeson of the Aerospace
Industries Association of America, the main industry body.
These postures mark a reversal of roles. In the past the US, angered by
government aid to Airbus, has made the running in demanding tighter subsidy
curbs. But now the EU believes Washington is on the defensive about its own
support programmes and scents blood.
'We are not returning to the talks as demandeurs,' says a European
government official. 'We have a strong case, and the European industry is
more united than ever before.'
The negotiations broke up last December, two days before conclusion of the
Uruguay Round trade deal, when the Gatt civil aircraft committee failed to
agree the text of a draft agreement prepared by Mr Mikael Lindstrom, the
committee's Swedish chairman.
The EU and most of the 10 other countries on the committee were ready,
albeit grudgingly, to accept the text. But it was rejected by the US
government, which still opposes it as a basis for negotiation.
Since the talks broke down, the political atmosphere has been further
inflamed by the Clinton administration's role in clinching a Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 4bn) Saudi Arabian order in February for US airliners.
The Europeans are also critical of rapidly growing US support for commercial
aerospace programmes. In addition to Pentagon funding for military contracts
 -long a source of transatlantic controversy - the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration is now generously funding industry research into
supersonic and advanced subsonic airliner technology.
At the same time, there are signs of growing tensions in talks between the
four Airbus partners and Boeing on joint development of a 'super-jumbo'
aircraft. The Europeans suspect Boeing's real motive may be to deter them
from launching a rival to its highly profitable 747 range.
The Geneva talks have resumed after frenzied French lobbying. In the hope of
prodding the US back into negotiations, France has blocked an
uncontroversial technical revision of the 1979 Gatt civil aircraft code,
which has to be adapted to the rules of the new World Trade Organisation,
Gatt's successor.
Though France's aggressive tactics infuriated other countries, they spurred
a search for closer EU consensus. But there is no evidence that they have
shifted the US bargaining position.
Washington says it still wants to extend to other Gatt members, notably
Canada and Japan, the principles of its bilateral pact with the EU. This
limits the proportion of aircraft development costs that may be 'directly'
funded by government and 'indirect' support for purposes such as research.
However, the US continues to resist EU efforts to insert in the proposed
agreement other provisions, several of them covered by Mr Lindstrom's draft
text. They include:
Tighter controls on 'indirect' government support.
Extension of subsidy disciplines to aero-engines and parts.
'Grandfathering' (exemption) of government support for existing Airbus
programmes.
Changes in methods used in the bilateral agreement to calculate government
support.
US officials say a strengthened Gatt code covering all industrial subsidies,
agreed in the Uruguay Round, provides adequate safeguards, making a separate
agreement for aircraft no longer necessary.
The EU says this argument is self-serving. Though the broader Gatt subsidies
code would restrict 'direct' aid of the kind mostly used in Europe, it would
have little effect on the 'indirect' support from which US aerospace
companies mostly benefit.
Such support is particularly prevalent in US aero-engines, many of which are
derived from military designs. Last-minute objections to tougher Gatt
disciplines by US engine makers were the main reason Washington rejected Mr
Lindstrom's text last year.
The EU says the US committed itself in the bilateral agreement to negotiate
seriously on extending disciplines to engines. Mr Robeson of the AIAA
concedes that such a commitment was given, but says it should no longer
apply.
In European eyes, this apparent ambivalence reflects a one-sided approach by
the US which, they claim, colours its attitude to the bilateral agreement.
Says one European industry executive: 'The Americans seem to think all the
obligations are on us and none on them.'
Some observers already suggest the best outcome in Geneva might be for the
US and the EU to sink their differences by agreeing quietly to bury the Gatt
negotiations. But while that would probably be welcomed in Washington, it is
far less clear that it would satisfy a European industry which seems intent
on exacting its pound of flesh.

<TEXT>
NCM, the Dutch-based international credit insurer, said yesterday it was
considering expanding into Asia, where credit insurance was relatively
under-developed compared with Europe, the group's main market, writes Ronald
van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Mr Harry Groen, NCM's chairman, said the company hoped to have a 'presence
of one form or another' in Asia within the next couple of years, extending
growth abroad that has seen the company buy or launch operations in six
countries, including Britain, since the early 1990s.
NCM last year insured deliveries of goods and services worth Fl 147.9bn
(Pounds 52.6bn). Recent economic difficulties in Germany had led to a rise
in credit insurance claims from companies doing business with German
customers.
The company had also recently tightened its policy on covering trade credits
on business with Italy, Spain and Portugal because of several years of high
claims.

Chile has won agreement for lower tariffs on its apples and pears exported
to the European Union, David Pilling writes from Santiago.
In return Chile has dropped its request that Gatt investigate EU
restrictions on its fruit.
Chilean fruit producers, who account for 12 per cent of EU consumption, say
the European system of countervailing duties last year caused them losses of
Dollars 100m-Dollars 120m (Pounds 66.6m - Pounds 80m).
Tariffs will be lowered by 50 per cent under the agreement reached in
Brussels on Tuesday. The reference price - the level at which import
surcharges come into effect - will also be raised. Chile will be allowed to
export 12 per cent of fruit below this price, against 8 per cent previously.

FT  19 MAY 94 / GAO rings alarm bells over danger of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fragmented US regulatory structure is badly organised to deal with the
fast-growing derivatives markets. The result: the markets have come to be
dominated by several big dealers, some of which are completely unregulated.
The failure of any one of these could bring the US - and, by extension, the
world's - financial system to its knees.
Those are the conclusions of the General Accounting Office, Congress's
investigating arm, in its long-awaited report on derivatives published
yesterday. Its warnings are the most apocalyptic yet to emanate from the
string of official reports carried out in the US and elsewhere in the past
two years into the derivatives markets.
The GAO concludes: 'The immediate need is for Congress to bring the
currently unregulated OTC (over-the-counter) derivatives activities of
securities firms and insurance company affiliates under the purview of one
or more of the existing federal financial regulators and to ensure that
derivatives regulation is consistent and comprehensive across regulatory
agencies.'
The markets are concentrated in very few hands, says the report: just seven
US banks accounted for 90 per cent of derivatives activity in the US at the
end of 1992. These entities also dominate a large part of global trading
activity. 'This combination of global involvement, concentration, and
linkages means that sudden failure or abrupt withdrawal from trading of any
of these large dealers could cause liquidity problems in the markets and
could also pose risks to the others, including federally insured banks and
the financial system as a whole.'
The agency's main proposal is for legislation to bring the unregulated
derivative trading units of securities houses and insurance companies into
the regulatory net. At end 1992, these companies already accounted for 30
per cent of over-the-counter activity in the US (the rest was carried out by
banks.)
'Congress (should) require federal regulation of the safety and soundness of
all main US over-the-counter derivatives dealers,' it says. Either the
Securities and Exchange Commission should be responsible for the unregulated
dealers, with a new inter-agency group set up to establish common regulatory
standards; or leadership in setting regulations for derivatives should be
divided between different regulatory bodies, depending on their particular
expertise.
The report also calls for the urgent modernisation of the entire financial
regulatory system in the US. 'The existing regulatory structure has not kept
pace with the dramatic and rapid changes in the domestic and global
financial markets' of recent years, it says. It does not offer solutions to
this perceived problem, but it says: 'Many issues need to be debated and
decided, including the appropriate uses of federally insured deposits and
the extent to which they should be used to finance large-scale proprietary
trading in derivatives or other financial instruments.'
Financial regulators, meanwhile, should work together to make combined
efforts more effective, the GAO says. This could be done by centralising
information about firms they regulate, operating a consistent set of rules
governing the capital which dealers are required to hold, and requiring
dealers to have independent audit committees and adequate internal controls
for their derivatives activities. It also calls for annual full-scale
examinations of all dealers once a year.
A second focus of regulatory attention should be the accounting and
disclosure regime for derivatives, the GAO says. It calls for rules
requiring both dealers and users of derivatives to publish more about their
activities in this area, and a consistent accounting regime that can be
applied to all types of instrument.
Finally, the report calls for the SEC to extend derivatives regulation to
many publicly-traded companies which use such instruments.
'SEC registrants that are major end-users of complex derivative products
(should) establish and implement corporate requirements for independent,
knowledgeable audit committees and public reporting on internal controls.'
External auditors should also be required to report on the quality of
risk-management systems for derivatives, it adds.

FT  19 MAY 94 / How they are used as a hedge against future price changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Instruments which provide protection against the shifting values of
agricutural commodities and currencies have been around for decades. But it
is only in recent years that the use of derivatives has become widespread -
mainly to hedge interest rate and foreign currencies movements and (more
recently) changes in equity and commodity prices. Their notional value
jumped from Dollars 7,198bn at the end of 1989 to Dollars 17,643bn three
years later, the GAO says (though the actual amounts at risk are much
smaller).
Like other financial instruments, they are also used to take a position on a
future price movement (critics prefer to call it 'speculation'). The
difference - and one of the factors which troubles regulators - is that all
derivatives are geared instruments, offering a much greater market exposure
for a smaller outlay.
Derivatives began as an extention of some underlying or 'cash' market: the
value of an equity index futures contract, when it expires, is based on the
underlying shares in the index. But values do not move mechanically in line
with a 'cash' market - and in many cases, the derivatives markets themselves
actually determine prices in the underlying instruments.
The plethora of complex financial instruments spawned recently can be broken
down into three main categories:
Swaps. The two parties to a swap agree that for a certain period they will
exchange regular payments. In an interest rate swap, for instance, one
institution pays the other a fixed rate of interest (say, 8 per cent) based
on some notional principal amount, while the other pays a variable rate of
interest, which changes as market interest rates changes. That enables
companies to turn floating rate liabilities into fixed rate ones, and vice
versa. Swaps represented some 27 per cent of the Dollars 17,643bn notional
value of all derivatives at the end of 1992.
Options. These give the holder the right to sell (a put option) or buy (a
call option) something in the future at a price determined at the outset.
For instance, an institutional investor wanting to protect investment gains
in its equity portfolio might buy put options. These would guarantee a
minimum level at which it can sell the shares in future - without at the
same time limiting its potential gains.
Forwards/Futures. Both require the holder to buy or sell an underlying asset
or currency at some time in the future: unlike an option, the holder cannot
simply let the contract lapse. Forward contracts - commonly used in forex
markets - accounted for 42 per cent of all derivatives at the end of 1992,
while futures were 18 per cent.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Congress cancels Dollars 100m US pledge for IMF arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US congressional committee has cancelled from this year's budget the
Dollars 100m contribution promised by the Clinton administration to the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, an arm of the International
Monetary Fund which lends money at subsidised interest rates to the very
poorest nations.
The House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee in charge of
foreign operations voted yesterday to delete the Dollars 100m proposed by
the administration in its foreign aid spending bill for the 1995 fiscal
year.
US officials yesterday sought to play down the significance of the move,
noting that the money would not have been called on in any case for another
two years.
Nevertheless, representatives of other countries at the IMF called the
decision 'very bad news,' and said it would further damage the reputation of
the US, which is perpetually in arrears on its pledges to international
institutions.
The US was one of the last big industrialised countries to promise money to
the ESAF, which comprises an SDR4.5bn (Pounds 4.2bn) capital fund and a
separate SDR2bn fund to subsidise its interest rates, and its Dollars 100m
contribution was described even by the US Treasury as 'a meagre share for
the largest economy in the world.'
Other congressional committees have been pressing for the ESAF money to be
linked to a promise of greater transparency from the IMF. The US appears,
however, to be riding a lonely hobby horse on this issue, with little
support from other nations.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Rough ride for bill on healthcare reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US legislators are facing an uphill task as they begin the thorny task of
drawing up a health reform bill. Despite a willingness to make concessions
from a few closely involved in the process, a consensus remains as far away
as ever.
Two of the five congressional committees overseeing the overhaul of the US
healthcare system started the formal process of drawing up a bill yesterday.
In the Senate labor and human resources committee, Republicans yesterday set
out to attack from all sides a proposal from Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, the committee's chairman, which preserves many aspects of
President Bill Clinton's plan while limiting the requirements that would be
placed on small businesses.
But Mr Kennedy's proposal is expected to win support from almost all of his
committee's 10 Democratic members, enough to overrule the seven-member
Republican minority.
In the House of Representatives, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski is not so sure
of the backing of all the Democrats on his ways and means committee, which
also began a drafting session yesterday.
Mr Rostenkowski has warned his members that they must face the uncomfortable
choices posed by the reform of health care. The reform raises the prospect
of a general tax increase to pay for it if members are unwilling to adopt
the employer mandate contained in Mr Clinton's plan, under which employers
would have to pay 80 per cent of the costs of health insurance for their
workers.
The employer mandate has appeared in recent weeks to be sticking in
Congress's throat, with Republicans and many centrist Democrats objecting
that it would cost jobs by raising costs for businesses.
But signals of a possible compromise are emerging, with some senior
legislators now willing to accept some form of mandate, so long as smaller
businesses are exempted.
Senator John Breaux of Louisiana has come up with a proposal that would
require large companies to provide health insurance for their workforce but
exempt employers with 10 or fewer workers and levying a payroll tax on those

Mr Breaux represents a vital swing vote on the Senate finance committee,
where Democrats outnumber Republicans by only 11 to nine. The finance
committee has so far made less progress than any of the other principal
committees towards drafting a bill.

Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a candidate for the presidency of the
Dominican Republic, has asked the electoral board to stop publishing the
results of the count, and not to declare the results of Monday's election
until it investigates his party's allegations of fraud and corruption in the
voting.
Mr Pena Gomez, who is trying to become the country's first black president,
made the request as returns from the election showed his social democrat
Dominican Revolutionary Party to be running a close second to the
conservative Social Christian Reform Party led by Mr Joaquin Balaguer, the
president. Mr Balaguer, at 87, is seeking a seventh term.
With 81 per cent of the votes counted yesterday, Mr Balaguer had 42.76 per
cent, with Mr Pena Gomez on 40.95 per cent. Mr Pena Gomez has claimed that
up to 200,000 people, most of them his supporters, were unable to vote
either because their voting cards had been confiscated, or their names were
not on the list.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Haiti's military draws on past to shrug off threats: How
previous experience has emboldened generals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A storm of international protest rages around them, but Haiti's military
rulers seem unconcerned, shrugging off efforts to apply economic pressure
for the return of ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide.
Their appointment this week of an alternative government to that of Mr
Robert Malval, the pro-Aristide prime minister, appeared to be explicit
defiance of the United Nations deadline of this Saturday for tougher
sanctions and veiled US threats of a military invasion.
In Port-au-Prince, President Bill Clinton's sabre-rattling is dismissed as
merely that. The coterie of affluent Haitians who support the
military-controlled regime see a US invasion - or even US participation in a
multinational force intended to remove the army and reinstate Mr Aristide -
as politically too risky for Mr Clinton and unlikely to be supported by
Americans.
Their reasons for optimism are not hard to find. Even under the existing
embargo, trade has continued. Between January and October last year, when
Haiti was under embargo, the US imported 2.5m softballs and 678,000
baseballs from Haiti, according to US commerce department figures,
significantly higher than imports in the same period of 1992.
Having survived sanctions so far, the military feels it can survive those
which will come into force if it does not step down by the weekend. Army
officers are also looking with more than passing interest at developments
across the border in the Dominican Republic.
The victory of the incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer in the election
there this week, if confirmed, will promise a continuing loophole in the
sanctions. Mr Balaguer has been opposed to Mr Aristide's return and is
against tougher sanctions. He had previously promised to reduce the
incidence of smuggling across the border, but has described the impending
embargo as 'an inhuman formula because you are punishing people that already
are impoverished.'
General Raoul Cedras and the other officers who head Haiti's military long
enjoyed support from professional associates in the corridors of power in
Washington. Many are past members of the National Intelligence Service, a
special unit created in the 1980s by the US Central Intelligence Agency to
fight narcotics trafficking, but which has since gone rogue, with former
members becoming traffickers themselves.
Gen Cedras was once a key source of US intelligence on Haiti and was, by
extension, influential in formulating Washington's early and negative
impressions of Mr Aristide.
The value of these links, and their effect on US policy, were indicated
when, in 1992, amid confirmed reports of the murder, imprisonment and abuse
of Mr Aristide's supporters, the CIA's leading analyst on Haiti described
Gen Cedras as 'a conscientious military leader who genuinely wishes to
minimise his role in politics. There is no systematic or frequent violence
aimed at civilians.'
Gen Cedras and his officers must also have been heartened by the various
official attempts in the US to discredit Mr Aristide. Last year the CIA
reported that Mr Aristide was a manic-depressive and was prone to violence.
The claim that the president had undergone psychological treatment at a
Canadian hospital was rebuffed by the hospital named which said it had never
treated the president.
The list of reasons for the military's sense of security is thus formidable.
But in not bending to international pressure, Gen Cedras runs a risk of
overplaying his hand. If President Bill Clinton really has concluded that
principle must take precedence over personality, and that returning an
elected leader to office is now more important than who that leader is, then
Haiti's military leaders could come to regret calling his bluff.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Biotechnology produces the 'flavour saver'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Biotechnology has given birth to its first food product, the 'flavour saver
tomato,' which was approved yesterday by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration.
The tomato, made by the California-based biotechnology group Calgene, is
claimed to taste better than most other tomatoes and should hit supermarkets
in California and parts of the mid-west within 10 days.
The flavour saver has been genetically altered so it no longer produces a
rotting enzyme. That means it can stay on the plant longer, and hold up
better to shipping. The plant-ripened tomatoes will be grown in Mexico,
California and Florida, and will be available all year round.
The price, said the company, would be slightly higher than conventional
tomatoes. However, the reception among consumers is uncertain. When the
company began cultivating the tomatoes two years ago, some gourmet chefs and
grass roots organisations said they would boycott it. Much of the public
remains suspicious of genetically engineered foods.
One development that does not bode well is mounting opposition to the
hormone BST, which was approved earlier this year and is used by dairy
farmers to increase milk production.
The tomato is just the first of a number of biotechnology food products
expected to hit the markets over the next few years. Monsanto, for instance,
is developing a potato which will have more carbohydrates and less water.
That would mean chips could be made with less oil, reducing fat content.
ICI may soon come out with its own non-rotting tomato. Calgene is also
working on a new, lower fat edible oil.

Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, yesterday threw his weight
publicly behind a full and speedy liberalisation of Europe's cable
television infrastructure. The commissioner, outlining the role of
competition policy in telecommunications, said his aides were studying the
impact of allowing cable TV companies to offer services already open to
competition, such as alarm services and data bases. This would not include
voice telephony to the public. 'The central issue we have to address is
whether such an initiative would undermine the ability of the incumbent
telecoms operator to provide universal service. It is my conviction that
this is not the case,' said Mr Van Miert.

FT  19 MAY 94 / German toxic rules blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has overturned a Brussels decision to allow
Germany to apply more stringent rules than its EU partners on the use of
pentachlorophenol (PCP), a toxic chemical used for hardening wood and
treating textiles and paper. Officials say this is a test case of an EU
treaty article designed to ensure that member states can, under certain
circumstances, act to protect public health and the environment even when it
could conflict with the free movement of goods within Europe's single
market.
Four governments including Germany's were outvoted on the 1991 modification
of the toxic substances legislation, but in 1992 Brussels gave Germany a
derogation, or time-limited exemption, for its tougher domestic rules.
France launched a complaint, and the court has now upheld it, arguing that
Brussels has failed to establish that the EU treaty's safeguard article
applies in this case. Commission officials say they will now have to go back
to the court, or risk the treaty safeguards being brought into discredit.

<TEXT>
Nato ambassadors yesterday rebuffed Moscow's demand for an alternative to
the Partnership for Peace arrangement, in a move that casts a shadow over
next week's visit to Brussels by General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence
minister. Gen Grachev has said Russia is not prepared simply to join the
queue of East European countries signing up to the partnership, an
arrangement that provides for joint exercises and an exchange of military
know-how. At a meeting in Brussels yesterday, the ambassadors said the most
they could promise was 'dialogue and co-operation' of a kind that reflected
Russia's importance in European security.
However, this dialogue would be in addition to Russian adherence to the
partnership, not a substitute. An alliance spokesman said Nato 'looked
forward' to Russia subscribing to the partnership, which already has 18
members. 'We do not like the term special relationship,' said a Nato
official, adding that any links between Russia and the alliance must be
transparent and stop well short of giving Moscow a veto over future alliance
decisions.

The mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Italy's disgraced former Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi deepened yesterday after he sent a sick note telling
magistrates he was too ill to hand in his passport. Milan magistrates last
week ordered the former Socialist party leader, who faces 20 different graft
investigations, to surrender his passport for fear he might flee the
country. But Mr Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987 and one of Italy's
best known politicians, has disappeared and is thought to be abroad. The
certificate, signed by a foreign doctor whose nationality has not been
released, is reported to refer to diabetes, a condition which Mr Craxi has
suffered from for many years. Milan magistrates could issue an international
arrest warrant for Mr Craxi unless he materialises by the weekend.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Berlusconi wins senate backing
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new prime minister, last night cleared the
last hurdle to begin governing with his right-wing cabinet when he narrowly
won a vote of confidence in the senate.
Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance lacked an absolute majority in the 315-seat
senate, swelled to 326 by 11 life senators. He had to rely on the absence of
some senators and the abstention of others to win the vote by 159 to 153,
with two abstentions.
The abstentions counted as a negative; but those absent either through ill
health, travel or tactical reasons simply reduced the size of the majority
required. With an absolute majority in the chamber of deputies, the
confidence vote there on Friday is a foregone conclusion. Mr Berlusconi can
now begin to flesh out the details of deregulating the economy, ending
Italy's rigid labour laws and reforming taxes, which he announced earlier
this week would be the centrepiece of his first 100 days.
The three-day debate in the senate showed many politicians were concerned
about the composition of the new government, with its five ministers drawn
from the neo-fascist MSDI/National Alliance and the presence of the populist
Northern League. But despite such reservations no one suggested a serious
alternative to Mr Berlusconi or his chosen allies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iceland is facing another difficult year in 1994 due to sharp cuts in cod
quotas and can expect only a modest recovery next year, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. An OECD report says
the economy will decline by 1.2 per cent this year, after growing by a
better-than-expected 0.8 per cent last year. The report says Iceland's
fishing industry, which accounts for 75 per cent of exports, is going
through a difficult phase because of past overfishing and unfavourable
environmental conditions. The total allowable cod catch has been cut by 20
per cent in the year to September 1994. The organisation says fisheries
management is Iceland's key policy challenge but believes further reform of
agriculture is also required. Payments to the sector should be gradually
reduced.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Journalist in a class of his own: Obituary of Robert
Mauthner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Mauthner, who died yesterday at the age of 65, would be proud to be
remembered simply as a journalist. But journalists are ten a penny. What
marked him out - as a foreign correspondent, diplomatic editor and deputy
foreign editor for the Financial Times in a career spanning 25 years, and
before that for Reuters - was that he belonged in that rare class of its
own: he was the most professional of journalists.
His countless colleagues, friends, peers and contacts all knew that he would
get it right and write it properly. His stamina was legendary, his fairness
and accuracy without equal, his knowledge and experience invaluable. From
Prague to Paris, from Helsinki to Kuala Lumpur, he always delivered the
goods meticulously, as a reporter, analyst and columnist.
Those who worked with him also loved many other qualities. He was an
incomparable counsellor and mentor, a role model who always gave his advice
and time unstintingly to those below and above him. He was often the first
into the office and invariably among the last to leave. Stories, he would
say, could not be left to chance. He grieved more than most over mistakes or
misinterpretations which he thought the newspaper should have avoided, but
he would be as pleased as punch, and generous in his praise, whenever we
beat the competition.
And he knew when this had happened; he read every newspaper he could lay his
hands on with a fine eye - in English, French, German, Dutch and probably a
few other languages besides.
He came to the FT almost casually. In 1968, having left Reuters in Brussels,
he was asked to fill in for our vacationing Bonn correspondent. When
Dubcek's Prague spring flowered and with FT foreign correspondents then much
thinner on the ground, he was sent to Czechoslovakia, from which he reported
with such distinction that when he finally left after the Soviet tanks had
rolled in he was immediately recruited to the foreign staff.
Three years later, he was chief correspondent in Paris, a post he held for
more than 10 years. His affection for and knowledge of France was
deep-rooted, but that never affected his detachment. He infused a succession
of younger, junior correspondents in the bureau with his standards, to the
point that all acknowledge their debt to him.
After a stint running the London foreign desk, he picked up the diplomatic
beat that was always close to his heart. But he was never content to confine
this to coverage of the British foreign office, though he never neglected
it. A European by conviction long before it was fashionable, he covered the
interstices of the Community's and Nato's security affairs and the
implications of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall.
Summits were always grist to his mill, whether of the European,
Commonwealth, G7, Nato or CSCE variety. At Maastricht in 1991, when so much
was happening and when the FT had a large team of experts deployed, there
was no other choice but Bob for the unenviable task of pulling it all
together into a coherent front page story.
Yet, as the map of Europe was changing, he also pulled more than the
required weight as deputy foreign editor in London. His advice on whom to
move where and when was always wise, as was his judgment of what was
important. Successive foreign editors knew they could always leave their
charge in his hands.
He could be crusty and obstinate. But the more cantankerous he became the
more it was apparent that he was standing on principle. If that made others
uncomfortable it was a price worth paying for fighting for what he knew to
be right.
All the above made him exceptionally respected as the professional
journalist, the heart, soul and mind of so much of our foreign coverage for
a generation. But the sheer sense of loss now consuming his friends and
colleagues attests to a much deeper affection extending well outside the
newsroom.
He was great company, preferably over a good meal and bottle, but also over
a bad pub sandwich and a pint. He loved his sports and if rugby was his
sneaking favourite, his tastes were catholic. He made us laugh, sometimes
with a wonderful line in what might be called poetic doggerel-plus. Even
though we all knew he would never really lay down his pen, there was a new
flat waiting for him in Paris with his wife Anne for his notional
retirement. No spare room would ever have been more permanently booked.

Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, paid the following personal tribute
to Bob Mauthner yesterday:
'I was sad to hear of Bob Mauthner's death.  He gave shape to that
ill-defined role of Diplomatic Editor, I was always impressed by his grasp
of foreign policy and his ability to explain the issues clearly and
objectively.
Good journalism, produced with real knowledge and authority, helps people -
policy makers as well as voters - understand and assess problems better.
Bob was a highly distinguished journalist, and we shall miss him.'
Hella Pick, president, Diplomatic and Commonwealth Writers' Association,
associate foreign editor, The Guardian:
'I feel a very deep loss.  He was a loyal friend and good companion. I
always envied his writing - I never knew anyone who could put so much into
his first paragraphs that made so much sense.'
Mr Stephen Somerville, director, Reuter Foundation:
'Reuters remembers Bob as one of the best-informed and most perceptive
observers of the European scene, including during the 1960s when he achieved
several notable scoops on political developments like Britain's efforts to
join the Common Market.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: German repo rate falls to 5.23%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday allowed the securities repurchase or repo rate to
drop by 12 basis points to 5.23 per cent following last week's half point
cuts in its Lombard and discount rates to five-year lows. The cut was in
line with market expectations and financial markets gave it a lukewarm
greeting, fearing Germany is nearing the end of its series of rate
reductions. The Bundesbank is expected to continue steering its repo rate
gradually lower in coming weeks but dealers said this did not suggest that
further large official rate declines were in the offing.
German bonds and shares rose slightly after the half point US rate rise on
Tuesday helped the market by removing uncertainty. The Bank of Portugal
forecast Portugal would move out of recession in 1994, with growth of 0.5 to
1 per cent (after falling 1 per cent last year) driven by export growth of
3.5 per cent and investment growth of up to 2.5 per cent. Inflation would
fall to between 5.5 and 6 per cent from 6.5 per cent in 1993. Peter Wise,
Lisbon.
The Danish government upgraded its 1994 growth estimate to 4 per cent from
an estimate of 3 per cent in December last year. The projection for
inflation in 1994 was lowered to 2 per cent from 2.8 per cent. Spain's
producer price index was 4.1 per cent higher in March against the same month
in 1993, the national statistics institute said. Producer prices were up 1.8
per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
In a dull little lecture hall on the campus of Bamberg university, normally
devoted to the delights of business studies, Mr Manfred Brunner was putting
on a passable imitation of Daniel in the lions' den.
The leading campaigner against the Maastricht treaty in Germany - the man
who fought the case vainly all the way through to the constitutional court
in Karlsruhe - was trying to persuade an audience of 40-odd young Christian
Democrats, normally loyal supporters of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his
Bavarian allies, of the need for Euro-scepticism. He was surrounded by
passionate pro-Europeans of most other political persuasions.
Mr Brunner showed no sign of trepidation. He warned them of the looming loss
of the precious Deutsche Mark in a single European monetary system.
He denounced the danger of weakening democratic control over an ever-more
bureaucratic European Union.
He intoned against a feeble German government allowing its interests in
eastern Europe to be subordinated to French fears of German domination.
Mr Brunner argues with all the passion of a convert. He used to be the chef
de cabinet in the European Commission in Brussels to the senior German
commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann.
He refers to the Maastricht treaty as the moment of his 'conversion on the
road to Damascus.'
He has already spent at least DM200,000 (Pounds 80,000) out of his own
pocket, he says, in fighting the legal battle against the treaty.
'The whole treaty is dedicated to the unilateral destruction of the D-Mark,'
he declares. 'The stability of the future Ecu will lie somewhere between the
D-Mark and the drachma.
'It will be a double fiasco. The hard currency countries will lose their
advantage of currency stability. The weak currency countries will be forced
into a harmful revaluation. Everyone will end up a loser.'
The threat to the D-Mark is Mr Brunner's best and biggest campaign theme.
Yet his first reason for fighting the Maastricht treaty was his conviction
that the treaty was a deliberate attempt to prevent 'the first real chance
we have had in history to create a truly pan-European community.'
His opponents see his movement as a threat to mobilise the latent forces of
'conservative nationalism' in Germany: he is an establishment figure, unlike
the extreme right represented by the Republicans. He represents a
respectable way to vote for national interests.
He has founded the 'Free Citizens' Alliance' to campaign against the treaty
in the European elections in Germany. And in Bamberg he was treated with
respect. But he is clearly finding the exercise an uphill struggle.
'If I had a proper organisation, I would win 30 to 40 per cent of the vote,'
he says. 'That is the level of sympathy in the population. But without an
organisation, I am not sure how we will do.'
Tonight, at a rally of disgruntled Bavarian farmers on the Chiemsee, Mr
Brunner will unveil his secret weapon in the campaign: the support from
across the Austrian border of Mr Jorg Haider, populist and nationalist
leader of the Austrian liberal party.
'I can only win this election with polarisation,' he admits. 'It is no good
to me being everybody's second-best choice. I know Haider, and I am
convinced he is not an extremist.'
Mr Brunner has a second secret weapon: he believes that Germany should be
seeking to forge a new and much closer relationship with Britain, to balance
its ties to France.
'The British philosophy is fundamentally much closer to our own,' he says.
'The Maastricht treaty is the last throw of the French revolution. I believe
much more, like the British, in an evolutionary process.'
He is convinced that the Chancellor's office in Bonn is orchestrating a
campaign of silence in the 'bourgeois press' against him.
He may pick up some protest votes, and even drain a little support from the
Republicans on the right.
But the prospect of losing the D-Mark has receded into the distant future of
1999. The German economy, jobs and taxation are the issues of the day.
Anti-Maastricht was a good theme one year ago, but it seems unlikely to
mobilise so many frustrated voters today.

FT  19 MAY 94 / De Beers in Russian diamond accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers of South Africa stepped back from a potentially serious conflict
yesterday by agreeing to consider changes to its Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
diamond marketing contract with Russia.
At the same time the Russian government representatives agreed 'to take
necessary steps' to stop rough (uncut) diamonds leaking from Russia through
unofficial channels to the west where they threatened to destabilise the
market.
Trade sources suggested that, after the Russians were publicly rebuked by De
Beers in December for breaking the contract, the flow of unofficial diamonds
eased but recently it had been increasing again.
There were sighs of relief in the diamond trade yesterday because Russia
supplies about 25 per cent of the diamonds De Beers sells through its
London-based Central Selling Organisation. The CSO controls more than 80 per
cent of the world's trade in rough diamonds.
In 1990 De Beers lent Russia Dollars 1bn, shipped some of the Russian
stockpile to London as collateral and signed the five-year marketing
agreement. This permits Russia to sell 5 per cent of its rough diamond
output directly to the west for 'market testing'.
While there are no indications that Russia wished to end the contract with
the world's most successful cartel, some officials have been pressing for
the federation to keep a bigger share. Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of
Komdragment, the Russian diamond and precious stones committee, who was in
the Russian negotiating team this week, is demanding that Russia be able to
keep 25 per cent of its rough diamond trade.
The De Beers team was headed by Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, its deputy chairman
and chairman of the CSO. According to diamond trade sources he stepped in at
the last moment because relationships had become strained.
Mr Gary Ralfe, who negotiated the Russian contract and publicly castigated
Russia for breaking it, was previously expected to head the De Beers team.
He was in Moscow with Mr Oppenheimer, however. Mr Richard Wake-Walker,
previously De Beers' representative in Moscow, quit the group recently after
being replaced by Mr Ray Clark. The Diamantaire trade newsletter suggested
Mr Wake-Walker 'advocated a flexible negotiating strategy with Russia while
Mr Ralfe and Mr Clark appear to be taking a tough, no-concessions approach'.
The large delegation with which Russia faced Mr Oppenheimer included
representatives from the Sakha diamond-producing region, as well as the
Russian diamond committee and the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Economic
Affairs - among whom the right approach is still being debated. Russia's
need for increased income from exports has been aggravated by the recent
fall in the oil price, its main export earner - and by the virtual
disappearance of its manufactured goods from the world market.
A joint communique yesterday said 'the parties remain committed to the
existing agreement, pending their agreeing on any modification. They are
also committed to the stability of the international diamond market and to
taking the necessary steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching
the market outside the current marketing arrangements.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / Questions in Europe: Europol spans frontiers in war on crime
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jurgen Storbeck, 47, German co-ordinator (head) of the EU's Europol
organisation, charged with combating organised crime. He has 17 years of
police experience at Interpol and Germany's federal police office.
Voters in the European parliament elections appear to want politicians who
can make an impact in combating organised crime. How can Europol contribute?
Europol is helping to overcome existing borders between criminal and justice
authorities to improve crime-fighting capacity. Since being set up at the
beginning of the year in The Hague, we have already been involved in 80
international investigations centering on drugs and related
money-laundering.
How does Europol work? Europol is the first international mix of police,
gendarmerie, and customs. It enables member states to exchange sensitive and
even unevaluated information and intelligence. Europol is unique in that
individual member states liaison officers (ELOs) work for their own national
criminal intelligence services rather than Europol itself. Confidentiality
is thus more readily accepted by member states.
Are individual EU countries putting enough resources into this effort? Every
EU member is represented except Portugal whose ELO arrives next month. The
Netherlands has been exceptionally generous, while Germany, France and the
UK have provided expert staff. The budget, subscribed in proportion to gross
national product, is Ecu2.5m (Pounds 1.9m) this year; Ecu4.5m in 1995.
Which countries in the EU are most at risk from cross-border organised
crime? All are at risk. The Channel makes no difference to criminals. A
large proportion of drugs seized in Britain come from other EU states. Crime
originating from economically weak east European states is a new and
dangerous phenomenon.
Do you fear the possibility of wasteful duplication with national agencies
and, if so, how can this be avoided? Europol has been charged with avoiding
duplication at all costs. We look at cross-border organised crime from an EU
dimension only; and seek to add values to intelligence on a Union basis.
What is the nature of your links with Interpol based in Lyons? Europol will
play a much more operational role than Interpol, especially after the
ratification of the Europol convention. In respect of continuing
investigations, Europol can collect and analyse and transmit sensitive and
highly confidential information and intelligence which law enforcement
agencies of member states hesitate to send via the Interpol channels.
How can Europol increase its links with agencies in central and eastern
Europe to combat Mafia-type organisations? If national criminal intelligence
services consider criminals in eastern Europe carry a disproportionately
high risk in respect of cross-border drugs trafficking and other forms of
organised crime into the EU, we will give them the required attention.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Philippe de Villiers, viscount, champion of a movement for French
morality and leader of L'Autre Europe, an anti-Maastricht list for the
European elections, was in uncompromising form.
On the stump in Strasbourg this week he delivered a tirade against the
Brussels technocracy, an assault on the Gatt regime of international trade
and an invective against corruption in France and beyond.
'The only good things which have come from Europe have nothing to do with
Brussels,' he claimed, citing the Channel Tunnel as an example. He condemned
the European Commission's failure to tackle the real problems of the day, in
particular unemployment, to the loud applause of the Strasbourg faithful.
But winning applause may be easier than winning votes for the
anti-Maastricht cause in the June 12 elections. French Eurosceptics are
spoiled for choice. From the Communist party and a rebel socialist-led
grouping on the left, to the National Front on the extreme right, voters who
fear the emergence of a federal Europe can take their pick from parties
which span the political spectrum.
'The debate transcends traditional left and right divisions,' says Sir James
Goldsmith, erstwhile financier and ecologist who is standing alongside Mr de
Villiers on the list for L'Autre Europe. Known as Jimmy in France, he is
opposed to what Sir James describes as the 'asphyxiation of a democratic
Europe,' and in favour of a 'Europe of nation states.'
The nature of the debate has brought an unlikely and colourful mix of
bedfellows both within and between the groupings of the anti-Maastricht
cause. In addition to Mr de Villiers and Sir James, for example, L'Autre
Europe also includes Mr Charles de Gaulle, grandson of the general.
To their left is L'Autre Politique, a list headed by Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, the former socialist minister.
To their right, by some distance, stands the National Front, headed by Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the demagogue who draws a comparison between the
Maastricht treaty and the Treaty of Troyes, which paved the way for Joan of
Arc's France to be subjugated to English rule.
The various groupings share a set of common targets. From the Gatt -
described by Sir James as a 'monstrous crime' - to European monetary union,
condemned by Mr Chevenement as 'a suicidal choice for our economy which has
resulted in unnecessarily high interest rates,' there is much on which the
various groups see eye to eye.
But there is also much on which they disagree. 'The Non to Maastricht is
deeply-rooted in republican beliefs. On religion and the role of women in
society, our values are not those of Mr de Villiers,' says Mr Chevenement,
whose list is split between male and female candidates.
The communists differ from their rivals on the right in favouring a pacifist
Europe which gives priority to the protection of labour.
The often confusing messages do strike a chord with many voters. 'Tell me
where are the supposed economic benefits of the European Union?' asks one
businessman attending the Strasbourg rally. 'Our interest rates are tied to
the Bundesbank which cripples my business and two of my relatives have lost
their jobs over the past 18 months,' he adds.
Such sentiments, according to the polls, will give the anti-Maastricht cause
almost 25 per cent of the votes in the June 12 elections.
But the support is splintered, with the National Front on about 9 per cent,
the communist list on 6 per cent, L'Autre Europe on about 5 per cent and
L'Autre Politique on 4 per cent.
The total is also rather less than the 49 per cent of the votes which the
anti-Maastricht cause garnered in France's 1992 referendum on the treaty.
'There were two issues then, a vote on Mr Mitterrand as president, and the
vote on Maastricht,' responds Mr de Gaulle.
'We have had very strong attendances at our rallies, people are more worried
than they have ever been about the development of Europe.'

FT  19 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Price to pay for drachma
at polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's currency crisis has placed the economy squarely at the centre of
the campaign for next month's European elections. The success or failure of
the socialist government's efforts to protect the drachma will have
repercussions that go well beyond the Athens financial markets.
'The Greeks are very aware of currency fluctuations,' says Mr Michalis
Papayiannakis, a Euro-MP for the small Left Alliance party. 'Whether it's
taverna owners catering for tourists or farmers whose children study abroad,
the socialists will be judged by what happens to the drachma. A devaluation
would be costly at the polls.'
While the campaign has been slow to start, opinion polls put the governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) several percentage points ahead of
the conservative New Democracy party.
One early poll gave Pasok 42 per cent of the vote, to 37 per cent for ND and
9 per cent to Political Spring, the right-wing party led by Mr Antonis
Samaras, the former foreign minister. The remainder would be split between
the Left Alliance and the Greek Communist party, still unblinkingly
Stalinist.
However, the socialists dismiss the European election as 'no more than a
live opinion poll' on the government's performance during its first eight
months in power, and appear to be conserving their energies for local
government elections in October.
One reason is that even before the drachma started coming under pressure,
the economy was showing few signs of emerging from recession. Though the
socialists have been adding to the bloated public sector payroll,
unemployment is projected to rise again this year.
By October, however, funds from the EU's new structural package for poorer
member-states will have started to arrive. The government should be able to
launch several large infrastructure projects out of Greece's Ecu16.2bn
(Pounds 12.5bn) share of the package, mainly in highway construction.
The socialists' reluctance to pay much attention to the European elections,
also reflects the unpopularity of European Union institutions with Greek
public opinion, following the Commission's decision to start legal
proceedings against Greece for its blockade of the former Yugoslav republic
of Macedonia.
The Greek presidency of the EU is also being glossed over because of a
widespread perception that most EU member countries have a hostile attitude
towards Greece.
On the other hand, there is growing anger in Pasok over the exclusion of
several prominent pro-European personalities from the party's new executive
bureau - among them Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the European affairs minister.
New Democracy is unlikely to be able to exploit voters' disenchantment with
the socialists, as Mr Miltiades Evert, who took over as leader after last
October's election defeat, has so far failed to build a consensus among the
powerful party barons.

FT  19 MAY 94 / The real contest to succeed Delors now begins: With
Sutherland in, the opaque process of electing a Commission president is made
more public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next month, European Union leaders will be sounded out by the
current Greek presidency of the Twelve on who they want to succeed Mr
Jacques Delors at the head of the European Commission.
If, as still expected, there is a loud enough murmur in favour of outgoing
Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers, this opaque selection process could be over in
minutes when the 12 heads of government convene at the Corfu summit on June
24-25.
But if a contest develops between Mr Lubbers and his fellow Christian
Democrat, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister of Belgium, then Mr Peter
Sutherland, the Irish director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, who threw his hat in the ring on Tuesday night, is in with a
chance.
Mr Sutherland, a consumate self-publicist with a nice sense of timing,
clearly thinks so. He concedes that the question is 'entirely hypothetical',
but that if asked to put himself forward, 'I would have to give it serious
consideration'. But will he be asked?
The Commission presidency race is about as permeable to outsiders as a papal
succession. EU governments leak or intimate what they say are their
preferences as the process evolves, but with the tactics and knowledge that
all 12 'cardinals' have in the end to be unanimous.
Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic affairs commissioner, has very
openly campaigned for Mr Delors' job. This has done European citizens the
service of generating what little public debate there is about who should
fill it, although it is unlikely to be him, simply because he is from
Britain, a semi-detached member state with two opt-outs from the Maastricht
treaty.
Mr Sutherland's publicly discreet declaration has enlivened the game, and
should now generate more debate.
Like Sir Leon in 1989-92, he was a forceful competition commissioner in
Brussels in 1985-88. His Euro-credentials are sound, he is ambitious, and
after securing the Uruguay Round world trade deal he is a figure on the
international stage.
After the 10-year tenure of Mr Delors, a French Socialist, EU club rules
point to a conservative from a small member state. Mr Lubbers, a cautious
Euro-Atlanticist, and Mr Dehaene, a mainstream federalist, are both
Christian Democrats from small countries who fit the bill. As an Irish
liberal, so too does Mr Sutherland.
But his only chance is if they both stay in the race, enabling him to come
up the middle as a compromise candidate.
This is still a long shot. First, the Sutherland challenge will force Mr
Lubbers to campaign, according to the word from the Hague. The Dutchman has
already been in Athens, and can be expected in other main capitals soon.
Second, the Christian Democrats are not the inner-EU club they once were.
After Mr Lubbers' own defeat in the Netherlands, they are down to the
coalitions they command in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany.
An intra-Christian Democrat fight under these circumstances is unlikely, and
Mr Dehaene is understood not to want to take on Mr Lubbers publicly.
Only Spain has sounded Mr Sutherland out, although he could almost certainly
count on Britain's support. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has no personal
warmth for Mr Lubbers, is still likely to want to get a Christian Democrat
in, and to do a deal with France, which despite its close relations with
Ireland, is more likely to favour Mr Dehaene.
Mr Sutherland has a big domestic problem to overcome as well. He is a member
of the opposition Fine Gael party in Ireland, at a time when Fianna Fail and
the Labour party govern in coalition. The current Irish commissioner for
social affairs, Mr Padraig Flynn from Fianna Fail, has made it clear he has
no intention of making way for Mr Sutherland.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, would therefore have to be
assured by his colleagues that Ireland was getting the Commission presidency
before contemplating switching horses. Yesterday in parliament, Mr Reynolds
said his own election agent was about as likely to get the job.
But the Dublin government has come under sufficient pressure from questions
in the Dail and speculation in the Irish press for Mr Dick Spring, the
foreign minister and deputy prime minister, to say in Brussels this week
that if Mr Sutherland wanted the job, he should indicate his interest.
This the Gatt chief has now done, and neither component of the Irish
coalition would relish being charged with passing up the chance of what Mr
Sutherland heavily underlined as 'a very important position for Ireland, for
Europe, and the world.' The real contest now begins.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Tighter control of derivatives urged: Report to Congress
warns of threat to financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inadequate regulation of the rapidly growing markets in derivatives,
financial instruments such as swaps and options, poses a threat to the US
and international financial system, according to a landmark report to
Congress published yesterday.
The report, by the General Accounting Office, recommends legislation to
extend regulation to all financial firms which deal in derivatives, as well
as a consistent approach to regulation from the various financial
authorities in the US.
In an unusual show of solidarity, a coalition of trade groups representing
the banking and securities industries issued a joint statement condemning
the call for tighter regulation.
The report will increase the pressure for US legislation to control
derivatives markets. Commissioned two years ago, it concludes that much of
the activity in over-the-counter markets in instruments such as interest
rate swaps and currency options is unregulated and concentrated among a few
big institutions.
The agency, which acts as Congress's investigative arm, warns that the
failure or withdrawal of any one of these institutions 'could undermine
stability in several markets simultaneously, which could lead to a chain of
market withdrawals, possible firm failures, and a systemic crisis'.
Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the key House Telecommunications and Finance
sub-committee, which is responsible for drafting legislation covering the
securities industry, indicated for the first time that he will push for
legislation.
'The question is no longer whether regulatory or legislative changes will be
made affecting the derivatives markets, but what form such changes should
take,' he said.
Staff members of the House Banking Committee, which already has its own bill
in preparation, indicated that the report would improve the chances of
legislation being passed.
Lawmakers will have the first opportunity to air their concerns today, as Mr
Markey's committee and the senate banking committee will hold hearings on
the subject. Mr Charles Bowsher, comptroller general and head of the GAO,
will appear before both to answer questions on the report.
However, early legislation in the area is unlikely, a staff member of Mr
Markey's committee indicated. He said a bill will probably not be ready
before the July recess. The House banking committee expects to publish a
final version of its own bill early next month.
Any legislation is likely to be opposed by the derivatives industry.
Yesterday, the Securities Industry Association, the American Bankers
Association, the International Swap and Derivatives Association and three
other financial services trade groups warned that further regulation would
harm the US economy by increasing the cost and reducing the availability of
derivative transactions. They criticised the GAO study for being out of date
and for failing to take into account changes that derivatives dealers and
users have made in recent years to improve disclosure, internal controls and
risk management techniques.
Derivatives, said the trade groups, 'are an essential component of modern
financial activity'. Rather than heightening risk in the financial system,
the trade groups said derivatives make it possible to quantify and manage
risks more effectively than ever before.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Hopes of rate cut fade after jump in earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, PHILIP COGGAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment and the under-lying inflation rate in the UK fell last month
but a first-quarter jump in average earnings looked set to keep UK monetary
policy on hold for the time being.
Official figures showing a seasonally adjusted 36,800 fall in unemployment,
to 2.68m in April, and an unexpected drop in the underlying rate of retail
price inflation, to 2.3 per cent last month from 2.4 per cent in March,
pointed to continued low inflationary growth in spite of April's tax rises.
However, underlying average earnings growth was an annual 4 per cent in
March. An upwards revision in earnings growth for January and February, by
0.25 percentage points to 3.75 per cent, added to concerns about future
inflation even though the acceleration largely reflected bonuses and
overtime payments.
The publication yesterday of the official minutes of the March 30 monetary
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the
governor of the Bank of England, suggested that conditions do not exist at
present for a change in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent. They agreed that
a further rate cut depended on activity weakening and inflationary pressures
staying subdued.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 yesterday, Mr Clarke said the recovery had to 'get
stronger before every man and woman feels that the country really is showing
signs of prosperity and they're more secure in their own jobs'.
Yesterday, the Department of Employment announced a clutch of statistics
pointing to growing activity in the economy. The number of unemployed
claiming benefit as a proportion of the labour force fell to a provisional
seasonally-adjusted 9.5 per cent on April 14 from 9.7 per cent the month
before and 10.4 per cent in April last year.
Fewer people became unemployed in April than in any month since October
1990. Vacancies at Jobcentres increased by 5,300 in April to 145,900, while
long-term unemployment fell.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that this upturn in
activity had yet to affect retail price inflation.
Although the 'headline' all-items retail prices index rose by 2.6 per cent
in the year to April compared with 2.3 per cent in the year to March, this
largely reflected higher taxes. The 1.2 per cent rise in the index to 144.2
in April from 142.5 in March was the biggest monthly increase for two years,
but last month's tax changes accounted for about three quarters of the rise.
At 2.3 per cent in April, underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, was at its lowest level for a generation.
The growth of average earnings prompted more alarm. Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, called for a 'firm check' to be kept on pay
settlements so that non-inflationary growth could feed through into falls in
unemployment and new jobs.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Thomas Cook's self-service travel kiosk goes on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Cook, the travel agent, is today launching what it claims is the
world's first self-service, screen-based holiday booking system.
If successful, it could allow holidaymakers to book their trips through
hole-in-the-wall machines or at screens in banks or department stores.
The system, called Travel Kiosk, allows customers to watch videos of their
intended destination - Amsterdam's canals or children shaking hands with
Mickey Mouse at EuroDisney. A Thomas Cook representative can appear live in
a corner of the screen to answer questions via a video telephone link.
By pressing an on-screen map of a city, customers can indicate which hotel
they wish to stay in and receive price information. If they want to book a
holiday, they press a 'book it' button, insert a credit card and receive a
printed confirmation and receipt.
Travel Kiosk will be tested in Thomas Cook's Marble Arch branch in London
for four months. Travel Kiosk currently offers two holiday programmes: the
EuroDisney resort outside Paris and Thomas Cook's city breaks programme.
Mr Tony Bennett, European strategic marketing and development director, said
Thomas Cook would use the trial to decide how the system could best be
employed. 'We expect to get a much clearer understanding of how this type of
advanced technology can complement the activities of our existing high
street travel shops and telephone holiday booking services.'
If Thomas Cook does decide to install hole-in-the-wall holiday booking
machines, these could either be outside its own branches or elsewhere. The
company said it had not yet begun discussions with banking or retail
partners in the project, but might do so in the future.
It said it did not believe the machines would replace its 385 high street
shops. It plans to raise the number of retail outlets to 500 over the next
two years.
However, the large travel groups have been watching the high street banks'
plans to reduce the number of their branches. While the large travel
retailers insist they intend to stay in the high street, they are also
believed to be studying alternative ways of selling holidays.

FT  19 MAY 94 / Backbench rebellion threatens sale of Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night threatened with a backbench rebellion if the
cabinet proceeds with plans to sell off 51 per cent of Royal Mail and
Parcelforce.
More than eight Tory MPs said they opposed the current proposals and may
vote against them if put to a vote, wiping out the government's likely
majority of 15 after the five by-elections are held on June 9.
To allay the fears of backbenchers, who fear privatisation could lead to the
closure of sub-post offices, ministers and Post Office management yesterday
gave guarantees to keep the postal network intact.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, insisted there would be
no change to the status of sub-post offices. Mr Mike Heron, Post Office
chairman, said it was 'unthinkable' that a privatised Royal Mail and
Parcelforce would not retain strong commercial and operational links with
the post offices.
However, Mr Robert Hicks, Conservative MP for Cornwall South East, urged
today's cabinet meeting to remove the Treasury constraints on the Post
Office, instead of privatising it. 'If that was lifted that would be the
ideal solution,' he said.
Although Mr Heseltine has committed the government to a uniform affordable
tariff, Mr Hicks pointed out that electricity privatisation led to regional
price differentials after similar assurances.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said: 'The public find it
difficult to understand why we have to privatise the Post Office when the
Germans and French are keeping their corporations in the public sector.'
Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, who last week urged Mr Heseltine to draw
back from privatising the Post Office, said: 'The case for a major upheaval
is not established nor is the rationale behind the government giving up
majority control instead of selling off 30 per cent or even 49 per cent.'
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Macclesfield's Conservative MP, said he opposed Mr
Heseltine's plan to split up the Post Office. 'I am also concerned that the
social obligation of the Post Office does not live with the rigid commercial
criteria of a private postal company which needs to make a return for its
shareholders'.
Mr Gary Waller, Tory MP for Keighley, said he wanted to discuss aspects of
the proposed privatisation with ministers.
Another backbencher privately described the government plans for Post Office
flotation as 'a privatisation too far'. One Tory MP said it could go ahead
if there were clear arguments in favour.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Price wars over name-dropping: The commercial threat posed
by generics to the world's top drugs companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A drug price war starts today. At midnight, one of the world's best-selling
drugs, the ulcer treatment Tagamet, lost patent protection in its biggest
market, the US. Its manufacturer, the Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham,
estimates that it could lose sales worth Dollars 500m a year as about 10
makers of cut-price unbranded versions - generics - enter the market.
While this is worrying for SmithKline, the world's sixth-biggest drug
company is not alone. Tagamet is just one of 17 drugs with combined annual
sales of Dollars 2.8bn in the US whose patents expire this year, according
to Goldman Sachs, the US stockbroker.
Between 1993 and 2005 drugs with total US sales of more than Dollars 27bn
will lose patent protection. None of the world's leading drugs companies is
immune to growing competition from a new generation of generic products.
The race is on to enter the generics market because of a bulge in the number
of patents which are expiring. Valium, the anti-depressant made by the Swiss
company Hoffman-La Roche, was a patented drug whose success in the 1960s
showed other groups how profitable the process could be.
The subsequent research boom of the 1970s generated the blockbuster drugs of
the 1980s. They included drugs for heart treatment such as ICI's Tenormin
(see chart), as well as Tagamet and the closely related Zantac, made by
Glaxo of the UK and still the world's best-selling compound. Drug patents
usually last 20 years and the industry is now seeing the fall-out from these
post-Valium efforts.
By unhappy coincidence for the drugs companies, healthcare costs are being
scrutinised by those who pay the bills - US employers who pay insurance
premiums, insurance companies which meet claims, and governments throughout
the industrialised world. All three groups are eager to substitute cheap
generics for costly branded drugs.
There are huge potential savings. 'The industry used to calculate that the
price of a generic version fell to less than 20 per cent of the branded
drug's price within 18 months,' says Mr Jim Hageman, the vice-president
responsible for US generics at US company Upjohn. 'Now you get the same
price fall in under 12 months.'
This is welcome news for drugs buyers, but damaging for drugs producers.
Earlier this month, the US company Syntex agreed to a Dollars 5.3bn takeover
by Hoffman-La Roche. Syntex had seen sales of its best-selling product
Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory, fall by 60 per cent after the patent expired
at the end of 1993. 'Naprosyn prices have fallen as far as 95 per cent,'
says Mr Paul Freiman, Syntex chairman.
The Davids who are humbling these Goliaths are small but fast-growing
companies. Goldman Sachs estimates that there are between 350 and 400 US
generic drugs companies, of which nine count as 'major independent firms'
but only four have sales worth more than Dollars 100m a year.
While sales of many generics are rising, it remains unclear whether
companies reliant on them will generate sufficient profits to rival
brand-name groups. Mr Peter Goldsbrough, vice-president in charge of
healthcare at management consultancy Boston Consulting Group in the UK, says
the generics business is driven by cutting costs and prices to a minimum to
win market share.
'There will always be room for a few fast-moving companies,' he says, 'but
the real winners may be alliances led by the big drugs makers.'
This idea is already taking root. Bristol Myers Squibb, the second-biggest
US drugs company, launched its US generics subsidiary in 1989 and claims it
is now so big that it would be the country's seventh-biggest drugs
manufacturer if it stood alone.
Last week, Bristol Myers Squibb bought 25 per cent of a German generics
company, Azupharma. The deal followed acquisitions this year by German
chemicals and drugs makers Bayer and Hoechst of stakes in US generics
companies Schein and Copley for Dollars 310m and Dollars 546m respectively.
More important still are the takeovers by Merck of Medco, the US drugs
distributor, last summer for Dollars 6bn, and of Diversified Pharmaceuticals
Services by SmithKline Beecham for Dollars 2.3bn this month. Defence against
the threat of generic competition is part of the rationale for these deals.
Medco and Diversified are the middlemen of the drugs industry, linking the
drugs companies with healthcare buyers. They offer a complete range of drugs
and will now promote their owners' products first whether they are branded
or generic drugs.
But such deals are an expensive and unproven means of defence by drugs
groups against generics. Lawyers and chemists have a record for beefing up
old patents.
Glaxo's Zantac was first patented in a crystalline form that proved
difficult to produce. Eventually a second, more stable, form was patented
and it is this version that has been so successful. The patents for the
early version lapse next year while the later version is protected until
2002.
Glaxo's reliance on its newer Zantac patent was exposed in March when Ciba
said it had found a way of manufacturing the earlier crystalline version of
Zantac. Glaxo shares have underperformed since the Ciba announcement. In
April Glaxo filed a patent-infringement suit in the US against Ciba, which
is still 18 months away from the launch of its generic rival.
SmithKline Beecham says it would have been happy to follow Glaxo and file a
patent on an improved version of Tagamet. 'We looked at that but it wasn't
possible for us to improve Tagamet,' says Mr Jerry Karabelas, president of
SmithKline's North American pharmaceuticals business. Instead, SmithKline
launched its own generic version of Tagamet last week. It will also supply
the generic to Lederle, part of American Cyanamid, the US drugs maker, to
sell only to pharmacies.
But these strategies - supplying distributors with generics and launching
generics - have their weaknesses.
The now-subsumed Syntex decided it would supply the generics market but was
overwhelmed by the number of competitors, according to experts at the US
stockbroker Lehman Brothers. The UK company Zeneca, then part of ICI,
entered the generics market with a version of its heart treatment Tenormin.
ICI's market share fell by 70 per cent in the two years after the patent
lapsed in 1991 because the generic was too expensive and made customers more
receptive to independent generic suppliers, adds Lehman Brothers.
The recognition is rapidly dawning on the drugs industry that despite
efforts to counter the generics threat, there is only one genuine defence:
new products with new patents.
SmithKline Beecham, for one, says this is a central plank of its
anti-generics strategy. It will continue to fight to extract full commercial
value from Tagamet, but it sees its future in two new drugs with potential
to match the sales Tagamet enjoyed in its heyday: anti-depressant Seroxat
and anti-viral Famvir.
But not every company has suitable drugs in clinical trials ready to come to
the market as older drugs lose their patents. And relying on scientists to
rescue the business is risky: the cost of research and development is about
Dollars 200m a product, while it typically takes seven years from patent
application to market launch, with no guarantee of success.
The fact that SmithKline Beecham and others have decided to make new product
development, however risky, the priority in fighting generics is an
admission that branded prescription drugs will eventually succumb to
unbranded rivals when their patents expire.
The decision to make new product development a higher priority than the
defence of drugs whose patents have expired might be welcomed by
governments, health insurers and employers eager to see lower prices for old
drugs and prepared to pay a price for genuinely innovative cures.
Drugs companies might like it less, but those that take this route fear that
the alternative is to go the way of Syntex.

Austrian Airlines should break even this year, according to Mr Mario
Rehulka, the joint chief executive, Reuter reports from Vienna.
Plans presented at yesterday's annual meeting see turnover rising to
Sch11.1bn (Dollars 917m) from Shl10.5bn, while pre-tax losses should be cut
to Sch351m from Sch728m. Net losses are forecast at Sch140m, but it should
be possible to cancel these with cost cutting, Mr Rehulka said.
Bayer, one of Germany's big three chemical groups, will acquire two units of
Veba's rubber subsidiary, Huels, Reuter reports from Leverkusen.

Lindt &amp; Spruengli, Switzerland's oldest chocolate maker, plans to take over
the troubled Austrian confectioner Hofbauer, Reuter reports from Zurich.
Lindt signed a letter of intent with Hofbauer on May 11 and a definitive
takeover of the Austrian company is planned for June, according to Austrian
media reports.
The unlisted family-owned Austrian company made a loss in 1993 of Sch24m
(Dollars 2.05m), but was reported to have blamed this on the loss of a big
client and construction costs.
Hofbauer is reported to have bank debts of Sch330m. Lindt reported a 1993
group net profit of SFr39.8m (Dollars 28m).

FT  18 MAY 94 / Chinese PM attacks US over dissidents: Deadline near for
Clinton decision on trade status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Li Peng of China has maintained Beijing's tough stance on
human rights, accusing the US of giving undue weight to the views of a 'tiny
number' of dissident Chinese.
Mr Li told Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, former US national security security
adviser, that China resented interference in its internal affairs and would
not yield to outside pressures.
'Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes,' he said, 'if they base their
understanding of China merely on the words or views of a tiny number of
Chinese to the exclusion of the interests and wishes of all other Chinese
people.'
The Chinese official was speaking just weeks before a deadline for President
Bill Clinton to decide whether to extend China's 'most favoured nation'
trading status in the US.
The administration last year called for 'overall, significant improvement'
in Beijing's human rights behaviour as a pre-condition for renewal of
China's privileged trade access to the US market.
Mr Brzezinski, who was in charge of the 1978 negotiations leading to
establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing, was
reported to be carrying a message to the Chinese leadership urging further
concessions on human rights before the 3 June MFN deadline.
Pressures are building on Mr Clinton from human rights groups and the US
Congress to impose penalties on China. But Mr Clinton has indicated that he
favours MFN renewal.
China, meanwhile, continues to exert pressure on its dissident community
with further detentions and little sign that its most prominent political
prisoner, Mr Wei Jingsheng, is about to be released.
Mr Wei, who served 14 years of a 15-year sentence for counter-revolutionary
actions before his release last year, was detained in April and accused of
'new crimes'. His family fears that Mr Wei may be facing another long jail
sentence.
China yesterday briefly detained leading student dissident Mr Wang Dan after
he met a US television reporting team. He was released by Beijing police
after being held for an hour.
Mr Wang was taken from his home after meeting reporters from the American
NBC television network. His residence is under constant surveillance by
Beijing's public security.
China, in its continuing game of 'cat and mouse' with the Clinton
administration over MFN, has recently released two high-profile dissidents
on health grounds.
They were Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, two of the so-called 'black hands'
behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests. These releases were seen as gestures
to placate US human rights concerns.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Christopher in first Jericho visit
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERICHO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on a Middle East peace shuttle,
yesterday became the first world statesman to visit Jericho - seat of the
newly created Palestinian autonomous area evacuated by Israel last week.
Mr Christopher's visit was clearly made to demonstrate US support for the
Palestinian self-rule deal: 'One of the reasons I came here is to make it
clear to our Palestinian friends that they are not alone in this endeavour
and that we in the international community will stand with them as they make
their historic transition.'
In the blazing heat Palestinian security forces lined the roads of Mr
Christopher's motorcade as an honour guard for the US secretary who spent
much of the day trying to avoid being photographed in front of pictures of
Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman.
Most Palestinians in Jericho, however, shunned the Christopher visit
preferring to flock to a gathering point near the Jordanian border crossing
to welcome home Mr Jibril Rajoub, a hero in the West Bank and Mr Arafat's
adviser on the occupied territories. Mr Rajoub, a 41-year-old veteran
activist of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, was allowed to cross the border with
20 other deportees yesterday after having spent six years in exile in Tunis
and 17 years in Israeli prisons.
He will become the overall PLO security boss for the West Bank. Thousands of
jubilant Palestinians, many from Mr Jibril's Hebron home, were in Jericho to
greet him.
The days events were overshadowed as Palestinian extremists shot dead two
Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and armed Israelis ignored
Palestinian policemen and entered an ancient Jericho synagogue with their
automatic rifles.
The Islamic Resistance Hamas movement claimed responsibility for the attack
in the West Bank less than 24 hours after armed Jewish settlers and Israeli
soldiers shot and wounded 18 Palestinians in Hebron, the flash point of
Arab-Israeli violence.
Meanwhile, Israeli officials handed over daily administration of the Gaza
Strip and Jericho to Palestinians yesterday putting 850,000 Arabs under
self-rule for the first time in their history. The embryonic Palestinian
self-rule authority took over 38 departments which have control from health
to taxation.

FT  18 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Company statements encourage a firm
market - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London stock markets closed firmly yesterday, taking their lead from the US
Treasuries, but without news from the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open
Market Committee (FOMC). UK traders were hoping that before London opens
today the Fed will have delivered the keenly desired  1/2 percentage point
increase in its key interest rates, hopes fulfilled by the Fed's rates move
last night. 'Anything less than a half-point rise will not please the
market,' was the consensus view at last night's London close of trading.
After a slow start, UK shares moved ahead and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 7.9
better at 3,123.5. Although trading volume was higher than on the previous
day, traders stressed that it was a cautious session. Stocks were easier for
much of the day but the Footsie once again bounced convincingly when it
slipped towards the 3,100 area; the day's low was 3,106.8. A survey of the
distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry was favourably
received.
Although the awareness that the FOMC meeting would not even start until late
in the London trading day inhibited activity in UK stocks, there were plenty
of company trading statements to keep dealers on the alert.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has shown itself both independent of and
somewhat weaker than the FT-SE 100 in recent sessions, finished just 0.3 up
at 3,707.2. Seaq volume of 638.5m shares compared with 671.7m on Monday when
retail business was worth Pounds 1.43bn.
Favourable trading comments from a handful of blue chip companies aided
sentiment. Allied-Lyons and Hanson said the year had begun satisfactorily
and BOC, seen as an industrial market leader, traded heavily after a very
positive interim statement.
The stock market remained hopeful that determined action by the Fed would at
last settle nerves in the bond market and, by stabilising bond yields,
enable the equity market to respond to improvement in corporate dividends
and earnings.
While the markets will remain on tenterhooks until there is news from the
FOMC meeting, London today faces important data on the domestic economy. UK
analysts expect these to confirm that domestic inflation has remained
subdued, and thus ward off fears that UK base rates will be forced higher
later this year.
Building and construction issues rose after the latest official statistics
showed new orders were 10 per cent up from the 1993 first quarter. But there
were further signs that investors are turning away from the engineering and
vehicles sec-tors, believed by some analysts to have outrun the economic
recovery.
Progress was somewhat patchy elsewhere in the market, with the food and
brewery stocks showing a mixed picture as investors waited for the March
retail sales statistics.
Pharmaceuticals stocks continued to move nervously as attention focused on
SmithKline Beecham and investors pondered the likely effect of the expiry
this week of US patents on Tagamet, SmithKline's high selling anti-ulcer
drug.
London outperformed other leading European stock markets yesterday and UK
traders sounded relatively confident that the Footsie can at last climb away
from 3,100, if only the bond markets can establish themselves in a new
trading range. Strategists were encouraged by the increase in trading volume
as the market rallied yesterday afternoon.

FT  18 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: BOC strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better than expected interim figures from BOC, the industrial gases and
healthcare group, saw the shares deliver the best performance of any FT-SE
100 stock.
By the close the share price had risen 29 to 715p, the highest level since
April 8. Turnover of 5m shares was the second-highest this year.
Analysts said they were impressed with the performance of all BOC's
operating areas, especially natural gases, which improved sharply, and
healthcare, where they said problems seem to have boottomed out. 'It looks
as if the worst is over for BOC,' said one of the market's more bearish
analysts. Most current year forecasts were being lifted to around the Pounds
340m mark.
News that the London Financial Futures and Options Exchange had decided
against joining Reuters' Globex trading system hit the shares, which closed
the day 7 off at 485p. Analysts said the development was disappointing but
not life-threatening for the product, which has been steadily increasing its
trading volumes.
However, one analyst said the danger of a major exchange such as the Liffe
not joining could have a negative effect on other exchanges' decisions -
making Friday's likely announcement by the Deutsche Termin Boerse all the
more important.
First-quarter profits from Sedgwick, the biggest of the UK insurance
brokers, came in well below most market estimates and put the shares under
heavy pressure during the morning.
But a clarification of the figures at the post-results meeting with analysts
helped to restore a measure of confidence in the shares, which ended 6 down
on balance at 197p, having fallen to 194 1/2 p immediately following the
numbers. Turnover of 9.2m in Sedgwick was the second most heaviest this
year.
Some analysts had pencilled in first-quarter expectations of Pounds 50m and
more, against the actual result of Pounds 43.6m. The company pointed out,
however, that it had warned of a change in the way profits were spread out
over the year. Profits forecasts for the year were being fine-tuned after
the meeting but mostly were clustered around the Pounds 98m to Pounds 100m
mark.
The reporting season in the drinks sector continued in similar vein, with
Allied-Lyons reporting full-year figures in line with market forecasts.
As expected, the brewing side performed poorly, prompting louder murmurs
from analysts for the company to consider divesting its interest in the
Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture. There was also some disappointment over the
lack of news on the disposal of the group's food business. The shares dipped
on the results announcement but picked up on a positive analysts' meeting.
They closed 5 up at 595p.
A busy pharmaceuticals sector saw Fisons dip 4 to 140p following the annual
meeting. SmithKline Beecham came under pressure early in the session
following news of a challenge to its UK patent on its biggest selling drug,
the antibiotic Augmentin, from Norton Healthcare. SmithKline shares fell to
394p but later rallied to finish a net 5 off at 400p.
Speculation that steel and wire group ASW Holdings may soon be on the
receiving end of a bid from British Steel did the rounds in the market. The
former gained 8 at 213p, while the latter eased 3 to 142 1/4 p in trade of
12m shares.
RTZ raced up 20 to 887p and looked set to attack the stock's all-time high
of 897p set in February, following the latest upsurge in copper prices and
talk of a strong buy recommendation from BZW.
The English power generators moved in opposite directions, with National
Power, the biggest of the UK's generators, sliding 6 to 437p on good
turnover of 3.5m shares ahead of preliminary results expected this morning,
and following suggestions that a big line of stock had been offered to the
market in mid-morning.
PowerGen, on the other hand, remained in demand and closed 9 higher at 484p.
Both stocks were strong performers on Monday.
Kleinwort Benson was said to have provoked the big switching from Scottish
Power into Scottish Hydro-Electric. The latter was finally 3 off at 339p and
the former a further 9 lower at 359p, after 356p.
The Pounds 22m rights issue from Higgs &amp; Hill, the housebuilding and
construction group, saw the shares retreat 10 to 122p.
Shares in publishing group Emap, which have underperformed the market by 14
per cent over the last three months, jumped 18 to 385p after Smith New Court
turned buyer of the stock, changing from a sell recommendation.
Mr David Forster at the broker said things were improving at Car Week
magazine after disappointing initial sales, and that the group should
benefit from the better than expected upturn in UK advertising. Around 47
per cent of Emap's revenue is derived from advertising.
Redrow, the housebuilder, made an unauspicious market debut, the shares
opening around 118p and slipping back to 115p at one point before rallying
and ending the session at 128p, a significant discount to the 135p offer
price.
The day's other debut stock, Capitol Group, the security operator, fared
much better, opening and closing at 133p compared with the 125p flotation
price.
Woolworth and Comet owner Kingfisher was buoyed by positive notes from UBS
and Robert Fleming, as well as talk of a bullish meeting with a private
client broker. The shares moved ahead 7 to 564p. An upbeat agm statement
from Goldsmiths helped the shares rise 5 to 115p.
Financial worries continued to overhang Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel
and the shares relinquished a further 15 to 405p.

<TEXT>
Turnover in Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson jumped to 24m shares, making it the
day's most actively traded FT-SE 100 constituent, after it surprised the
market with an increase in the dividend. The stock gained 6 at 269p.
The hefty volume included a single block of 6.9m traded at 259p, thought to
have been part of a tax-related deal.
News on the dividend accompanied interim figures which revealed headline
profits of Pounds 683m - against Pounds 507m a year earlier - a figure which
disappointed several analysts. The dividend was raised from 2.85p to 3p.
Mr Geoff Allum at NatWest Securities was among those disappointed by the
profits figure but conceded: 'As a yield stock the increase in the dividend
overshadows the less than expected profits.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lacklustre session in stock index futures brought poor volume as dealers
continued to await the outcome of last night's US Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,124, up 18 from its
previous close and at parity with the underlying cash market. Turnover, at
8,345 contracts, was one of the lowest in recent sessions.
Earlier, June started trading at 3,110 and briefly slipped to 3,103 before
recovering to trade around the 3,120 level for the next few hours. Dealers
said the little activity there was consisted of sideways trading with light
buying seen occasionally.
The firm opening on Wall Street led to an advance in June during the
afternoon and a peak of 3,130 was recorded in the last half-an-hour of
trading before a bout of profit-taking just before the finish.
Traded options remained buoyant and saw turnover of 30,174 contracts, of
which 9,381 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,035 in the Euro FT-SE
option.
British Gas was the most actively traded stock option with a total of 2,745
contracts. Most of the trading was carried out in the June 280 calls. It was
followed by Hanson, also busy in the cash market, with a total of 2,568
contracts.

The strong rally on Wall Street and in US bond prices sparked a sharp buying
spree in Brazilian shares, boosting equities in Sao Paulo by 5.5 per cent in
what brokers called a 'selective return' of foreign investors. The Bovespa
index ended 858 points up at 16,484. Turnover was Cr286.3bn (Dollars
180.4m).
Investors were also focusing, domestically, on an expected congressional
vote on a key presidential decree.
Approval of the temporary presidential decree, which created Brazil's single
price index on March 1, is regarded as a key element for the continuation of
the government's anti-inflation policy.

uncertainty with its upward move on the discount and fed funds rates.
Traders said the resource-heavy Toronto market was also heartened by the
boom in base metal prices.
The TSE-300 composite index finished 60.9, or 1.45 per cent, stronger at
4,269.1, while advancing issues outpaced declines by 419 to 316. The index

stock closed CDollars  3/4 firmer at CDollars 43 3/8 .
Simmonds Communications fell 11 cents to CDollars 1.57 in spite of reporting
higher first-quarter earnings.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges on rise in
discount rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks surged yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve
announced an aggressive tightening of monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 49.11 higher at 3,720.61, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.88 at 449.37. Activity on
the New York SE was brisk, with trading volume reaching 311.7m shares, while
rising issues outnumbered declines by 1,344 to 827.
The secondary market indices closed with little net change, however. The
American SE composite was up 0.30 at 431.98, while the Nasdaq composite
finished 0.39 off at 711.52 after recovering from a solid loss earlier in
the session.
It was a quiet but restless morning on Wall Street, with the afternoon
expected to bring a move by the central bank to lift short-term interest
rates for a fourth time since early February.
Although few were willing to make big bets under the circumstances, the
overall tone was generally positive. The Dow blue chip index held modest
gains throughout the morning, even though higher rates could lead to a
flagging economy and slower growth in corporate earnings during the rest of
the year.
Indeed, most investors feared a slight increase in rates more than a bold
one. The uncertainty hanging over the markets since the Fed began its
gradual shift to tighter money has depressed share prices at least as much
as the expected impact of more restrictive policy as the year progressed.
In the event, the Fed acted boldly, lifting both the discount rate and its
Fed Funds target rate by 50 basis points each. In doing so, the central bank
said it had achieved its goal of moving policy to a neutral position, after
last year's 'accommodation'. Its announcement suggested that the latest Fed
action would be the last in the current series, which began in early
February.
The response in the bond market was rousing, with prices on the long end of
the maturity range showing powerful advances. Stocks responded in kind,
especially those which are expected to benefit the most from the current
economic recovery.
Alcoa advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/2 and International Business
Machines jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/4 . Caterpillar was Dollars 1
1/4 higher at Dollars 111 3/8 , while Deere appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 72 1/4 .
McDonald's climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 and Procter &amp; Gamble put
on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 56 7/8 .
The retailing sector was active as several leading chains reported their
quarterly results. JC Penney weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 7/8 after
disappointing the market with net income of 84 cents a share, compared with
78 cents a year ago. By contrast, Dayton Hudson moved forward Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 80 3/4 on a 37 per cent improvement in earnings.
Home Depot, a building supply retailer, climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 42
5/8 after issuing its results.
Technology issues, except IBM, were generally weaker. Hewlett Packard
dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 75 1/2 , in spite of reporting a 25 per
cent increase in orders. Micron Technology was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 30 3/8 and National Semiconductor closed Dollars  7/8 easier at
Dollars 17 1/2 .
The early retreat on the Nasdaq was led by Lotus Development. The computer
software concern plunged Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 amid speculation,
denied by the company, that its inventory levels had risen.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hesitant Tokyo mildly
easier as Hong Kong falls 2.3%
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors remained inactive ahead of the US Federal Reserve Board's Open
Market Committee meeting, and the Nikkei 225 average declined on index
linked selling by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was finally 54.91 easier at 20,133.53 after a day's low of
20,067.41 and high of 20,174.93. A fall in futures prices on the overnight
Chicago market prompted a bout of arbitrage selling earlier in the session.
Small-lot buying by overseas investors later eroded some of the losses.
Volume remained low, totalling 251m shares against 285m. The Topix index of
all first section stocks dipped 2.58 to 1,636.43 and the Nikkei 300 lost
0.54 at 299.13. Declines led rises by 614 to 369, with 188 issues unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.19 firmer at 1,335.88.
Market participants said many investors were still wary of any surprises
from the spate of company earnings announcements and were reluctant to
commit funds in spite of the yen's easing against the dollar.
Meanwhile, technical indicators were also worrying some dealers. 'The three
short term moving averages nearly converging, the lack of volatility and the
very low volumes seem to be precursors of a sharp move up or down,' said Mr
Yutaka Nakai, analyst at Daiwa Securities.
High-technology stocks were higher on buying by foreign investors. Hitachi,
the day's most active issue, rose Y5 to Y1,000 and Toshiba put on Y3 at
Y798. Large-capital steels were also firmer, with Kawasaki Steel up Y2 to
Y385.
Some banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank slipped Y10
to Y1,950. Profit-taking depressed real estate and pharmaceuticals shares,
previously bought as laggards. Mitsubishi Estate receded Y20 to Y1,220 and
Takeda Chemical Y30 to Y1,230.
The rise in gold and copper prices buoyed mining shares. Dowa Mining
advanced Y12 to Y585 and Sumitomo Metal Mining added Y13 at Y925.
The low volume encouraged individual investors' trading in speculative
stocks. Ga-jo-en Kanko forged ahead Y27 to Y184 and Wakachiku Construction
gained Y9 at Y669. Brother Industries, however, relinquished Y13 to Y706 on
profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 57.55 to 22,366.93 in volume of 20.4m shares.
Aoyama Trading, the men's suits retailer, fell Y120 to Y4,180.
Roundup
Regional markets continued mixed, awaiting the outcome of yesterday's FOMC
meeting.
HONG KONG closed sharply lower as the brief detention of a prominent Beijing
dissident raised worries about the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation
trade status with the US in a market already cautious about US interest
rates.
The Hang Seng index dropped 208.71, or 2.3 per cent, to 9,044.70. Turnover
came to HKDollars 4.88bn, against a revised HKDollars 4.10bn on Monday.
The market was also speculating about a possible early agreement with China
on financing Hong Kong's new airport, but news that the Sino-British Airport
Committee will meet on Friday to discuss the issue emerged after the market
close.
Among blue chips, HSBC slid HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 83.50, China Light
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 40.75, Swire Pacific 'A' HKDollars 2 to HKDollars
55.50 and Hutchison HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 30.
TAIPEI retreated 1.6 per cent as profits were taken following the market's
recent rally. The weighted index fell 98.95 to 6,015.83 in TDollars 67.3bn
turnover.
Financials led the falls, with China Development down TDollars 3.5 to
TDollars 129.5 and Cathay Life losing TDollars 6 to TDollars 257.
SINGAPORE was steady with selective buying seen among blue chips. The
Straits Times Industrial index finished 14.08 higher at 2,304.49.
Shipyard stocks were firmer amid talk that a foreign brokerage was issuing
covered warrants on a basket of shipyard companies.
KUALA LUMPUR was easier after a moderate session, a spate of selling near
the close having pushed the index down from an early high. The composite
index settled 5.88 off at 991.96 in volume of 76.4m shares.
Telekoms, facing a competitive telephone system, weakened 90 cents to
MDollars 18.70.
SYDNEY retreated after Monday's sharp gain. The All Ordinaries index
finished 14.9 down at 2,096.0 after touching 2,094.8. Turnover was ADollars
548m.
BHP slipped 30 cents to ADollars 17.94, Western Mining dropped 23 cents to
ADollars 7.85 and Pasminco shed 15 cents to ADollars 1.80. CRA contrasted
with a rise of 8 cents to ADollars 18.46. Turnover amounted to ADollars
560m.
In the banking sector, ANZ slipped 7 cents to ADollars 4.75, Westpac dipped
4 cents to ADollars 4.98 and National Australia eased 2 cents to ADollars
12.04.
WELLINGTON eased, with most of the day's activity taking place in Fletcher
Challenge. FCL closed 1 cent up at NZDollars 3.90 as the NZSE-40 Capital
index shed 8.21 to 2,118.04 in turnover of NZDollars 51m.
SEOUL turned higher in a technical rebound after its three-day
consolidation, and the composite index improved 5.21 to 946.87 ahead of
today's market holiday.
MANILA rose strongly, helped by an overnight gain on Wall Street for PLDT,
together with buying of San Miguel and Manila Electric. The composite index
moved forward 34.20 to 2,936.43. Turnover was 950.4m pesos.
PLDT put on 50 pesos at 1,955 pesos, San Miguel 'B' increased 5 pesos to 235
and Manila Electric added 5 pesos at 330.
BOMBAY's 30-share index registered a 41.59 decline at 3,802.50 after
index-weighted shares fell, but the broader market was steady after a dull
session.
Hopes remained high, however, that forward trading will be allowed to resume
after a meeting of the Securities and Exchange Board of India on Friday. The
old badla, or carry forward system, was banned in mid-March on the grounds
that it led to excessive speculation.
KARACHI ended firmer on heavy buying of polyester stocks, reflecting
expectations of higher profits because of a cotton shortage.
The KSE 100-share index rose 4.43 to 2,189.44.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Lufthansa shows further
weakness in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The markets were generally lacklustre awaiting the outcome of yesterday's
FOMC meeting.
FRANKFURT moved into retreat as Monday's record levels failed to inspire a
follow on of momentum. The Dax index eased back 11.40 to 2,259.71 during the
official session. Turnover was DM7.4bn.
Sentiment was upset by news that Schneider debt was higher than anticipated,
with estimates of between DM3.5bn to DM4bn.
This report affected the banks who are exposed to the property group with
Deutsche Bank, for example, slipping DM10 to DM781.50.
Lufthansa continued to weaken on a further round of selling following
disappointment over its results on Monday, the shares down a further DM11.30
to DM190.20, bringing accumulated losses since the start of the week to 8
per cent.
In contrast, Volkswagen rose DM3.20 to DM528.70 on news that it was
extending working hours at some plants. Nikko Europe issued a buy
recommendation earlier in the week, noting that the restructuring programmes
should begin to bear fruit in the near term. Furthermore, said Nikko, 'Seat
should report a considerable reduction in last year's loss of DM1.8bn, with
a return to profit in 1995 the target'.
PARIS took a long look at Eurotunnel which held a shareholders meeting
yesterday to approve its rights issue plans. The group lost FFr1.30 to
FFr35.10 but off a session low of FFr34.70 as the CAC-40 index rose 7.47 to
2,195.17.
Turnover was a moderate FFr3.7bn.
Oil stocks were active as Merrill Lynch added Elf Aquitaine and OMV to its
stock selection list and deleted Total and Repsol. Of the French groups Elf
was FFr2.70 stronger at FFr429.70 while Total shed FFr4.90 to FFr342.10.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, down FFr12 at FFr598, denied that it was planning
to raise fresh capital, while Club Med slipped FFr1.90 to FFr446.10 as it
forecast a better first half result.
MILAN began the new account in resilient mood, the Comit index rising 11.89
or 1.5 per cent to 801.62, as worries subsided about the outcome of today's
parliamentary confidence vote.
Blue chips led the advance. Generali rose L1,567 or 3.3 per cent to L48,470,
Fiat advanced L149 to L7,188 and Olivetti was L128 or 4.5 per cent higher at
L3,003.
Ciga, the hotels group advanced L76 or 6.8 per cent to L1,188 in heavy
volume of 36m shares amid speculation about stock building as its rights
issue sold out.
Ferruzzi put on L149 or 7.1 per cent to L2,233 as the company launched its
L1,340bn rights issue. Cir rose L134 or 4.7 per cent to L2,994 as its
L1,060bn rights issue began, although technical problems blocked business in
the rights throughout the session.
ZURICH continued on the upward track as domestic buying, and an absence of
foreign selling, took the SMI index 18.1 higher to 2,727.1.
Roche certificates added SFr155 to SFr6,705 as presentations to analysts
yesterday and on Monday were well received and details of the Syntex
takeover appeared to be positive. The certificates have picked up 9 per cent
since their low on May 9, following 1993 figures and the Syntex acquisition.
However, analysts noted that yesterday's demand came from Swiss banks,
buying for their own account, and that sentiment remained fragile.
Nestle, another recent weak performer, rose SFr20 to SFr1,135, on the
perception that recent falls had been overdone. Brown Boveri rose SFr13 to
SFr1,275 ahead of today's first quarter figures, with some analysts
forecasting a rise of up to 75 per cent in profit.
STOCKHOLM maintained a strong run with Astra featuring ahead of first
quarter results that came out after the close of business. The Affarsvarlden
general index added 7.70 to 1,552.50.
Turnover was SKr2.6bn.
Astra reported a 15 per cent rise in first quarter pretax profits - the B
shares ended the day up SKr1 at SKr161.
Volvo, which releases its first quarter figures today, picked up SKr13 in
the B shares to SKr758.
AMSTERDAM struggled to find some incentive to move and, with the exception
of a Fl 2.30 loss in KLM to Fl 53.20, due in partly to profit-taking
following good gains last week, the AEX index finished the session just 0.81
ahead at 413.81.
MADRID overcame some early profit-taking with late demand taking the general
index up 0.71 to finish at the day's high of 334.91 in heavy turnover of
Pta36.59bn.
Banks, however, remained under pressure with Banesto Pta25 easier at
Pta1,120. Argentaria lost Pta100 to Pta6,000 and Santander was marked Pta80
lower at Pta6,350.
Agroman, the construction company, was the day's leader, rising Pta75 to
Pta825.
ISTANBUL rose 3.55 per cent on a technical rebound following a reduction in
interest rates. The composite index put on 549.02 to 16,032.68. On Monday
the index lost 1 per cent.
ATHENS ended slightly lower in light trading as investors remained worried
about the prospect of devaluation. The general share index lost 7.95 at
944.94. Turnover was Dkr2.7bn.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg extends its correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African shares extended Monday's downward correction, ignoring more
positive fundamentals and attracting little buying interest, Reuter reports.
Dealers said steady selling in small blocks had impacted on price levels and
gold's rally above Dollars 382 an ounce had done little to reverse the
softer trend.
Shares have been making strong gains recently following the country's
transition to all-race rule.
The overall index was 41 lower at 5,457, industrials fell 74 to 6,633 and
the gold shares index lost 19 at 1,835.
Among the actives, De Beers eased 25 cents to R109 and Minorco declined R2
to R102.
Pockets of strength included a R2.50 gain to R95 for JCI, a R3 advance for
Anglovaal to R138 and a 25-cent rise to R32.50 for Remgro.
Independent banker Investec Bank made a strong R3 climb to R58 after
reporting a 48 per cent increase in attributable earnings to R80m for the
year to March 31.
Parent company Investec Holdings posted earnings per share of 164.7 cents,
up from 122.4 cents, and was bid R1 higher to R45. Investec also said it
would proceed with a R180m rights issue, terms of which are yet to be
announced, to fund further expansion.
South African Breweries receded R2.50 to R100 and Iscor softened 6 cents to
R3.36, while gold issue Vaal Reefs slipped R7 to R373.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Caution before US move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges spent a nervous session in London as markets went through
the day positioning ahead of the US Federal Reserve's eventual decision to
tighten monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith.
In the run-up to the announcement of an increase in the 3 per cent discount
rate to 3.5 per cent, and comments by a Fed spokesman that the Fed wanted to
see a 50 basis-point rise in the fed funds rate, markets had eyes for little
else beyond the meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee.
The market had been widely discounting a 25-50 basis-point rise in the funds
rate, and the possibility of a discount rate increase.
The Fed's failure to lift rates at the normal funding time (15.30 GMT) left
observers thinking that the tightening was likely to have been a more
complicated proposition than many had assumed.
The dollar, which edged higher after the Fed announcement, had closed in
London at DM1.6683, down from DM1.6740 on Monday. Against the yen, it
finished at Y104.380 from Y104.580. It ended in New York at DM1.6720 and
Y104.525.
Elsewhere, sterling weakened against the D-Mark to finish in London at
DM2.5095 from DM2.5174. The Greek drachma remained fairly steady as the
central bank maintained a policy of high interest rates to defend the
currency.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said the Fed's
decision to add reserves to the system through overnight system repos had
clearly been a holding operation.
The market's expectations were clear from the federal funds rate, which
stood at around 4 1/8 per cent at 15.30 GMT, the typical time for Fed
action, against a then-official level of 3 3/4 per cent.
In Europe the D-Mark was generally slightly weaker, closing in London at
FFr3.426 against the French franc from FFr3.429. The Spanish peseta regained
some ground to close at Pta 82.63 against the D-Mark from Pta 82.84.
In Greece, high overnight rates underpinned the drachma. Overnight money was
at 200 per cent, with the drachma steady at Dr148.30/35 to the D-Mark.
The Italian lira ended at L956.6 from L961.5 per D-Mark, helped by the
belief that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will win the confidence vote in
parliament today.
In Germany, the repo rate is expected to fall by about 5 to 8 basis points
today after the Bundesbank announced another variable rate repo. Call money
was steady yesterday at 5.35/50 per cent, compared to the existing repo rate
of 5.35 per cent.
After the Bundesbank cut its official rates by 50 basis points last week,
the market speculated that the repo rate might fall by as much as 10 to 15
basis points. That position has since been abandoned and most analysts are
predicting a more modest move.
Ms Phyllis Reed, European fixed income strategist at BZW, said the
Bundesbank had succeeded in arresting the pessimism about the extent to
which German interest rates were still likely to fall. It was thus
'perfectly reasonable to return to a dull, few points per week, rate of
cuts'.
The Bundesbank, she said, could not be expected to maintain the aggressive
pace of easing seen between the last two sets of official rate cuts.
Ms Reed predicts a cut of, at most, 5 basis points today, although she
maintains the view that three-month money rates are likely to fall to about
3 3/4 per cent by the year-end.
Sterling traded in a very narrow range against both the D-Mark and the
dollar. It closed in London at Dollars 1.5043, from Dollars 1.5039 on
Monday, and finished easier at DM2.5095 from DM2.5174.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg in London,
commented: 'The events of the past week have taken some of the political
risk premium, that had been accumulating in the currency, away for a while.'
This had allowed the 'growth story' to show through more prominently.
The pound's progress, however, is likely to be subject to no further
setbacks for the dollar. If the dollar falls back, sterling is unlikely to
be secure above DM2.50.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England injected Pounds 571m liquidity
into the system to clear a Pounds 550m shortage. Overnight money traded in
the 4 to 4 3/4 per cent range.
Futures markets generally lost ground, with the prospect of higher US rates
generally bad for short-term contracts. Some of the longer month short
sterling contracts performed better. Amid modest volumes, the December
contract closed 9 basis points lower at 93.96.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said a large portion of the
volumes came from a single sale by a European bank. He added that trade had
been nervous, with traders reluctant to take positions, but he predicted
that the market was preparing for a decisive move.
The December Euromark contract finished at 95.20 from 95.25.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finnish mill project gets green
light - A Pounds 365m chlorine-free pulp project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After five years of planning and two years of difficult financing talks, a
project to build the world's largest chlorine-free pulp mill was finally
given the go-ahead last week. The FM3bn (Pounds 365m) facility, to be built
at Rauma in western Finland, will be capable of producing 500,000 tonnes of
softwood pulp a year and is scheduled for start-up in 1996.
Even six months ago a decision to proceed with the plan would have looked
reckless. Softwood pulp prices had plunged to just Dollars 380 a tonne from
a peak of Dollars 840 in 1989, and there was little sign of the long-awaited
recovery in the pulp and paper sector. Since then pulp prices have risen to
Dollars 560 a tonne and the broader paper industry cycle appears to have
turned.
In spite of the improved climate, however, United Paper Mills, the biggest
shareholder in the project with a stake of 45.6 per cent, only came on board
at the last minute. It also appears that the financing problems were only
resolved through a FM1.2bn state guarantee for a large proportion of the
loans. A persistent difficulty has been risk concentration, with many of the
leading Finnish banks already heavily exposed to the companies behind the
project.
Most analysts, though, believe that the fundamentals favour construction of
the mill. They note that it will come on stream at a time when pulp prices
are expected to be at or near their next cyclical peak.
This explains the determination of Metsa - Rauma, the operating company, to
stick to the 1996 start-up target. Excavation work began last autumn, well
before the project was finally approved, and impetus has been maintained
with the immediate placing of FM600m worth of contracts.
At least half of the mill's output will be consumed by UPM and Metsa -
Serla, the second largest investor in the project with 27.8 per cent. UPM
will supply its Rauma paper mill and Metsa - Serla its Kirkniemi magazine
paper plant. Metsa - Botnia, which previously supplied much of this pulp,
will offer more of the commodity on the open market.
Much of the new mill's remaining output is expected to go to western Europe,
primarily for use as a reinforcing agent in the production of recycled
paper. This is an attractive market, with forecasts suggesting that recycled
paper demand will grow at 4.5 per cent a year over the next decade, compared
with overall growth in pulp demand of only 1.6 per cent a year.
In tapping this outlet, Metsa - Rauma believes its environmentally-friendly
totally chlorine-free (TCF) pulp will give it a considerable marketing
advantage. It notes that its production costs for TCF will be no higher than
for conventional pulp because it is installing the required equipment from
scratch.
The mill's cost structure is also favoured by the 35 per cent fall in
Finnish wood prices over the past three years. Although prices have started
to rise again, mirroring the pulp industry's improved fortunes, the prospect
of increased wood imports from neighbouring Russia in the next few years
should ensure that Finnish wood suppliers moderate their price demands.
Developments in the broader market could also favour the mill. Analysts say
several Canadian pulp mills may be forced to close on environmental and
financial grounds. They also believe there will be sales opportunities in
the Far East, where paper demand is growing rapidly and long-fibre softwood
pulp is expected to be in short supply. Most of the pulp capacity coming on
stream in countries like Indonesia is of the short-fibre hardwood variety.
Not everyone is convinced, however, that the pulp market recovery is fully
established. Many commentators say short-term factors, such as restocking
and disruptions to hard wood supplies from Russia, have driven the price up
further than supply and demand factors warrant. They believe pulp prices
could easily fall later this year.
But the mill's backers are undeterred. They point to the mill's economies of
scale and the technical advantages it will enjoy from utilising the very
latest equipment.
They also stress that their financial calculations are relatively
conservative. The mill is expected to break-even after depreciation and
interest with a pulp price of below Dollars 500 a tonne. At Dollars 550 a
tonne the return on capital will be 10 per cent - much higher than the pulp
industry has managed traditionally.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Precious metals hold on to gains -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Precious metals held most of their overnight gains yesterday, despite doubts
about the authenticity of SILVER'S surprise rise in New York.
The London silver price caught up with a 20-cent jump to Dollars 5.55 1/2 a
troy ounce, while GOLD put on Dollars 2.80 at Dollars 383 an ounce and
platinum edged up Dollars 1.85 to Dollars 400.
At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures failed to get going after a
sluggish start and the July position ended the day at Pounds 947 a tonne,
down another Pounds 5. Traders said the continuing absence of industry
offtake and producer activity was keeping dealings quiet. New York offered
no direction, holding little changed following its weaker opening.
London Metal Exchange prices all moved higher with copper and aluminium (see
story above). Notable gains were registered by TIN, which touched 14-month
peaks, and NICKEL, which, although running into heavy sales on approaches
towards Monday's 19-month highs, was underpinned by speculative buying.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper and coffee keep London's
bull run going
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Natural Resources Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper and coffee markets remained the prime targets of investment fund
buyers yesterday, with prices adding to recent prodigious gains. But the
party appeared to be over for oil traders as nearby prices for North Sea
crude slipped back below Dollars 16 a barrel.
The London Metal Exchange reported another steep drop in its copper stocks
yesterday, triggering fresh fund and speculative buying. This not only sent
copper's price spiralling upwards again but dragged other metal prices along
with it. Copper for delivery in three months was Dollars 2,220.50 a tonne at
the close but prices surged again in the final minutes of LME after hours
'kerb' trading and the red metal moved to its highest level for 15 months,
to Dollars 2,229, up Dollars 50 from Monday's kerb close.
LME copper stocks fell by another 18,625 tonnes to a fresh one-year low of
406,075 tonnes.
Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, suggested that only
copper and aluminium among the LME metals had any fundamental reasons for
price rises, although 'the fundamentals for lead are slowly turning in its
favour.'
He said that there had been some panic buying by copper consumers yesterday
and buyers were ready to step in any time the price dipped. 'But it is
wishful thinking to expect a summer price lull this year,' he added. Mr
Arnold said he had no idea how high the copper price would go, but when it
reached its peak it would fall back a few cents a pound. He doubted if it
would go back below Dollars 2,000 a tonne.
Three-month aluminium closed Dollars 22 a tonne up on the LME at Dollars
1,374.50. Mr Arnold said the market was now confident that producers would
stick to the international agreement to cut annual output by between 1.5m
and 2m tonnes.
Meanwhile, coffee futures remained in strong favour on both sides of the
Atlantic, with some traders believing New York had taken over the running
from London.
The July arabica futures contract in New York was consolidating yesterday
afternoon after a rise of more than 12 cents a pound on Monday. But the
September contract spent some time stuck at its one-day upward limit of 6
cents a pound as it struggled to catch up with July's earlier rise.
'The fireworks seem to be in New York,' said one London trader. 'The sign of
a true bull market is a strong backwardation (when contracts for nearby
delivery are at a premium over forward positions). The backwardation is
starting to deepen in New York whereas it's starting to weaken in London.'
The steam had certainly not gone out of the London market yesterday. The
July robusta position hit a peak of Dollars 2,150 a tonne before easing
slightly to close up Dollars 93 at Dollars 2,145. This puts it 79 per cent
up on the year, having risen by 50 per cent in the past three weeks.
Oil prices yesterday bucked the upward trend in other commodities. The
benchmark Brent Blend for July was quoted at Dollars 15.85 a barrel in late
London trading, well down on its close on Monday of Dollars 16.13.
Traders attributed the decline to profit-taking at the end of a three month
rally, which has seen oil prices rise by about Dollars 4 a barrel from the
five-year lows recorded in mid-February.
Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at the London office of US investment bank Lehman
Brothers, said other factors affecting prices included the end of a buying
spree by US refiners in advance of the American summer holiday driving
season, and continuing strong output from the North Sea fields.

Booming business in base metals has led to fierce competition for
experienced traders, prompting rising salaries and bonuses, reports Reuter.
Banks and trading companies, fearful of losing top people, are offering a
range of incentives to existing staff, while others are seeking to lure
dealers through attractive signing-on terms.
An annual package of salary plus bonus totalling Pounds 130,000 to Pounds
140,000 is not uncommon, according to a trade house executive.
'The (metal trader) recruitment market is buoyant,' said a leading job
consultant.
All areas of metals trading are expanding as business from consumers and
producers increases and investors buy in the hope that prices will continue
to rise as the world steps out of recession.
Banks, financial institutions and other players see metals as a growing
source of business. There has been a rush of derivative product issues, such
as warrants on baskets of metals, regarded as the commodities most likely to
benefit from an economic revival.
A further boost to business has come from rising demand from mining
company's for long-term packages to hedge their price risk.
As the metals business is small compared with bond and foreign exchange
markets, turnover in dealers has become particularly active. 'We have been
busy since the start of the year,' another recruitment consultant said.
The number of floor members on the London Metal Exchange is rising. Sucden
UK, a subsidiary of French broker Sucres et Denrees, becomes the 18th member
later this year.
At least one other company may follow suit, while the number of associate
broker clearing members is also rising. US securities house Kidder, Peabody
International, part of General Electric Company, was recently elected to
this category.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU pulp makers in 'home-made
mess'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European pulp and paper companies will escape an even worse recession than
the last one only if they refrain from building up extra capacity too
quickly, an industry leader warned yesterday.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman of KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging
group, told a Financial Times conference on world pulp and paper that it
would take time to resolve the 'home-made mess' of overcapacity.
All sectors apart from newsprint had operated well below 90 per cent
capacity utilisation during the past few years and were expected to return
to operating rates above 90 per cent only in 1995 or 1996, he said. 'Current
overcapacity will only disappear if the leaders of European paper companies
act responsibly. If they do, the outlook is excellent. If not, the future
will be even worse than what we experienced during the last few years.'
Timber, pulp and paper producers worldwide are emerging from a severe
recession that has forced many into radical restructuring. Optimism that the
industry has turned the corner has been fuelled by a strong recovery in pulp
and paper prices.
But Mr van Oordt said rising prices were creating 'an artificial situation'
in Europe. 'Other economies - the US and Asia - are doing better than our
own and are siphoning off the raw material and pushing prices up. Our
economies in Europe are not yet strong enough for us to pass on our costs to
our customers.'
He said EU companies had to close the competitive gap with other players in
the industry, notably in North America and Scandinavia. Further
rationalisation of mills was needed.
In Finland, the average mill size had risen from 142,000 tonnes to 241,000
tonnes between 1980 and 1992. In the US, the figure had gone from 92,000
tonnes to 134,000 tonnes. But the average mill size in the EU had increased
from 22,000 tonnes to just 42,000 tonnes.
On the bright side, demand for paper was expected to remain healthy, 'a
unique starting position in a European setting where most industries are
troubled by low- or no-growth conditions,' he said.
The continued demand for paper in the electronic age was underlined by Mr
Alain Soulas, chief executive of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French
paper manufacturer. 'The psychological value of the printed page is still
high, as is shown by the rapid rise in demand for printers,' he said.
Growth in the west European market would continue, he said, but European
paper companies must look to opportunities in the Far East, Latin America
and eastern Europe to become more competitive globally.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (6): Little farms
and little industry - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beyond the high-tech centre of Toulouse and the industrial towns of Tarbes,
Albi, and Rodez lies a vast rural region - bigger than Belgium or the
Netherlands. A world apart from the space research and electronics design
conducted in the regional capital, it has its own economic structure and its
own concerns.
Over the past few years, these concerns have become more pressing. Mr
Etienne Lapeze, president of the regional agricultural industry federation,
cites a lengthy list of problems, from rural migration to the effects of
Europe's common agricultural policy and the impact of cheap imports. He
believes that the challenges can be overcome, but not without significant
adjustment.
At the root of the various problems lie some traditional weaknesses in the
region's agricultural sector. Despite steady growth in recent years, farms
in the Midi-Pyrenees are relatively small - 51 per cent are less than 50
acres, and only 13 per cent bigger than 124 acres. As a result, investments
to improve productivity or irrigation have been constrained.
More seriously, the region suffers from a relative lack of agricultural
industry. 'We have a huge agricultural region but a weak processing base,'
says Mr Georges Bories of INRI, the agricultural research institute. 'Much
of the raw materials are shipped elsewhere for treatment.'
Such weaknesses have been compounded by the liberalisation of the French
agricultural market - a result of the CAP and the Gatt accords concluded
last year after much protest from French farmers, particularly in south-west
France.
The effects, says Mr Lapeze, have been severe. In addition to the reduction
in prices for agricultural products such as cereals and oil seeds, he argues
that the measures have penalised farmers who invested to make their land
more productive. To illustrate the point, he cites the case of a farmer who
produces three tonnes of cereal per hectare and another who produces just
one tonne. With the fall in prices per tonne from FFr3 to FFr0.90, resulting
from liberalisation, and with a subsidy of FFr3,000 per farmer, it is the
more efficient producer who suffers.
For Mr Lapeze, Gatt negotiations have brought few benefits to offset such
costs. 'Gatt has weakened rather than strengthened the rules of agricultural
trade,' he says, adding that factors such as social protection must be taken
into account. The impact of Chilean apple imports, for example, would be
much reduced, he argues, if there were international rules to safeguard
working conditions and social protection there.
To counter these challenges, the region's agricultural organisations have
embarked on strategies of diversification and a focus on increasing the
value of production in the sector. One example is the seeds industry, which
has seen considerable development in production and research. Large
companies in the sector, such as Rustica and France-Mais, have established
bases in the region and are working with local research institutes to
develop the sector. Successes include resistant and high yield seeds for
maize, which have seen strong demand from French farmers.
'It is a sector which is very important for the future,' says Mr Bories. 'It
has a high value added content, and the Midi-Pyrenees has already
established a strong base in research and development.'
Traditional products are also being steered towards an emphasis on higher
value. This is partly being achieved through the introduction of labelling
and the establishment of brand image. From Roquefort cheese to garlic,
cassoulet and beef, local producers are seeking to establish brand
identities. 'If you can distinguish yourself from other products, then you
can establish an image of quality,' says one farmer. 'This brings protection
against competitors and falling prices.'
The biggest potential for value-added production, however, lies in the
creation of large agro-industrial groups in the region. To encourage the
process, the region's agricultural co-operatives and agro-industrial groups
have formed a joint body, called Promia, to help develop links between
research organisations and the public and financial sectors. 'The resources
are present,' says one Promia member, 'but we have to strengthen our
activities in processing and in areas like branding.'
The success of such initiatives will determine whether the agricultural
sector can resist the increasing pressures it faces. Mr Lapeze estimates
that the region's 80,000 farms will fall to 60,000 as a result of
demographic trends - in particular, the ageing of the rural population. A
further 10,000 farms could be threatened by the impact of Gatt and the
common agricultural policy. But he is optimistic. 'We have a resilient
culture and some formidable trumps,' he says. 'A focus on quality and
investment should allow us to keep many of these jobs.'

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (7): Brain, not
brawn, is the key to the future - Paul Cheeseright examines the region's
academic-industrial nexus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Sunflower husks can be turned into cellulose and used as a thickening agent
in paints. This was established at an agri-industries laboratory in Toulouse
where scientific work is taking place in an effort to breathe new life into
the harassed agricultural sector.
Every year students arrive at the design centre of Aerospatiale-Avions,
where the Airbus is assembled, and take part in research projects, while
Aerospatiale engineers provide tuition at the two graduate engineering
schools, the grandes ecoles, with which it maintains close relations.
Pierre Fabre, the second largest privately-owned pharmaceuticals group in
France, will by the end of this year establish an international centre to
study skin ageing at one of the Toulouse university hospitals.
These links between the academic and research world, on one hand, and
industry, on the other, point to the broad economic and scientific policy
espoused by national, regional and local government and paid at least lip
service by the private sector.
This policy is to assure economic growth and sharpen an international
commercial edge by creating a cluster of industries and academic
institutions, where each feeds off the other and the future is brain, not
brawn; white collar, not blue collar.
In terms of people, the infrastructure is already there. Figures trip off
the tongues of Toulouse enthusiasts: nearly 90,000 university students, four
universities, 10 graduate engineering schools in and around, about 350
research laboratories, about 11,500 research workers, 10,000 jobs created a
year and so on.
But in terms of securing a future through growth, the policy is unproven.
Recession has shown no mercy. Unemployment in Toulouse has not been less
than the national average.
What is clear, however, is the paramount role of the public sector. Of the
11,500 research workers, the private sector, according to official figures,
employs just 1,500. Most of the university laboratories are supported either
by the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the National
Institute for Health and Medical Research, both state bodies.
CNRS officials note that it directly manages 20 laboratories in Toulouse and
is in association with 40 others. Not that there is anything surprising in
this. The scientific research the laboratories undertake will have a
commercial application only in 10 or 12 years' time. 'In a public laboratory
we must be creative,' says Mr Gerard Goma, who runs a biochemical and food
engineering laboratory.
Such creativity is now spinning off into joint research ventures between the
public sector institutions and Matra on space computing, Alcatel on
multimedia communication, Technofan on turbomachine acoustics and Siemens on
automotive electronics. Such joint activity is more widely practised in the
Midi-Pyrenees region than anywhere else in France. Clearly, the nearer the
scientific idea gets to the marketplace, the greater will be the interest of
the private sector.
But in some cases relations between the public sector scientists and
industry are bound to be difficult. Mr Michel Wright, research director of a
pharmacology and toxicology centre, says that as a public laboratory, it has
to publish its results, but this is unacceptable to pharmaceutical
companies, the main potential clients for its work.
'The best way to collaborate with the pharmaceutical industry is to provide
them with complementary results, exploring along the lines of their own
interests,' Mr Wright says.
More generally, the classic form of contact between a company and a
laboratory is the research contract, where, in effect, companies are using
the expertise of state institutions to undertake work which they cannot, or
are unwilling, to do themselves.
The extent to which this is taking place is difficult to gauge precisely. Mr
Alain Costes, director of the centre for automation and systems analysis,
calculates that 220 such contracts are signed each year in Toulouse. City
officials variously claim 700 or 1,000 contracts a year.
Of these contracts, 70 per cent are signed by companies employing 500 or
more people, suggesting that in France, as in the UK, there remains the
perennial economic problem of how to raise the technological levels of
smaller companies.
Technology transfer in Toulouse is seen largely as a question of bringing
companies and the broad academic sector into collaboration. Specialists in
this area acknowledge that little has so far been achieved in spreading
expertise into small manufacturing companies.
Mr Costes has tried to solve this problem by setting up affiliate clubs
whereby his institution can reach small companies via large companies that
already have relations with the laboratory and sub-contracting arrangements,
and via colleges, lower down the academic strata, with which small companies
are more likely to have contact.
Smaller companies probably are most likely to be drawn into the
industrial-academic nexus through larger groups, as assemblers, like
Aerospatiale, redefine their relations with component suppliers and their
sub-contractors. The overriding demand for quality and safety in the
finished product creates its own demand for higher technology.
In Toulouse, it is acknowledged that there is a lot to learn and deep
cultural divides to cross. As one businessman noted of the academics, they
are very good at devising products and coming up with ideas, but they are
bad at industry.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (8): Where rugby is
rife - The region's top sport derives from Great Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The taxi driver from Castres is silent as he steers his Renault along the
road to Toulouse. Silent, that is, until mention of the word rugby.
'Thousands of us went to Paris for the championship final last year,' he
says proudly, before launching into a scrum-by-tackle analysis of the
victory over Grenoble.
It is a familiar topic in the Midi-Pyrenees. Mr Michel Castel, the mayor of
Albi, becomes visibly excited when the sport crops up in conversation. From
then on, investment strategies and the prospects of his Socialist party are
described in terms of teamwork, tries and conversions. Professor Remy Pech
of Toulouse-Mirail University, author of a book on the history of rugby, is
similarly animated by the subject. A former player himself, he describes how
his father would cycle 150km from Narbonne to watch the regional final in
Toulouse.
Such a common enthusiasm in such an ostensibly disparate group of characters
reflects the importance of rugby in the region. 'All the people here care
about rugby,' says Prof Pech. 'It provides a powerful social bond at every
level, from quartier to village, town and city.'
It has done so for the best part of a century. News of the game travelled
east from Bordeaux in the 1890s and quickly took root in the Midi-Pyrenees.
As in Bordeaux, there was an important British influence in the birth of the
game. For example, Higgens, the captain of one of the first Toulouse teams
was the son of the British consul.
The expansion of the sport was rapid. From urban teams based on professions,
notably vets and miners, rugby passed to villages and rural districts.
Schools, according to Mr Pech, played a valuable role in rugby's
dissemination throughout the region.
The reasons behind the rise of rugby in the Midi-Pyrenees are as numerous as
the local teams. For Mr Castel, the sport gives expression to the character
of the region's inhabitants. 'It combines our Latin fire with the sense of
teamwork and community,' he says. 'Rugby accommodates all types of people,
from the large powerful forwards to the smaller fast wingers. When you look
around the street, you can imagine a position for everyone.'
The amateur status of the sport, and the strict rules which govern it, have
also encouraged strong ties with the local communities. Mr Labbe, treasurer
of the Stade Toulouse rugby club, points out that, unlike in soccer, it is
extremely difficult to transfer rugby players from one club to another. The
players must have a licence to represent their team and this requires a job
or a student certificate. As a result, teams are largely comprised of local
players.
There are exceptions. Rob Andrew, the England captain, played for Toulouse
in 1992-1993. Emile N'Tmack, the quicksilver Toulouse three-quarter who also
plays for the French national team, came originally from the east of France.
Such exceptions, however, tend to confirm the rule. Andrew had to find a job
with a local company. The Toulouse club helped relocate N'Tmack's brother
and mother when he decided to join them.
Despite its strict codes and amateur status, the attraction of the game is
strengthened by the social and economic opportunities it provides. Laurence
Spanghero, one of six rugby-playing brothers in an Italian immigrant family,
used his fame on the rugby pitch to develop his Cassoulet food empire. A
local government representative in the Pyrenean town of Tarbes refers to
employment advertisements in which rugby skills are cited as an advantage
for applicants.
Unsurprisingly, given the level of local support for the sport, the region
has emerged as a powerhouse of French rugby. Many of France's leading teams,
from Castres to Colomiers and from Toulouse to Tarbes, come from the
Midi-Pyrenees.
While Castres claimed the championship last year, Stade Toulouse look good
for the 1994 title. Training in the Stade des Sept Deniers, the players work
together as a slick unit. In the play-offs, they have already overcome an
important hurdle by beating local rivals Colomiers by 32-12. Should they go
all the way to the trophy, their exploits will provide any conversation that
is needed in the taxis of Toulouse.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (5): Test of
economic strength - The region is suffering the 'unemployment of growth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession which has blighted the French economy since the end of 1992
has not spared the Midi-Pyrenees. In Toulouse, as elsewhere in the region,
unemployment has risen to the national average of just over 12 per cent as
contraction in the international aerospace industry has compounded the
pressures facing traditional textiles, mining and agricultural industries.
But just as the region surrounding Toulouse retains a sense of cultural and
political autonomy - stemming from its historical role as a powerful and
distant provincial city - so its economy possesses its own peculiarities.
Its strength in high technology, for example, suggests that the economy's
foundations may not be as badly shaken as cities elsewhere and that Toulouse
and the Midi-Pyrenees may be better placed to resume expansion once the
economic environment improves.
The particular nature of the local economy is reflected in its employment
trends. Mr Robert Marconis, an expert in regional development at the
University of Toulouse-Mirail, describes the rise of joblessness in the city
and its environs as 'the unemployment of growth'.
Unlike northern France, he argues, where jobs have been lost through
large-scale redundancies, Toulouse has continued to create employment and
has drawn economic migrants to the regional capital. Between 1982 and 1990,
for example, the population of the city and its environs swelled by about
100,000 - partly as a result of people from outside seeking job
opportunities in the area.
A second, equally important characteristic of the regional economy is the
importance of cyclical rather than structural problems in its industries. A
case in point is the aerospace industry which, with Aerospatiale, Airbus and
a host of sub-contractors is one of the most important manufacturing sectors
in the region.
When the international aerospace industry sneezes, Toulouse and its environs
 -with more than 30,000 employees in the sector - catch cold. The deep chill
which has afflicted aircraft orders over the past few years has had a
significant effect. Aerospatiale, for example, plans to reduce staff in the
region by between 700 and 800 this year in response to declining orders and
losses of FFr3.8bn in 1992 and 1993.
But the problems facing the aerospace sector are likely to prove temporary.
'We have seen the worst of the downturn and we can expect recovery sometime
between 1996 and 1997,' says Mr Bernard Keller, director of communications
at Aerospatiale and a member of the regional development committee.
The resistance of the Toulouse economy has also been helped by a nascent, if
growing, diversification. The electronics and software industries have
established themselves in the region, while the biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals sectors are currently expanding in Toulouse and nearby.
For the region's older industries, however, the situation is more difficult.
Textiles have been hit hard by the impact of cheap imports, notably from
Asia, although Mr Jean-Pierre Gilly, a research director at LEREP, the
economics research centre, argues that many companies have been able to
fight back through the introduction of higher value added products and
relatively high productivity.
In mining and metallurgy, the downturn has been less equivocal. Over the
past 20 years, the mines in the Albi-Carmaux area have seen employment fall
from almost 7,000 to about 300 today. The depressed aluminium market and the
removal of the price advantage of hydro-electricity following the
establishment of nationwide energy prices by Electricite de France, have
raised a serious question mark over the regional operations of Pechiney, the
state-owned aluminium group.
In areas with declining traditional industries, the response has been to
diversify and to implement policies of reconversion. In Albi, for example,
Adirac, a development organisation which groups local government and
industry bodies, has created 2,000 jobs over the past nine years. It has
done so partly through Sofirem, a venture capital organisation, which has
provided funding to local companies.
Albi, unlike much of the the Midi-Pyrenees, has the benefit of an industrial
tradition. Elsewhere, the lack of an entrepreneurial or industrial
background represents an obstacle to the creation of new enterprises. 'We
never had an industrial bourgeoisie here compared with some other cities
such as Lyon,' says Mr Marconis. He says the region remained on the margins
of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, partly because of the
tendency of the dominant landed classes to invest in property and real
estate.
The result has been that much of the region's industry has been imposed from
outside, often as the result of the transfer of research and infrastructure
by the state. Again, the aerospace and aeronautics industry provide a case
in point. President de Gaulle's decision to move the top engineering and
pilot training schools to Toulouse and the establishment of the CNES
aeronautics centre there in the 1960s provided a hub for the sector's
expansion.
There are increasing signs, however, of spontaneous local business
development. The strength of scientific and research institutes has prompted
the creation of a number of small companies working either as
sub-contractors or niche players in the aerospace, electronics and
biotechnology sectors. Mr Gilly describes the development of a 'tissue of
small and medium-sized companies' in the electronics and aerospace field,
citing the example of Verilog, which specialises in computer systems for
satellites.
The pace of this development has been slowed by recession. In several cases,
such as Verilog, the lack of capital has resulted in acquisition by larger
groups. But most industrialists in the region believe the process will
regain momentum once the economy shows evidence of recovery. Here too, there
are encouraging signs. Insee, the national statistics office in Paris,
argues that France is now emerging, if gradually, from its malaise. As it
does so, Toulouse appears well placed to benefit.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (4): The mayor's
strategy / Profile of Dominique Baudis of Toulouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse, puts the emphasis on quality rather
than quantity. 'It is not my vision for the city to grow to millions of
people,' he says. 'What I want is to create a pole of excellence, not a
gigantic town.'
It is a strategy which, so far, has worked rather smoothly. Although only
Europe's 50th city in terms of population size, Toulouse has drawn some of
the biggest names in leading edge industries. Airbus, Aerospatiale and
Motorola are just some of the companies which, drawn by the city's strength
in research and development, have established headquarters or substantial
operations there.
But Toulouse has not been spared a bout of the turbulence which has shaken
France in the past few years. 'Like every town, we have been hit by the
crisis. Since 1991, we have lost jobs,' says Mr Baudis, pointing out that
the unemployment rate has risen to the national average of just over 12 per
cent of the workforce.
In Toulouse, the downturn has been exacerbated by the depression in the
international aerospace industry. Mr Baudis describes the sector as the
'engine of the economy', but rejects criticism that it is too dominant in
the city's economic structure.
'It is fashionable to say that we are too concentrated on aerospace. But
even today we produce 15 aircraft a month compared with seven 10 years ago,'
he says. 'In 1995 to 1997 we will see another increase,' he predicts, adding
that, unlike steel or cars, the problems afflicting aerospace are cyclical
rather than structural.
Mr Baudis is also keen to emphasise that Toulouse is not a one-industry
town. He points to the rapidly growing electronics sector, the rise in
biotechnology industries and the importance of service activities to
demonstrate the degree of diversity in the local economy. 'We are the second
centre in France for software development,' he says, citing the decision by
Storagetek of the US to site a large operation there.
The arrival of the US group is the latest step in a familiar pattern. Much
of the rise of Toulouse, from industrial backwater to high-tech
manufacturing centre, can be explained by its ability to attract capital
from the rest of France or abroad. France Meteo, the meteorological
institute, and Air France are just two of the scalps collected by Toulouse
over the past year in its drive for inward investment. To maintain the
process, Mr Baudis sees a need for 'balanced development' - the promotion of
cultural, scientific and urban projects to strengthen what he calls the
'quality of life aspect' of Toulouse.
Such 'balanced development' allows Mr Baudis to aim for several targets at
once. The urban renovation projects also provide a Keynesian boost to the
economy to help it through its current problems. 'We are working now to
intervene to support economic activity by big investment projects,' says Mr
Baudis, citing the decision to bring forward the FFr3bn project to construct
the second line of the city's metro.
Fiscal stimulus, however, is not to be achieved at the expense of the
budget. Mr Baudis has reduced the city's debts from FFr2.9bn five years ago
to about FFr600m today. This has been achieved despite a policy of
maintaining local taxes at their current rate for the past six years - a
strategy regarded as necessary to encourage corporate investment.
The future prospects of the city, however, need a broader perspective than
its budget situation and the list of public works under way. Critics of the
development of Toulouse, and there are many in the city's universities,
believe that it remains an artificial creation, built through the
decentralisation of research centres and industry and lacking deep roots in
the surrounding region. The criticism is repeated by representatives of
neighbouring towns who say the region's economy is dangerously centred on
Toulouse.
Mr Baudis accepts that more must be done to increase economic links with the
rest of the region. 'There is an important gap and we must reduce it.' He
says the construction of autoroutes from Toulouse to Albi and Tarbes is a
step in the right direction and should be followed by an expansion of the
regional railway network. He points out, however, that the development of
Toulouse is in the interests of the neighbouring cities. 'There are many
indirect effects,' he says, adding that he favours the growth of regional
centres, rather than curbs on Toulouse.
The need for extended communications, however, spreads well beyond the
neighbouring towns of the Midi-Pyrenees. Of particular significance is the
development of commercial and social ties with Spain.
Various initiatives are under way. The C6, for example, which groups
Toulouse, Montpellier, Barcelona, Saragoza, Palma-Majorca and Valencia, is
designed to promote economic co-operation among these cities. For Mr Baudis,
the main target is Barcelona, which he describes as the 'motor of Spain.' He
hopes for a high speed train link which will bypass Bordeaux from northern
France on its way to Toulouse and down to Barcelona.
Given the financial situation of SNCF, the French railways system, such a
project is not likely in the near term. But once built, it would put Mr
Baudis' town still more firmly on Europe's economic map.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (3): Education and
research bring in the foreign investor - Industrial location
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Take a drive around Toulouse and the importance of foreign investment to the
local economy quickly becomes apparent. From Siemens of Germany to Sony of
Japan and Motorola of the US, many of the world's largest business groups
have their names on manufacturing or research centres in the city and its
environs.
It is a similar story in the region as a whole. A total of 284 foreign
companies, in manufacturing and services, have invested in the Midi-Pyrenees
 -from agricultural groups in the Haute Garonne department to automobile
components in Aveyron. Foreign companies now account for almost 30 per cent
of the region's industrial investment and about 24 per cent of its
industrial workforce.
Such a substantial presence is explained by several factors. In Toulouse
particularly, much of the attraction lies in the strong education and
research base which is available to industry. Ms Florence de Villoutreys,
director of human resources at Storagetek, the most recent foreign investor
in Toulouse, says that it took just six weeks to find the six engineers
needed for the data storage group's initial product line.
According to Ms de Villoutreys, the US group decided on Toulouse as an
investment location after a three-year study of 27 sites in nine countries.
In addition to the skilled workforce in Toulouse, she says the links with
research institutes were an important factor in the final decision. In
March, the company signed contracts with two engineering and science
institutes to work on their robot and data reading systems.
Similar arguments are expressed at Motorola, the first foreign electronics
group to make a significant investment in the region. 'We have always had a
close relationship with the research centres here,' says Mr Robert Aschieri,
chairman of Motorola France, citing as an example the development of high
efficiency switching systems for electric lights.
Motorola has expanded steadily in Toulouse since its first factory was built
in 1967. It has added higher value added semiconductors to its product range
from the site and is now planning to build a pure research laboratory for
advanced chip technologies.
The scale of foreign investment which has flowed into the area since
Motorola put down its roots is partly the result of a 'coat-tails' effect.
'It was encouraging for us that Motorola was here,' says Ms de Villoutreys
of Storagetek. She adds that many of the company's customers, including
Aerospatiale and Meteo France, the meteorological agency, are located in the
city.
The rise in foreign investment also reflects an aggressive search by local
authorities. The search has been strengthened since 1988 when Mr Dominique
Baudis, the mayor, established Metropolitan Toulouse, an agency charged with
promoting investment in the city and its environs. The organisation has
joined forces with BRIA, the regional development body, with which it
co-operates to secure foreign investment throughout the Midi-Pyrenees.
Foreign companies are offered a number of sites in the region, says Mr Jean
Barcellini, head of Metropolitan Toulouse. 'Some may be attracted to
Toulouse because of its strength in R&amp;D, but others may have reasons, such
as costs, to be in the countryside or near one of the other towns.' For
instance, Storagetek was shown sites in Albi and Montauban before deciding
on the regional capital.
Mr Barcellini says his organisation has helped draw about 20 companies to
the area since 1988. He is currently involved in advanced negotiations with
nine potential investors, five from the electronics sector, and two each
from the aerospace and medical fields.
The challenge, he admits, has become tougher. Increased competition from
other regions in France and from abroad has coincided with the impact of
recession to reduce the potential candidates and increase the number and
quality of offers they receive. 'Yes, it is harder, so we have to
concentrate on our strengths,' says Mr Barcellini.
For Toulouse this means an emphasis on the operating environment, rather
than on financial incentives which can be offered to prospective investors.
'In the region we can offer financial support, but in Toulouse this is
relatively limited,' says Mr Barcellini. 'Our advantage is the
infrastructure we possess, in terms of communication and in terms of science
and research.'
Such factors should continue to work to the benefit of Toulouse and the
Midi-Pyrenees. The trend of foreign investment is shifting away from
low-cost labour sites towards what Mr Barcellini describes as 'low brain
cost delocalisation'. France's second largest university town, and one of
its principal centres of high-tech research, should therefore retain a sharp
edge in the competition for foreign capital.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (2): A tale of
three cities - Despite their differences, all face similar challenges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The new autoroute from Albi to Toulouse has cut the journey time to just 45
minutes. Still heading south-east, another stretch of highway can get you
from Toulouse to Tarbes in an hour and a half. But if expanding motorway
links between the region's big cities has brought them closer together, they
remain distinct in terms of identity, politics and culture.
That much is apparent even from a cursory study of three of the region's
largest towns. Toulouse has a right-wing mayor, a developed high-tech
industrial base and covers an area almost as large as Paris. Albi, with its
picturesque town centre built around a magnificent Gothic cathedral, has a
socialist mayor and an industrial tradition in mining and metallurgy.
Tarbes, with its Communist mayor, is less picturesque. But it is nestled at
the foot of the Pyrenees, close to Spain, with which it enjoys close
cultural and social contacts.
Such diversity is hardly surprising given the size of the Midi-Pyrenees
region and the conflicting pressures and attractions to which it has been
subjected over the ages. But there is also a common thread behind the
development of Tarbes, Albi and Toulouse. All have been shaped to a certain
extent by their relationship with the French state and their strategic
importance.
The proximity of Tarbes to the Spanish border, for example, explains its
role as a traditional arsenal town. It is still home to substantial defence
industries, such as GIAT, a manufacturer of tanks and armaments. Albi, one
of the strongholds of the Cathar religious movement in the early centuries
of the millennium, became a focus of the struggle between central power and
regional sentiment. The cathedral, built like a fortress to impress the
strength of church and state on the surrounding region, stands as testimony
to the tradition of local identity,
Toulouse, itself one of the most important power bases outside Paris for
much of French history, represents a more modern example of the relationship
between the French state and the regions. Through the policies of Datar, the
state organisation for regional development, it has become one of France's
most successful cases of decentralisation. Its high technology industries in
aeronautics and space have been built around the universities and research
centres removed to the city in successive stages since the 1960s.
Despite the separate historical and economic traditions, all three cities
face a common challenge of adjustment. The closure of much of the coalmining
industry in Albi-Carmaux has forced the city to look to new investment and a
more diversified industrial base. 'The area has been hit by the closure of
mines and of a military barracks' says Mr Hubert Gallais, head of
development at Adirac, the agency charged with encouraging local investment.
'But we are rebounding. We have created 2,000 industrial jobs through our
policy of conversion.'
In Tarbes, the economic downturn has been felt through the city's largest
employers. GIAT, for example, has shed jobs as a result of reduced defence
expenditure in France and abroad. 'First we have to save the big groups,'
says Mr Raymond Erracaret, mayor of Tarbes. 'But we also need to restructure
the regional economy.'
In Toulouse, the problems are possibly less severe. The strength of its
high-tech industrial base means the economic downturn is cyclical rather
than structural. But it is faced with the need to diversify its production
and its markets.
The problems of adjustment bring occasional friction between the cities of
the Midi-Pyrenees. Mr Erracaret, mayor of Tarbes, for example, criticises
the 'Toulousaine imperialism' which has seen the regional capital expand
much more rapidly than the rest of the region. 'Development has been too
centred on Toulouse', says Mr Michel Castel, his counterpart in Albi.
In the case of Tarbes, the physical distance from Toulouse is prompting
closer links with neighbouring cities. In particular, Mr Erracaret sees the
potential for economic and social co-operation with Pau, which is in the
neighbouring Aquitaine region, and Lourdes, the nearest town in the
Haute-Pyrenees department. An agreement to share hospital resources could
represent the first step in the creation of a 'Pyrenean Metropole'.
But there is also pressure to integrate more closely the principal towns of
the Midi-Pyrenees region. 'We have to extend regional links,' says Mr
Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse. 'There is an important gap between
Toulouse and the rest of the region and we should reduce it,' he says. He
adds, however, that this should not involve curbing the development of
Toulouse, but rather the development of communications and commercial links
with the other towns.
This process is already under way. In addition to the construction of
auto-routes, the towns co-operate in attracting foreign investment.
Agreements between metropolitan Toulouse, which promotes investment in the
city, and BRIA (the regional development agency) mean, for example, that
potential investors are offered sites in Toulouse and the outlying areas.
In education, some of the department of Toulouse University have been
relocated to regional cities such as Albi. Although at an early stage, this
should allow a repeat of the experience in Toulouse, where industry has been
attracted by the educational and research base.
Political affiliations do not appear to present an obstacle to increased
regional integration. Mr Castel's light pink shirt reflects his moderate
ideology. Mr Erracaret, like many Communists in the region, comes from a
tradition of pragmatism rather than polemics. 'I don't think party politics
makes a difference in regional development,' he says.
Nonetheless, it is regarded as a vital issue. For many observers it is the
most important challenge facing the Midi-Pyrenees. 'We have a situation of
two worlds - Toulouse and the rest of the region,' says Mr Robert Marconis,
professor of geography at Toulouse-Mirail university. 'It is important to
create a more balanced growth.'

FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (1): Technology for
a second take-off - Diversification and broader regional development are the
challenges facing Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees, writes John Ridding,
introducing this three-page survey of France's biggest region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Toulouse, one of Europe's oldest university cities, has bet its future on
brain power. So far, the bet has paid dividends.
Since the 1960s, the capital city of the Midi-Pyrenees has confirmed its
position as a centre of high technology manufacturing and France's second
university city and research centre. From Aerospatiale to Alcatel and from
Motorola to Matra Marconi, many leading French and international groups have
put down roots in the city and its environs.
They have done so partly because of the policies of the government in Paris,
which has sought to reverse the concentration of economic activity in the
capital. The decision in the 1960s to locate France's space and aeronautics
research centres in Toulouse, followed by the later transfer of engineering
schools and state-owned industry, laid the foundation for private sector
investment in aerospace, electronics and related sectors.
Spared the burden of declining smokestack industries and blessed with an
enticing environment, the city has proved a magnet for many of the leading
industries of the next century.
But the success of the Toulouse experiment is not yet secure. Recession has
shaken the aerospace sector and many of the city's other main industries,
applying the brakes to its headlong expansion over the past three decades.
Beyond the city limits, it is a similar story. From Tarbes, near the border
with Spain, to Rodez in the north-east, the Midi-Pyrenees, France's largest
region, is being forced to adjust to the harsher economic environment that
is confronting traditional industry and agriculture.
The continued development of Toulouse now depends on the strategies being
employed to ensure a rebound from recession. Equally important is the need
to redress an imbalance between the development of the city and the rest of
the region. 'Our biggest problem is a problem of two worlds,' says Mr Robert
Marconis, professor of geography at Toulouse University. 'Growth has not
been diffused from Toulouse in the way that had been expected.'
On the first count, the rebound from recession, Toulouse officials are
confident. Mr Dominique Baudis, the mayor, points out that the decline in
the aerospace sector, one of the city's largest employers, is a cyclical
rather than a structural phenomenon. He believes, along with the management
of Aerospatiale and Airbus, that recovery in the sector should be under way
by 1996.
More important, perhaps, is Mr Baudis' argument that the Toulouse economy is
increasingly less dependent on the aerospace sector. 'Aerospace is an
important engine for the economy,' he says. 'But we have a powerful
electronics industry and have seen a promising diversification into new
activities such as medical equipment and biotechnology.'
Toulouse should also continue to benefit from an inflow of foreign
investment. Storagetek, the US data storage group, is the most recent
arrival and has pushed the number of foreign investors to almost 300 since
Motorola built its first European plant in the city in 1967. Like many other
international investors, Storagetek says it was drawn by the close links
between industry and research centres such as Laas, the robotics and
automation institute.
The strength of Toulouse's research base is vital. Not only does it draw
investment from existing companies, it encourages the creation of indigenous
small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Jean-Pierre Gilly, director of Lerep,
the economic research institute, says that a number of new companies have
sprung up around the larger aeronautic groups. The process has been stunted
by recession and the region's relatively weak venture capital base. But it
provides a source of growth.
For Mr Baudis, the research and technology base in Toulouse is also
essential to compete with rival European business centres, from Montpellier
to Milan. 'If you look at European cities we are 50th in terms of size. Our
strategy has to be to create a pool of excellence,' he says. 'We are in a
difficult part of the cycle, but there is much more future in high
technology and aerospace than in steel or cars.'
If Toulouse has the capacity to rebound with a more diversified and high
technology industrial base, however, the problems facing the rest of the
Midi-Pyrenees are more complex. 'The key problem at the moment is how to
make the rest of the region dynamic,' says Mr Marconis of Toulouse
University.
For many officials in towns outside Toulouse, the rise of the regional
capital has led to a concentration of resources and a vexing imbalance. 'We
need to have a more equal growth,' says Mr Raymond Erracaret, the pragmatic
Communist mayor of Tarbes, and a critic of what he calls 'Toulousain
imperialism'.
Tarbes, like other towns in the Midi-Pyrenees, is attempting to adjust to
the pressures facing traditional industry. Giat, the arms manufacturer, is
just one example of an important local employer that is cutting jobs and
reducing production. In Albi, to the north-east of Toulouse, the challenge
is to replace the jobs and subcontractors removed by the decline of the
mining sector.
In most cases, the strategies being pursued are bearing fruit. Adirac, a
public and private sector association which promotes industrial development
in Albi, has created more than 2,000 jobs, partly through the support of a
venture capital fund which targets small and medium-sized industry. The
development of its tourist sector, a growth area for all of the region, has
also strengthened Albi's resilience, while the transfer of some faculties
from Toulouse University, including materials research, should encourage
industrial investment.
How far such transfers should go is a hotly debated topic. 'There is an
important gap and we should reduce it,' says Mr Baudis, referring to the
imbalance between Toulouse and other regional cities.
But for him, as for most observers, the solution lies in providing the means
for neighbouring towns to share in the growth of Toulouse rather than
depriving the regional capital of resources. This could be facilitated, for
example, through an improvement in communications and transport networks.
The recently completed autoroutes to Albi and Tarbes are examples of this
strategy.
For Mr Baudis, there is a need to go further. In particular, he sees the
potential for a high-speed railway link, bypassing Bordeaux on its way from
northern France and heading on to Narbonne and Barcelona. Such a project
would strengthen the close economic and social links with Spain and present
Toulouse as the crossroads between northern Europe and the Iberian
peninsula. Plans have long been on the drawing board for such a project, but
are unlikely to be realised in the next 10 to 15 years.
Of more immediate concern for many of the inhabitants of the region are the
problems afflicting the agricultural sector. The biggest imbalance, however,
lies between the towns and the countryside. The effects of the European
Union's common agricultural policy and the production cuts demanded by the
Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations have added to the
hardships of the farming community and fuelled the long-term trend of rural
exodus. Mr Etienne Lapeze, vice-president of the FNSEA, the agricultural
workers' organisation, estimates that 10,000 of the region's 80,000 farms
could disappear as a result of the CAP and Gatt.
The impact on the Midi-Pyrenees has been particularly hard because of the
lack of agricultural processing industry in the region. 'We are mainly
primary producers in areas such as cereals and oil products,' says Mr
Lapeze. 'It is vital that we invest more in agriculture.'
Also important, he argues, is the need to extend production in new sectors.
He cites the seeds industry as one important area of development for the
agricultural sector. Without such investment and the introduction of higher
value added agro-industries, the gap between town and country, and
particularly between the agrarian economy and Toulouse, seems set to widen.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries jump after Fed raises interest
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY, CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a morning of quiet anticipation, US Treasury bonds prices jumped
yesterday afternoon on news that the Federal Reserve would lift short-term
interest rates by 50 basis points.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 25/32
higher at 87 9/16 , with the yield slipping about 20 basis points to 7.276
per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  5/32 at 99 1/4 , to
yield 5.894 per cent.
In early activity, investors were unwilling to make any fresh commitments as
most were convinced the Fed would raise rates again after a meeting of the
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee in Washington.
Although there was a general consensus that a policy move was imminent,
there was disagreement among traders over how aggressively the central bank
would act.
Most believed the discount rate - which the Fed charges on loans to
commercial banks - was due for an increase of 50 basis points. In its
previous three moves this year, the central bank had left the discount rate
unchanged.
However, traders were divided on whether the Fed would lift its target for
the Federal funds rate - charged by banks on overnight loans to one another
 -by 50 or 25 basis points. In each of the previous tightenings, the Fed
chose the more timid of the two figures.
In the event, it decided on a more aggressive approach, lifting both the
discount rate and Fed funds target by 50 basis points, to 3.50 per cent and
4.25 per cent respectively.
The market's response was immediate. The moves helped the long end of the
yield curve by easing any lingering concern over inflationary pressures.
Shorter-term securities benefited as well, because the bold strike appeared
to dispel the uncertainty engendered by the Fed's earlier gradualism. The
decisiveness of yesterday's move suggested it was the last in the current
series.
This view was reinforced by the central bank in its announcement of the
policy change. 'These actions, combined with the three previous adjustments
initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of
monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,' it said.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, had said his goal was to shift the
bank's policy until it had a 'neutral' impact on the economy.
European trading was also overshadowed by the FOMC meeting, leaving most
markets to drift sideways in moderate turnover.
After tracking German bonds in the morning, French bonds spurted ahead in
the afternoon. Some traders said this was caused by late short-covering in
the futures pits in expectation of bond-positive news from the Fed.
Moreover, investors were switching from Germany into France, said Mr Brian
Hilliard, senior international economist at Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull in London.
The June notional French bond future rose 0.34 points to close at 121.10.
The June Bund future was down 0.16 points in after-hours trading at 95.67.
In Germany, the focus today will be on the Bundesbank's latest allocation of
securities repurchase agreements. German money market traders surveyed by
MMS International expect the minimum rate to fall by 12 basis points to 5.23
per cent.
Trade in the UK government bond market was again quiet ahead of the results
of the FOMC meeting and today's UK economic data.
The market firmed in afternoon trading, largely on the back of strength in
US Treasuries, The June long gilt futures contract was up  5/16 at 105 11/32
in after-hours trading.
The Bank of England announcement that its May 25 gilt auction would be of
Pounds 2bn of 7.0 per cent 1997 stock, convertible into 9.0 per cent 2012
stock, for the first time on August 6, drew little reaction
'This is a very uncertain issue,' said Mr Don Smith of Midland Global
Markets. 'There is no other stock like it in the market, which makes pricing
it very difficult.' But analysts said there would be sufficient demand.
Today's release of UK average earnings and RPI data coincides with the
publication of the minutes of the March meeting between the chancellor and
the governor of the Bank of England. 'The avalanche of information could
cause quite a choppy time in the markets, especially if there is a pick-up
in earnings and inflation, and if there are signs of a disagreement between
the chancellor and the governor,' said Mr Smith.
The Italian bond market is awaiting today's vote of confidence in the Senate
on prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Although his coalition is
short of a majority in the Senate, most observers expect him to scrape
through.
Meanwhile, technical distortions at the long end of the Italian yield curve
have created buying opportunities, said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Caribbean region goes for
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean countries are joining the ranks of the faster growing emerging
capital markets. Capitalisation of the region's markets reached Dollars 322m
last year, up 41 per cent on 1992, according to the Inter-American
Investment Corporation, with the stimulus coming from changes in economic
policy in several countries.
Countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, the Dominican Republic and
Jamaica have opened their economies, allowing greater participation by local
and foreign capital in sectors such as utilities, once considered the sole
province of governments.
Increased private participation has come with the divestment of state
economic enterprises, an increase in the number of traded companies on local
stock exchanges and a broadening of ownership which has widened and deepened
the exchanges.
Many previously highly-geared companies have been restructured, making them
more competitive. The sensitive foreign exchange markets have also been
deregulated with the removal of exchange controls and the floating of
currencies.
Financial services companies have used the new climate to introduce a range
of securities on domestic markets and to move into the regional and foreign
money markets.
The growth in the Caribbean reflects a global trend in emerging markets,
according to Mr Rudolf van der Bijl of the Capital Markets Department of the
IFC. 'In 1982, 32 emerging markets had a market capitalisation of Dollars
67bn,' he said. 'In 1993 it was almost Dollars 1,400bn - a 20-fold increase.
This is clearly not a flash in the pan.'
The behaviour of emerging markets can be volatile, he reported. In 1992, for
example, the Jamaican market recorded growth of 202 per cent, the highest of
all the emerging markets. Yet last year the market dropped 50 per cent,
largely because of high interest rates.
However, the continued growth of the Caribbean markets is being hobbled by
infrastructural and institutional shortcomings. 'If the Caribbean countries
and companies wish to participate in the international market and reap the
benefits of globalisation and internationalisation, they must establish
standards and practices consistent with the international market,' Mr van
der Bijl advised.
These changes include equitable and similar fiscal treatment of income from
different types of instruments; investor protection; and a modern legal and
regulatory framework, such as a capital market law.
An adequate securities commission, compliance with internationally accepted
accounting standards and reporting, adequate clearing and settlement
standards and procedures, and modern communications are also required.
The prospects for further growth appear to be improving, with indications
that government officials are aware of what is needed.
'The development of the capital market in some Caribbean countries, such as
Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, is possible with the flotation of public
issues, the underwriting of loans, underwriting of privatisation issues, and
syndication,' said Mr Paul Chen-Young, executive chairman of the Eagle
Group, one of Jamaica's larger financial services conglomerates.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Uncertainty ahead of FOMC meeting keeps
lid on issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty ahead of yesterday's key Federal Reserve meeting in US put the
lid back on the eurobond market. Issuers who were expecting the Fed to
announce a rise in interest rates were taking no chances and there was only
a smattering of small offerings.
The largest issue came from Bayerische Landesanstalt fur Aufbaufinanzierung,
the state-owned Bavarian development bank. The LfA is borrowing DM200m via a
five-year floating-rate note issue priced to yield five basis points below
six-month D-Mark Libor.
The issue, led by Trinkaus und Burkhardt, was the bank's first to include
the state 'deficiency' guarantee. As a result, the notes were snapped up by
domestic banks, which can use them as collateral in their dealings with the
Bundesbank.
Ecu paper was popular as retail investors continued to roll over their
holdings. Dealers said around Ecu1.7bn was coming up for redemption every
month.
Credit Local de France, the triple-A rated French municipal financing
agency, offered Ecu65m of four-year bonds fungible with an outstanding
Ecu235m bond through lead manager Swiss Bank Corp.
Later in the afternoon, GECC, the fund-raising arm of General Electric, made
its second appearance in as many days when it raised Ecu100m fungible with a
five-year Ecu100m issue launched in late March.
There was little speculation of impending deals and the expectation of more
yen-based supply was hardly satisfied by yesterday's offering from Hitachi
Credit, which issued Y1.5bn via the Bank of Tokyo.
Meanwhile, United Microelectronics Corp, a Taiwanese designer, producer and
distributor of integrated circuits, announced it was issuing Dollars 160m of
euroconvertible bonds to fund an increase in its production capacity.
UK investment bank BZW, which is handling the launch, said the 10-year bond
would have a coupon of between 1.25 per cent and 1.75 per cent. Final
pricing takes place at the end of the week.
Tube Investments' Indian arm issued Dollars 50m of new stock in the form of
Global Depositary Receipts through S. G. Warburg and Cazenove. The 5.2m GDRs
were priced at Dollars 8.77 and there was a 'green shoe' addition of just
over 500,000 GDRs. The launch was scheduled to take place three weeks ago
but was pulled after the failed flotation of VSNL, the Indian telephone
company.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday affirmed its AA+
rating on the Kingdom of Sweden's long-term foreign currency debt. It said
the ratings were supported by a manageable external financial position and a
solid balance of payments performance.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Thai airline surges to Bt2.28bn
midterm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thai International Airways yesterday reported a steep increase in net
profits for the six months ended March, due largely to improved efficiency.
Six-month profits were Bt2.28bn (Dollars 89.8m), up 300 per cent, following
a 166 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits to Bt1.19bn.
The airline has been a private sector company since March 1992 when just
over 7 per cent of the company was floated on the Bangkok stock market.
Since the flotation it has been criticised by airline analysts for propping
up weak operating results with extraordinary income, notably from aircraft
sales.
However, Mr Thamnoon Wanglee, president, appears to be creating a leaner
organisation.
Revenues from transportation, the core income, rose 10.8 per cent over the
year while operating expenses went up by only 2 per cent.
'This is encouraging, although it is still too early to say if they have
turned the corner or not,' said an analyst at brokers HG Asia.
Although the current load factor (passengers and cargo carried) is 70.3 per
cent, compared with 65.8 per cent last year, this does not translate
directly into higher profits because the airline currently targets
economy-class passengers. Previously, it sought primarily high-spending
business and first-class passengers.
The break-even load factor is nearer 66 per cent compared with 62 per cent a
year ago.
That Thai still finds unconventional revenue useful is shown in a comment
from the company that second-quarter revenues of Bt2.42bn would have been
higher but for a delay in the delivery of an Airbus A300-600 which also
delayed a 'concession payment'.

<TEXT>
Electronic Data Systems, the computing services company, and Computer
Associates, the provider of systems and application software, yesterday
ended a 28-month legal dispute and announced a software licensing agreement
they claimed to be the largest ever.
Computer Associates sued EDS in 1991, alleging the company had obtained
unauthorised access to its software and used it without paying fees to
process data for third parties.
The centrepiece of yesterday's agreement is a 12-year licence, renewable for
a further five years, giving EDS broad and flexible use of all current
Computer Associates products for itself and its customers throughout the
world. Where appropriate, EDS will standardise on Computer Associates
products at all its information processing centres.
EDS will become a value-added reseller of Computer Associates software. It
will initially have the right to resell Dollars 100m of CA-Unicenter, a
systems management package for the client/server market.
The two sides are discussing an agreement for Computer Associates to
outsource the information technology support for some of its administrative
and financial functions to EDS.
Both refused to put a value on the settlement. Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of
EDS, said the deal was unrelated to Monday's news that General Motors, which
owns EDS, was considering spinning it off to facilitate a possible merger
between EDS and Sprint, the telecommunications group.
Mr Alberthal said EDS had long believed an alliance with a leading software
group would be of benefit. Mr Gary Fernandes, EDS senior vice-president,
added it had selected Computer Associates because of 'its reputation as a
provider of best-of-breed software covering systems management, application
development and business applications'.

<TEXT>
USAir, the US airline in which British Airways holds a minority stake, has
postponed delivery of 40 Boeing 737 jetliners and cancelled options for
another 76 Boeing aircraft, it emerged yesterday.
Separately, a ballot among the airline's 8,000 fleet service workers
indicated they were set to join a labour union in an attempt to win better
protection against the shake-out in the US airline industry.
USAir, which faces acute pressure to cut costs because of competition from
low-cost airlines making inroads into its east coast market, had planned to
take delivery of the 40 737 jets between 1997 and 2000.
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows it has deferred
delivery of the airliners to dates between 2003 and 2005. It has also
cancelled options for 63 737s, 11 757s and two 767s, but it will still take
delivery of 18 757s between now and 1996.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: British Gas to sell Bow Valley
stake to Talisman

<TEXT>
Talisman Energy plans to buy all the common stock of Bow Valley Energy,
including British Gas's 53 per cent holding, in a deal which could be worth
CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.1bn).
The deal would create one of the world's biggest upstream oil and natural
gas companies and the third biggest gas producer in western Canada, said Mr
James Buckee, Talisman president.
Talisman, the former BP Canada and independent since 1992, is offering
between 27.5m and 30.2m Talisman common shares, plus CDollars 480m cash for
all Bow Valley's 88.3m common shares and equivalents, including several
classes of preferred stock. Bow Valley shares on Monday traded around
CDollars 13.75.
The takeover was subject to the approval of Bow Valley's board and
shareholders, and by the Alberta court, Talisman said.
British Gas said it intended to vote its shares in favour of the
arrangement, Talisman said.
The UK group said the sale of its 53 per cent stake in Bow Valley to
Talisman would total about CDollars 720m, payable in cash and Talisman
shares, based on an average price of CDollars 15.45 for each Bow Valley
share.
British Gas did not say how much it paid for the shares, or whether it would
make a loss or a gain on the sale.
The company said in March it was reviewing its shareholding in Bow Valley.
'This transaction forms part of our review of our activities,' said Mr
Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive.
'It is consistent with our policy of focusing on international markets where
we see the greatest growth potential and where we can apply our expertise.'

Fujita warned it would cut its dividend in the current year to Y7.5 per

Broken Hill Propriety, the Australian resources group, has received another

Papua New Guinea.
The writ was lodged in the Victorian Supreme Court by Mr Barry Shackles. He
claims that damage from the Ok Tedi project has reduced profits of a
Daru-based fishing business.
The writ follows the launch earlier this month of Australia's most expensive
court action, an estimated ADollars 4bn (USDollars 2.8bn) claim on behalf of
landowners near the Ok Tedi river alleging environmental damage from the
BHP-controlled operation.
Both writs are being handled by Slater and Gordon of Melbourne.
CRA, the Australian mining group, has rejected allegations that it misled
shareholders in its 1990 takeover battle for Kalimantan Gold, operator of
the Kelian gold mine in Indonesia.
CRA was responding to legal action launched in the Supreme Court of Victoria
on Monday.
Five former corporate shareholders in Kalimantan are seeking unspecified
damages from the company.

Fujita Corporation, a second-tier Japanese construction company, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits down 44 per cent to Y18.77bn (Dollars 179m) for the
year ended March.
The company said the downturn reflected the poor state of the domestic
property market. Fujita is particularly exposed to the badly-hit Tokyo
property market.
Fujita warned it would be forced to cut its dividend in the current year
from Y10 per share to Y7.5.
'We faced tough times because of the fall in orders for plant and office
buildings from the private sector, although public works orders and
investment in new homes were firm,' said the company.
Group turnover fell 14.4 per cent to Y727bn, while post-tax profits tumbled
39 per cent to Y8.6bn. Earnings per share declined to Y17.46 from Y28.54.
The group said it expected construction orders to remain slow during the
current year because private companies were unlikely to increase capital
investment.
It forecast that pre-tax profits for the year ending next March would fall
further to Y12bn.
Earnings per share would fall to Y13.15, but sales would increase to Y750bn.

Ontario, Canada's biggest province, has had its double-A minus debt rating
confirmed by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency.
Ontario's recent budget forecast a CDollars 8.5bn (USDollars 6.2bn) deficit
for 1994-95, higher than originally forecast but down from CDollars 9.4bn in
1993-94.
The rating outlook is stable, the agency said, reflecting Ontario's
diversified economy.
It had lowered Ontario's ratings from double-A last year reflecting the
province's rising debt and heavy servicing costs.
Quebec's budget late last week forecast a CDollars 4.4bn deficit for
1994-95. Standard &amp; Poor's said that it was studying its previous rating of
A-plus with stable outlook.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Flotation may help ITD build on
past successes - Thai contractor plans listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian-Thai group, one of the biggest and most successful conglomerates in
south-east Asia, plans to float Italian-Thai Development (ITD), its
construction and civil engineering arm, on the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
ITD, which accounts for about half of total group business, is expected to
be valued at about Dollars 1.6bn when 10 per cent of its shares are listed
in the next couple of months.
This would give a market capitalisation bigger than the other three
Bangkok-listed construction companies combined - including Christiani and
Nielsen, the Thai group that took over its Danish parent in 1992.
ITD is the dominant contractor in Thailand for big infrastructure projects
such as ports, dams, power stations, roads and pipelines. The government has
begun tendering out transport and other projects to private companies. ITD
wants the new capital to help finance its share of concessions and pay for
new equipment.
In addition to the construction arm, the privately-held Ital-Thai group owns
a trading and industrial business, importing aircraft and locomotives as
well as pumps and valves, and holds a quarter of a brewery in neighbouring
Laos.
It also has interests in 14 hotels - including Bangkok's most famous, the
Oriental - and in the luxury Eastern and Oriental Express train. Both the
Oriental and the Royal Orchid hotels are listed on the SET, and there are
plans to float the Amari group of hotels in the next few years.
ITD is well-placed to take advantage of the inadequacy of Thailand's
existing infrastructure. The Thai economy is growing at 8 per cent annually,
but traffic congestion, water pollution and a shortage of telephones testify
to the need for transport improvement and new communications networks.
All are areas of opportunity for ITD. The company owns a 14 per cent stake
in Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, which is installing 1m new
telephone lines in the provinces. ITD is also hoping to take a share of
forthcoming work to double Thailand's single-track railways.
It is engaged in a Bt2bn (Dollars 80m) project extending terminal buildings
at Bangkok's Don Muang international airport, and wants to win contracts for
the new airport planned for Nong Ngu Hao.
ITD has been selected as priority bidder, together with the Anglo-French
engineering group GEC-Alsthom, for a proposed elevated commuter railway in
central Bangkok - a contract that could provide as much as Bt15bn in revenue
for ITD if it goes ahead.
Last year ITD made a net profit of Bt1bn on turnover of Bt11.61bn. Even if
the elevated railway project is excluded from the forecasts, Jardine Fleming
Thanakom, co-lead manager for the forthcoming share issue, predicts sales
growth of 27 per cent, 35 per cent and 25 per cent over the next three
years.
By 1996, ITD's turnover is forecast to reach the equivalent of Dollars 1bn,
with profits of Bt2bn.
The Italian-Thai group began as a temporary alliance for ship-salvaging
between Mr Giorgio Berlingieri, a marine engineer, and Mr Chaijudh
Karnasuta, a Thai-Chinese doctor turned entrepreneur.
The two men established their own company in 1958 and bought the local
assets of Archimede. Ital-Thai went from strength to strength, although Mr
Berlingieri died in 1981. One of the few continuing links with Italy is a
joint venture with the Italian company Trevi.
The Karnasuta family now control the group and ITD.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Thai airline posts sharp
increase after six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thai International Airways yesterday reported a steep increase in net
profits for the six months ended March, due largely to improved efficiency.
Six-month profits were Bt2.28bn (Dollars 89.8m), up 300 per cent, following
a 166 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits to Bt1.19bn.
The airline has been a private sector company since March 1992 when just
over 7 per cent of the company was floated on the Bangkok stock market.
Since the flotation it has been criticised by airline analysts for propping
up weak operating results with extraordinary income, notably from aircraft
sales.
However, Mr Thamnoon Wanglee, president, appears to be creating a leaner
organisation.
Revenues from transportation, the core income, rose 10.8 per cent over the
year while operating expenses went up by only 2 per cent.
'This is encouraging, although it is still too early to say if they have
turned the corner or not,' said an analyst at brokers HG Asia.
Although the current load factor (passengers and cargo carried) is 70.3 per
cent, compared with 65.8 per cent last year, this does not translate
directly into higher profits because the airline currently targets
economy-minded Asian passengers.
Previously it sought primarily high-spending business and first-class
passengers.
The break-even load factor is nearer 66 per cent compared with 62 per cent a
year ago.
That Thai still finds unconventional revenue useful is shown in a comment
from the company that second-quarter revenues of Bt2.42bn would have been
higher but for a delay in the delivery of a Airbus A300-600 which also
delayed a 'concession payment'.
Mr Sriyan Pietersz, head of research at Smith New Court in Bangkok, said:
'When Thai buys an aeroplane at a theoretical discount it books the discount
as a cosmetic profit.'
Thai International predicts a net after-tax profit for the year of Bt4.5bn.
This compares with a forecast of Bt3bn from Smith New Court which does 'not
including any fancy footwork in the accounts'.
In 1992-93, net profits at Thai fell 67 per cent, a result that the airline
openly acknowledged as below budget.
Thai's regional flights in Asia tend to be profitable, but its
intercontinental and domestic services perform poorly.
The airline has been working on a plan to reform its accounting system to
produce an accounting format more familiar to foreign investors.

Hewlett-Packard, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported
strong growth for its second fiscal quarter as it continued to outperform
its largest competitors in the computer market.
Net earnings for the quarter, ended April 30, were Dollars 408m, or Dollars
1.56 a share, compared with Dollars 347m, or Dollars 1.38, in the same
period last year. An adjustment for employee stock options reduced earnings
per share by 4 cents in the latest quarter.
Revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars 5.1bn in the second
quarter of fiscal 1993. Net revenue in the US was Dollars 2.8bn, an increase
of 26 per cent, while revenue from outside the US was Dollars 3.5bn, up 20
per cent.
'Overall we had a very good quarter,' said Mr Lewis Platt, chairman,
president and chief executive. 'Our revenue and order growth were
outstanding in today's challenging environment, and our earnings improved
nicely over last year's strong second quarter.'
Orders booked during the quarter rose 19 per cent to Dollars 6.4bn, compared
with Dollars 5.4bn in the second quarter of 1993. US orders were Dollars
2.9bn, up 25 per cent, while those from outside the US rose 13 per cent to
Dollars 3.5bn. Order growth was 'excellent' in Asia Pacific, but declined in
Europe.
In the computer business, revenues increased by 21 per cent in the quarter
to Dollars 4.9bn from Dollars 3.9bn. Orders for PCs increased dramatically,
the company said, while orders for HP's popular Deskjet PC printers also
grew strongly. Growth in orders for laser printers was 'modest and in line
with company expectations'. Multi-user computer orders continued to grow
strongly, but workstation orders declined in value.
The test and measurement business achieved 16 per cent order growth, its
biggest increase in many years. Orders for communications-test equipment, as
well as semiconductor and printed-circuitboard test systems, increased
strongly.
As a percentage of net revenue, cost of goods sold increased to 62.2 per
cent from 58.8 per cent in the year-ago quarter reflecting competitive
pricing pressures and a continuing shift toward products with higher sales
costs.
Operating expenses for the quarter increased 12 per cent over the year-ago
period, with R&amp;D spending up 16 per cent. However, as a percentage of
revenue, operating expenses were 27.6 per cent, down from 30.3 per cent a
year ago.
For the six months ended April 30, net earnings increased 28 per cent to
Dollars 776m, against Dollars 608m in the first half of 1993. Net earnings
per share totalled Dollars 2.98, an increase of 24 per cent over the Dollars
2.41 in last year's first half. Net revenue rose 23 per cent to Dollars
11.9bn.
'We still face intense competition, a mixed economic environment worldwide
and rapid change in the marketplace in all our businesses,' Mr Platt said.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rochester Tel wins agreement on
plan to split
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Rochester Tel, the New York state telecommunications group, said yesterday
it had cleared an important hurdle in its unique and closely watched plan to
split itself in two and voluntarily abandon its local monopoly around the
city of Rochester.
The scheme, unveiled in February last year, has been hailed as a possible
model for other local phone companies wanting to make themselves more
flexible and entrepreneurial in the face of growing competition from new
rivals offering multimedia communications services.
Rochester Tel said yesterday it had reached agreement on the package with
staff of the New York State Public Service Commission, which oversees the
utility, and with other interested parties. The deal still has to be
approved by the full Commission, which is expected to consider it in the
third quarter of this year.
If it gets the green light, Rochester will open up its local market to far
greater competition than that faced by other US telecommunications
companies.
Entertainment group Time Warner, which operates a cable television system in
Rochester, plans to offer a rival switched business and telephone service in
the area.
It said yesterday that it had signed an agreement with Rochester Tel
establishing the right to interconnect customers of the two systems. The
agreement is the first of its kind between a cable operator and a leading
telephone company.
Rochester Tel's plan centres on the division into two separate businesses of
its Rochester area telephone operations. One new company, R-Net, would take
over the basic telecommunications transmission and switching network. It
would become a wholesale seller of these services to other retail companies,
although it would itself continue to offer some retail services.
The other, R-Com, would operate as a retailer, buying network access from
R-Net, and packaging those services with its own and others' product lines,
such as voice-mail, data services, long distance and wireless.
Initially, the only services assigned to R-Com would be those considered to
be highly competitive, such as high-capacity private lines. Any other
company would be able to compete for these services, or for customers of
other services offered by R-Net.
A holding company, set up above these two subsidiaries, would have far
greater freedom from local regulatory oversight. It could issue securities,
make any acquisition or enter any line of business.
To win regulatory support for the scheme, the company has agreed to a
seven-year plan of price stabilisation, which includes Dollars 21m of rate
reductions.
The commission has in turn agreed that while R-Net would remain subject to
regulatory oversight, the price cap regime allowed it to be freed from the
rate-of-return financial targets which are common in the telecommunications
industry.
This would allow the group to retain all the cost efficiencies it achieves,
making its stock potentially more attractive to investors.

<TEXT>
J. C. Penney and Dayton Hudson, two of the biggest US store groups, both
reported sharp increases in sales and profits for the first quarter to
April.
J. C. Penney's net income rose to Dollars 223m, a 30 per cent increase on
the Dollars 172m reported before extraordinary items last time.
Fully-diluted earnings per share rose to 84 cents from 65 cents before
extraordinary items.
The profits increase was partly driven by a 10 per cent increase in sales to
Dollars 4.35bn. J. C. Penney's mix of own-label and brand-name apparel has
been selling well in its department stores, and the group's catalogue
operations have benefited from Sears's exit from the catalogue business.
The company also benefited from tight control of costs. Selling, general and
administrative expenses fell to 25.1 per cent of sales this time from 25.9
per cent in last year's first quarter.
Dayton Hudson increased profits by 31 per cent in the same period, but from
a lower base than J. C. Penney. Net income rose to Dollars 39m from Dollars
30m on sales up by 11 per cent to Dollars 4.47bn. Fully-diluted earnings per
share rose to 47 cents from 35 cents.
Mr Robert Ulrich, who took over last month as chief executive, said the
Target stores had continued their solid performance. Mervyn's results were
starting to reflect the benefits of a new merchandising strategy, especially
in women's apparel, and the department store division was continuing to gain
momentum from its emphasis on value.
US West, the regional Bell telephone company, plans to launch an interactive
video merchandising service, Reuter reports from Seattle.
Mr Andrew Orgel, executive vice-president of US West's Interactive Video
Enterprises division, said retailers Nord strom and J. C. Penney were among
the businesses participating in the new venture. They would help design,
develop and promote the system.
He said the service would be offered on a variety of platforms and would be
available to consumers through their television sets or over personal
computers.
Mr Orgel said the service was a planned national system available for
distribution by a variety of providers.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar revises its
derivatives accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financial services subsidiary of Caterpillar has reported a Dollars 5.4m
loss from derivative instruments, amid signs that auditors in the US are
taking a more stringent line in this area.
The company said the reported loss stems from a decision to revise its
first-quarter figures after receiving an opinion from its auditors, Price
Waterhouse. The accounting firm declined to comment.
The accounting change led Caterpillar Financial Services to slash its
reported profits for the quarter to Dollars 6.4m from Dollars 11.8m. No
adjustment was made to the Caterpillar group figures, since the amount was
not material in the context of its previously reported profits of Dollars
192m, the company said.
The adjustment related to interest rate caps and swaptions which Caterpillar
had written (or sold.) Caps give the buyer protection against higher
interest rates, while holders of swaptions have an option to enter into a
swap contract. In both cases, such instruments amounted to a form of
insurance sold by Caterpillar to others who wanted cover against rising
interest rates.
The practice of selling such option-type instruments is usually limited to
sophisticated derivatives traders, since they require constant hedging on
the part of the seller to limit its exposure as interest rates rise. As a
result, writing options is generally regarded as a risky strategy for an
industrial company.
Caterpillar said that the instruments had been used as part of an overall
strategy to protect its financial services subsidiary's margins from changes
in interest rates.
The adjustment stems from a forced switch from so-called hedge accounting to
mark-to-market accounting. Under the first method, any profits or losses
from changes in the market values of financial instruments are set off
against the underlying asset the instruments are intended to hedge.
Under the second, the instruments are shown at their market value, with any
change being booked as an immediate profit or loss, regardless of any
offsetting change in value in the underlying assets.
The company said that in future it would only buy hedging instruments which
qualified for hedge accounting treatment.

boardroom independence

<TEXT>
The Toronto stock exchange has urged publicly-traded companies to have a
majority of independent outside directors on their boards.
The report of the TSE Committee on Corporate Governance suggested such
companies should report annually on the make-up of their boards, detailing
any directors' connections with controlling shareholders and management.
It called for penalties for directors of companies that provided improper
information to shareholders. Allegations would be subject to a due diligence
defence.
The committee said outside directors should meet regularly to review board
performance and co-operation and take steps to ensure boards operate
independently from management.
The report was drafted in response to a rash of corporate failures since
1990 and shareholder complaints of lack of information.
About 70 per cent of the companies traded on the TSE have controlling
shareholders who usually want the make-up of boards to reflect their
interests.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Israel may float 51% of El Al
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli government is expected to announce plans for a stock market
flotation of about 51 per cent of El Al, the state-owned airline, following
a cabinet meeting next week.
Israel's finance ministry has appointed two consortia of advisers to conduct
a valuation of the airline. One of them includes Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
UK investment bank.
An official at Israel's privatisation office said no participant in the
valuation consortia would be allowed to act as underwriter when shares were
finally offered to the public, apparently ruling BZW out of a wider role.
Israel's privatisation rules require the government to seek a second opinion
on the value of a publicly-owned company and both valuations would play a
part in setting the price for shares.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Growing concern over investor
lawsuits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US companies are increasingly reluctant to release forward-looking
information to analysts and investors about their earnings and performance
because they fear shareholders might sue them if the projections prove
wrong, according to a survey by the American Stock Exchange.
The growing number of shareholder suits is becoming such a problem in the US
that the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering ways to bolster
the 'safe harbour' provision of securities law.
The provision protects companies from fraud claims unless the information
they release is 'without a reasonable basis or was disclosed other than in
good faith'.
In recent years, however, the safe harbour provision has not been working
effectively, with a growing number of shareholders filing lawsuits alleging
they have been deliberately misled by information from companies.
Mr Dick Syron, chairman of the ASE, said that many of these shareholder
lawsuits had little, if any, merit.
'This is another case of excessive litigation being counter-productive.
Investors are suffering because less, not more, financial information is
available to determine the value of a company's stock.'
The ASE said that more than 75 per cent of the 218 companies which responded
to its survey had been forced to curtail the amount of information they
provided to investors because of the mounting number of 'frivolous'
lawsuits, and 17 per cent said they had been sued in the past five years on
issues relating to disclosures.
A majority of the respondents who were sued said they chose to settle out of
court rather than fight the suit.
The problem of shareholder lawsuits does not relate to official
announcements such as quarterly earnings, dividend payments or securities
transactions, but to informal disclosures such as meetings with analysts and
institutional investors, press releases, press conferences and executives'
speeches.
The SEC is keen to encourage a constant flow of this type of information so
that investors can make sound judgments about their investments.

Air Products and Chemicals, the US industrial gases group which last week
took a Dollars 60m after-tax charge in its second quarter to cover losses on
five derivatives contracts, is to absorb an additional Dollars 9m charge in
the next quarter to cover the cost of closing out the contracts.
The Pennsylvania-based group said it terminated the interest rate swap
contracts to reduce the company's earnings exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. Air Products is the fourth US company to take a charge
against its earnings this year because of problems with derivatives sold by
Bankers Trust, the New York bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel chain, yesterday rose nearly 7 per
cent to L1,188 from L1,112 as it became clear the group had successfully
auctioned the outstanding rights to its shares.
The auction and the preceding L1,000-a-share rights issue were supposed to
fail, delivering a majority of shares to Ciga's creditor banks and then to
ITT Sheraton of the US, which had offered L740 a share for the company.
Instead, Ciga said yesterday the auction and rights issue had raised
L1,003bn (Dollars 593m).
Since the rights issue was launched on March 17, Ciga's shares have
consistently traded at well above the issue price. ITT Sheraton's threat to
withdraw from the bidding at the end of last month failed to dent investors'
enthusiasm.
The company is likely to try to strike a separate deal with the banks to
write off part of its L954bn of short-term debt. The funds raised will be
used to repay the most of the outstanding overdraft and take care of
day-to-day operations.
Several investors are now thought to hold small speculative stakes. They
will have to declare any holdings above 2 per cent within 30 days. Fimpar,
the Aga Khan's holding company, which used to control Ciga, has reduced its
stake to less than 3 per cent by renouncing its rights.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banesto, the Spanish bank acquired by Banco Santander last month in the
largest domestic takeover, has announced a Pta12.6bn (Dollars 91m) capital
increase for Agroman, the loss-making construction group in which it has a
57 per cent holding.
The decision to rescue the group is Santander's first look at tackling
Banesto's industrial empire.
The fresh funds, which will double Agroman's shareholder capital to Pta25bn,
will seek to eliminate the company's heavy financial costs and, according to
Banesto, 'put (Agroman's) financial structure on a level with the best
companies in the sector'.
A recent audit by Price Waterhouse put Agroman losses at more than Pta10bn.
Banesto said it was prepared to subscribe the entire capital increase on a
one-for-one basis.
Analysts said the capital injection amounted to a mere accounting entry on
the part of Banesto, and would have a neutral impact on the bank's balance
sheet. They said Banesto would be simply capitalising loans to Agroman which
had already been provisioned.
The move fuelled speculation that Banesto, under its Santander parent, was
preparing for the disposal of the construction company. 'The new capital
makes Agroman saleable,' said Mr Jaime Mariategui of the Madrid financial
consultancy firm Research Associates.
Santander eschewed industrial investments several years ago, and its Dollars
2bn takeover of Banesto was aimed at gaining the bank's widespread branch
network. It is understood Santander will, over time, sell off the companies
within Banesto.

Group earnings at WestLB, the largest German public-sector bank, rose 106
per cent to DM481m (Dollars 289.7m) in 1993, following the first-time
consolidation of the Thomas Cook group and the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz.
Mr Friedel Neuber, chief executive, said: '1993 was an exceptional year in
terms of earnings, a result which cannot be repeated very quickly.'
He added that the first quarter of 1994 had been 'satisfactory', although
operating profits of DM142m were 9 per cent below last year's levels. Mr
Neuber forecast the bank would present 'satisfactory' 1994 results due to 'a
more positive economy and our good condition'.
About a third of 1993 profits came from foreign business. The group plans to
expand its operations in Asia and eastern Europe in the coming year.
The bank plans to concentrate its property interests in Immobilienbank, to
be headquartered in Mainz and run jointly with SudwestLB and the Landesbank
Rheinland-Pfalz.
WestLB said it had lost DM140m in two developments run by Mr Jurgen
Schneider's property group. However, the 'risks had been adequately
covered', the bank said.
Although Mr Neuber said Germany was pulling out of an 18-month recession,
the bank raised bad-loans provisions in 1993 by 35 per cent to DM973m.
Earnings at the bank rose 48 per cent to DM1.281m and profit from trading on
its own account 34.5 per cent to DM398m. Before provisions, operating profit
rose 66.1 per cent to DM1.767bn, up from DM1.064bn the year before.

Microsoft, the leading personal computer software company, has pounced on
the emerging market for computer systems used to deliver interactive
television services with the launch of software code-named 'Tiger'.
Microsoft, in collaboration with Compaq Computer and Intel of the US, claims
to be able to provide cable television companies and telephone groups with
'media server' systems at a fraction of the cost of interactive television
technologies developed by competitors.
Systems developed by International Business Machines, Digital Equipment,
Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have already been adopted for trials of
interactive TV in the US and UK.
Media servers are the computers used to store and retrieve digitised video
and audio signals for services such as video-on-demand, interactive TV
shopping, and interactive TV channel guides. Anticipated business
applications of the technology include hotel and airline entertainment
systems, video messaging and corporate multimedia networks.
While its competitors have developed media servers based on super-computers
and mainframe computers, Microsoft's Tiger software can be run on
inexpensive microcomputers, the company claims.
Video-on-demand services did not necessarily require high-powered computers,
said Mr Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft senior vice-president of advanced
technology. 'Once you have the right software, you can implement
(video-on-demand) in many ways,' he said. The Tiger software allowed
computer systems to be expanded as the needs of the network grew, he added.
Yesterday, the companies demonstrated a prototype system based on 16 Intel
Pentium microprocessors, capable of delivering more than 3,000 video signals
simultaneously. Viewers could choose from more than 50 films, and control
the video signals as if they were running on a home video cassette recorder.
PC manufacturers are expected to offer Tiger servers for small and
medium-sized applications, such as corporate networks, while Intel will
offer larger-scale multimedia servers for public networks.
Compaq, the leading manufacturer of PC network 'servers', planned to develop
media server products, the company said.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Skopbank lines up FM470m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skopbank, the Finnish state-owned bank, yesterday announced a preliminary
agreement to sell the Finnish Real Estate Bank (Freb), its largest
subsidiary, for about FM470m (Dollars 87m).
The purchaser is Finvest, a development company focusing on industry and
banking, and the parent of Interbank, the Finnish commercial bank.
The sale reflects Skopbank's new focus on corporate and wholesale banking.
Its role as the central bank in the Finnish savings bank system has been
sharply reduced after last year's dismemberment of the Savings Bank of
Finland.
It said it no longer needed Freb's balance sheet for the purpose of
advancing loans.
Freb is a mortgage banking operation concentrating on long-term secured
lending. Total assets at the end of 1993 amounted to FM9.1bn, and
shareholder equity and reserves were FM480m.
Mr Heikki Jarvi-Eskola, Skopbank chief controller, said the deal would have
minimal influence on Skopbank's long-term earnings potential or capital
adequacy.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann to split into four
units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bertelsmann, the leading German media group, yesterday announced a
restructuring plan following the collapse of Vox, its private television
channel.
An important element is the splitting of the group into four divisions:
books, industry, entertainment and press.
Mr Manfred Lahnstein, head of Bertelsmann's electronic media division which
included Vox, has been appointed to head the supervisory board. He takes
over from Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president, who is
stepping down.
Vox, the Cologne-based TV channel, collapsed last March, 14 months after its
launch. Its fall caused estimated losses for Bertelsmann of DM160m (Dollars
94.1m).
Bertelsmann was previously divided into seven divisions, some determined by
outdated geographical considerations, the company said. The new structure
would make the company slimmer, faster and more effective, it said. 'The
point is to enable business areas which work together to be better in tune
with each other.'
The group recently reported that earnings for the six months ending December
were well above budget and likely to exceed the 1993 results.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Portugal to privatise majority
Cimpor stake
</HEADLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal is to privatise a majority of the capital of Cimpor, the country's
largest cement producer, by mid-1995, in three tranches beginning next
month. The company has been independently valued at more than Es200bn
(Dollars 1.2bn).
Mr Antonio de Sousa, secretary of state for finance, said a 20 per cent
stake would be sold on the Lisbon stock exchange in June. A second tranche
of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent would be sold to foreign investors in
an offering on foreign exchanges later this year.
The final tranche of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent would be sold in
the first half of 1995, giving private shareholders control of the company,
he said.
The June sale will embody Portugal's recently-revived policy of advancing
popular capitalism by offering up to 35 per cent of the shares on sale at a
discount to small savers.
A total of 14m shares will be sold at a fixed price of Es2,900 each.
However, 25 per cent will initially be reserved for employees at Es2,600,
and for small investors at Es2,700. This tranche will be increased to 35 per
cent if there is sufficient demand.

Wienerberger Baustoff-industrie, Austria's largest building materials group
and one of the two largest brick manufacturers in Europe, yesterday reported
a strong rise in profits for last year. It raised its dividend to 37 per
cent compared with 34 per cent in 1992.
Group profits before tax were Sch938m (Dollars 80m) - up almost 50 per cent
on the Sch626m achieved in 1992 - on sales of Sch12.1bn compared with
Sch11.7bn in 1992.
Mr Erhard Schaschl, chief executive, said pre-tax profits would continue to
rise this year, to around Sch1.1bn. He suggested the group would probably
further increase its dividend in 1994.
Wienerberger is the largest producer of bricks in Austria, Germany and
Hungary, and it has an important share of the market for pipes.
Its main shareholder is Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's second-largest
bank, which has a 51.6 per cent stake. The remaining capital is dispersed
among private shareholders. It is one of the most liquid shares on the
Vienna stock exchange.
Treibacher Chemische Werke, Wienerberger's troubled alloys subsidiary, made
a pre-tax loss of Sch113m, down from Sch157m in 1992. Turnover declined from
Sch3.3bn in 1992 to Sch2.96bn last year.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Robust sales help lift pre-tax
profit at Astra
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong volume growth helped Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, lift
first-quarter pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to SKr2bn (Dollars 260m),
maintaining its momentum as one of the world's fastest-growing drugs groups.
The result was struck on a 28 per cent increase in sales, to SKr6.4bn, with
the group's two main drugs - Losec and Pulmicort - performing strongly.
Operating earnings were 52 per cent higher at SKr2.05bn.
Astra noted that, adjusted for currency factors, sales grew by 24 per cent,
a bigger rise in volumes than last year and much better than the market
average.
However, it said the pace of sales growth had weakened because currency
movements were not as beneficial as last year's. It said the same factor
would slow the pace of sales and earnings growth over the full year,
although both are expected to continue to develop favourably. Last year,
group pre-tax profit amounted to SKr7.8bn.
Losec, the anti-peptic ulcer agent and one of the world's top-selling drugs,
saw sales expand by 49 per cent to SKr2.24bn in the first quarter. Including
sales through licensees, sales grew 50 per cent to SKr3.95bn.
Sales of Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent, were 32 per cent higher at
SKr850m. Plendil, an anti-hypertensive agent, increased sales by 41 per cent
to SKr273m.
Astra was particularly encouraged by its performance in Germany, its largest
market, where sales rose 32 per cent in local currency terms, compared with
estimated market growth of 7 per cent. The performance was driven by
improved sales of Losec, even though a German health regulator has been
looking into possible side-effects of the drug.
Astra noted the German market was 'now recovering from the effects of
political intervention in early 1993'.
Sales in the UK, the group's second-largest market, climbed 53 per cent.
Astra said its pre-tax performance was held back by an (unrealised) drop in
the value of its bond portfolio - blamed on increased interest rates at the
end of the quarter - and exchange losses. These resulted in net financial
expenses of SKr52m, compared with income of SKr344m in the same 1993 period.
Analysts are looking for full-year profits of between SKr9.5bn and SKr10bn.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Charterhall disposal costs leave Seafield
Pounds 24m in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Seafield, the transport and distribution company where the board
is under fire from dissident shareholders, doubled from Pounds 11.1m to
Pounds 24.2m pre-tax for 1993. Turnover fell to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 45.2m).
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said the results marked the end of 'the disaster
created by the acquisition of Charterhall Properties in 1989'.
Charterhall was sold last October resulting in a loss of Pounds 21.7m,
including Pounds 17.5m of goodwill written off. Competition in the European
freight business helped push profits from continuing operations down from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 804,000 on turnover of Pounds 17m (Pounds 18.7m).
Losses per share emerged at 35.4p (15.4p).
Shareholders speaking for 25.4 per cent want to replace Mr Chilver and
another director with Mr Robert Cosby and Mr Tony Wilson, a former executive
chairman, because of the 'dismal' trading record. Mr Cosby described the
latest loss as 'an appalling indictment' of the present management. It was
much worse than the dissidents had feared.
Mr Chilver, who is writing to shareholders this week, expected 'significant
progress' this year after 'three years of dealing with the errors of the
previous management, led by Mr Wilson, which threatened the very existence
of Seafield'.
The group, which withdrew from merger talks with private company Imari last
week, was considering the acquisition of two other transport companies, Mr
Chilver added.

<TEXT>
Telemetrix, the supplier of specialised electronic components, test
equipment and services, saw its share price fall 3p to 92p yesterday as the
company issued a profit warning.
Mr Arthur Walsh, chairman, told the annual meeting that 'although it is
expected that second half earnings will be above those for the first half it
is unlikely that full year earnings will exceed last year'.
Last month the company announced that results from its US subsidiary were
lower and the shares fell sharply.

<TEXT>
James Smith Estates, the property investment company, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.57m for the year to March 24, against Pounds 1.45m.
During the period net assets per share increased from 114p to 129p after
taking into account a revaluation and the Pounds 12.4m placing and open
offer in March.
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 2.39m) resulting from a small
number of voids. Recent purchases have increased the rent roll to Pounds
3.25m. Profits from sale of flats on long leases rose from Pounds 125,000 to
Pounds 195,000.
As expected, the proposed final dividend is 3.1p making a total of 4.65p
(4.2p) from earnings per share of 6.8p (6.3p).

<TEXT>
Alba is to purchase Goodmans Industries, its rival consumer electronics
group, for a maximum of Pounds 3.6m in shares and cash.
Goodmans, which specialises in in-car entertainment and domestic audio and
visual products and ranks first in brand share in the home karaoke market,
incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.09m in the 12 months to end-January
1994 on turnover of Pounds 36.4m. Net assets at that date were Pounds
876,000. Until January 1993 it formed part of TGI, the professional and
consumer audio manufacturer.
Mr David Harris, chief executive of Alba, which also takes in the Bush and
Hinari brands, said: 'Goodmans is an established brand name which will
produce new opportunities for profit.
'The acquisition reinforces Alba's focus and adds another quality brand to
our portfolio.'
Alba will also subscribe for Pounds 700,000 of new Goodmans shares and fund
the repayment of Pounds 250,000 of loan stock.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dorling settles dispute with TBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace has broken out in the war between Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the
publisher of illustrated reference books, and its distributor, Tiptree Book
Services, which is owned by Random House, the US publisher.
DK recently partly blamed computer problems at Tiptree for a 17 per cent
decline in its pre-tax profits in the six months to December 31 - a claim
disputed by Tiptree, which said it refused to be made a scapegoat for DK's
failure to meet the high expectations it had generated among shareholders.
DK said yesterday it would this summer transfer the distribution of its
publications for the UK book trade and English-language exports from Tiptree
to International Book Distributors, a Rugby-based company which is part of
Paramount, the US media company.
As part of a confidential settlement, a compensation payment to DK for the
loss of sales was partly offset by a payment to Tiptree for ending the
distribution deal when it still had 14 months to run.
Mr Rod Hare, managing director of DK, said: 'We had to ensure that our
distribution this autumn would not be at risk - that was our paramount
concern. Tiptree was confident that it could manage, but we decided not to
take the risk.'
He added: 'The settlement will certainly improve our results this year, but
I doubt whether they will be significantly better because of the
compensation.'
DK had already transferred from Tiptree to International Book the
distribution of DK Family Library, its direct-selling operation to homes and
schools which was most affected by the problems at Tiptree.
Mr Hare said DK had lost a 'significant proportion' of its network of Family
Library agents, but this was being rebuilt as confidence in supplies
returned.
DK's shares, which were floated at 165p at the end of 1993, had climbed to
351p last October, but plunged to 213p in December after the group issued
two profit warnings.
The shares yesterday closed 5p higher at 293p.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Value Trust advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructurings and other changes in companies within its portfolio helped
Scottish Value Trust outperform its benchmark in the six months to
end-March.
Net asset value rose 23 per cent over the half year to 119.63p per share,
easily exceeding the FT-SE-A Investment Trusts Index, up 8.2 per cent over
the same period.
Referring to the showing, Mr Bob Borthwick, chairman, highlighted the
reconstruction of Ivory &amp; Sime Enterprise Capital, which enabled the trust
to realise a substantial profit on its holding of convertible loan stock and
enhanced the underlying net asset value of its investment in the ordinary
capital, and the restructuring and subsequent share price increase of
Utility Cable, the former Baillie Gifford Technology, in which Scottish
Value held a 26 per cent stake.
Earnings were 1.18p; the interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.85p) and a total
of 2p (1.8p) is anticipated for the full year.

FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Anglo Irish Bank improves by 39%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to profitability from its London-based operations helped Anglo
Irish Bank Corporation raise profits by 39 per cent from IPounds 4.44m to
IPounds 6.15m (Pounds 5.99m) pre-tax for the six months to March 31.
Mr Gerry Murphy, chairman, said the performance reflected 'the focused
strategic approach of the bank'. Prospects for the next six months were
encouraging.
Mr Murphy said the bank would continue to focus on medium sized corporate
and professional business, with a wide sectoral spread. He expected full
year profits to be above last year's IPounds 9.25m.
After-tax profits for the half year rose 40 per cent, from IPounds 3.29m to
IPounds 4.61m. Earnings per share were 2.6p (2.39p) and an unchanged interim
dividend of 1.36p is declared.
In the UK, quality loan demand rose significantly and the acquisition of the
Chemical Bank UK loan book last autumn contributed to profitability.
Overall lending rose by 4 per cent, reflecting slack demand in Ireland. The
chairman commented, however: 'The lending division performed very well.
Margins were maintained and bad debts contained.'
Deposits were up to IPounds 1.04bn, an 8.5 per cent rise on the year end
figure and 22 per cent higher than at March 31 1993. Capital resources rose
to more than IPounds 174m in the period, with the combined impact of the
recent IPounds 58m rights issue and the addition of IPounds 23m in tier two
capital via the issue of subordinated loan stock.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Amey to raise Pounds 10m via market listing
 -New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amey Holdings, one of the UK's largest private construction companies and
the sixth biggest roadbuilder, plans to raise about Pounds 10m in new money
when it comes to the market next month.
Existing shareholders, including Close Brothers which holds a 25 per cent
stake on behalf of approximately 30 investment institutions, also expect to
raise Pounds 10m by selling some of their holdings.
Amey, which issued a pathfinder prospectus yesterday, is expected to have a
stock market value of about Pounds 50m when the price of the issue is
announced on June 2.
The shares will not be offered for sale but will be placed with Baring Bros,
sponsor to the issue. James Capel will act as broker.
The company, previously part of the ARC building materials and construction
group, was briefly a Hanson subsidiary when ARC was acquired from
Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson in August 1989.
Amey was sold almost immediately by Hanson for Pounds 6.5m to Amey
directors: Mr Neil Ashley, executive chairman, Mr Eddie King, managing
director, Mr David Cawthorne, finance director and Mr Richard Douglas,
managing director of Amey Building.
Mr Ashley said the company's continuing businesses made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4.7m last year on group sales of Pounds 210m, compared with profits
of just Pounds 300,000 on sales of Pounds 70m in 1989.
If losses from the former electrical business of JM Jones, now closed, are
included pre-tax profits last year would be reduced to Pounds 2.16m
At the end of December Amey had net cash of Pounds 8.64m.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Minproc sells stake in Bakyrchik Gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bakyrchik Gold, set up last year to exploit a gold mine in
Kazakhstan, fell by 10p to 315p yesterday after it revealed that its biggest
shareholder had disposed of a 19.1 per cent stake despite giving an
undertaking last August that it would not sell any more shares for at least
a year.
The shares were placed on behalf of Minproc, the Australian group, at 300p
each to raise about Pounds 9m.
Minproc was the second founder-shareholder to pull out of Bakyrchik. Only
five days after trading began on the London Stock Exchange, Chilewich, a New
York tra- ding organisation, sold virtually all of its 25 per cent stake.
Minproc also sold about 5 per cent then but also gave its undertaking to
keep the rest of its shares for 12 months.
There was no hint about these sales in the documents in connection with the
Pounds 9m placing, at 120p a share, by Williams de Broe.
Mr David Hooker, Bakyrchik's chairman, said yesterday that Minproc was in
the throes of a necessary financial reconstruction and had asked Bakyrchik
to be relieved from its undertaking.
He said that 'while the disposal of this large stake by a founder is
regrettable, as we have a financing later this year we thought it better to
release Minproc from its undertaking, rather than go into that financing
with a major shareholder reluctant to take up its rights'.
The shares were placed without difficulty with new and existing
institutional shareholders 'who have the financial resources to support
future funding of the Bakyrchik mine in Kazakhstan,' he added.
Mr Kevin Foo, chief executive, said the Bakyrchik joint venture was on
course to pour its first gold in July and a feasibility study about a second
stage, to cost some Pounds 100m, would be ready by the end of this month.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Nightfreight raises Pounds 16.1m to cut
debt - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The family interests of Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Park Food and Tranmere
Rovers - and prospective chairman of Everton Football Club - will get about
Pounds 1.75m from the flotation of Nightfreight, the express parcels group,
of which he is also chairman.
More than 16m shares are being placed at 105p to raise Pounds 16.1m, giving
a market capitalisation of Pounds 47.3m. Existing shareholders are selling
4.72m shares. Of the placing 400,000 are being placed with preferential
applicants including existing shareholders, employees and associated
companies operating within Nightfreight's UK network.
Another principal beneficiary will be 3i, the investment group, which is
selling 2m shares worth Pounds 2.1m. The company will raise a net Pounds
11.2m to eliminate debt.
Nightfreight distributes The Independent newspaper and specialises in
industrial packages for the just-in-time market. It was founded by Mr
Russell Black, who bought Hernway Transport, a former regional newspaper
distributor, from the receiver for Pounds 180,000 in 1984.
Mr Johnson became involved in 1990 when Mr Black needed capital and
negotiations with a venture capital provider broke down. Mr Johnson, who
knew Nightfreight because it once distributed Park Food's Christmas hampers,
put in Pounds 500,000.
Forecast earnings per share of 7.5p for the year to November 30, compare
with 4.12p. The historical p/e was 25.5; the forecast is 14. Notional gross
dividend yield at the placing price is 4.03 per cent.

AAF Industries, the mini-conglomerate that plunged into the red in the first
half of 1993, is at an advanced stage in talks on the possible disposal of
Alloy Wheels, which makes wheels for the car industry.
The division accounted for Pounds 32m of total turnover of Pounds 72.1m in
1992. The group's other activity - system building - accounted for the
balance.
The potential buyer is thought to be from outside the UK.
The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11m on turnover of Pounds 42m in
the first half of last year. It is expected to announce its full year losses
along with the sale - possibly later this week.
Announcing interim results last October, AAF said it had concluded a joint
marketing and technical collaboration agreement with Topy Industries of
Japan, one of the world's largest alloy wheel manufacturers.
The first-half deficit stemmed directly from expansion of its prefabricated
building manufacturing business, which it bought in 1989, into an on-site
contractor.
The group warned last year that further costs of Pounds 7m would be incurred
in the second half because of the closure of the lossmaking division.
In November it sold its US modular building subsidiary for Dollars 33.3m.
The group said at the time that the net proceeds of the sale would be about
Dollars 13.3m (Pounds 8.8m), of which Pounds 4.3m would be used to reduce
debt to about Pounds 24m, leaving gearing at between 110 per cent and 115
per cent.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Property flotation value likely to
top Pounds 175m - New Issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pillar Property Investments yesterday became the ninth property company to
come to the market this year. Pillar, formed in 1991 by Arlington
Securities, the British Aerospace subsidiary, will be valued at more than
Pounds 175m.
The company has built up a portfolio of 25 properties valued at Pounds
330.4m, having been set up with Pounds 70m cash to capitalise on collapsing
property valuations.
Its initial shareholders were British Aerospace, Electra and General
Electric. A year ago, British Aerospace sold its stake to its partners, and
Arlington's founders, Mr Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, were brought
in as minority investors.
Mr Humphrey Price, finance director, said Electra and General Electric had
not decided whether they would sell part of their holding in the share
offer, but the management will retain its interest of about 10 per cent.
Analysts said that like Capital Shopping Centres - the Pounds 209m retail
property flotation earlier this year - Pillar offered sound management and
quality assets, but the success of the offer would hinge upon pricing.
It is being issued in a competitive market, following the publication last
week of the pathfinder prospectus for Argent, another relatively high
quality property group.
Pillar has a geographically spread portfolio, comprising 35 per cent office
space, 20 per cent office park, and the remainder in retail and
distribution.
Its current annualised rent roll is Pounds 23.7m, substantially higher than
financing costs, and 67 per cent of its rent is derived from FT-SE 100
companies or government bodies.
The portfolio was put together by Mr Robert Maxted, a former director of
Speyhawk. He will be property director of the listed company, but Mr Mould
and Mr Vaughan will be taking on a more active management role, as chairman
and chief executive respectively.
As founders of Arlington they developed an expertise in business parks, and
made an astute call on the property market, selling to British Aerospace at
close to the peak.
It is unclear what impact their return to Pillar will have on its investment
strategy, although it suggests the group will be looking at property
development opportunities.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd is financial adviser, while Kleinwort Benson is
broker to the issue, which is set to be launched within the next two months.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Redrow at 5% discount on first day of
dealings - New Issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First day dealings in Redrow, the latest housebuilder to come to the market,
ended with the shares trading at 128p - representing a 5 per cent discount
to the issue price of 135p, writes Andrew Taylor.
At one stage the shares had been as low as 118p but recovered by the close.
The issue, which raised Pounds 55.4m of new money for the company and Pounds
62m for Mr Steve Morgan, the founder and chief executive, has fallen foul of
the recent fatigue regarding new issues, particularly by housebuilders.
Of the minimum 21.75m shares offered to the public only 17.12m, or 78.7 per
cent, were taken up.
The issue was fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove
acting as broker.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill rights to fund land purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higgs &amp; Hill yesterday joined the growing band of builders to announce share
issues to pay for housing land purchases.
The company plans to raise Pounds 22.2m by offering shareholders one new
share at 105p for every two already held. It has agreed to buy 78.6 acres of
land, more than half in south-west England, for Pounds 22.5m.
The land on 13 sites is sufficient to build about 930 homes, said Mr John
Theakston, chief executive. More than four fifths of the land, 67.2 acres,
is being acquired from English China Clays for Pounds 19.3m.
English China Clays has previously announced its withdrawal from
housebuilding and is in the process of demerging its building materials
business.
Higgs &amp; Hill's share price yesterday fell by 10p to 122p. The land has been
acquired at a price of about Pounds 24,000 a plot, compared with an average
house price of Pounds 82,000, producing an estimated gross margin of 18 per
cent before selling expenses, said Mr Theakston.
At the end of last year, the company owned 1,200 plots with planning
permission at an average cost in the balance sheet of Pounds 23,000 each.
The number of plots will now increase to more than 2,000.
This will enable the company, which previously has operated mainly in
south-east England, to increase the number of homes it builds annually from
332 last year to 650 by the end of next year.
The purchase of three of the sites would depend upon revised planning
approvals being granted. English China Clays had agreed to carry out off
site works on a fourth site.
Under the terms of the deal, Pounds 13.7m would be paid to English China
Clays immediately; Pounds 3.7m on award of planning and completion of works
with the final Pounds 1.9m to be paid by December 16 next year.
Higgs &amp; Hill said that at the end of April it had net cash of between Pounds
3m and Pounds 4m, but expected to move to modest borrowings by the end of
this year to meet the cost of establishing a new division in the south-west
and other land purchases.
COMMENT
The timing of the cash call is not the best given the sharp rise in housing
land prices and the recent pressure on housebuilding stocks. The market
therefore was duly suspicious of the value to be gained from buying sites
which in the case of English China Clays have been on the market for more
than a year. On the other hand, Higgs &amp; Hill management is highly regarded
and profits of Pounds 12.5m in 1996 would leave the group on a prospective
p/e of under 10 on an ex-rights price of 123p. The rights therefore, should
be supported, but the market is getting fatigued by the volume of shares
being issued by housebuilders.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sedgwick disappoints City with 5% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, yesterday announced a 5 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 43.6m for the first quarter of 1994,
up from Pounds 41.6m. The figures disappointed most analysts, however, and
the share price fell 6p to 197p.
The result was affected by a poor performance from Sedgwick's UK reinsurance
business, and a combination of restructuring costs and a seasonally quiet
start to the year at Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits consultancy.
Revenue from brokerage and fees increased to Pounds 239.8m (Pounds 204.9m)
while interest and investment income fell Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 9.6m,
reflecting lower interest rates.
Mr Stuart Tarrant, finance director, said the results were in line with the
statement at the annual meeting that Sedgwick would experience a flatter
first half and stronger second half, compared with previous years. He said
present performance was in line with budget forecasts.
Sedgwick Payne, the reinsurance arm, was hit by the large number of clients
who have withdrawn from the London underwriting market. But Mr Tarrant said
the business would improve in the second half.
Noble Lowndes, acquired from TSB on September 30, was affected by
restructuring in the US, where 150 people were made redundant through the
closure and merger of offices. Mr Tarrant said the more substantial UK
business had performed in line with expectations.
Earnings per share dipped to 5p (5.7p) as a result of the August rights
issue.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Marley makes Pounds 20m sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Marley, one of Britain's biggest building materials companies, has sold
Bisch Marley, its clay roof tile subsidiary in Alsace, France, for FFr170m
(Pounds 19.8m) to Keramik Holdings of Switzerland.
The sale for cash reflects Marley's policy of disposing of businesses where
it does not command a large market share. The sale price includes the
repayment of inter-company debt.
Bisch, which had net assets of FFr108m at the end of December, reported
operating profits of FFr11.8m last year. Marley said that Bisch was a
leading supplier of roof tiles in eastern France but had been unable to
translate this into a sufficiently large national position.
The proceeds initially will be used to repay group borrowings.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BA acquires minority in Air Miles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways has bought the outstanding 49 per cent of Air Miles Travel
Promotions from MCM. The airline would not say how much it paid but it is
thought be less than Pounds 10m.
BA has owned 51 per cent of Air Miles, since it was founded in 1988.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said: 'Air Miles is one of
the best-known brand names in the country and we are now keen to get on with
developing the business as a mass market customer loyalty programme.'
Air Miles runs customer loyalty schemes for 150 companies, including BA's
Executive Club, National Westminster Bank, Shell, Hertz, Hilton and
Marriott.
BA said it carried about 500,000 passengers through the Air Miles programme
last year. This represented a little more than 5 per cent of its surplus
seats, which would otherwise have been empty.
There are 3.75m registered collectors of Air Miles in the UK and 2.75bn Air
Miles in circulation. BA said this was the equivalent of 10 per cent of its
unused capacity. The number of Air Miles in circulation is likely to grow to
5bn by the end of this year.

<TEXT>
Smith New Court has reached agreement with a leading South African
stockbroker to establish a New York-based joint venture which will sell
South African shares to US investors.
Agreement has also been reached in principle for Smith to acquire up to 30
per cent of Davis Borkhum Hare, the stockbroker. The stake is the maximum
envisaged by the recently published report of the sub-committee of the South
African Stock Exchange.
Mr Michael Marks, Smith's chief executive, said the deal was intended to
capitalise on the anticipated demand from US institutions which for decades
have been discouraged from buying South African shares by widespread
American revulsion for apartheid.
So far, several US states, including New York, have lifted restrictions on
public sector pension fund investment in South Africa. And others, such as
California, are in the process of doing so, he said.
The joint venture will act as an agency broker for investors wishing to buy
South African shares and as the vehicle for South African clients of both
firms who wish to offer their shares for sale in the US.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Standard Platforms Holdings, the USM-quoted computer hardware and
software group, which were suspended on March 30 at 36p pending publication
of its accounts, resumed trading at 18p yesterday.
The group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.07m for the 18 months to
September 30 1993, against losses of Pounds 847,471 for the previous year.
It also announced a proposed rights issue, loan stock conversion, a capital
reduction, a share option scheme and board changes. The directors said that
if resolutions relating to these were not passed at an extraordinary meeting
on June 9 the group's future would be uncertain and it might have to cease
trading.
The capital reconstruction involves the subdivision of 10p ordinary shares
into one ordinary 1p share and one deferred 9p share.
The issue, to raise Pounds 450,000 net, is on the basis of 5-for-2 at 5p per
share fully underwritten by a group of investors brought together by IDJ.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs hold back BOC to Pounds
79.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery was boosting sales volumes at BOC, the industrial gases
and healthcare group said yesterday on publication of its results for the
half year to March 31.
An exceptional Pounds 85m provision for restructuring and losses of Pounds
8.7m on disposals left pre-tax profits at Pounds 79.7m, compared with Pounds
182.4m.
Earnings per share, after the exceptional items, were 3.65p (23.55p). The
dividend is unchanged at 11.6p.
Borrowings have hardly changed from the start of this financial year and
gearing was 33 per cent, the company said.
The figures were at the top end of expectations, however, and the shares
rose 29p to 715p.
Turnover increased to Pounds 1.72bn (Pounds 1.59bn), thanks to economic
recovery in the US and Australia, the company said. Higher demand from
manufacturing industry helped the gases division report operating profits up
from Pounds 156.6m to Pounds 161.4m.
Although prices remained flat, Mr Pat Dyer, chief executive, said he was
studying the price rise proposed on Monday by Praxair, a US rival.
'You would not have to be too intelligent to see what we are going to do,'
said Mr Dyer, adding that it would be 'a little difficult' to raise prices
by more than 7 per cent.
The gases business in much of continental Europe remained in recession.
BOC's recently acquired atmospheric gases businesses in Poland and its
hydrogen business in Germany had made some pro-gress.
'We would like to have a bigger continental presence,' said Mr Dyer,
although he added that any growth in mainland Europe would continue to be
gradual and the group's concentration on markets in developing economies had
provided BOC with strong growth.
Better results from the north Pacific market were offset by lower profits
from Japan.
The healthcare business continued to be hit by the falling price of the
anaesthetic gas Forane, which has lost its patent protection in the US.
Healthcare operating profits fell 47 per cent to Pounds 29.3m (Pounds 55m).
The company's new anaesthetic, Suprane, continued to gain market share 'but
the costs associated with introducing it meant that it could not offset the
impact on profit from lower Forane revenues'.
The smaller vacuum technology and distribution services business benefited
from growth in demand from semiconductor manufacturers. Its operating
profits rose from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 24.8m.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Economic recovery aids Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of economic recovery in Hanson's two main areas of activity could
be detected in many of the half year figures published by the Anglo-American
conglomerate yesterday.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said the first half of the financial year,
to end-March, was 'marked by clear signs of emerging economic recovery in
the UK and continuing improvement in the US'. He said the group's profits
were still close to their trough, with the potential peak - based on the
group's previous records in each division - at Pounds 1bn more in a full
year.
The group is involved in many cyclical areas - such as bricks, aggregates,
lumber and polyethylene - which were now seeing the benefit of the economic
upturn translated into rising volumes and increased prices, and in turn
higher profits.
At London Brick, for instance, volumes rose by 10 per cent and prices by 5
per cent with lower levels of price discounting too. As a result, brick
stocks in the UK have fallen to less than four months worth. ARC, the
aggregates business, increased prices between 6 and 10 per cent on March 1,
while in the US, polyethylene prices were upped by 5 per cent, with every
extra cent adding Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) to operating
profits in a full year. Forest products profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds
60m.
Even so, some areas saw profit falls. Grove Cranes fell from Pounds 15m to
Pounds 5m as excess equipment with dealers, both new and used, depressed
markets in Europe and the US. Profits from SCM Chemicals, which makes
titanium dioxide, fell 15 per cent to Pounds 44m as prices dropped 5 per
cent, offsetting a 9 per cent rise in sales.
The figures were the usual Hanson maze of one-off items, both positive and
negative. Group sales in the half were ahead 17.7 per cent to Pounds 5.64bn,
with Pounds 848m coming from acquisitions, virtually all from Quantum
Chemical, bought on the final day of the last financial year.
Operating profits from continuing businesses fell to Pounds 373m (Pounds
391m), but acquisitions contributed Pounds 70m. Quantum's polyethylene
activities made Pounds 32m and Suburban Propane chipped in Pounds 38m.
Discontinued operations such as Beazer Homes, floated in the half year, made
Pounds 28m (Pounds 40m).
A profit of Pounds 333m (Pounds 40m) was recorded from disposals, which
includes the housebuilding sale, the office products business, and a number
of small UK activities.
There was a Pounds 155m swing on the interest line to a negative Pounds
119m. Mr Bill Landuyt, finance director, said this was in line with warnings
made last December of an expected adverse swing during the current year of
Pounds 275m. That left pre-tax profits at Pounds 683m, some 35 per cent up
on Pounds 507m.
Organic growth in operating profits was 8.4 per cent to Pounds 453m, with
the rate accelerating between the first and second quarter, Mr Bonham said.
That figure excluded disposal profits, and the Pounds 80m (Pounds 25m) cost
of the Peabody coal strike, settled in December.
A potential concern was a cash outflow of Pounds 246m. However, Mr Landuyt
blamed most of this on a Pounds 387m rise in working capital which resulted
from a number of changes. The refinancing of debt meant that Pounds 145m of
accrued interest at the end of the last financial year had not been
replaced, and the change of date for the budget - in advance of which
Imperial Tobacco usually runs down its stock, left it with Pounds 80m higher
working capital.
Mr Landuyt said on a normalised basis, there would have been an inflow of
Pounds 100m.
The cash raised from disposals, which totalled Pounds 815m, and the issue of
shares which brought in Pounds 116m, with Pounds 89m coming from the
exercise of warrants issued in 1987 when Hanson bought Kidde, cut gearing
from 86 per cent to 69 per cent over the six months.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Celltech near to asthma drug deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celltech, the biotechnology company which floated on the stock market in
December 1993, will within months sign a collaborative deal on the
development of an asthma drug worth at least Pounds 20m.
Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive, said yesterday he was in advanced talks
with four companies interested in taking the asthma treatment through the
later, more expensive, clinical trials and to market.
The deal would involve royalty payments to Celltech and 'other mechanisms'
for sharing profits, he said.
News of the deal came as the company released its interim results for the
six months to the end of March 1994.
The proceeds from the flotation lifted the company's net cash position - one
of the most important figures in a biotechnology company's balance sheet -
to Pounds 40.3m (Pounds 11.4m).
Turnover rose from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 6.5m as the biologics division
boosted sales of materials to pharmaceutical companies. This figure is
likely to be much lower in the second half as production stops for new and
larger equipment to be installed.
Sales of biologics, and a Pounds 1.5m progress payment from Bayer, helped
limit the half-year pre-tax loss to a little changed Pounds 4.4m (Pounds
4.3m).

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo steps up attack on hostile predator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo yesterday fired its second volley in the war against hostile predator
Enterprise Oil by accusing the rival explorer of having lost its way in the
1990s.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, urged shareholders in the second letter
in less than a week to reject Enterprise's Pounds 1.4bn paper offer. He
claimed Enterprise's management was 'hiding behind the success of its
predecessors'.
Proven and probable reserves had fallen by 42m barrels of oil equivalent in
the 1990s, while almost Pounds 500m had been spent on exploration, appraisal
and acquisitions. Finding costs had also risen since 1990 from 43p per
barrel to 213p.
Enterprise was spending more to find less oil, Lasmo argues. 'In 1993,
Enterprise spent Pounds 67m to drill 2.6 net wells. Finding costs have
soared,' the company said.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Searching for liquidity in trendless Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global investors have punted heavily in Japanese equities in recent months,
and the tactical shift has been nicely rewarded in the short term. So far
this year the FT-Actuaries World Index is showing a gain of about 3 per cent
in dollars, but the sub-index for Japan is up 20 per cent. Foreigners bought
Japanese stocks worth Dollars 33.5bn (Pounds 22bn) net in the first three
months of 1994, contributing substantially to the rally in the Tokyo market
and also to the strength of the yen. Meanwhile the Japanese were net sellers
of foreign securities, to the tune of about Dollars 9bn (mainly reflecting a
Dollars 13bn sell-off of bonds in March).
Whether these speculative portfolio movements have done anything to cure
Japan's economic woes is a moot point, however. Real GDP has been more or
less unchanged for two years now. With consumer prices up just 0.8 per cent
year-on-year, Japan teeters on the edge of deflation: indeed, on the basis
of wholesale prices falling at nearly 3 per cent a year, it is already
there. The capital flows are serving to aggravate the problem of an
overvalued yen, adding to the impact of the obstinately durable Dollars
130bn current account surplus. Moreover the purchases of equities by
foreigners are essentially being mopped up by banks and are not contributing
to liquidity growth which might stimulate demand in the broader economy.
Some of these issues are addressed in an in-depth study from Jardine
Fleming's Toyko economist Richard Werner, who has conducted an extensive
analysis of liquidity in Japan. He has constructed several indices of
liquidity which suggest that the recent slight upturn in the conventional
monetary indicators may be misleading: the M2 plus certificates of deposit
aggregate, shrinking in 1993, has recently been growing at about 2 per cent,
but liquidity on most of JF's definitions remains flat.
During the 1980s private liquidity in Japan was growing at around 12 per
cent a year while nominal GDP was rising at only about 5 1/2 per cent: the
excess fuelled the great asset price bubble. By 1991 some 40 per cent of
outstanding bank credit was directed to speculative areas such as property
and finance. If only half of these are eventually paid back the bad debts
would be 20 per cent of outstanding loans. Many financial institutions have
become technically insolvent.
Shell-shocked banks cannot be substantial sources of new credit in these
circumstances. Spending packages by the government have had little effect
because they have been offset by bond issues which have drained liquidity
out of the economy again. Only if the Bank of Japan prints money can the
economy grow - but the BoJ is terrified of creating inflation and/or another
asset price bubble.
As for the foreign portfolio inflows, much of the supply of stock will have
come from banks seeking to book profits to strengthen their balance sheets.
There are no significant new issues of the kind which pumped huge amounts of
liquidity into the US corporate sector.
So will the BoJ respond? Perhaps: Richard Werner says cautiously that there
have been signs of a policy shift. Recent foreign exchange intervention has
not been sterilised as was previously the rule, and his leading liquidity
index has jumped, although the broad liquidity index remains subdued. More
evidence of an aggressive policy is required: without it the Japanese
economy will go nowhere.
Foreign investors could now be tempted to take some profits. At the very
least they will need to think about hedging their yen exposure, because a
recovery in the economy in general and in profits in particular will require
even lower short-term interest rates (now only just over 2 per cent) and a
weaker yen to stop the erosion of wholesale prices.
The bulls argue that Tokyo is the only major stock market currently nowhere
near its historical highs. That provides a tempting but dangerous recovery
prospect: Japan has a profoundly sick economy that requires not tender care
but major surgery. Asset prices are still too high, but they have to be
sustained at levels which damage the real economy because otherwise the
banking system would be undermined.
Foreigners may profitably job in and out of these distortions but they would
be unwise to make long-term commitments.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Globex hit by Liffe decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by
Reuters, the financial information and news group, was dealt a further blow
yesterday when Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, said
it had decided against joining.
Liffe's decision comes one month after the Chicago Board of Trade announced
it was pulling out of Globex despite a new agreement designed to revitalise
the system and lighten the financial obligations on participating exchanges.
Following the CBoT's departure, only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
France's Matif remain as Reuters' Globex partners. However, the DTB,
Germany's futures exchange, is expected to make a decision today on whether
it will join Globex. Simex, Singapore's futures exchange, is also having
talks with Globex.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the board's decision reflected its
main priority, which was to increase the distribution of Liffe's products
outside European time zones.
'Regrettably, the terms on which our participation in Globex were offered
would have denied us further development of our preferred linkage strategy
and would have meant withdrawal from our Euroyen discussions with Tiffe,
Tokyo's financial futures exchange,' he said.
Liffe would also have been precluded from extending its automated trading
system beyond its current hours of use. 'These restrictive conditions were
totally unacceptable to the Liffe board,' Mr Durlacher said.
Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters' managing director for transaction products, said
although she was disappointed that Liffe was not going to join Globex, she
believed that its future was not dependent on the participation of large
exchanges.
Nevertheless, observers said Liffe's participation would have gone a long
way towards providing the critical mass which Globex needs to survive. Mr
Alastair Smellie, a media analyst with the US investment bank, Lehman
Brothers, said: 'It is a disappointment, there are no two ways about it. The
success of Globex is dependent on a critical level of volume.'
Reuters is believed to have invested Dollars 100m in Globex. Its shares fell
7p to 485p yesterday.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Spirits help Allied-Lyons advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons, the UK-based drinks, food and retailing group which is paying
Pounds 740m for control of the Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks producer,
yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits to
Pounds 606m.
The figure, struck after Pounds 26m of additional pension costs, compares
with Pounds 505m the previous year when profits were reduced by Pounds 64m
of restructuring charges. Currency movements added Pounds 6m.
Excluding the charges, pre-tax profits increased by 9 per cent in the year
to March 5 on turnover up 4.9 per cent at Pounds 5.53bn.
Earnings per share benefited from a lower tax charge and advanced 25.1 per
cent to 36.7p. A final dividend of 14.9p raises the total from 21p to 22.2p,
but the shares closed 4p lower at 559p.
Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, said the year was one of 'solid performance
in still tough market conditions' and added that the current year 'has
started satisfactorily'. Gains in spirits and retailing, which contribute 80
per cent of group trading profit, offset a weak performance by the
Carlsberg-Tetley brewing joint venture formed in December 1992. Overall
trading profits increased by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 821m, reflecting the
absence of restructuring costs. By far the biggest contributor was the Hiram
Walker spirits division, which raised its profits by 5.1 per cent to Pounds
434m and widened its margins. In Scotch whisky, Ballantine's, the group's
most important brand, maintained overall volumes with gains in duty-free
sales, Greece and eastern Europe, offsetting lower volumes in Spain, France
and Germany, while Teacher's volumes rose by 13 per cent.
Beefeater gin continued to grow in Spain, duty free and in the UK where
sales were up 25 per cent, but US volumes were affected by destocking and
its total volumes were marginally lower.
From today the Spanish group Domecq, which sells 19m cases of spirits and 5m
of wine, will become part of the division.
Retailing profits increased 7.2 per cent to Pounds 209m, with the group's
pub companies which generate about 70 per cent of sector profits, increasing
their contribution despite a reduction in average pub numbers by 403 to
4,279.
Trading profits from the brewing division, which now includes the
Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture, the group's Dutch Brewery and a 22.5 per
cent stake in Britannia Soft Drinks, increased from Pounds 91m to Pounds
96m.
However, Mr Peter Macfarlane, finance director, cautioned that like-for-like
earnings from the joint brewing venture fell by 14 per cent.
In the food manufacturing division Lyons' trading profits were slightly
ahead at Pounds 87m (Pounds 86m).

FT  18 MAY 94 / Banks hold out on loan to Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dozen international banks with substantial exposures to Eurotunnel were
last night refusing to provide new senior debt for the Channel tunnel
operator's refinancing.
Yesterday evening, 24 hours after the formal deadline for raising the funds,
members of Eurotunnel's 200-bank syndicate had made commitments to provide
just over Pounds 500m of the new debt, still well short of the Pounds 700m
target.
The company has also not yet received formal approval from banks for its
refinancing, including changes in its loan agreements, to avoid it being in
breach of covenants. Votes have been received from 80 per cent of banks,
compared with the 90 per cent majority required.
About half of the recalcitrant banks are Japanese. However, a principal
lender to the group said that some European banks had also not yet made any
commitments to provide the new funds.
'It is all moving in the right direction, albeit slowly,' a European banker
said. He was hopeful that those big banks holding out would eventually
provide the funds and vote in favour.
He said it would be harder to achieve the target if the banks holding out
were the ones with small exposures to the company's commercial debt of
Pounds 6.8bn.
Until the banks have guaranteed to provide the senior debt and purge the
breaches in loan covenants, Eurotunnel cannot launch its rights issue to
raise a further Pounds 850m in equity, around 20 per cent more than the
stock market had originally been expecting.
Yesterday Eurotunnel gained permission from its shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting to issue an additional 150m units - which twin
a Eurotunnel plc share with a Eurotunnel SA share - in the rights issue.
The company has permission to issue 342m units, worth Pounds 1.38bn at
yesterday's closing price of 405p per unit. But Eurotunnel emphasised that
the size of the authority did not indicate the size or price of the rights
issue.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel chairman, said after the meeting that it
would probably try to raise total debt and equity of about Pounds 1.6bn if
it opted for an equal mix of loan and share capital in the refinancing.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Hanson raises dividend: First-half profits up to Pounds 683m
 -Bonham looks for acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson surprised the stock market yesterday by increasing its quarterly
dividend, from 2.85p to 3p, when announcing half-year pre-tax profits up
from Pounds 507m to Pounds 683m, a figure buoyed by Pounds 333m of disposal
profits.
Lord Hanson. chairman of the Anglo-American conglomerate, also gave an
upbeat view of trading, saying 'our return to profit growth at the operating
level is now established'.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said economic recovery in the US and UK,
an accelerating trend in underlying profits growth, the resolution of
uncertainties such as the US coal strike, and the improvement in the group's
balance sheet meant 'we feel positive enough to increase the dividend'.
He said Hanson would not have raised the dividend unless it was sure the new
level was sustainable. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose from 7.7p to
9.9p in the six months.
He added that the dividend increase put Hanson on one of the highest yields
in the FT-SE 100 index. The stock market started to erode that yield by
pushing the share price 5 1/2 p higher to 268 1/2 p at the close. The
initial reaction had been better, though, with the shares jumping to 273p
before easing back.
Some analysts, who had not expected a dividend increase for another three or
six months, applauded the move but others questioned whether it was prudent.
One said: 'They are already paying a high dividend. There is no reason to
pay more.' He added that last year's dividend had been covered by earnings
only 1.3 times - 'a very uncomfortable ratio compared with the rest of UK
plc'. Another suggested Hanson had 'an in-built desire to please the market
and get the share price up' to use shares for acquisitions, and that had
prompted the increase.
It was the first rise in the quarterly dividend since December 1992. In
December last year, when reporting full-year figures, the 1993 final
dividend was not increased for the first time in the group's 30-year
history.
Mr Bonham said underlying operating profits rose 8.4 per cent in the
half-year to March 31, with the pace quickening between the first and second
quarters. Quantum Chemical, the US polyethylene and propane group bought
last September for Pounds 2bn, had added to earnings in its first six
months, contributing Pounds 70m of profits before Pounds 40m of interest
costs.
After the Quantum deal Hanson's gearing rose to 86 per cent, but a disposal
programme had cut it to 69 per cent at the end of March. With an expected
further reduction in the second half, Mr Bonham said: 'We're prepared to
look at acquisitions from here on.'

FT  18 MAY 94 / Personal pension sales hit by fears over mis-selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of people taking out single premium personal pension policies
fell sharply in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period
of 1993.
Figures released by the Association of British Insurers suggest sales have
been hit by widespread concern over the possible mis-selling of personal
pensions to people transferring a lump sum from a pension scheme run by a
former employer.
Last December, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, launched a review of pension transfer business, after publishing
a pilot study which suggested a majority of pension transfers failed to meet
regulators' requirements.
The ABI figures show that numbers of single premium pensions sold fell from
166,000 in the first quarter of 1993, to 110,000 in the first three months
of this year. 'Pensions may well be reflecting the uncertainty of
transacting business in the transfer market in the light of the current SIB
review,' the ABI said.
However, comparison of the two quarters showed the impact on premium income
to the life companies was not substantial. Excluding Department of Social
Security rebates and incentives, new single premium pension income fell only
by about 7 per cent, from Pounds 1.21bn to Pounds 1.12bn.
The pension figures come against a background of a general fall in new life
and pensions business. New annual premium income from life insurance and
annuities fell by 9 per cent from Pounds 417m in the first quarter of 1993
to Pounds 378m in the first three months of this year. Even single premium
income in these areas was down slightly to Pounds 2.5bn.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the ABI, said life and pensions products
had faced strong competition from other forms of savings, such as personal
equity plans, where investors had to take up entitlements before the end of
the tax year.
The SIB has already issued guidance intended to improve the standards of
selling in personal pensions business.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Braer report calls for urgent action on shipping: Inquiry
finds significant incidence of human error
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for urgent action to cut the chance of human error in shipping and
reduce the danger of pollution of the seas was made in an official report
published yesterday.
Lord Donaldson's inquiry into the prevention of shipping pollution, launched
after the sinking of the oil tanker Braer, has made more than 100
recommendations for improved safety procedures.
The Braer, a Liberian-registered tanker, spilled 85,000 tonnes of Norwegian
oil into the sea off Shetland in January 1993 after sea water entered its
diesel tanks and caused engine failure.
Responding to the report, Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas, Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, announced plans to shame shipowners into raising
standards by publishing a monthly list of sub-standard ships calling at UK
ports, detailing the names of vessels, their defects, flags and owners.
Lord Donaldson and his inquiry team said they 'were surprised and alarmed at
the number of potentially serious incidents which took place during the
course of the inquiry . . . Although none resulted in major pollution, it
was largely a matter of chance that they did not'.
The report identified human failings as the cause of virtually all
accidental pollution from ships, and said the best preventative measure was
improved maintenance and operation standards.
Its recommendations include:
A tougher system for inspecting ships arriving in port. An increase in the
number of tugs around the UK coastline. Improved sharing of information
between charterers, insurers, shipping agents and regulatory bodies on the
standards of ships and fleets. Substandard ships would then have difficulty
finding cargoes and increase their insurance premiums.
Better identification of ships at sea by painting their international radio
call sign on their sides and decks. The creation of Marine Environmental
High Risk Areas, a small number of areas which are both environmentally
sensitive and on busy shipping routes.
The inquiry said these measures would cost about Pounds 10m with the bill to
be shared by the government and shipowners.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, called for the North Sea states
to bring in tough new regulations to enforce better standards because of the
failure of the 'flag states' to act. Numast, the ships' officers union, said
it was concerned that planned cutbacks at the department of transport's
marine safety agency would undermine the inquiry's recommendations.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Sutherland ready to join race for EU presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The race to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission was joined last night by Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), who
signalled he was available for the job.
Mr Sutherland, whose leadership at Gatt was instrumental in securing the
Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation deal, recently said he would be
stepping down at the end of the year.
'If I was asked the question about being a candidate (for the Commission
presidency) by a member state then I would have to give it serious
consideration,' Mr Sutherland said.
He told RTE, Irish television, that 'it's an entirely hypothetical
situation'. But he stressed twice that 'it's a very important position for
Ireland, for Europe and the world'.
Mr Sutherland's candidacy opens up a field which includes Mr Ruud Lubbers,
the outgoing Dutch prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier,
and Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner in charge of the EU's
external economic relations.
The Irishman, a successful competition commissioner in Brussels in 1984-88,
is a plausible if long-shot compromise. But he must pick up endorsements
from leading member states - particularly Germany - and win the support of
Dublin. The EU's 12 heads of government are expected to decide on Mr Delors'
successor at their summit in Corfu on June 24-25.
It is understood that of the larger member states, only Spain has so far
sounded out Mr Sutherland. The Gatt chief has a Spanish wife, and a
Commission president from Ireland, which is a member of the 'Cohesion' group
of the four poorest member states including Spain, Portugal and Greece,
would be a useful ally for Madrid.
Mr Lubbers remains the front-runner, but has less than warm relations with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Kohl is said by some leading EU officials to
favour Mr Dehaene, who could also get backing from Paris. Sir Leon is
hampered by being from the UK, which has opt-outs from the Maastricht
treaty.

FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the composition rather than the scale of Lloyd's loss for the 1991
underwriting year that gives greatest cause for concern. Business actually
written in 1991 showed an underwriting loss, but notably less than the
previous year. If that improvement continues, policies now being written
should be profitable. Yet Lloyd's syndicates felt obliged to add Pounds 1bn
to reserves to cover claims on policies written many years before. That is
70 per cent more than was set aside in the 1990 underwriting. While the pain
from old years continues to mount, Names will not feel the benefit of
business now being written.
How much more pain is to come remains a matter of conjecture. Proposals for
reform of US Superfund legislation could help reduce pollution claims. But
the timing and impact of any reform is impossible to judge. Claims in areas
such as asbestosis and professional indemnity insurance show no sign of
abating. While Lloyd's appears to be better reserved than many US insurance
companies, there is no way of knowing whether its reserves are sufficient.
The plan to ring-fence old liabilities within a new company still looks the
best hope of solving the problem. If there are not enough reserves set aside
already to make the ring-fence secure, though, Names will again be asked to
contribute. An audit of liabilities and reserves across Lloyd's should give
a clearer picture. The results of that audit, together with haggling in the
US Congress over Superfund, will determine whether Lloyd's can escape the
legacy of the past.

FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied-Lyons' annual results produced a predictable combination of strength
in spirits and retailing, offset by weakness in beer. Though the joint
venture with Carlsberg is improving after a disappointing start, it remains
a drag on performance. The underlying contribution from beer to last year's
earnings fell by 14 per cent even including the interest on the Pounds 135m
cash payment from Carlsberg when the venture was set up. That will only
reinforce the belief that brewing, like food, lacks a long-term future
within the group. Meanwhile, though, Allied's management seems finally set
to reap the benefits of the transformations it has wrought in spirits and
retailing.
Like Grand Metropolitan, Allied has had its disappointments in the US
spirits market, but it is making inroads in eastern Europe and Domecq should
bring opportunities in South America. Similarly the improving quality of its
pub estate and a greater focus on food helped produce a 7 per cent increase
in underlying profits from retailing.
The test will be whether Allied can use this growing strength to generate
more cash. Gearing fell only slightly last year to 70 per cent. Domecq
produced only Pounds 9m in net cash last year, but this was after payment of
Pounds 25m in dividends and there may be scope to reduce the Pounds 38m
negative cash contribution from working capital. If it can start reducing
its debt by generating cash from operations as well as disposals, Allied
will be able to claim its strategy has been vindicated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC spent most of last year trying to dampen the market's expectations,
finally by announcing that, for the first time since the early 1970s, it
would not increase its dividend. Yet yesterday's interim statement struck an
optimistic tone, pointing to early signs of volume growth in gases. Since
demand for gases is a fair indicator of industrial activity, that suggests
consumer-led recovery in the Anglo-Saxon world is finally taking root in the
wider economy.
Many of the special problems which afflicted BOC last year are also easing.
The pharmaceuticals division seems to be recovering after losing the US
patent on Forane, its staple anaesthetic. While there could be a relapse if
more companies choose to manufacture cheap generic versions of the drug, BOC
has moved to protect margins by cutting costs. Any further margin squeeze in
industrial gases should also be offset by the benefits of restructuring. If
prices start to rise, BOC will be well placed to benefit.
The brighter outlook leaves the equity market in something of a quandary.
After a decade yielding less than the market average, BOC's shares were
pushed to a handsome yield premium last year. With the growth prospects
seemingly restored the yield premium should logically be unwound.
Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares is a step in that direction.
Having been so sorely disappointed last year, though, investors will be wary
of taking a giant leap.

FT  18 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson's cash flows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The return to dividend increases at Hanson has come faster than expected.
The conglomerate froze its dividend only last December as gearing levels
mounted. On the face of it, the group's financial position has improved
since then, but not that dramatically. Gearing at end'March was 69 per cent
compared with 86 per cent last September. But disposals brought in Pounds
898m, while share issues - mainly through the exercise of warrants - knocked
another Pounds 116m off debt. Operating activities produced a post-tax cash
outflow of Pounds 246m.
Hanson argues that the underlying position is better. Once one-off cash
outflows associated with the Quantum acquisition, the Peabody coal strike
and the change in the group's interest payments are taken into account,
operating cash inflow was actually Pounds 100m. Moreover, Hanson's highly
cyclical businesses have started to pick up and are expected to improve
further in the second half. Volumes are going up and price rises can
increasingly be made to stick.
Hanson says it is prepared to return to the acquisition trail if the right
acquisition comes along at the right price. But a sizeable acquisition now
would be premature. Investors will probably want first to see operating cash
flow covering the increased dividend and gearing below 50 per cent. Still,
such a prospect is not far away. The continuing economic recovery should see
to cash flow. Meanwhile, the exercise of another tranche of warrants later
this year should reduce debt by Pounds 200m with disposals next financial
year bringing in perhaps a few hundred million pounds more. By this time
next year, Hanson could be ready to leap.

It sounds like Geoffrey Martin, the acting head of the European Commission's
London outpost, has finally got the job as the EC's official London
flagwaver.
A year has passed since John Drew quit the job and there has been strong
pressure to reserve the post for a friendly Tory MEP who failed to win
re-election next month.
Martin, 53, an Ulsterman, is not the normal kind of Brussels bureaucrat. He
was president of the National Union of Students while at Belfast's Queen's
University, then ran the housing charity, Shelter, and worked for the
Commonwealth Secretariat before joining the Commission.
A European-friendly equivalent of Des Wilson, perhaps?

Who was the journalist who has admitted making up previous accounts of
clashes between the Bank of England and the Treasury?
Kenneth Clarke, the 'business friendly' Chancellor of the Exchequer, dropped
the tantalising reference into his CBI speech last night in a bid to prove
that the publication of the regular monetary chats between the Treasury and
the Bank of England led to a better informed debate.
The Chancellor likened his actions to introducing 'Red Indians to whisky' -
it was heady stuff for journalists, he said.
But who was the journalist who let the side down? Surely not Rupert
Pennant-Rea, ex-editor of the Economist and now deputy governor of the Bank
of England. All Clarke's officials would say was that it was a 'state
secret'.

When is a leak not a leak? When it is 'enterprised without our help'. This
was how Xerox explained why its new digital publishing strategy somehow
appeared in the US press before being announced to an eager world.
In terms of business jargon, the US continues to lead the world. A Texas
firm, for example, reported recently that one of the benefits of its
labour-saving process was 'retarded headcount growth'.
But US jargon producers are facing increasing foreign competition. A college
at Guildford, England, has just scrapped its four student faculties and
replaced them with 'curriculum delivery units'.
Meanwhile, the World Society for the Protection of Animals has come up with
a politically correct alternative to a pet. It is a companion animal.

Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie . . ? Forget it.
The latest Australian gold mine is located far closer to the department of

has noticed - and shut it down.
Since Sydney won the right to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000, some
240 smart alicks have registered business names incorporating the likes of
'Olympic', 'Sydney 2000' and 'Games City'.
The idea is to flog them on, in due course and for a suitable sum, to the
sports marketeers.
With local Olympic sponsorship revenues expected to exceed ADollars 425m,
the authorities have had a bit of a panic about how to protect their brand
from 'ambush marketing'.
Hence the state law decreeing that entrepreneurs will need government
consent to use any such title - which they won't get.

Oil explorers are not normally the politest bunch.
Hence there is some surprise at the remarkable civility of Enterprise Oil's
hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo. Both sides have been busy dissecting
each other's record and cost of finding oil, and have avoided getting into
personal slanging matches about the size of the chairman's expense account,
etc.
This may all change in a week or two. However, there is a possible
explanation as to why Enterprise's criticisms of Lasmo management, a key
part of its offensive, have so far been relatively muted.
Could it be that Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive,
may try to rally flagging City support for his bid by offering Joe Darby,
Lasmo's chief executive, the same position in a combined company? That would
be a bit tricky if he had trashed Darby's reputation in the battle.
Stranger things have happened. After all, Hearne is 11 years older than
Darby and his reputation in the City would be enhanced if he agreed to split
his own role as chairman and chief executive.
And no doubt the problem of what to do with Lasmo chairman Rudolph Agnew
could be solved with a handsome cash settlement.

John Smith's death may have thrown the Labour party into confusion, but at
least there is now a bit of time in which to craft an elegant solution to
the leadership quandary. Pity Bill Clinton, who has to make a hastier
decision.
Into his diary for June 4 had been scheduled the US president's first ever
meeting with Smith - in Portsmouth so that he could step straight on to the
D-day flotilla. What, though, does Clinton do now?
Acting leader Margaret Beckett seems to be viewed as a less than wholly
suitable subject for Clinton's undivided attention - seeing that she won't
get the job full-time.
If he embarks on a session with the entire party leadership, on the other
hand, he could be accused of interfering. Some Japanese apparently took
offence last July when Clinton earnestly chatted up Morohiro Hosokawa, then
only the leader of a small political party, at a time when Kiichi Miyazawa
was still prime minister.
It's a wonder he ever ventures out of the Oval Office at all.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Chernomyrdin sees the light
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Victor Chernomyrdin was chosen as Russia's prime minister because he had a
proven track record of running a successful Soviet enterprise. He was not
picked because of his grasp of the economic and management skills required
to shift a centralised and militarised economy towards a decentralised,
market system.
But the policy statement published in this newspaper on Monday indicates, at
the very least, that Mr Chernomyrdin has been persuaded by 18 months in high
office that currency stability is a top priority and that potential foreign
investors require a stable legal and tax regime and have to be wooed, not
grudgingly tolerated.
These are important conclusions, reflecting a marked shift away from the
attitudes with which Mr Chernomyrdin assumed office. Gasprom, the gas
enterprise he once controlled, was always a ferocious lobbyist for more
funds and fiercely resistant to foreign investment in one of Russia's
industrial 'crown jewels'.
Mr Chernomyrdin appears to have taken on board both the advice of the
international institutions and the reform experience of central Europe and
the former Soviet Baltic states, especially Estonia. He portrays himself as
a convert to the virtues of positive real interest rates and tightly
controlled budgets. As proof, he points to his government's perseverance
with anti-inflationary policies in the face of a 25 per cent decline in
production and screams of pain from the powerful military, industrial and
farm lobbies.
Such perseverance is brave. But, as Mr Chernomyrdin now concedes, there is
no alternative. The really difficult part still lies ahead. Monthly
inflation of 7 or 8 per cent is better than 30 per cent, but it has to be
reduced still further if the preconditions for stable growth are to be
established.
Loss-making plants
It is hard to see how inflation can be reduced, however, while the prime
minister continues to argue that the loss-making plants which sustain
employment and social amenities in 'hundreds of cities and towns throughout
Russia' have to continue in production. These plants and cities were built
in defiance of economic logic to serve a militarised economy which has to be
largely dismantled if resources are to be freed up to allow the development
of new enterprises, responsive to the needs of consumers and capable of
producing the goods and services required to build a market-based economy.
Equally clearly, however, the millions of Russians who live and work in such
communities cannot simply be abandoned to their fate. Devising a social
security framework which would allow the Russian authorities to provide
unemployment pay, and to retrain and relocate workers and their families
away from what were often in origin Stalin-era prison labour camps or cold
war bastions, should become a top priority for co-operation between the
Russian and western governments.
Managed decline
At the same time, however, the leaders of Russia have to keep in the
forefront of their mind that the new economy which will eventually grow out
of the wreckage of the Soviet model will not be a modernised version of the
old. An economic policy which concentrates on revamping and modernising
thousands of Soviet-era plants is not likely to leave adequate resources for
budding entrepreneurs to build enough new factories and plants on greenfield
sites. Nor will revamping the old release sufficient resources to permit the
development of the service industries which have been so woefully lacking in
the past and which provide such a high proportion of employment and wealth
in contemporary market economies elsewhere in the world.
Mr Chernomyrdin is right to focus upon the need for financial and monetary
stability and is well placed both to understand the fears of state sector
managers and to explain the need for managed decline of the state sector.
But his main energies should be devoted to extending privatisation and
encouraging both foreign investment and the domestic entrepreneurs. The
private sector already provides more than 50 per cent of the jobs in the
booming Polish economy, and is rapidly increasing its share in other former
socialist economies.
Russia, with its skilled labour force and resources, is perfectly capable of
developing a modern economy along similar lines. The trick is to release the
energies of those capable of using Russia's potential wealth in a creative
and modern way, not to spend too much energy propping up the old structures.

FT  18 MAY 94 / High-wire act in a bear garden: John Plender explores the
impact of trading in derivatives and other financial instruments on the US
banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the start of the year, US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was
credited with unusual sagacity. His adroit manipulation of monetary policy
over the previous four years had restored the capital of the US banking
system and averted a credit crunch.
Today things look altogether different. The financial community is nervous
and critical, following successive increases in interest rates that have
rattled global markets. Politicians in Congress fear that the high volume of
trading in derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and options could
lead to a disaster to match the recent savings and loans fiasco. The
stability of the US financial structure is once again being questioned
against the background of exceptional market volatility.
At first sight, that seems paradoxical. If the banking system has been
recapitalised and profits are healthy, why worry? Yet the very success of Mr
Greenspan's gigantic market-rigging exercise, in which interest rates were
held at negligible levels in real terms while the banks traded their way out
of trouble, has distracted attention from a radical change in the structure
of the banking system. Of far greater long-run importance than the noisy
debate about derivatives and hedge funds is the way the biggest wholesale
banks - dealing mainly with governments, institutions and companies - have
been shrinking their deposits and loan books as they turn themselves into
high-octane global marketmakers and dealers, trading in a vast range of on-
and off-balance sheet instruments.
The visitor to Wall Street is left with the impression that the pace and
scale of financial innovation is such that no one can be sure how much
capital banks really need to support these activities. Small wonder that, in
a report due today, the US General Accounting Office is expected to call for
more stringent capital requirements.
The low stock market rating accorded to many big commercial and investment
banks also suggests that high profitability may reflect nothing more than
increased risk-taking. The falls in the biggest US banks' trading profits in
the recent first-quarter figures lend credibility to that view. Much the
same applies to the investment banks, which the commercial banks
increasingly resemble. Salomon Brothers, says its chairman and chief
executive officer, Deryck Maughan, went into 1994 with the largest inventory
(of financial instruments) in its history. Others were almost certainly in
the same position before the storm struck, when the Fed raised interest
rates on February 4 for the first time since 1989.
If the investment banks adopted the opposite of Japanese just-in-time
inventory control last year, the big US commercial banks are becoming more
like their Japanese equivalents. Their capital is increasingly vulnerable to
market fluctuations, but without the prop of Japanese-style hidden reserves
or the albatross of crippling Japanese bad debts. This stems from an
approach to banking which reflects the belief that conventional financial
intermediation - raising deposits and lending to borrowers - will
increasingly be undertaken by markets instead of banks.
A growing proportion of such market activity is driven by high technology
and relentless innovation, notably in derivatives. The merit or otherwise of
the doubters' concerns about new instruments will be explored in a
subsequent article. What matters here is the big transformation in the
composition of bank revenues and balance sheets.
Consider Bankers Trust, whose visionary chairman Charles Sanford regards
run-of-the-mill commercial banks as no more than inefficient mutual funds
that do a poor job for their depositors. He expects conventional bank
intermediation to have largely disappeared by 2020 and is tailoring his
banks' activities accordingly.
Between 1989 and the end of 1993, Mr Sanford's loan book shrank from Dollars
18.4bn to Dollars 13.9bn, while the financial instruments that Bankers Trust
trades on its own account rose from Dollars 12.2bn to Dollars 48.3bn,
equivalent to more than half its total assets. Last year revenue from
own-account trading, at Dollars 1.6bn, exceeded net interest revenue of
Dollars 1.3bn for the first time; and that understates the dependence on
trading because net interest revenue included more than Dollars 600m that
was related to own-account trading.
Meantime the notional amount of instruments such as derivatives, which do
not appear on the balance sheet (and whose absolute value in the
accompanying tables and charts is less meaningful than their relative value
and the year-to-year trend) has soared from Dollars 461bn to Dollars 1,900bn
over the period. Equally striking is that the credit risk in relation to
counterparties in these off-balance sheet contracts stood at Dollars 61.8bn
in Bankers Trust's latest balance sheet, whose stockholders' equity amounted
to just Dollars 4.5bn.
Bankers Trust is the extreme case of a bank turning itself into a hugely
leveraged (highly borrowed) investment dealing company. But others have
comparably radical strategies. The giant of the industry, JP Morgan, has
seen its net loan book shrink from Dollars 26bn to Dollars 23.2bn over the
past five years, where it accounts for a mere 17.3 per cent of total assets.
Yet the balance sheet total has increased from Dollars 89bn to Dollars
134bn, with more than two-thirds of the increase coming from the rise in the
value of trading account assets. The notional amount of off-balance sheet
exposures has risen more than threefold to Dollars 1,700bn in that time (see
chart).
Much the same process has been at work in the investment banks. When Morgan
Stanley went public in the mid-1980s, its prospectus showed own-account
transactions amounting to 13.5 per cent of net revenues. In the latest
financial year the comparable figure was 38.9 per cent. There were no
figures in the original prospectus for swaps and other derivatives, whose
notional value stood at Dollars 629bn in Morgan Stanley's latest accounts.
Reporting accountants Arthur Young presumably took the view that they were
not sufficiently material in 1986 to require disclosure.
There were equally dramatic increases in off-balance sheet activity at
Salomon Brothers, which has traditionally been heavily dependent on trading
for its own account; also at Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch (see table).
And the big European universal banks are now following suit, leaving the
heavily regulated Japanese far in the rear.
Few on Wall Street or in London doubt that the US banks have mapped out the
future for wholesale finance. Up to a point, it works. Having lost most of
their biggest clients after Mexico's default in 1982, when companies
discovered that they could cut out the banking middleman and go direct to
the markets for funds, the banks have found a new way of ingratiating
themselves with their former corporate clients. Risk management and trading
products provide an answer to the shortage of bankable assets that followed
the third-world debt crisis. The problem is to identify the nature of the
risks and profits involved.
Charles Sanford at Bankers Trust argues that, if banks constantly adjust the
value of their financial instruments to market value - known as 'marking to
market' - credit problems will be perceived much earlier than with
conventional bank lending. Most institutions that use derivative instruments
will only deal with counterparties who have a respectable credit rating. In
this kind of world, Mr Sanford claims, the less developed country debt
problem would not have happened. 'Bank lending,' he boldly asserts, 'is the
most risky thing we do.'
Certainly it is hard to deny that these new-style bank balance sheets, with
more trading assets than loans, are inherently more liquid than in the past.
All the leading players have developed proprietary computer systems, which
are capable of monitoring trading exposures on a variety of assumptions at
the press of a button. They have risk-weighted capital disciplines that are
far in advance of the current global guidelines laid down by the Bank for
International Settlements.
As Salomon's Deryck Maughan puts it, the big US commercial and investment
banks are running larger market risks than five to 10 years ago. 'But they
are better equipped and better capitalised,' he adds, 'and have the capacity
to manage these risks.' Salomon, in fact, appears more highly leveraged than
most (see table) and it would have taken a fall of only 3.9 per cent in the
value of those financial instruments actually on the face of its end-1993
group balance sheet to wipe out the whole of its capital.
But the company has long argued that such conventional measures of leverage
are misleading, because they give no indication of the quality or liquidity
of assets, or the risk in off-balance sheet instruments. On its own
preferred measure of working capital to equity, it has managed to reduce its
leverage substantially since 1990, a period in which its conventional
equity-to-assets ratio deteriorated and its off-balance sheet exposure
exploded.
These sophisticated apologetics notwithstanding, the stock markets remain
sceptical. One reason, according to John Kriz of the credit rating agency
Moody's, is that over the past 20 years we have been told 'by statesmen of
the banking industry, and by technicians as knowledgeable in their
particular areas as any derivatives specialists, that their activities were
prudently controlled and did not entail excessive risk'. Then came the
third-world and real estate debt crises.
Another answer might be that new-style balance sheets, in which capital is
perpetually expanding and contracting in volatile fashion, have not been
tested in protracted bear markets. Moreover, while banks have reduced their
own balance sheet leverage by increasing capital, the leverage inherent in
the instruments and markets in which they deal has increased vastly. It is
not simply that derivative instruments are, by definition, more volatile
than the underlying cash markets. In effect, the banks are involved in a
Faustian compact with the markets, whereby their own pursuit of profit can
simultaneously jeopardise their capital.
Hedging risk through options trading provides an example of the double-edged
nature of the game. Because option portfolios continually become un-hedged
through price movements and the passage of time, constant trading is
necessary to re-establish the hedge. This is a marketmaker's dream. Yet
re-hedging requires traders to sell into falling markets, which is
inherently destabilising - especially when combined with margin and
collateral calls. A reduction in risk for the individual hedger increases
the aggregate risk in the market.
The leverage in instruments that do not strictly belong in the derivative
category can also be huge, points out Stephen Thieke, co-head of corporate
risk management at JP Morgan. Mortgage-backed securities are an obvious
example. When interest rates rise, fixed-rate mortgage holders are slower to
repay. The potential life of a mortgage-backed security is thus extended;
and because investors receive their principal later, they lose the chance to
reinvest at new, higher rates.
The duration of the mortgage component of the Lehman Brothers Bond Index,
covering some Dollars 1,200bn of outstanding mortgage paper, rose in March
from 3.47 years to 4.35 years following Fed tightening. Morgan's analysts
calculate that to offset this increase in the duration of the portfolio -
which is important for institutions that have to match their investments to
liabilities that fall due over time - investors would have had to sell the
equivalent of about Dollars 140bn of 10-year Treasury bonds or nearly
Dollars 250bn of five-year Treasuries.
Some, says Thieke, would not have had to do so where, for example, they were
tracking the mortgage-backed securities index. Even so, the astonishing
magnitudes involved help explain why the US bond market has an inbuilt and
growing tendency to overshoot. It is a tribute to those who have been
playing these new, high-risk games that, in the bear garden that has
prevailed since February, bankruptcies have been confined to marginal
participants
But the test is not over yet. The Fed will continue to raise rates; the
banks will shed more of their Dollars 300bn-plus portfolio of public sector
debt, as credit demand increases in a stronger economy; and US bond and
income mutual funds could face withdrawals after years of positive cash
flow. A further article next week will look in more detail at the risks to
the system as these high rollers move through uncharted territory.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Oil on the rocks again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Braer, the Liberian registered oil tanker, smashed onto the rocks
of the Shetland Isles in January 1993, spilling 85,000 tonnes of crude oil,
the public and MPs understandably called for immediate measures to prevent
such a disaster occuring again. Lord Donaldson's 500-page report into the
implications of the wreck for merchant shipping, published yesterday, says
that the call should be heeded.
The picture Donaldson paints is of an industry in near-crisis: suffering
from 'vast overcapacity', slender or non-existent profit margins, and an
unwieldy system of safety regulation. His team was 'shocked', it says, to
discover that there had been 67 incidents potentially as serious as the
Braer in UK waters last year.
Of the team's 103 recommendations, the main one - more regular inspections
by ports of ships' maintenance - appears both to be workable and to stand a
chance of improving safety standards. Under this proposal, European ports
would delay the granting of permission to load and unload cargo for ships
which did not comply with inspections.
Donaldson is right to identify maintenance standards as the heart of the
industry's poor safety record. He avoids, too, the temptation of calling for
further changes in ship design. There is no evidence that the double-layer
hulls incorporated in new tankers since 1993, in response to the Exxon Valez
disasters off Alaska, would have saved the Braer.
Public concern
However, Donaldson's recommendation that the UK should surround itself with
a network of salvage tugs to help struggling tankers appears more of a
gesture to public concern - and potentially an expensive one - than an
effective policy. Tugs were available to tow the Braer, but the captain
delayed in alerting them.
Similarly, the report's endorsement of the costly practice of spraying oil
slicks with detergent to disperse them is open to challenge.
Environmentalists say the detergents are as harmful to marine life as oil
pollution, while one of the lessons of the Shetlands is that the force of
the waves can be the most effective tool for dispersing pollution.
However the report's most serious omission is its failure to find more ways,
in its own words, 'to make it unprofitable to cut corners'. The key is
tackling the shortcomings of the present international rules on liability
for shipping pollution.
The Torrey Canyon spill in 1967 gave birth to the Civil Liability and Fund
Conventions, under which shipowners limit their liability for oil spills to
several hundred million dollars. Two voluntary compensation regimes known as
Tovalop and Cristal, financed partly by levies on the oil industry, cover
countries which have not signed the conventions.
Liability limits
Maximum liability under these schemes has been rising steadily - by more
than 20 per cent under Tovalop and Cristal for the current year. A further
rise in liability limits should be encouraged, given that the sums still
amount only to a tiny fraction of the costs of cleaning up.
That is not to back the scale of liability in the US, where Exxon has
already paid more than Dollars 2bn for the Valdez incident. Pitched at too
high a level, insurance rates soar and pressures on a struggling industry
intensify. What is needed is something midway between the global voluntary
schemes and US. Governments also need to find replacements for the voluntary
schemes, which expire in February 1994, or press more countries to ratify
the conventions. The low level of compensation for non-oil pollution - which
runs at only about 20 per cent of that for oil - represents another
troubling gap in the present regime.
The Donaldson report focuses mainly on measures within the UK government's
control. But, as it recognises, most of the toughest problems are
international in cause. That is the arena in which solutions need to be
framed.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: US action blatantly contradicts free
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Export promotion quite often is not only the obverse of trade
protection, as your leading comment states ('Uncle Sam, salesman', May 16),
but is virtually equivalent to it.
With decreasing average costs - which is certainly the case in the aircraft
industry - winning an export order enables companies such as Boeing to
reduce their domestic prices and still earn what is a genuine, that is
unsubsidised, profit on the resulting domestic orders.
Accordingly, promoting exports to Saudi Arabia is at the same time a most
elegant way to prevent possible foreign competitors from gaining access to
US markets as well.
Consequently, the trade policy currently employed by the Clinton
administration stands in blatant contradiction to the free trade philosophy
which it sermonises so emphatically, but nonetheless hypocritically,
elsewhere.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Link relief to level of investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VISHVAS KANJI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Venture capital trusts are intended to provide a much needed source of
capital for unquoted companies trading in high-risk activities.
However, your article (Management: 'Will the bait be tasty enough?', May 10)
reminds us of the shameful waste that can result when the parameters
defining the qualifying activity are drawn too tightly. In comparison, the
legislation on Employee Share Ownership Trusts occupies 10 pages of the
Finance Act 1989, but one can count the number of ESOTs set up on the
fingers of one hand.
Let us hope that this will not be the situation with VCTs. This is
particularly so as tax relief for specific activities is a form of subsidy.
This relief is given at the expense of taxpayers. It can be justified only
where it effectively promotes a credible government policy.
For VCTs the investment mix will be crucial. This could best be dealt with
by introducing a tapering relief.
A VCT would decide the percentage of funds it would invest in 'qualifying
companies', subject to a collar of, say, 65 per cent. The greater the
proportion of funds to be so invested, the greater the tax relief available
to the VCT investors.
A VCT prepared to invest more than, say, 90 per cent of its funds in
qualifying companies would allow its investors' gains to be completely tax
free. A VCT prepared to invest only 65 per cent of its funds in qualifying
companies would allow its investors' gains to be taxed at, say, half the
normal rate.
Partnership with private industry is an efficient use of resources to
promote government policy. Efficiency requires some flexibility. A tapering
relief would provide this.
It would be a shame if it was possible to count the number of VCTs on the
fingers of one hand.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: CrossRail would be folly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID STARKIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The 'business as usual' tone of the comment following the collapse of
the CrossRail bill ('Search starts for a way to revive CrossRail', May 12)
and your editorial comment ('CrossRail debacle', May 12) surely miss the
point.
It would appear that the economic return from investing in CrossRail is
inadequate and that the Commons committee was mindful of this when blocking
the bill.
You remark that the Jubilee Line was given the go-ahead as a political
gesture; but to go ahead with the CrossRail project would be to repeat the
folly.
There is a need for more investment in public transport infrastructure, but
let us invest wisely.
Projects with good social cost benefit returns do exist. But these often
appear to lack the glamour of the mega project or they serve less
politically charged interested groups.
Nevertheless, in the long run the economy will be better served by the
adoption of a more rational and consistent approach to transport
investments.

FT  18 MAY 94 / It's not on the menu: Mr Hurd's portrayal of an a la carte
Europe is deceptive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd has been trying to persuade the Tories that they ought to
like the European Union. In principle this is a worthy enterprise, and not
before its time, especially in the run-up to next month's elections to the
European Parliament. Unfortunately, however, the UK foreign secretary's
sales pitch for Europe is misleading, both about the facts as they are now,
and about the future as it is likely to be.
Mr Hurd has been telling the party that the argument in Europe is going
Britain's way. The European Union is not a tyrannous and regimented
organisation, he reassures the Tories, but a wonderfully flexible grouping,
which is becoming more flexible all the time. Its flexibility is reflected
in Britain's various opt-outs, from the single currency and the social
chapter; and this so-called 'variable geometry', by which member states can
pick and choose the policies that suit them, will be the wave of the future.
'This,' he told Scottish Conservatives last week, 'is a multi-track,
multi-speed, even multi-layered approach, which will increasingly be the way
of the future. It threatens no one.'
His tactics are obvious. The Conservatives risk a drubbing in the European
Parliament elections, some of which may come from the anti-European wing of
his own party. If he can win over some of the party's waverers on Europe, he
may hope to alleviate the danger of a threat to Prime Minister John Major's
leadership.
The problem is that it is simply not true to suggest either that national
opt-outs are becoming a generalised pattern throughout the Union, or that Mr
Hurd's image of a 'multi-track, multi-speed, multi-layered approach' is
becoming generally accepted as an alternative model of how Europe should
develop in future.
On the contrary, most of the other governments are still committed to the
model of an integrated Europe with strong common institutions, in which all
the member states sign up to reach the same common objectives, sooner or
later. This commitment to the traditional model tends to be strongest among
the original founding members at the heart of the European Union; and there
is no sign they are being won over by Mr Hurd's vision of Europe a la carte.
British ministers have triumphantly endorsed recent proposals from the Bonn
government for faster deregulation in Europe. But it would surely be a
mistake to draw too large an inference from this initiative. The German
government has its own problems of unpopularity with the voters in the
run-up to the European elections; and Germany also has its share of
Euro-sceptics. This episode does not constitute evidence of a strategic
shift in Germany's European policy, away from the objective of an integrated
Union, towards the loose Europe of opt-ins and opt-outs touted by Britain.
Now it is possible that we shall see more 'variable geometry' in Europe in
future. It may be desirable as a way of accommodating the countries of
eastern Europe; and if the Union becomes more integrated, it may be an
unavoidable concession to the reluctant members. But this does not mean that
Europe a la carte will become the preferred paradigm for Spain, Portugal or
Ireland, let alone for France, Germany or the Benelux.
So when Mr Hurd says that there is no danger of Britain being left in a
'slow lane or outer circle' of the European Union, he is being merely
disingenuous. There is certainly no danger that the other member states
would prefer to relegate Britain to an outer circle. But unless variable
geometry does become the generalised pattern for all the member states, the
logic of the way Mr Hurd is talking is that Britain might manoeuvre itself
into a slower lane.
Mr Hurd's advocacy of a British vision of Europe may ease the pressure on
the government in the European elections; or it may not, we shall see. But
the longer he sticks to this kind of dialectical deception, the harder it
will be to frame a reasonable strategy for the fundamental medium-term
choices coming up.
Those choices will have to be faced in the Inter-Governmental Conference of
1996. This was originally conceived as a fairly modest event, to revise the
Treaty of Maastricht in the light of experience; it now seems likely to be a
much bigger affair, to plan for the opening of the Union to the countries of
eastern Europe. No one yet knows how or when they can be brought in; but it
is already obvious that they cannot be included soon without fundamental
revisions of the Union's policies, or its institutions, and probably both.
A larger Europe, moreover, must have a common foreign and security policy.
This was a decorative optional extra in the Maastricht treaty, but will
become an inevitable obligation, imposed by geography. The east European
countries have just been offered associate partnership in the Western
European Union defence grouping; when they join the European Union, their
security from any instability in the east will unavoidably become our
concern. In political terms variable geometry will become more difficult in
this larger Europe, not easier.
In 1996, therefore, most existing member states will want to strengthen the
central institutions of the Union, including, no doubt, easier majority
voting and more powers for the European Parliament; and some may want to go
further, towards a European constitution. There must be a real danger of an
ideological confrontation between Britain and its partners. But the
negotiation will be unnecessarily gruelling the longer the government goes
on painting a misleading picture of the way things are really going in
Europe.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consultants are more than
cost-cutters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEITH BURGESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked'
(April 26), and the Cabinet Office report which it cites, are incomplete and
inaccurate regarding the contribution made by management consultancies to
government.
The quoted figure of Pounds 10m grossly understates the savings our members
are in fact able to prove.
Because the total savings are unknown, it cannot be assumed that they are
negligible.
Management consultancy is about creating wealth, encouraging best practice
and transferring skills.
It is not merely about cutting costs.
The Cabinet Office report agrees that consultants make a significant
contribution to achieving important government objectives. They also provide
invaluable assistance in managing change programmes and other fundamental
reforms.
The report makes clear, however, that there is little attempt by government
to track expenditure or to assess value for money with regard to
consultancies, and it argues that more should be done in this respect.
The MCA wholeheartedly agrees with this point. Much can be achieved through
improved purchasing, greater accountability and follow-through to obtain
better value for money.
It would be a great shame if a report, which is intended to produce such
changes, is used to pillory one of the most powerful forces stimulating such
improvements.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: A tribute to Gary Glitter / Review of 'Leader' at the
Arts Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leader] is billed as an 'affectionate' tribute by the Gang to Gary Glitter -
and that's the problem. 'Affectionate' is much too mealy-mouthed an approach
to Paul Dadd, the 50-year-old egomaniac who, after trying on as many
personalities as Rory Bremner, hit the world as Gary Glitter, the Bacofoil
Kid.
Supported by platform shoes of vertiginous height, and costumes that pushed
camp excess beyond the imagination of Julian Cleary, in 1972 Glitter changed
glam rock from a smile into a joke. He was also supported by the heftiest
drumbeat in the business. Outrageous; ridiculous; surreal; pathetic - these
are better words for Glitter.
Of course Glitter had the last laugh. He went through all the career moves
expected of a pop star - divorce, drug abuse, bankruptcy, teenage girls -
but kept coming back for more doses of fame. In the 1980s he discovered the
university circuit and students who remembered being awed by him as infants
were now ready to laugh with him in maturity.
Little of the enormity of the man and his durability comes out in Steve
Furst and M. Simon Leigh's portrait. It is as pedestrian, and self-censored,
as This is Your Life (suicide attempts are 'cries for help'), and starts
with a wall chart of the Glitter career and ends with the inevitable
communal choruses. There is one good joke: Leigh looks nothing like Glitter
and so that bewildered, what-am-I-doing-here, stare, which was Gary's
permanent on-stage expression, is doubly effective coming from Leigh.
But the set and costumes are reminiscent of the troughs of Glitter's career
when he played the chicken-in-the-basket circuit - although I'm sure he
never appeared at La Rue's Codpiece, Didcot, as the script suggests. Paul
Putner plays one of Glitter's many managers and Furst everyone from Andrew
Lloyd Webber to Elvis Presley.
The problem is you cannot be more blatant than Glitter. He sends himself up
so high that no satirists can reach him. But once a member of the Gang you
are hooked for life, and there will be enough loyal members happy to honour
the Leader at these meretricious entertainments. After all, there is nothing
wrong with a little affection.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: La traviata - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When La traviata first came to London, Queen Victoria forbade the Court to
attend. A story about a prostitute who dies on stage was thought an improper
subject for the theatre and it cannot have helped that Verdi intended the
opera to be performed in modern dress, bringing its message even closer to
home.
That it what Music Theatre London is about: lifting well-known operas out of
their historical context and throwing them down in the fast lane of the
present-day. The Mozart/Da Ponte operas and Rossini's Cenerentola have been
swept along by their irreverent ebullience; this Traviata is their first try
at a serious opera - a commission from the Covent Garden Festival as part of
its adventurous programme of opera and music theatre.
Violetta's house-party is a yuppies' rave and when Gaston bursts out from a
back room, it is to collect an orange presumably to go with a plastic bag
and some ladies' stockings. Later, Alfredo comes in from doing the weekly
shopping at Sainsbury's, any suburban boyfriend from the home counties.
For a producer updating a stage work this is the easy bit. When it comes to
bringing the characters alive, the producer William Relton does not aim to
score many points, but some of the shots he does try are bull's-eyes: as
Violetta sings her solo scene, she removes her blond wig, peels off her
false eyelashes and wipes clean the prostitute's face to reveal the
untainted woman underneath.
By the last act she is in the terminal stage of some unnamed (unless I
missed it) modern disease. Her end comes not in a grand Parisian apartment,
but in a National Health hospital - every last drop of romance sanitised by
the surroundings. Watching Mary Lincoln's Violetta trying to turn in bed
during her final aria was painful in the right way and a fitting end to a
portrayal that one could always believe in.
The company is lucky to have a Violetta who can sing what Verdi wrote,
whereas one generally wishes that the musical arranger, Tony Britten, would
help out his actors by re-writing more boldly. Tim Godwin sings the English
words as if he has been listening to too many Andrew Lloyd Webber records,
but his young puppy of an Alfredo ('hung like a horse' is his
recommendation) is very touching. David Burt makes heavy weather of Giorgio
Germont. The moral force of this role is more difficult to update.
The cameos include Liza Sadovy as a stylish slut of a Flora and Simon
Butteriss's Gaston, who returns as a gypsy in drag with a talent for reading
palms. He might predict success for this show if some of the bathetic rhymes
in the translation can be sharpened and the string quartet rehearsed more
thoroughly. La traviata is an opera of today and Music Theatre London has
chosen well.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: Holt and Messaien - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a pair of concerts at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Mark Wigglesworth and his
crack Premiere Ensemble have been playing with orchestral arrangements - not
in the transcription sense, but with seating and placing. Their first
concert included Simon Holt's new Minotaur Games, for which the band was
divided into almost exactly matching halves. For the late Olivier Messiaen's
expansive Des Canyons aux etoiles on Monday, it rose in a pyramid five tiers
high, with glittering percussion at the top - but also at port and
starboard, down below.
In Des Canyons . . . the impact of the tiered band was terrific: forceful,
lucid, all the pungent orchestral colours sharply distinct. Messiaen's
inspiration came from an early 1970s visit to the brilliant desert-scapes of
Utah - especially Bryce Canyon, Cedar Breaks and Zion Park, which earned the
three most sumptuous movements here. For their short but ultra-sweet
episodes, the relatively small string-group sang out with ultra-vibrato. As
always the pianist Yvonne Loriod, Messiaen's widow, was scrupulously
faithful and articulate in the main solo role, without 'personal' nuances
and yet with penetrating expression. Richard Bissill's brave, skilful French
horn almost matched her.
Why was I so uninvolved? Des Canyons . . ., an hour and three-quarters long
without any natural interval, was preceded by a London premiere of
more-or-less posthumous Messiaen - a brief tribute to his publisher on his
90th birthday, for piano and string quartet. That does what Canyons did:
recycle familiar Messiaen tropes in a new sequence, with some more
birdcalls.
The recent 'Piece', however, is dense and dramatic for its three or so
minutes. Canyons, despite some incisive writing, stretches out its length
indulgently and interminably. To believe it you need to be a rapt devotee.
It was delightful to read that its 9th movement would feature 'slow and
strong lambs, being contrasted to short and fast lambs in ascending
sequences'; but then curiously dampening to recognise a mere typo for
'iambs' (as in 'iambic pentameter').
Holt's Minoan exercise, the centrepiece of a projected 'triology' (sic),
came with no notes but the composer's brief, clumsy recounting of the
Theseus myth. No clue to how, exactly, his 15-minute Minotaur Games might
latch on to it. The music hinted perhaps at a search, a confrontation, a
headlong flight, and at a deeper level some nameless erotic scenario - there
were eldritch howls and whimpers. But Holt's scoring is so insistently
opaque in the low-middle (viola) register that we lost trace of any harmonic
movement: the thing just sat there, emitting baleful cries, defying us to
guess where it was meant to be going.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: Mixed up breakfast menus - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Question Of The Day' is: what can you find in your garden shed? Other
items on the programme include a test to see what happens when you pour a
bucket of ice cubes into a man's underpants. A Scottish actor, chosen
because of his role in an ITV detective series, is visited 'unexpectedly' in
his home, Cilla Black style, and invited to ride a gently undulating
mechanical bucking bronco. There is an embarrassingly inept attempt at
square dancing. Dancing to a bhangra beat may be a bit better, though it is
impossible to be sure since the item is very brief and the dancers are lost
in a cloud of dry ice. Puppets called Zig and Zag, looking like rejects from
the Muppets, screech so much that it is impossible to hear most of what they
say.
This is The Big Breakfast on Channel 4, the programme which, we are assured,
has been such a ratings success that GMTV, the ITV breakfast show which
notoriously displaced TV-am, has appealed successfully for an easing of its
licence requirements to be able to go further down-market and compete more
effectively. One of the most striking aspects of The Big Breakfast is its
astonishing cheapness. The 'surprise' visit to the actor must have been the
most expensive item on this day since it involved sending out a camera crew.
Virtually everything else was done in the three lock-keepers' cottages which
the company uses as its studio. The 'family of the week' was there, Paula
Yates did her interview-on-the-bed (with, of course, Hugh Grant, star of
Four Weddings And A Funeral) upstairs, and the chap who blow-dried his
chickens was downstairs. The sexy building worker with bare chest, shorts
and a big hod was actually on the stairs.
Another striking fact is the extent to which the appeal of the programme
depends upon other popular television output. Not only is there a regular
'Snap, Cackle And Pop' item promoting forthcoming programmes (commercial
programmes, anyway) there is also a lot of talk about the soaps. Even more
obviously, presenter Mark Little is a young Australian whose sole claim to
the job seems to be his previous experience as a member of the cast of the
Australian soap Neighbours. He certainly does not exhibit any obvious talent
for presentation, though co-presenter Gaby Roslin does. Indeed her charm and
natural flair will surely take her pretty well anywhere else in television
that she wants to go . . . which must surely be almost any other series.
But what strikes you most of all is the childishness of so much of the
material. Even on days when the ultra brief news bulletins do turn up every
half hour or so (on this day there is some technical hitch at the cottages
and most of them are dropped) the overwhelming feeling is of a programme
pitched at about the level of Noddy In Toyland. The studio colours -
brilliant yellow, bright red, vivid mauve, lurid orange - are straight out
of Noddy, the animated cartoons appeal to Noddy's public, as do Zig and Zag,
and it is surely no coincidence that the outside reporter is the former
children's presenter Keith Chegwin. The commercial breaks reinforce the
impression: much of the advertising is clearly intended for young children.
So it seems that The Big Breakfast is aiming at an audience with a median
age of about seven. But what on earth is GMTV up to? Its presenters, Eamonn
Holmes and Penny Smith, look just like the sofa couples who come on later in
the morning, apparently intending to appeal to women at home. To this extent
GMTV is the last breakfast show still relying on the formula originally used
by the BBC and TV-am when the whole thing began in spring 1983 and Frank
Bough and Selina Scott sprawled on the sofa in their sweaters being ever so
cosy.
But who does GMTV think it is appealing to? The phone poll asking 'Do you
want a referendum on the EC?' (90 per cent said yes) is obviously of
widespread interest, but what about the long item on popcorn sales in
American cinemas? Or the weirdly contrived report asking 'What is it that
American men find so fascinating about Scottish women'? Once again there is
much exploitation of soap operas, but that sits oddly with the items on
cricket ball tampering and a new off-the-wall Irish magazine called 'DV8' (a
name already used by a well known modern ballet troupe). Perhaps the idea is
to have something for everyone, but the trouble is that it looks unlikely to
satisfy anyone.
The BBC on the other hand seems to have achieved, in this area at least,
what it boasted it would do throughout television: it has taken the
'Himalayan option', climbing back to the commanding heights and establishing
itself as the provider of high quality. Whether FT readers really want to
watch television at 6.00 in the morning I do not know, but Business
Breakfast between 6.00 and 7.00 am can be remarkably lively. On the day in
question it offered - in addition to routine reports on the Footsie, Nikkei
and so on - items on the success of the price cutters in UK food retailing,
the revival of US car manufacturing, the modernisation of Scotch whisky's
image (can you imagine Scotch and lemonade?) and the academic/commercial
schism within the Internet computer network.
A similar approach, exploiting the BBC's tremendous resources in
international news, continues in Breakfast News between 7.00 and 9.05 am.
True, on the day in question the overkill in covering Nelson Mandela's
forthcoming inauguration was embarrassing, and the tone of religious
solemnity in which it was discussed absurd. But the reports on
Nagorno-Karabakh, Hizbollah, and opposition to the use of Lake Windermere by
motor boats were excellent. Moreover they were - as always on this programme
now - introduced by Nicholas Witchell and Sally Magnusson from behind news
readers' desks, as they would be on the Nine O'Clock News or Newsnight, and
not from a sofa.
Watching television at breakfast time still feels depraved to me, and almost
any newspaper or radio programme seems preferable at that time of day. For
those who do want television with their toast, however, there is now,
undeniably, a range of sharply - even wildly - contrasting programmes.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: Booth's 'Wonderlawn' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclay's New Stages festival - concerned with the innovative and, we hope,
the valuable in theatre and (some) dance - is in its fourth year and at the
Royal Court. Several cheers for the enterprise; rather fewer, sad to say,
for the major dance offering: Laurie Booth and Company in a commissioned
piece.
I saw Booth's Wonderlawn on Monday night. I have much admired his solo and
duet work (notably in his partnership with Russell Maliphant) for its
extraordinary variety of energy - Booth like a calligrapher, brush heavy
with ink, making sweeps and flows of dynamics, suddenly twisting the
ideogram with a flick of the hand, leaving a bold shape on the retina. His
stage persona is often that of guru or of a traveller in quest of spiritual
experience. Serenity sought and found is an abiding impression in his best
dances.
As a creator his most potent work is made for himself, or in tandem with one
disciple-colleague, their bond the subtleties of contact improvisation,
where every move awakens a spontaneous sequence of activity. His larger
creations that I have seen look diffuse. So with Wonderlawn.
Three dancers - Ellen van Schuylenburch, John Kilroy, James de Maria - join
Booth. Two parts, each just over 30 minutes long. An emollient score by
Gavin Bryars for a chamber ensemble, making amiable wall-papery patterns.
Elaborate design by Duncan MacAskill. And it is all too much. Focus,
precision, even purpose, seem clogged by the rich trappings of
collaboration. Booth has, in the past, shown us the beauty of austerity: he
is better with a begging bowl than a bank account. What I saw in the first
part was dance well done (Booth produced tremendous spirals of energy) but
fatally bland. There was a whiff of the orient about it all - T'ai Chi;
martial arts, Indian dance - yet it looked more Brummagem than Benares, as
if the cast were auditioning for a revival of The King and I.
The second, and better, section found the dancers clambering on a vast metal
web which was wired for sound so that each move produced a tingling
resonance (very welcome to ears sated with Bryars' maunderings). The web
flew up, Bryars and his ensemble (dressed, oddly, as druids) were revealed,
and for a time Booth's skill gave the dance a bright immediacy. But at
curtain fall - too long delayed - I felt somehow cheated. Booth can be more
powerful, more illuminating than this.

<TEXT>
You have to hand it to television drama departments: though they know
viewers would rather be entertained, they stick doggedly to serious social
issues. Today's 'Screen Two' is Sin Bin in which Pete Postlethwaite plays a
nurse in a mental hospital who sees a colleague batter one of the patients
to death. Should he blow the whistle or turn a blind eye? (9.00 BBC2). It
will be surprising if the audience for that is anything like as big as the
audience for Three Men And A Baby on ITV, even though the 1987 movie has
been shown on television before. Ted Danson, Steve Guttenberg, and Tom
Selleck star as three bachelors who prove to be incompetent when they are
landed with a baby girl to look after (8.00). Inside Story looks at the real
life 'manageress' of the football world: Karren Brady, managing director of
Birmingham City FC. We are assured that she was appointed not because club
owner David Sullivan, who made a fortune from girlie magazines, thought it a
good gimmick to choose a photogenic 23-year-old blonde, but because she was
the right person for the job (9.40 BBC1).

Telephone companies have long trumpeted the virtues of communication.
Persuading people to dial more numbers helps to boost revenues. Now,
however, they are starting to latch on to the environmental arguments for
increased phone use.
At a conference held by the Royal Society of Arts, senior managers in the
industry agreed on a number of actions, including the more aggressive
promotion of videoconferencing and telecommuting as a means to cut down on
environmentally damaging business travel.
Delegates resolved to build on the industry's 'clean' image to contribute
more to the debate on sustainable development. Their first action will be to
issue a joint global environmental policy statement.
'The telecommunications sector is going to be critical in achieving
(environmental) sustainability,' says Braden Allenby, a research
vice-president at AT&amp;T in the US. 'It is the ethical responsibility of our
industry to address these issues.'
The new emphasis could have profound implications for the transport and
travel industries.
Although telecommunications is not perceived as a leading polluter,
manufacturers also announced their intention to improve the environmental
qualities of their products.
'Those companies which address environmental criteria at the design stage
are likely to be the ones that emerge with a competitive edge,' says Colin
Hicks, head of environment and energy technologies at Britain's Department
of Trade and Industry. British Telecommunications has given informal
indications that it may take the lead in producing a flagship 'green'
telephone product.
The RSA conference was intended as the first in a series of environmental
design workshops covering 'eco-design' in various industries; future
seminars may cover white goods, office products, transport and building
design.
Telecommunications is not, perhaps, the most obvious sector to pick for a
first outing. People buy comparatively few phones, which are, in any case,
small objects. In use, the equipment accounts for a scant 1.2 per cent of
the UK's energy consumption, according to figures from BT.
In 1992, BT collected 2.9m telephones under its recycling scheme, but
complete disassembly and recycling of these products is not yet possible.
Products designed to be taken apart and made of materials that could be
recycled more efficiently than the present hard-moulded plastic could
streamline the process, possibly transforming what is currently a cost into
a modest profit, according to David Mercer of the BT design unit. In
addition, telephones that work, but which users have reported as broken -
known in the trade as 'fault-not-found' - currently find their way into this
recycling stream rather than being rescued for resale and re-use.
The fast growth of this sector is another reason for considering its
environmental impact now. The volume of electronic data communication is
forecast by BT to multiply a thousand-fold in the first half of the next
century, although advances in technology should ensure that its
environmental effect does not increase commensurately.
Telephones and related products are well suited for snap-together plastic
components that assist disassembly. Moulded eco-labels, like those widely
used in packaging, could also be incorporated at the design stage, although
it is not currently possible to eliminate all toxic materials and processes
such as the use of solders and solvents.
Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications monopoly, is exploring the
possibility of a questionnaire that will require its suppliers to state  -
and prove - the environmental impact of their parts and materials.
In order to work at the pace required in day-to-day business, the
questionnaire would invite respondents to fill in simple 'figures of merit'
on a check-list of materials and procedures.
These figures would be weighted according to the amount of material or
processing and then added, with scores for more general questions about a
supplier's environmental policies, to arrive at a total figure.
Such a procedure is more flexible than relying on standards which, because
of both rapid advances in communications technology and changing views about
relative environmental merits of particular materials, are often out of date
by the time they are published.
The scorecard approach also means that designers are able to spend less time
attempting the confusing task of weighing the relative environmental merits
of materials and components that they might use.
The method could be taken a stage further, believes AT&amp;T's Allenby. Rather
than attempting to turn every designer into an environment specialist, it
would be possible to incorporate the data on materials into computer-aided
design software so the most appropriate choice is made automatically for the
task in hand.
The evolution of such design methods means that giving greater consideration
to the environment need not be an added cost. Such scrutiny of design,
manufacture and reclamation processes can actually lead to unexpected
savings, as Dutch companies found out through a year-long environmental
manufacturing project.
Hans van Weenen of the UN Environment Programme's Workshop for Sustainable
Product Development in Amsterdam, said they made savings in both materials
and energy costs of between 30 and 50 per cent across a wide range of
product manufacturing, including office chairs, coffee-makers and car
dashboards.
But perhaps the greatest potential for telecommunications companies lies in
exploiting the relative environmental benefit of their services. The energy
used in flying to New York and back is equivalent to five weeks on the
telephone, according to Graham Davies, BT's head of corporate research. (He
omitted to say, however, that such a call would cost around Pounds 20,000,
enough to fund a fairly stylish trip.)
More telecommuting would bring cuts in transport use. There would also be a
potential knock-on effect as telecommuters rediscovered the joys of more
local amenities, feels Stephen Potter of the Open University's technology
faculty, thus cutting the length of many other journeys as well as reducing
the number of trips to the office.

Thousands of tonnes of industrial waste that would otherwise have been
dumped is being recycled, thanks to a small UK company, Waste Exchange
Services, based in Stockton-on-Tees. James Donaldson, head of WES, brings
together waste-producers and companies that can use the waste. He expects to
have arranged uses for 30,000 tonnes a year soon, saving industry an
estimated Pounds 500,000. His clients include BP, National Power and ICI.
Donaldson says waste is only valuable if someone within a reasonable
distance can use it, and the deal helps the waste provider and the user. He
has built up a database of 1,500 companies offering or able to use waste and
publishes a catalogue listing materials wanted or on offer. He is also
raising money from outside investors to develop new processes.
One of his most innovative projects is the world's first plant for recycling
the silica gel used to keep electronic equipment dry. He also sent 50 tonnes
of stainless steel rings discarded by an oil refinery to a chemical company
that was upgrading its process towers. Ammonium fluoride intended, but not
suitable, for the electronics industry went to a metals company. A textile
factory is producing sulphate of ammonia fertiliser from the absorption of
its ammonia emissions in sulphuric acid. Chemical waste is used to make
cement. Previously unwanted lead oxide dust from British Steel goes to a
lead recycler. Selenium from old photocopier drums goes into metal alloys.
Donaldson used to be a chemical engineer for Davy McKee. He set up his own
company when ICI asked him to design a recycling plant. The ICI contract
gave him the cash to get going. He now charges 25 per cent of first-year
savings from his exchange deals, and hopes turnover will exceed Pounds
100,000 this year.

Jean-Baptiste Tefra is replacing Martin Mays-Smith as chairman of Empire
Stores, the UK's fifth-largest mail order company.
Tefra, 47, became chief executive of the catalogue operations of Empire's
French parent La Redoute last year. He was previously managing director of
Empire, until Michael Hawker, managing director of Sears' mail order
subsidiary Freemans, was recruited earlier this year.
Hawker had been filling the role as a part-time consultant, but took over as
full-time chief executive last week, at the same time as Tefra took over the
chairmanship.
Mays-Smith is stepping down to pursue his other business interests, which
include chairmanships of the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society and
First National Bank. He says that with Michael Hawker's appointment, it was
'clearly more appropriate' for Empire to have a chairman from Redoute.
Tefra graduated from the Ecole Centrale de Paris. He joined La Redoute in
1969, moved to a computer leasing company, CFCE, in 1971, and then to French
retailer FNAC, before returning to La Redoute in 1984. He became md of
Empire in October 1991.

<TEXT>
Michael Miles, 58, an executive deputy chairman of Barings, has been
appointed a non-executive director of BP. His appointment to the board of
Britain's biggest oil company continues its longstanding boardroom ties with
Britain's oldest merchant bank.
Miles, who remains an executive director of the family-owned John Swire &amp;
Sons, one of the biggest Far Eastern trading houses, is the first
non-executive director to be appointed to the BP board since it adopted the
Cadbury committee's recommendations on corporate governance.
BP played down the Barings' connection yesterday, describing Miles'
membership of both companies' boards as a coincidence. The company had used
headhunters to find its new director and said that Miles had been chosen
from a list of four candidates all of whom had 'strong Far East business
experience'.
Miles joined Barings as a non-executive director in 1989, just as Lord
Ashburton, the current BP chairman, was retiring after 15 years as chairman
of Barings. Lord Ashburton, formerly known as Sir John Baring, resigned as a
non-executive director of the merchant banking group in March but remains
chairman of The Baring Foundation, a charity which owns the non-voting
equity capital of Barings.
Lord Ashburton, 65, is the longest serving director on the BP board and took
over the chairmanship in June 1992 following the ousting of Bob Horton.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Busines and the Environment: Survival in scrap metal suburb
/ A look at Hanoi's complex recycling network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite its low level of economic development, the Vietnamese capital Hanoi
has a sophisticated network for waste re-use and recycling. From individual
rubbish collectors to large industrial plants, more than one third of the
hundreds of tonnes of waste produced in Hanoi every day is re-cycled.
In more prosperous western countries, recycled paper and glass products are
popular and fashionable. In poorer countries like Vietnam, where thousands
of people make their living by collecting and selling paper, plastic, glass
and metal, recycling is a necessity and a part of daily life.
At a junk yard on the outskirts of Hanoi, workers dismantle old trucks and
sort through heaps of scrap metal. Different grades are sold on to be melted
down and re-used as pipes and reinforcement bars.
The scrap metal trade is at the more lucrative end of Vietnam's recycling
industry. Throughout the country, people collect discarded metal objects and
bring them to places like the suburb of O Cho Dua to sell to the dealers'
yards.
Collecting scrap metal is a risky business in a country devastated by 20
years of war. In a village outside Hanoi, a pair of bomb casings has been
turned into gateposts, but every year dozens of people are injured and a few
killed when they try to move unexploded bombs for sale as scrap metal.
In O Cho Dua, the recycled scrap is turned into building materials. Old
reinforcement bars are beaten back into shape and newly-delivered tubes made
from recycled waste are welded together, covered in plastic, assembled and
sold as shelving in the city's roadside furniture shops.
Along the streets of the capital, there is a well-organised system for
collecting rubbish. Dozens of small, three-wheeled carts do their rounds
throughout the day, clearing up waste. When the carts are full, they are
emptied into large piles where scavengers pick out anything with a resale
value.
Elsewhere in Hanoi, old women go from door to door buying old bottles, jars,
plastic and paper for a few cents. When one of them has a full load, they
head for one of the hundreds of junk shops.
These traders are the next link in the recycling chain. They buy piles of
cardboard, baskets of bottles or bags full of scrap metal, which they keep
until they have enough to sell on to a bigger dealer or factory. All this
waste will then be either sold for re-use or melted down and turned into
something new.
As well as the scrap metal suburb, there are other areas around Hanoi that
specialise in waste recycling. One is known as 'plastic village' because
almost all of its inhabitants make their living from collecting and selling
plastic waste.
Outside one house is a foul heap of rotting plastic. The owner of the house
says he makes good money by storing old plastic and then selling it on to a
recycling plant. One of these small factories will make the plastic into
soles for plastic sandals or melt it down to produce roofing sheets for the
city's booming construction industry.
Some of the better quality waste is simply sold for re-use. Plastic bottles
and glass jars are sold for a couple of cents for domestic use or are taken
back to the factory and refilled. There is even some cross-border recycling.
Empty bottles of Chinese beer are collected and taken north across the
border to be refilled.
Through a combination of poverty and enterprise, not much goes to waste in
Hanoi and instead of being burned or dumped at an expensive land-fill site,
much of the city's rubbish is put back to work.

FT  18 MAY 94 / People: Hong Kong billionaire joins Standard Chartered's
board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the international banking group recovering after several
years in the doldrums, has appointed Ronnie Chan, 43, one of Hong Kong's
wealthiest property developers, as a non-executive director.
Chan, a US citizen who lives in Hong Kong, is the first of two new
non-executives who are being recruited from a part of the world which
produces the bulk of the group's profits. Patrick Gillam, who took over as
chairman a year ago, is keen to reshape his UK-orientated board and make it
more representative of a region which should provide the group with its
greatest growth over the next few years.
Apart from recruiting another director from the Asia Pacific, the group
plans to hold two board meetings in the region every year. Chan's
appointment helps fill a gap on the board left by the recent retirement of
several non-executive directors: Robin Baillie, Bill Brown, John Craig and
Geoffrey Williams.
Chan, a US citizen who has an MBA from the University of Southern
California, is well known to Standard Chartered. He is chairman of the Hang
Lung Development Company, the quoted parent of a group of property related
businesses which include Amoy Properties and Grand Hotel Holdings. Standard
Chartered sold its Hong Kong headquarters to part of Chan's property empire
in 1992.
Forbes magazine has estimated that he is worth over Dollars 1bn. In addition
to his interests in several publicly quoted companies, he has substantial
private business interests, which include the Morningside Group and
Springfield &amp; Company. The latter is involved in financial trading and has
offices in New York, Boston, Chicago, Hong Kong, Beijing and Taipei.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Jobs: Managing creativity takes talent - Time to meet the
challenge of working with thinkers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What sort of workforce do we want? It is a question attracting increasing
attention from managers and recruiters, particularly those whose business
and products are in a constant state of development. Demand is growing for
the thinking employee, yet too many companies seem wedded to management
principles ill-suited to invention.
Fears have been raised recently that some of the latest performance
monitoring programmes are suppressing rather than cultivating creativity
among innovative staff.
A report from The British Psychological Society in March criticised the
application of such practices among creative people. The report was gloomy
enough for employers concerned to encourage self-improvement among their
workforces; if anything it may have understated the extent to which
managements may need to address the problem.
Philip Sadler, a management consultant and vice president of Ashridge
Management College, believes that innovation is often stifled by outmoded
management thinking that should have been thrown out with Bakelite
telephones.
He believes the time could be ripe for many companies to dump their
allegiance to two old theories which form the bedrock of management
practices that persist today. The first is Taylorism, the scientific
management principles of Fredrick W. Taylor, who argued that workers were
less efficient if they exercised such traits as discretion, initiative or
spontaneity.
Taylor held that all work could be analysed and that the best way of
performing a job could be organised scientifically. Because managers were
more intelligent and better educated, he argued, they were in the best
position to decide how work should be done.
His theories are more associated with repetitive production line work, much
of which has been overtaken by technology, but Sadler believes that
Taylorism is 'alive and well' among top management who are attempting to
define competencies required for the successful performance of jobs.
The second theory that Sadler criticises is that of Max Weber, the German
sociologist. His Theory of Social and Economic Organisation, published in
1924, outlined a bureaucratic approach to office work and administration,
stressing qualities such as precision, order, hierarchy and authority.
Sadler says that while such practices may traditionally have been associated
with government departments and public-sector bodies, they also thrived and
continue to flourish in the private sector.
In last month's Personnel Management magazine, Sadler wrote: 'Bureaucracy
stifles talent, particularly creativity, and its strong emphasis on
authority, seniority and the proper channels means that new ideas find
difficulty in acceptance and that risk avoidance is more highly valued than
innovation.'
Neither theory seems acceptable for organisations that have changed from
mass production with large workforces to demanding continual changes and
constantly improving processes and products from smaller creative working
groups.
Sadler asks whether managements are meeting the new corporate demands. One
which has developed practices to stimulate talent, he says, is Merck, the US
pharmaceuticals company, which has been voted by a jury of more than 8,000
executives the most admired company in the US for the past six years.
Merck values scientific excellence as much as managerial competence. Among
its motivational programmes for scientists is an award scheme to bring them
recognition among their peers and stock options spread over stages of
research and development which only become exercisable when the product has
been launched successfully on the market.
Sadler believes that too few companies are prepared to develop their
creative people who, if deprived of management training at an early stage,
can become hostile to management. 'They often regard managers as thick and
stupid,' he said.
Sadler likes to draw a sporting analogy when discussing the management of
talented people. The characteristics of talent management, he suggest, are
nowhere more simply defined than in Association Football and the possession
of talent by itself is not enough to guarantee high achievement.
This has been demonstrated by a string of skilful soccer players over the
years who rarely achieved more than a brief appearance in the England side.
Players like Frank Worthington and Stan Bowles could dazzle the opposition,
but they lacked the overall vision that marked out great players. Franz
Beckenbauer, Johan Cruyff and Jack Charlton not only performed consistently
on the pitch but continued into successful managerial careers.
Football clubs place values on their teams, but balance-sheet valuations for
people have not been extended into industry. If they were, managers might
begin to appreciate their assets more.
The successful formula for managing what Sadler calls 'gold-collar workers'
is simple: attract the best people, keep them, develop them, motivate them
and manage their performance. Putting this into practice is less easy and
challenges traditional management thinking. Those who do may find it pays
dividends.
Philip Sadler's book on the subject, Managing Talent, is published by F. T.
Pitman.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Management: Antibiotics offer new cancer hope - Drugs can
kill a germ which may cause serious stomach problems / Health check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is barely two decades since drugs like cimetidine revolutionised ulcer
treatment, sparing many patients the knife. Now it has been discovered that
a simple course of antibiotics may cure ulcers and even certain forms of
stomach cancer.
The BBC's Horizon programme on Monday night told the story of the
appropriately named Stephen Hope. He is one of several people with lymphoma
of the stomach who have been treated successfully not by surgery or
radiotherapy but by antibiotics against the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.
H. pylori was discovered about 100 years ago but misunderstood until
recently. It was almost an accident that, while looking for a suitable
research topic, young gastro-enterologist Barry Marshall became interested
in H. pylori in 1983. Among other things, he tried giving himself the germ
and eradicating it in his patients. Both were a great success, even if his
efforts met with little acclaim at first.
H. pylori is highly resistant to stomach acid, which kills most known germs.
It moves in corkscrew fashion, penetrating deep into the stomach lining. In
the last ten years, research has increasingly implicated it in gastritis,
gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of
the stomach.
Around 95 per cent of patients with duodenal ulcers and 80 per cent of those
with gastric ulcers are thought to carry H. pylori. According to a study
just published in the British Heart Journal, there is also evidence that the
bacterium is associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,
though a causal relationship is unproven.
H. pylori is often acquired in childhood, especially among poorer
households, where it may spread from person to person. Infection with H.
pylori increases with age - at 50, around 50 per cent of us are infected; at
70, around 70 per cent.
Eradicating the bacterium can now be done fairly simply. A fortnight's
treatment with two drugs (the antibiotic amoxycillin and the anti-ulcer drug
omeprazole) does the trick in around three-quarters of patients infested
with H. pylori.
This regime is easier than its predecessor, triple therapy, which involved
more tablets, had more than a 20 per cent incidence of side-effects, and
precluded alcohol for the duration of the treatment.
It is now possible to test for H. pylori (one such test costs about Pounds
26 per person). But many gastro-enterologists believe that all patients
proved to have a duodenal ulcer should be offered eradication therapy,
whether or not they carry H. pylori.
Studies point out that patients treated in this way feel better and relapse
less often than those given conventional anti-ulcer treatment, and the
treatment may cost less in the long run. A report from general practitioners
in Suffolk suggested recently that annual savings of at least Pounds 120 per
patient could be achieved.
Some authorities would also agree that eradicating H. pylori is good
treatment for gastric ulcers, and the last year has seen increasing evidence
that it can work wonders for gastric lymphoma.
But this type of tumour accounts for only 5 per cent of all stomach
malignancies. So what hope is there for most stomach cancer sufferers? H.
pylori is thought to multiply the risk of stomach cancer by six, but is only
one of several factors - diet and blood group are also important. One
hypothesis is that a chain of sugars found only in type A blood may help H.
pylori attach itself to the stomach lining.
It is not yet known whether eradicating H. pylori affects gastric cancer (as
opposed to lymphoma). Nor is it clear how much it can offer those with
gastritis - specialists are now trying it, though many believe it will
confer few benefits.
A wider question is that since H. pylori can be tested for, might it be
worth treating those who carry it but do not have symptoms, in the hope of
preventing serious disease later?
At the moment, the answer is no. One problem is that the incidence of
infection with H. pylori is very much higher than the incidence of diseases
it is associated with. Until it is known precisely how the bacterium causes
harm, it would be fruitless to treat aIl carriers.
Prevention of stomach malignancies may therefore be around the corner. From
where we are now, however, that corner seems to be some way down the road.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Management: Batting tips for a long innings - Business can
learn from West Indian cricket's commitment, selection policy and
self-belief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLA NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Lara's world record-breaking cricket innings last month took the
sporting world by storm. But the Trinidadian's batting score of 375 runs in
the final test match against England in the West Indies displayed an
excellence which is also salutary for business.
Lara's innings, like many played by West Indians over the years, had much to
do with good people management and the creation of the right market
conditions.
Firstly, cricket in the West Indies follows a golden rule pursued by most
successful businesses: managers must believe in their employees. The
businesses which excel in the long term select the best available talent,
and then give them every opportunity to succeed.
In West Indian cricket, the talented players know that even if they have a
series of low-scoring innings, the management will continue to select them.
This faith is an important part of their motivation, and contrasts with the
selection and deselection that occurs in English cricket: That is no way to
manage people.
West Indian cricket also shows the significance of top management's
commitment to the product. Its managers - many of whom were themselves
sporting legends - know only too well how important cricketing success is
for a region which has had few other things to boast about. Because of this,
they take the job of maintaining and improving the performance of the team
very seriously.
West Indian cricket also illustrates the need to have a market willing to
consume the business's product. Without a customer base, businesses soon
wither and die. In the West Indies, cricket will never die, since West
Indians consume all they can of the game. If only all businesses could have
such loyal consumers.
One final ingredient of business success illustrated by West Indian cricket
is luck. This is that curious element of competitive advantage often
mysteriously conferred on some businesses, but not on others. Consider, for
example, how lucky West Indian cricket is to have a climate which allows the
game to be played and practised all year round. Luck can be a little bit of
help from nature which many other cricket teams do not have.
More than all this perhaps, with a string of world record holders and world
class talent stretching back many years, West Indian cricket also carries a
legacy of success.
In business, as in cricket, a legacy of success is one of the key
ingredients for continued success.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Management: Portuguese are Champs of 1994 - A business
student competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any consumer goods company whose branded product had a 40 per cent share of
the European market would probably refuse to manufacture a private label
version for one of its smaller national territories. The risks would be too
high, the potential rewards too meagre.
Yet a remarkably well-argued case for a big French pizza-maker to do
precisely that has helped a team of four Portuguese students win Champ 94 -
Challenge in Management Perspectives - a business undergraduate competition
which attracted entries from 400 teams in 23 countries across Europe.
Designed to test analytical, interpersonal and presentational skills, Champ
94 was one of the largest pan-European team events of its kind. It was
sponsored by Unilever, with support from the London Business School, the
European Commission and the Financial Times.
After qualifying heats last month in Budapest, Hamburg, Milan, Paris,
Rotterdam and Warsaw, the two-day final was held last weekend at the LBS,
whose MBA students organised the competition in conjunction with two
international student associations, AEGEE and AIESEC.
The Portuguese victory, against teams from Germany, Hungary, Poland,
Scotland and Switzerland, was greeted with whoops of joy worthy of a south
European soccer match. Apart from one tied result, the team of 22-year-olds
from the Catholic University in Lisbon won every phase of the final session.
Last year, when Champ was started by two LBS students, 232 teams took part.
That event was won by a team from the Stockholm School of Economics.
This year's final consisted of two days of case study analysis and debate,
and an interactive computerised management game in which students had to
make a series of high-pressure decisions over a company's purchasing,
production and inventory. Appropriately for young people about to enter the
real world of business, the marking is weighted towards teamwork.
Although it did not form part of the judges' official assessment, the
students' fluency in business English was remarkable. Only two of this
year's 24 finalists were native English speakers, and almost all are still
in their early 20s. Yet their language skills were demonstrated not only in
formal presentation but also in cut-and-thrust debate.
The winning team shares a Ecu 2,000 (Pounds 1,540) purse and receives
individual eight-week work experience scholarships with Unilever outside
their home country.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Electricity productivity 'not improved' since sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation did not significantly improve the productivity growth of most
electricity companies in England and Wales, the Centre for Study of
Regulated Industries said yesterday.
The centre's claims conflict with the industry which says efficiency
improvements are one of the main benefits of privatisation four years ago.
They come ahead of a review by the industry regulator into the distribution
businesses.  This will set price controls after taking into account issues
including the companies' ability to cut costs in the future.
The regulatory regime set up at privatisation was probably too lenient and
did not offer sufficient incentives to improve efficiency, the centre says.
 Since privatisation all companies have been allowed to lift distribution
prices in line with inflation and many be more.  The authors suggest the
review by Offer should result in price rises being limited to inflation
minus 2.5 percentage points.
The centre, a research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy, says the rate of productivity growth between 1991 and 1993 was
3.1 per cent on average, against 2.8 per cent for 1971 to 1990.
However, the centre says the 'slight' improvement is not statistically
significant and most of it would have happened even had privatisation not
taken place.
The centre says only three companies, Manweb, South Wales and Eastern,
significantly improved their performance after privatisation.  The gap
between the most efficient and least efficient companies has widened, it
says.
The report says the failure to significantly improve performance is
explained in part because the companies were privatised during a recession.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Subsidies on mobiles rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, ruled yesterday that
mobile phone operators were 'un-fairly' cross-subsidising service providers
owned by them.
He said he would oblige the operators to pay a reasonable return to service
providers for connecting mobile phone users, in a ruling likely to favour
the remaining independent service providers. There are about 20 service
providers.
The ruling follows complaints by service providers not owned by one of the
four cellular network operators - Vodafone, Cellnet, Mercury One-2-One and
Orange - that the low margins paid to them were making their business
uneconomic.
Nearly half the network subscribers of Vodafone and Cellnet are connected
via providers partly or wholly owned by them. Mr Cruickshank said he was
'determined this market should operate in a completely fair and open
manner'.
The complaints were launched in 1992 by Talkland, then an independent
provider. Vodafone, the largest network operator has since bought a
one-third stake in the company.
Mr Charles Wigoder, managing director of the independent Peoples Phone,
said: 'This is good news for the independent service providers, but it does
not change the fact that the economies of scale in the industry casts doubt
on the future of the smaller independents.'
Practice throughout the industry is to subsidise the acquisition of
subscribers. Mr Cruickshank ruled that 'mature' service providers should
make a reasonable return on this investment.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Professor faces more expenses allegations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh allegations about expenses on overseas trips were made yesterday
against the former chief executive of Health Promotion Wales, a government
quango.
The allegations emerged as police said a file was being sent to the Crown
Prosecution Service following an investigation into expenses claims by
Professor John Catford.
Lawyers for Health Promotion Wales have been asked to recover more than
Pounds 3,000 from Prof Catford, who resigned in February after admitting a
brief affair with a woman colleague in Brazil.
An investigation by the district auditor has now pinpointed four other trips
in which Prof Catford apparently received for work fees that he did not pass
on to his employers.
Details of the report were made public by Mr John Davies, chairman of Health
Promotion Wales, who said visits to Belfast, Denmark, Poland and Germany
between 1991 and 1993 were involved.
'We shall be taking the appropriate steps to recover these monies,' he
added.
Prof Catford, now working abroad, has strenuously denied any misuse of
public funds while chief executive.
Police confirmed a file was being sent to the CPS following an investigation
by fraud squad detectives.

FT  18 MAY 94 / July likely for audit change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation exempting small companies from an annual audit will not be in
force before the end of July, the Department of Trade and Industry said
yesterday.
The legislation moved ahead with the release of the text of the draft
statutory instrument. It said the exemption would apply immediately to any
eligible companies which had not yet filed accounts. This could allow those
with financial year-ends as early as last November to take immediate
advantage of the relaxation.
The amendments, announced in November's Budget, will exempt companies with
turnover less than Pounds 350,000 a year and a balance sheet total of up to
Pounds 1.4m.
Companies with turnover above Pounds 90,000 will be required to include a
'compilation report' with less rigorous demands.
The exemption will not apply to public companies, banking or insurance
companies, those authorised under the 1986 Financial Services Act or a
parent company or subsidiary.
The compilation report must be by members of one of five recognised bodies -
the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and Ireland, the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants and the Association of
Authorised Public Accountants.

Expenditure on acquisitions fell from Pounds 2.8bn in the final quarter of
last year to Pounds 2.7bn in the first three months of 1994, according to
the Central Statistical Office, Andrew Jack writes.
The number of UK acquisitions by industrial and commercial companies rose
from 164 to 176. In the first quarter of last year, there were 103
acquisitions with a value of Pounds 1.6bn.
Expenditure on acquiring independent companies was Pounds 2.3bn compared
with Pounds 900m in the previous quarter.
Cash expenditure on acquisitions accounted for 46 per cent of the total,
down 87 per cent, with the remainder coming from issues of ordinary shares.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Power watchdog looks to speedy shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, yesterday
indicated a strong preference for speeding liberalisation of the power
market but said it would not be possible to give domestic customers the
ability to choose a supplier before 1998.
Speaking on publication of the annual report of Offer, the regulation
authority he heads, Prof Littlechild and his officials said they would take
steps to ensure there were fewer leaks from confidential memoranda sent to
power companies about a review of distribution prices.
Prof Littlechild said it was regrettable that details of a letter he sent
last month to electricity companies about the distribution review had leaked
into the market.
Offer would try to limit leaks by making clear who in the companies should
have copies of letters and access to information in them.
Prof Littlechild said he hoped to conclude the distribution review around
the end of July.
On market liberalisation possibilities, Prof Littlechild has already asked
the 14 power distribution companies for their views of allowing more
consumers the right of choice in 1996.
Only about 50,000 industrial and commercial companies which use more than
100kw of electricity - the so called 'non-franchise' customers - are now
able to choose. Government plans issued at privatisation four years ago were
that the choice should be extended to other consumers only in 1998.
Prof Littlechild said that there would be advantages in opening up the
franchise earlier. It would, however, not be possible to allow domestic
customers choice without compromising contracts made between power companies
on electricity generated from coal.
This suggests that the 100kw limit may be reduced to 70kw or 80kw, drawing
in more industrial and commercial consumers, although he would not be drawn
on a figure.
The speeding of liberalisation measures has been prompted by changes in the
gas market due in 1996 which will allow household consumers a choice in gas
suppliers.
Gas companies say power groups, which also sell gas, would have an unfair
advantage unless similar measures were introduced in the electricity market.
The power companies argue that they have bought coal-fired electricity on
five-year contracts in the belief that they had guaranteed markets for users
above 100kw in their distribution areas.
Mr Ian Byatt was yesterday re-appointed director-general of water services
in England and Wales for a further two years.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Insurers gloomy about prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Encouraging customers to look ahead and consider the ills that could befall
them is a classic pitch for selling life insurance. The life industry itself
might be forgiven for being in sombre mood as it contemplates what lies
ahead.
Certainly some in the industry believe that the fall in new life and
pensions business revealed in the statistics from the Association of British
Insurers for the first three months of this year represents more than a
passing cloud.
The combination of tougher regulatory requirements and intensifying
competition looks like having an enduring and damping impact on the amount
of new business written in the months to come. The reluctance of some
leading companies to be drawn on the figures tells its own story.
Regulation seems to have acted as a depressant on new business in more than
one way.
On pensions business, the association highlighted the effect on
single-premium pension business of the uncertainty created by the
regulators' review of pension transfers launched in December after a pilot
study caused widespread concern about standards of selling.
That uncertainty has affected not only customers but also life insurers:
some of them are still not writing any pension transfer business and others
are being more cautious.
More generally, Mr Steve Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, is
among those to have highlighted the effort that needs to be put into meeting
new standards in training and the sales process as a diversion from current
selling.
Others suggest that the concentration on dealing with new regulatory
requirements may have detracted from designing new products to meet new
customer needs.
As Mr Tom King, general manager in charge of marketing at Standard Life, put
it: 'Product development has perhaps not kept pace with the changing
market.'
Association figures suggest that life companies have also been affected by
other forms of savings such as personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt
special savings accounts (Tessas). The success of some National Savings
products, already identified as contributing to successive monthly outflows
from building societies' retail deposits, may be another factor.
One company commented: 'Investment performance hasn't been that great, so
perhaps customers did not think it worth the risk to go for life products
rather than National Savings.'

FT  18 MAY 94 / Investment trusts savings schemes jump 41%

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savings through investment trusts savings schemes jumped 41 per cent in the
first quarter of this year to Pounds 67.9m, compared with Pounds 48.1m in
the first quarter of 1993, Gillian O'Connor writes. In the financial year
1993-94 as a whole they rose 91 per cent to Pounds 259.4m. This was in
addition to the Pounds 293.7m invested through personal equity plans in
1993-94.
The rise in purchases of investment trusts by private investors mirrors
recent strong growth in sales of unit trusts, another popular way into the
stockmarket. Net unit trust sales rose 40 per cent to Pounds 2,531m in the
first quarter of 1994, with Peps accounting for the majority of retail
sales.
New issues of investment trusts have also been very strong this year. So far
22 new issues have raised a total of Pounds 2.26bn.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Action over ulcer drug is dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mylan Laboratories of the US said yesterday that SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-US drugs company, had dropped its patent and trademark lawsuit filed
last week against Mylan over Tagamet, the ulcer drug.
The US patent on Tagamet, once SmithKline's best-selling drug, expired at
midnight. Mylan said it will launch its generic version today.
Mylan will join two other manufacturers, Canada's Novopharm, and an alliance
between US companies Du Pont and Merck to sell the generic drug -
cimetidine.
SmithKline and Novopharm settled a separate patent and trademark dispute out
of court on Monday.
Both actions were over the alleged visual similarity between the generic
manufacturers cimetidine tablets and Tagamet. Novopharm agreed to darken the
green colour of its product.
SmithKline has said that up to 10 generics manufacturers may eventually
enter the market.
Novopharm has said it expects the generic price to be 30 per cent to 50 per
cent below that of the branded drug.
Recent cases of other big-selling drugs running out of patent protection
suggest that an 80 per cent discount is likely within 12 months.
Tagamet sales are worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 664m) a year.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Savings ratio sinks to post-war low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ratio of savings to gross domestic product last year fell to its lowest
level since the second world war, threatening to undermine hopes of an
investment-led recovery, an economic study warns.
Written by Mr Peter Warburton and Mr Nigel Sedgley, economists with Robert
Fleming Security, it calculates that the level of UK savings last year was
only 15 per cent of the total GDP figure, largely because of public-sector
debt.
This proportion leaves the UK at the bottom of the 24-nation OECD league
table for national savings ratios. With the latest public-sector borrowing
requirement figures due to be released today, this debt seems set to
seriously undermine the hoped-for recovery in fixed investment, the study
warns.
'The national savings figure does not get a lot of attention. But such a
slow national savings ratio is a big drain and big constraint,' argues Mr
Warburton, who points out that the problem is almost entirely due to
public-sector debt, rather than low levels of private savings, which have
started to pick up in recent months.
Government officials insist that a vigorous attempt is being made to reduce
the public-sector debt, pointing to the recent undershoot in the PSBR as
evidence.
Mr Warburton argues that the weak performance of the gilt market suggests
that the markets remain unconvinced by these efforts.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Make Ecu a business currency, says think-tank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ecu should be used as a parallel currency to allow business to deal in a
single tender across Europe, a new paper by a leading rightwing think-tank
argues today.
The paper, published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, which influenced
Baroness Thatcher during her term as prime minister, says that a parallel
Ecu is needed by business given that monetary union has receded to a distant
dream.
The paper's authors, who have expressed these opinions before, stress there
are now powerful economic reasons for a united, parallel currency. The
kaleidoscope of national currencies has been calculated to cost European
business Ecu15bn (Pounds 19.5bn), it says, with 55 per cent of companies
agreeing that savings from a single currency could exceed 1.5 per cent of
turnover.
Recent European Commission res-earch suggests that many businesses already
use the existing abstract Ecu measure in their transactions, with the Ecu
bond market the fifth largest in Europe.
A parallel currency need not entail any loss of political sovereignty, the
paper says.
The key to their scenario is a 'basket' Ecu, compiled from a weighted
average of community currencies.
This would require only minimal political agreement to introduce or manage,
they argue, saying that notes and coins could be issued by national banks or
even private currency boards, instead of the European Monetary Institute.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Price war is forecast for life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commission disclosure in the life insurance industry will quickly trigger a
price war as banks and building societies take advantage of their lower
distribution costs, says accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The ability to price products differentially to reflect the costs of selling
through various distribution channels will lead life companies which use
more than one channel to concentrate on their core method of distribution,
it forecasts.
Differential pricing is to be allowed in the new regime for disclosing more
information about commissions and costs. The regime, which requires the new
disclosure rules to be met by the start of next year, has been demanded by
regulators.
A Coopers analysis of the costs of companies operating mainly through one of
three distribution channels - banks, independent financial advisers and a
direct sales force - suggests that a significant price differential exists
for the banks and building societies.
The estimated average costs of acquiring new business as a percentage of
annual premium equivalent (regular premium income plus 10 per cent of single
premium income) range from 60 per cent for banks and building societies to
89 per cent for those using independent advisers and 95 per cent for
companies using a direct sales force.
Mr Angus Hislop, a senior financial services partner at Coopers, said
yesterday that the analysis also highlighted the scope for cost savings. In
each category, the highest expense ratio in the range was at least 25
percentage points higher than the average. Among companies using mainly
independent advisers it was more than 50 percentage points higher.
The Coopers forecast points in the same direction as research last month by
the Securities and Investments Board which suggested that commissions would
fall by about 20 per cent as a result of the new regime.
Mr Hislop said that he would expect the move to have the worst impact on
smaller, non-specialised sales forces. It would not affect independent
advisers so badly because there had already been a shake-out in that part of
the sector.
He added that, while distribution through banks and building societies was
clearly the cheapest method, the life-product proportion of overheads for
bank and building society branch networks should rise. That would happen as
more space in branches was devoted to selling and less to processing
transactions.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Insurers gloomy about prospects: Alison Smith says that
tougher regulation and competition may have an enduring impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Encouraging customers to look ahead and consider the ills that could befall
them is a classic pitch for selling life insurance. The life industry itself
might be forgiven for being in sombre mood as it contemplates what lies
ahead.
Certainly some in the industry believe that the fall in new life and
pensions business revealed in the statistics from the Association of British
Insurers for the first three months of this year represents more than a
passing cloud.
The combination of tougher regulatory requirements and intensifying
competition looks like having an enduring and damping impact on the amount
of new business written in the months to come. The reluctance of some
leading companies to be drawn on the figures tells its own story.
Regulation seems to have acted as a depressant on new business in more than
one way.
On pensions business, the association highlighted the effect on
single-premium pension business of the uncertainty created by the
regulators' review of pension transfers launched in December after a pilot
study caused widespread concern about standards of selling.
That uncertainty has affected not only customers but also life insurers:
some of them are still not writing any pension transfer business and others
are being more cautious.
More generally, Mr Steve Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, is
among those to have highlighted the effort that needs to be put into meeting
new standards in training and the sales process as a diversion from current
selling.
Others suggest that the concentration on dealing with new regulatory
requirements may have detracted from designing new products to meet new
customer needs.
As Mr Tom King, general manager in charge of marketing at Standard Life, put
it: 'Product development has perhaps not kept pace with the changing
market.'
Competition is increasing across a range of sources. It is a familiar
argument that existing life companies will face a fiercer contest for
customers as new life operations - particularly those planned by a number of
the largest building societies - enter the market in the coming months.
But the association's figures suggest that life companies were also affected
by other forms of savings such as personal equity plans (Peps) and
tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas). The success of some National
Savings products, already identified as contributing to successive monthly
outflows from building societies' retail deposits, may be another factor.
'Investment performance hasn't been that great, so perhaps customers did not
think it worth the risk to go for life products rather than National
Savings,' one company commented.
There are, however, some opportunities among the gloom. In particular,
higher standards in training and selling should in the longer term help
rebuild the confidence not only of the customer but also of the sales agent.
And it is open to life insurers themselves to adapt. Mr King pointed out,
for example, that life companies could undertake more Pep business as the
popularity of other products faded.
'We realise we're facing very serious challenges in the marketplace,' he
said, 'but we're not down hearted'.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Cut-price sale for troubled project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Quay, a large part-finished office building opposite Canary Wharf in
the London Docklands, is believed to have been sold to an overseas buyer for
about Pounds 7m, about a tenth of its original cost.
South Quay, 360,000 sq ft of space including an unfinished 17-storey tower
block, went into receivership in May 1992. The purchaser intends to hold the
development until market conditions improve.
The South Quay development consists of three separate office buildings above
two floors of shops.
Two buildings - comprising 144 self-contained business apartments and 30
retail units - are virtually complete while the third building, which
includes the tower block, is part-completed.
South Quay was built by Wiggins Group, a property developer, and established
as a separate company in 1990 when Wiggins underwent financial
restructuring.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Hope mingles with fears at troubled Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London has done its best to soften the impact of its 1991 losses
of Pounds 2.05bn on the Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the
insurance market.
Nevertheless, in spite of some encouraging signs, the figures announced
yesterday provide evidence of a number of worrying trends especially in
relation to the market's exposure to US asbestos and pollution claims.
The identification of a substantial 'double count' in the 1991 and 1990
results is probably the most welcome news for Names - Pounds 533m of the
1991 loss and Pounds 596m of the 1990 loss has been counted twice, reducing
losses for the two years from Pounds 5.4bn to Pounds 4.3bn.
An estimated Pounds 268m of the 1991 'double count' has emerged on errors
and omissions policies, which cover agents against legal awards for
negligence.
The remaining Pounds 265m has occurred on personal stop loss (a personal
re-insurance policy bought by Lloyd's Names) and estate protection plans (a
policy which covers the liabilities of deceased Names).
Lloyd's is also holding out the prospect of further reductions as it seeks
to eliminate other forms of 'double counting'. These include the losses on
catastrophe re-insurance syndicates, which specialised in so-called 'spiral'
business, covering the high-level risks of other Lloyd's syndicates and
companies.
'We've got to get to grips with dual notification of claims,' said Mr Peter
Middleton, chief executive.
Other positive signs include pledges to accelerate tax recoveries and
payments of stop loss policies.
Lloyd's is also holding out the prospect of future rewards for Names,
following increases in insurance rates. Mr David Rowland, the chairman, said
recent restructuring at Lloyd's had 'resulted in a much leaner, fitter
generation of surviving underwriters'.
He added: 'It is encouraging to note that nearly two-thirds of the capacity
in the Lloyd's of 1994 is in the hands of syndicates which made good profits
in 1991.'
Confidence is so great in this respect that the market is again allowing
Names to borrow a percentage of profits from the current year of account -
an amount equal to 3 per cent of their premium income limit - to meet past
losses. Syndicate managers are also being encouraged to delay cash calls on
Names.
From the market's point of view, agents and underwriters can take comfort
from indications that the 1991 loss will prove to be more widely spread than
in recent years.
Mr Rowland said this made 'the possibility of recovery easier than if it
were concentrated on fewer heads'.
Members of syndicates specialising in catastrophe re-insurance were hit by
claims from disasters such as Hurricane Hugo in the Caribbean and the
European winter storms of 1990. They faced some of the worst losses in 1989
and 1990.
In 1991 the marine market, which was heavily exposed to catastrophe business
in 1989 and 1990, reduced its losses for the year by about 50 per cent to
Pounds 452m (Pounds 892.9m), for example.
While Lloyd's may be beginning to emerge from its immediate problems, the
legacy of its past involvement in the US, where syndicates were leading
underwriters of liability business, still casts a shadow.
An increase in reserves of Pounds 1,042m for years before 1991 - mainly from
asbestos, pollution and other health-related claims - was the 'single
largest factor in the result', Mr Rowland said.
Lloyd's explained that claims from 'asbestos property damage', which
involves property owners claiming for the cost of removing asbestos from
their buildings, were 'coming in quicker than expected'.
In addition, there had been a 'ballooning' of settlements on 'asbestos
bodily injury', which arise when victims of asbestos-related diseases
successfully sue for damages.
The uncertainty over the evolution of these claims has led to a rise in the
number of syndicates unable to close their accounts, with the number of
'open years of account' rising from 162 at the end of 1991 to 317 at the end
of 1992 and 478 at the end of 1993.
Lloyd's stresses that it is well-reserved, especially compared with US
insurers, to meet these claims. It is confident that plans to establish
NewCo, a re-insurance company into which all business underwritten before
1986 will be transferred, will prove to be successful.
There is optimism, too, about the prospects of reforming the so-called
'superfund' laws, under which the US government can order business to clean
up contaminated land sites.
Names, who face cash calls of between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.7bn this
year, can only hope that this optimism is well-founded.

Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, suggested in the Commons
yesterday that the accurate total of the unemployed was nearly 5m. The
latest official figure says 2.722m are out of work.
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the unemployed total was
measured through the numbers claiming benefit and through a definition
approved by the International Labour Organisation. Both were broadly the
same.
Mr Prescott said the government's labour force survey showed that on top of
the total another 2.2m people were looking for work.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Brown's bandwagon starts to roll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complexities of Labour's leadership battle deepened yesterday as friends
of Mr Gordon Brown suggested that he might stand against Mr Tony Blair, his
close ally, and Mr Jack Cunningham re-emerged as a potential candidate.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, was also said to have put off a
decision on whether to stand until after the European parliament election on
June 9.
Aides of Mr Brown, the shadow chancellor, said he was being urged to stand
by union officials concerned about the media bandwagon building up behind Mr
Blair, the shadow home secretary.
Friends of the men had earlier indicated that one of the two would stand
down to avoid blurring the so-called 'modernist' message to which both
subscribe.
Mr Brown's friends said, however, he believed it would be possible for both
to stand without damaging their friendship.
Mr Brown is expected to proceed only if it appears that his support among
constituency members and trade-union levy payers is significantly stronger
than Mr Blair's.
Most MPs said Mr Brown's position appeared untenable, given the strong
support within the parliamentary party for Mr Blair.
Others said the outcome would be uncertain if several candidates decided to
take advantage of the preferential voting system to stand.
Mr Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was said to be thinking of standing
if he could rely on the support of about 60 MPs.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Labour to call four by-elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour business managers confirmed yesterday that they would call four
by-elections for June 9, the same day as the European elections and the poll
in Eastleigh, Hampshire, James Blitz writes.
The party moved the writ to hold by-elections in three east London
constituencies - Barking, Dagenham and Newham North East - and in Bradford
South, West Yorkshire. At the last election, Labour had a comfortable
majority in all four constituencies.
The elections in Barking, Newham and Bradford were caused by the deaths of
sitting MPs - Jo Richardson, Ron Leighton and Bob Cryer. The Dagenham
election was caused by the resignation of Mr Bryan Gould, the former shadow
cabinet member, on Monday. He had announced earlier he was taking an
academic post in New Zealand.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Eastleigh bickering dents truce: Roland Rudd discovers a
change of mood as accusations fly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement between the political parties to suspend campaigning in the
wake of John Smith's death appeared to have collapsed yesterday as the
government moved the writ for the Eastleigh by-election for June 9, the same
day as the European elections and four other by-elections.
The Liberal Democrats were criticised by the other parties for launching
their campaign with a national press conference.
Ms Marilyn Birks, the Labour candidate, was said to be 'very disappointed',
while Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party, said he was
very surprised to hear of the press conference in the week of Mr Smith's
funeral.
Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, accused his opponents of
hypocrisy. He said Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, visited
Eastleigh with 14 other Labour MPs before the funeral of Mr Stephen
Milligan, the Conservative MP whose death led to the by-election. While the
Tories suspended press conferences and campaigning Mr Stephen Reid, their
candidate, continued private meetings with businessmen.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, plans to visit Vosper
Thorneycroft and hold a press conference, although Mr Reid says that - out
of respect to Mr Smith - he will not attend it.
Only the Labour party suspended campaigning, apart from press briefings by
Miss Julie Crowley, the press officer, to explain what Labour will not do in
advance of Mr Smith's funeral.
Mr Smith's death has not raised the level of political debate in Eastleigh.
The Liberal Democrats were accused of poor taste, Labour of hypocrisy and
the Tories of running scared. One shopkeeper said: 'Mr Smith's death was
very sad, but no one expected it to end the political slanging match.'
People of all political beliefs and of none expressed genuine sorrow at Mr
Smith's death but few thought it would have a significant political
fall-out. It is unlikely to affect the by-election result - the Liberal
Democrats still appear to be on course to win the seat with a big majority,
overturning the Tory majority of 17,702.
In old people's sheltered accommodation in prosperous Bursledon support for
the Conservatives appeared to be haemorrhaging, primarily because of tax
increases and rising crime. Labour supporters were contemplating switching
to the Liberal Democrats as the party best placed to take the seat from the
Tories.
Mr Maurice Wichall seemed to sum up the mood of many when he said there was
'enormous sympathy' for Labour. So would he be voting Labour? 'Goodness no,'
he replied. 'People die all the time.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Football club receiver under investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receiver to Chelsea Football &amp; Athletic Club, which is in liquidation,
is under investigation by his professional body, it emerged yesterday.
The work of Mr John Papi, a practitioner based in London, is being reviewed
by the membership and authorisation committee of the Insolvency
Practitioners' Association, the leading trade body.
A report filed by Mr Papi, who was appointed receiver to CFAC last August by
Chelsea Village, shows that he paid Pounds 622,000 - all the remaining
assets of CFAC - to Chelsea Village on a charge it had over the assets worth
Pounds 1.04m.
Chelsea Village is the parent company of Chelsea Football Club, a separate
company which now holds the players and assets of the club.
The Official Receiver's office has appointed Mr Christopher Morris, a
partner with accountants Touche Ross, to liquidate CFAC.
Touche Ross confirmed yesterday that it was examining the transfer of assets
 -including the club's football players - possibly at below their value from
CFAC in 1992. It said that it was considering attempting to recover the
value of the Chelsea players on behalf of CFAC's creditors.
Mr Papi confirmed yesterday he was under investigation, but denied he had
done anything wrong.
He said that the transfer of players had been done with the blessing of the
Football Association and 'no one raised any objections at the time'.
Touche Ross said it had been told that Chelsea Village paid Pounds 1.7m in
cash to CFAC in September 1992, and registered a debenture on the company at
that point to secure the money.
The last accounts filed for CFAC in the year to June 30 1991 show that the
ultimate holding company is Mayflower Securities, based in the British
Virgin Islands.
Mr Papi's report filed at Companies House in October last year shows that HM
Customs &amp; Excise and the Inland Revenue were owed between them Pounds 93,000
at May 14 1993.
Other creditors were owed a total of Pounds 1.9m, of which the largest at
Pounds 1.25m was Chelsea Football Club. There was also a contingent creditor
 -Dr Ashraf Marwan - who claimed Pounds 2.5m in respect of a guarantee
provided by the company in March 1992.
None of these creditors was paid because the debenture holder is the first
to receive any assets in a receivership, and was not paid in full.
Neither the Insolvency Practitioners' Association nor the directors of
Chelsea would comment yesterday.

FT  18 MAY 94 / MPs warn on rising cost of US missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain should speed up its purchases of US nuclear missiles for Trident
submarines because the cost may rise sharply, the Commons defence committee
warned yesterday.
The government has so far ordered 44 of the missiles and has said it will
buy about 24 more over the next four to six years.
The committee, in a report on the Trident programme, warns that the unit
cost of missiles sold to Britain will rise sharply if the US administration
scales back its own procurement of the missile.
While the government had already increased its estimate for missile costs by
Pounds 80m, this could prove insufficient if this summer's US Budget calls
for a reduction of missile purchases by the US Navy, and the price
consequently rises.
'We fear that future (price) rises may far exceed provision, and consider
that the Ministry of Defence must be prepared to complete its missile
procurement programme as soon as possible to avoid such cost penalties,' the
report said.
The committee welcomes the fact that estimates for the total cost of the
Trident programme have inched downwards for the eighth successive year - by
Pounds 24m to Pounds 9.94bn. Some Pounds 6.9bn of this money had been spent
by November last year.
However, it expresses disappointment at the low share of sub-contracting
work being awarded to British groups. As of last autumn, UK companies had
won only Pounds 207m worth of business as a result of the Trident programme,
while US groups had obtained orders worth Pounds 3.5bn from Britain.
The committee says many elements in the Trident programme remain subject to
sharp fluctuations in cost, and warns that there must be 'no lessening of
strict control over all areas'.

Unit trust managers will be allowed to deduct annual charges from the
capital of the funds they manage and will no longer be limited to taking
fees out of the income stream from dividends, the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, said yesterday.
SIB has been under pressure from the unit trust industry to alter new rules
on unit trust pricing which had restricted the source from which fees could
be derived. It said it was 'not expressing a view on the appropriateness of
adopting the practice of charging to capital'.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Call for longer radio licences
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Radio Authority has told the government it would like to see longer
licences for commercial radio companies to give the industry greater
stability. The body, which regulates commercial radio, believes that the
present eight-year licences are too short to give an adequate return on
investment.
It also wants the government to look at anomalies in the way television and
radio is treated in the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
After six years ITV companies can apply to negotiate a licence extension
which, if accepted, can then run for a further 14 years. National radio
licences such as that held by Classic FM are simple one-off licences that
have to be readvertised.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 200 employees of Northumbria Ambulance Service have accepted a local
pay offer conditional on a no-strike agreement - the first among ambulance
staff in the UK - and an end to collective bargaining.
The offer, made on an individual basis to the 199 station officers and
paramedics, gives them rises of 4.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively
from July 1.
The agreement means pay negotiations will no longer be conducted through the
Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, which was the association's
sole recognised union.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Lecturers walk out over contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 800 lecturers went on strike yesterday at Sheffield College, the
country's largest further education college, as the dispute over
government-backed 'flexible' contracts escalated, John Authers writes.
Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, has withheld Pounds 50m from
college budgets until the new contracts are introduced. The government
believes the contracts are necessary if the growing demand for flexible
training courses is to be met.
Members of the Natfhe lecturers' union at Sheffield College, which has more
than 850 lecturers on six different sites, plan to strike for a total of
five days. The lecturers say the new contracts include no limits on working
hours.
Ms Sue Berryman, Natfhe negotiating secretary, said union branches at more
than 100 colleges were holding strike ballots and predicted that most would
lead to strike action next month.
Two other unions with fewer members in the sector, the Association of
Teachers and Lecturers and the Association of College Management, have
agreed to the contracts, which offer a one-off payment of Pounds 500 for
longer hours and a 50 per cent cut in holidays.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Chancellor denies rift with Bank over policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night sought to quash suggestions
that he and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, differed
on policy, asserting that they 'share the same aim of low inflation and
sound money'.
Stressing his belief in a 'business-friendly government', Mr Clarke said he
would continue to set fiscal and monetary policy 'as toughly and decisively
as I have to' with the aim of 'low inflation on a permanent basis and
healthy public finances'.
In an address to the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry,
the chancellor admitted that the government had a political problem because
the UK economy was recovering 'without a feel-good factor'.
But, using words that echoed those of Mr George in a speech last week, he
said: 'Too many people still hanker after the go-go growth of living
standards they enjoyed in the years of boom. Well, this chancellor does not
want a boom because boom gets followed by bust.'
In a move to counter reports of differences with the governor over interest
rates and Mr George's hawkish anti-inflation stance, Mr Clarke said he
remained firmly committed to the government's policy of keeping underlying
inflation in the 1 per cent to 4 per cent band and bringing it within the
lower part of the band by the end of this parliament.
He had, he said, allowed the Bank to publish its own quarterly inflation
report and insisted on the publication of genuine minutes of his monthly
monetary meetings with Mr George to improve the credibility of policy.
'There is not a clash between cultures or objectives.' Stories of
differences with Mr George were 'a little coloured'. The new openness in
government was 'heady stuff for journalists to handle - it is like
introducing Red Indians to whisky'.
Britain's current low inflation level had been hard won and 'the governor
and I are equally determined that it should not be jeopardised by any lack
of monetary discipline in the upturn,' Mr Clarke said. The government
remained 'absolutely resolute' in its determination to control public
spending and cut public borrowing, he added.
Tax cutting would come on to the agenda again, he said, but only after 'the
other things' had been put right.
Mr Clarke made a vigorous defence of his private finance initiative,
claiming that the effort to involve the private sector in areas such as
infrastructure spending could have as important an impact in the 1990s as
privatisation had done in the 1980s.
He also said the UK should not lose self-confidence over Europe, claiming
that Britain's improved economic performance could win influence and help
the government in its aim of creating a European Union that is good for UK
industry and enterprise.

FT  18 MAY 94 / CBI president pours scorn on Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The out-going president of the Confederation of British Industry yesterday
delivered a blistering attack on the European Commission, claiming that
Brussels was hampering UK business interests by excessive regulation and
out-dated '50s-style' policies.
In a clarion call to the UK Euro-sceptics Sir Michael Angus, who is chairman
of Whitbread, accused the commission of ignoring the views of European
businessmen and called on the UK government to 'take up the cudgels' of
industry.
'Doubts have once again begun to set in as to whether the community is
capable of adopting an agenda that makes a positive contribution to the
ability of businesses to face intense global pressures,' he said.
If European legislators introduced any more anti-competitive initiatives
they should simply 'go into a dark room, lie down, and keep taking the
tablets,' he said at the CBI's annual dinner.
The unusually provocative speech, which marks the swan-song of Sir Michael's
two-year term as CBI president, cited five main areas where the commission
had apparently failed to listen to business views.
The first was the white paper on competitiveness and growth, drawn up by Mr
Jacques Delors, commission president. This had been given a 'disappointingly
thin' follow-up. But when he had raised these criticisms with Mr Padraig
Flynn, social affairs commissioner, he had been shocked by Mr Flynn's
'outdated' focus on industrial relations.
The second target was the green paper on social policy, which was accused of
paying too little attention on the need to get Europe's 20m unemployed back
to work.
The commission's attempts to introduce the directive on employee information
and consultation provided another bone of contention. The directive would
erode the competitiveness of European companies and leave US businessmen
'chortling'.
Fourth, the proliferation of anti-competitive state aids was undermining
European industry, Sir Michael said. He accused the commission of
undermining competitive policy in areas where the UK was strongest - civil
aviation, steel, telecommunications and energy.
Finally, Sir Michael concluded, the commission was failing to get to grips
with its own spending policy, producing a 'dismal catalogue of fraud and
waste'.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Heseltine defends business links plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to press ahead with creating a network of 200 business
links advisory centres during the next two years, in spite of doubts among
some chambers of commerce and business leaders.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday dismissed
opponents as representing vested interests. He said people would change
their minds when they saw the new business links at work.
Business links are designed to pull advisory services into one-stop shops
and use information technology to link them in a national network. They will
charge for services and target medium-sized companies.
Mr Heseltine was opening Manchester's business link which - with satellite
offices in Trafford, Salford, Tameside, and East Manchester - counts as five
business links towards the 200 target.
Manchester's business link is the biggest of 22 approved so far and is seen
by the government as a flagship for the whole initiative.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Measured response to Sinn Fein expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night preparing a deadpan response to the latest
attempt by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, to secure clarification of
the Downing Street Declaration.
Mr John Major met senior ministers including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to consider
draft comments understood to do no more than restate existing policy.
The government is expected to publish its commentary, along with Sinn Fein's
questions, today or tomorrow.
The government has come under pressure from unionists and some Conservative
backbenchers not to say anything that might be interpreted as opening
negotiations with republican leaders.
Ministerial aides have been playing down expectations at Westminster,
pointing out that many of the questions raised matters that could be
resolved only in talks between Ulster's constitutional parties.
As the cycle of violence in the province continued with the shootings of two
workmen in north Belfast, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, seemed to
pave the way for a negative response from republicans.
'There has been growing concern among many nationalists that the British
government may squander yet another opportunity to advance the peace
process,' he said.
Yesterday's killings by loyalist gunmen brought to 28 the total of murders
this year in Northern Ireland.

FT  18 MAY 94 / BBC strikes start next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions at the BBC yesterday announced a schedule of two strikes a week
starting from next Tuesday in an increasingly bitter dispute over pay and
conditions.
Tuesday's planned strike of technicians and journalists will last 24 hours,
although subsequent strikes will last for varying periods - some could be
for as little as 10 minutes.
Live radio and television programmes such as news, current affairs and sport
are expected to be the worst affected. The unions said there would be
strikes on June 10, the day after polling in the European elections and
parliamentary by-elections, and June 12, when counting begins for the
European elections.
The BBC's management last night began drawing up contingency plans for
emergency coverage.
The dispute is over plans to introduce performance-related pay and to end
comprehensive collective bargaining and conditions of employment.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the BBC technical union, said his
members had sweated to keep programmes going since the introduction of an
internal market at the corporation, and now the management 'wants blood'.
Ms Margaret Salmon, the BBC's director of personnel, said she was
disappointed at the call for action. The management had wanted to continue
talks, she added. 'We are prepared to talk as soon as the unions are
prepared to talk too.'

FT  18 MAY 94 / Low safety standards cause alarm: There is 'a strong
temptation to cut corners . . . we have to make it unprofitable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An alarming picture of low safety standards at sea and the environmental
risks to marine life and the shoreline posed by poorly maintained tankers
and other vessels is painted by the report of the Donaldson inquiry.
The inquiry was prompted by the grounding of the oil tanker Braer, but 67
significant pollution-threatening marine incidents - more than one a week -
were recorded while the inquiry was sitting, revealing the extent of the
potential risk to the coastline.
Among those incidents were:
The Havkong, a Bermuda registered carrier of liquefied petroleum gas, broke
adrift from its moorings in the Firth of Forth in winds of up to 80 knots.
It nearly collided with another tanker but 'by a combination of good fortune
and good seamanship' was successfully anchored.
The Freja Svea, a Danish-owned tanker, was trapped in Tees Bay in
deteriorating weather conditions and unable to put to sea. The Gran Piedra,
a Cuban-registered cargo ship, went adrift near the Isles of Scilly when its
engines failed because of poor-quality fuel. 'A classic example of a near
miss', the vessel drifted near the isles before anchoring.
The report says high standards of ship design, maintenance and operation are
expensive and vast overcapacity has made the shipping industry extremely
competitive.
'This produces low or negative profit margins and a strong temptation to cut
corners, resisted by some, but far too few, shipowners. In one way or
another we have to make it unprofitable to cut corners.'
Prime responsibility for the safety of ships lies with the states whose
flags they fly and the classification societies which carry out inspections.
Some 'flag states' do their job well, including a number providing 'flags of
convenience', such as Liberia, the flag state of the Braer, 'but others
quite clearly do an inadequate job'.
Lord Donaldson and his team urge the International Maritime Organisation,
the United Nations body responsible for international shipping agreements,
to do more to persuade flag states to improve performance, but says Britain
and its European partners cannot wait for changes.
International conventions place the first duty to ensure ship safety on the
flag states, but the north-west European countries already have a tough
system of inspection of vessels calling at their ports.
In 1992 nearly half of the 15,000 north-west European port inspections
revealed deficiencies, and 600 vessels were in such a poor state that they
had to be detained until repaired. 'If instead of ships the inspections had
been of aircraft, there would have been a public outcry.'
The report proposes that vessels visiting ports for the first time should
report for inspection and thereafter give advance warning at least once a
year - more frequently if they are tankers - for a possible further
inspection. If enough faults were found they would have to report every time
they approached a port for the next 12 months.
In severe cases, substandard vessels could face delays before being allowed
to load or unload. The arrival of one substandard vessel could trigger an
inspection of the owner's entire fleet.
It also calls for an increase in the number of salvage tugs available to
respond to emergencies, with costs shared by the private and public sectors.
These two suggestions should form the 'bedrock of the defence of these
shores', Lord Donaldson said, but his report also identifies the improved
supply of information as a way of raising standards.
More information about the quality of fleets would allow charterers and
their brokers to make more informed choices about which vessels are most
likely to reach their destination in one piece while insurance underwriters
would adjust their premiums.
Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas. HMSO. Pounds 38
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
               TOWARDS SAFER SHIPS AND CLEANER SEAS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems highlighted by the Braer disaster
Inadequate system of inspection for ships' design, maintenance and operation
standards.
Insufficient provision of emergency assistance facilities: not enough
salvage tugs available.
Polluting or potentially polluting ships are not easy to identify, even in
daylight.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommendations
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Selected ships to give 48 hours notice of arrival at most European ports
where they would be thoroughly inspected.
Information on sub-standard ships held by charterers, insurers, agents and
regulatory bodies should be shared more widely.
Ships should carry a unique recognition symbol prominently on sides and deck
and, longer term, be fitted with transponders for automatic electronic
identification.
Random aerial surveillance of shipping lanes.
Establishment of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas (MEHRAs).
Publication of a Seaway Code listing MEHRAs and reminding ships masters of
practical steps to reduce risk of pollution.
Polluters and potential polluters should pay more towards costs of
prevention.
Increased number of salvage tugs around coast.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Broad welcome for Braer report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shipping industry gave a generally positive response to the findings of
the Donaldson inquiry - which was prompted by the Braer tanker disaster -
but questioned whether its recommendations would provide swift or easy
answers to the problems of pollution and shipping safety.
Numast, the shipmasters' and officers' union, said: 'There have been endless
discussions and the International Maritime Organisation (a United Nations
agency) does an awful lot but it can take three or four years to get an
international convention agreed and years more to get it enforced.'
Emphasis on port controls of substandard vessels to overcome the weakness of
the system of 'flag state' control, was met with scepticism.
'Port inspection can only be an adjunct to flag state control,' said Capt
Kenneth Long, assistant director of the International Association of Dry
Cargo Shipowners. Some flag states have improved controls in recent years,
although the only way to bring pressure is 'to keep telling them', he said.
The Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Associations said
a weakness of port controls was that the standards demanded could be
inconsistent, both between countries and between ports in the same country.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, disagreed and called for
action by port states. 'With so many irresponsible shipowners and operators
we cannot depend on the necessary action being taken by the states whose
flags they fly.'
Capt Long said the proposal to increase the number of tugs stationed on
Britain's coastline could prove extremely costly for only a marginal
improvement in safety.
Increasing the amount of information in a traditionally secretive industry
may also prove more difficult than envisaged by the Donaldson report.
Some said that those who provide information could find themselves at a
disadvantage against the 'cowboys' who keep quiet.
Numast, which pointed to the 800 deaths of seafarers since the Braer
disaster, said the inquiry report did not make enough concrete suggestions
in the field of human resources.
'The report says it is idle to attempt to change human nature but this seems
to us to duck the issue,' it said. Operating standards were crucial but
there were no effective guidelines on working hours for ships' crews, it
added.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Scotch whisky producers take on Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five centuries after their first skirmish with the Scottish exchequer,
Scotch whisky producers are still struggling with the tax man, but their
opponent now is Japan's finance ministry.
Mr Hugh Morison, director general of the Scotch Whisky Association, is in
Tokyo to lobby against what whisky producers say is a discriminatory tax
regime.
Whisky, like other imported spirits such as bourbon and cognac, is taxed up
to six times higher than shochu, a domestic drink made from sweet potato
which controls about 67 per cent of the Japanese spirit market.
'This discrimination is in spite of a 1987 ruling that declared that Japan's
liquor tax system contravened Gatt,' he says. 'The findings were accepted by
the Japanese government in 1989, but little has changed since then.'
Japan is the world's fourth largest Scotch whisky export market after the
US, France and Spain. But imported spirits account for about 8 per cent of
the Japanese market, compared with an average of 30 per cent in other
industrialised democracies.
'This is a pretty blatant breach of a Gatt ruling by one of the world's main
trading nations,' says Mr Morison. 'It's the worst case of discrimination in
any of the Scotch export markets.'
Japan argues that shochu is part of the national culture because it is made
by small rural distilleries across Japan. But Scotch makers insist that more
than half of all shochu is made by six large industrial groups involved in
other activities such as pharmaceuticals.
Japan says its taxation system is moving in the right direction. Since 1989,
the difference between the tax on whisky and shochu koh, a down-market
version, has fallen from a ratio of 1:16 to 1:5, and dropped to 1:4 under
rules introduced on May 1.
Scotch whisky sales have done particularly badly during Japan's worst
post-war recession. Sales in Japan fell 22 per cent last year from Pounds
178m in 1992 to Pounds 139m, while volume dropped 13 per cent from 18.5m
litres of pure alcohol to 16.2m litres.
Mr Morison says the tax distortions have meant Japanese consumers switched
to lower cost products such as shochu whose sales ended a five-year decline
in 1992, rising 4.4 per cent, and 5.5 per cent in the first half of last
year.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Lucas to pay Dollars 12m to settle US claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the British-based aerospace and motor components group, is
to pay the US Defence Department Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) to settle claims
that it provided US forces with faulty equipment.
A settlement reached with the US Attorney's office in New York provides for
Lucas not only to pay the money but also to admit guilt of falsifying the
results of tests on certain of its products and to keep in place procedures
to make certain there can can be no repetition of the claims.
This accord, which Lucas said yesterday would be placed before a federal
court, ends two years of FBI investigations. It removes the possibility of
court proceedings against Lucas Aul, a US subsidiary.
The investigation sought to establish whether Lucas Aul supplied defective
missile launching components and military radios which failed to meet
specifications. The Components are used in Maverick ground-to-air missiles.
Mavericks were the cause of 16 Allied deaths in two 'friendly fire'
incidents on January 29 and February 26 1991 in the Gulf War. But the US
authorities made clear there was no link between these deaths and the
defective equipment. Lucas acquired Aul in 1986. Many procedures for testing
components were in place before then. So were the Pentagon supply contracts.

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic took a narrrow lead
yesterday as counting continued from Monday's election, opening the prospect
of a seventh term in office for the veteran leader.
With nearly half of the 3.3m votes counted, Mr Balaguer's Social Christian
Reform Party had 43.6 per cent, with the Dominican Liberation Party of Mr
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, on 40.47 per cent.
The count was accompanied by charges of fraud and irregularities from the
Dominican Liberation Party and others contesting the election.
Mr Pena Gomez said yesterday he would ask for new elections in several
provinces where many people, most of whom he claimed were his party's
supporters, were unable to vote. The election was subject to 'major fraud'
perpetrated by the ruling party, he said. Reform Party officials yesterday
dismissed the charges as 'fiction.'
Hundreds of thousands of voters were prevented from casting ballots on
Monday either because their voting cards were confiscated by the military
and the police, or because their names were not on lists of voters.
Mr Pena Gomez, who is black, claimed that many of those prevented from
voting were told that they were not Dominicans but illegal immigrants from
neighbouring Haiti.
The elections commission extended voting by three hours on Monday night
following the charges.
Public opinion polls before the election indicated a close win for Mr Pena
Gomez, 54, a social democrat and a former mayor of the capital Santo
Domingo. Reform Party officials always maintained Mr Balaguer, 87, would
win.
Political tension was high yesterday as the votes were being counted. The
army imposed an undeclared curfew in several cities following outbreaks of
shooting.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Disgraced former mayor joins the race for Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Marion Barry will this weekend declare himself a candidate to be mayor of
Washington, DC, the job he left in disgrace four years ago after being
arrested for use of narcotics.
Mr Barry, who subsequently served a prison term, was re-elected to the city
council in 1992 representing Washington's poorest district. He is given at
least an outside chance of winning September's Democratic party primary,
which is tantamount to victory in November since local Republicans are
insignificant in number.
The likely field of local black leaders also includes Ms Sharon Pratt Kelly,
the incumbent mayor, and Mr John Ray, an at-large city council member. There
is no provision for a run-off election after the primary which means, as was
Mr Barry's fortune in 1978, that the mayoralty can be won in an evenly
divided three-person field with little more than one third of the vote.
Mayor Kelly is widely considered to have been a disappointment, especially
by the city's whites, a majority of whom supported her in 1990. One recent
city-wide poll found two-thirds believing she did not deserve a second term.
She is blamed for failing to attack both the crime wave and the city's
budgetary deficit, which leaves it on the verge of seeking federal
assistance. Several senior aides have recently been fired or resigned.
Mr Ray is probably now rated the favourite, since he seems to have been the
principal beneficiary of Ms Kelly's declining support. He is expected to run
a less passive campaign than he did in 1990, when he sought to balance his
appeal between blacks and whites and was upstaged by Ms Kelly's campaign to
clean up the Barry mess.
Mr Barry's three terms, from 1978 to 1990, could hardly have been more
controversial, even before his demise. A well known community and civil
rights activist, he cut a flamboyant figure, preaching black pride and
awarding city contracts to minority companies, but simultaneously alienating
both the federal government and Congress, on whom Washington depends for
about 20 per cent of its financial needs.
But his grassroots support in the overcrowded and run-down housing precincts
remained strong, as witnessed by his easy council victory two years ago over
an apparently formidable black female opponent. He claims now to be a
reformed person, with a new marriage, and his drug addiction behind him.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Fed acts decisively to lift confidence: Bond surge reflects
hopes of end to 'water torture'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, yesterday gave
financial markets most of what they have been demanding for weeks.
Under his leadership, the Fed raised the federal funds rate by a half point
to 4.25 per cent - a more decisive move than the three previous
quarter-point increases announced since February. And, equally important, it
put the increase in context by saying that yesterday's action 'substantially
removes the degree of monetary accomodation which prevailed throughout
1993.'
This was interpreted by some analysts as meaning that the Fed had all but
achieved its immediate goal of raising rates to a 'neutral' level - in other
words, a level consistent with non-inflationary growth in the medium term.
Part of yesterday's surge in bond prices probably reflected hopes that the
policy of repeated incremental increases in short rates - known
disparagingly as 'water torture' - has been put on hold, at least for the
time being.
Given an underlying inflation rate of about 3 per cent, short-term interest
rates of 4.25 per cent imply real or inflation-adjusted rates of about 1.25
per cent. This is within the 1-2 per cent range that most economists would
argue represents a neutral level of real rates in the longer term.
However, it does not imply that the Fed's work is anywhere near complete.
If the economy continues to grow faster than its long-run potential - which
is probably 2.5-3.0 per cent a year - the Fed will want to move beyond
neutrality to an overtly contractionary stance. This would require further
substantial increases in rates, perhaps to well above 5 per cent.
Recent better than expected inflation data - such as April figures for
consumer and producer prices - have led some analysts to conclude that a
further tightening of monetary policy will not be required for several
months. This may be so, but other factors are less encouraging.
The Fed may well conclude more aggressive efforts are needed to prevent the
economy hitting capacity constraints, threatening higher inflation in 1995
and beyond.
The annualised rate of growth admittedly dipped in the first quarter to an
estimated 2.6 per cent against 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. A few
recent indicators have been slightly weaker than expected: retail sales fell
in April after strong upward revisions in February and March; housing starts
also dropped last month, prompting speculation that residential construction
has peaked.
But the preponderance of data still suggest the expansion is uncomfortably
strong. The first quarter figures were distorted by severe winter weather
and an erratically large decline in government spending. The monthly payroll
employment figures give a better indication of underlying trends. In the
first four months, average monthly gains averaged more than 250,000 against
about 200,000 in the fourth quarter of last year and about 160,000 in the
first three quarters of last year.
These figures suggest the economy is still rapidly using up spare industrial
capacity. Last month capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry was 83.0
per cent against 80.6 per cent a year ago and a long-term average of 81.9
per cent. The jobless rate for adults is now 5.6 per cent, close to the
level at which upward pressure on wages has emerged in the past.
Signs that leading European economies are beginning to emerge from recession
will only increase the Fed's fear about a possible overheating of the
domestic economy.
Until now a widening trade account has acted as a brake on US growth. But a
concerted global economic revival could lead to stronger upward pressure on
prices and strengthen the case for prudent US monetary policies.
A second concern for the Fed is the apparent lack of confidence in US
economic policies in financial markets. This is reflected, for example, in
the comparative weakness of the dollar even though interest rates are rising
in the US and falling elsewhere. A portfolio shift out of a currency when
interest differentials are moving in its favour is usually a tell-tale sign
of lack of confidence in economic fundamentals. Yesterday there was no rush
to buy dollars following the Fed's announcement of higher interest rates.
The recent very sharp rise in US long bond yields is also disturbing. A
steepening of the yield curve typically reflects fears of higher inflation
in the future - in other words, a fear that monetary policy is too loose.
With the benefit of hindsight many economists now argue that the Fed should
have begun tightening soooner in this economic cycle - before long bond
yields started rising last autumn.
The Fed doubtless hopes that yesterday's half-point increase in rates will
bolster confidence and lead to a sustained reduction in long yields. But
winning back confidence once it has been eroded is never easy.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Wiser US to meet chastened Japan / Preview
of the resumption of trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an older, perhaps wiser, Clinton administration awaiting the arrival
tomorrow of a somewhat chastened Japanese trade team whose mission it is to
help salvage the US-Japan trade relationship.
Both sides have had more than three months to reflect on the consequences of
the breakdown of bilateral talks. The mood is slightly more optimistic than
when talks broke down in February at the summit between President Bill
Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former Japanese prime minister, over
Washington's insistence on specific indicators to mark the progress of
market-opening deals.
Yet even at this stage, there are few signs that substantial progress can be
made.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, says he has been promised a
new plan by Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, which would address
the question of 'objective criteria' for measuring market access.
'We have passed the ideological issues,' said another administration
official. 'They know we don't want managed trade. The issue now is can we
find a way to negotiate around reality.'
In the sombre halls of Tokyo's ministry of international trade and industry,
officials have allowed themselves to be encouraged. 'The US is sending
positive signals in that its rhetoric is no longer as heated as it used to
be,' says one trade official. 'If we are realistic, and don't set the
hurdles too high from the start, then we may be able to discuss what is
needed in order to begin talks on restarting the negotiations.'
The US and Japan each have their own reasons for needing to find a way
forward. Both have been jolted by the tumbling dollar and climbing yen and
Japan remains mired in recession.
As Japanese trade officials admit, recent market turmoil has highlighted the
negative impact that the chill between Washington and Tokyo has on the
markets and on the rest of the world. 'We realise that our actions have an
impact on the markets and that for two of the biggest economies in the world
to continue to have strained relations is not a good situation,' said one.
Japanese bureaucrats are also sensitive to criticism that their
intransigence over quantitative indicators of progress in opening Japan's
markets to foreign products and services might have been a factor in pushing
things to the brink.
Next time round, they say, 'we don't intend to take an inflexible stance'.
President Clinton is being criticised at home by the right and the left who
say he is running messy and contradictory foreign and trade policies.
Japan's Asian neighbours have expressed concern about the uncertainty.
Trading partners in Europe are also worried.
Although neither side can afford another failure, there is little evidence
that either will sharply change course. What may be under way is a shift in
emphasis from the disputed numerical 'indicators' to an emphasis on
macro-economics.
The US set out in April a basis for restarting the informal talks. It wants
a commitment by Tokyo to a relatively long period of consumer-led growth and
macro-economic steps to stimulate the Japanese economy - continued income
tax reductions and public investment; as well as increased access for
competitive foreign products and services; and objective criteria.
For Japan, progress on the first point, along lines that would satisfy the
US, is politically difficult. While the trade ministry believes that more
should be done on the macro-economic side to stimulate the economy and
thereby trade, this will require a difficult decision from a government that
is fighting for its survival.
Further tax cuts without a guarantee that the revenue shortfall can be made
up for through alternative taxes, is strongly objected to by the ministry of
finance, which wields enormous power over both the political establishment
and bureaucracy.
But raising Japan's consumption tax to make up for that shortfall, a scheme
favoured by the finance ministry and some politicians, is strongly opposed
by the Social Democratic party whose co-operation is crucial for the
minority government.
Dr Paula Stern, a former adviser to President Clinton, said the
administration would probably get concessions on sectoral deals and
numerical targets. Washington should be playing to those forces in Japan
which have wanted faster growth and deregulation, she added.
But despite Miti officials' claims of flexibility, there is unlikely to be
any substantial change in their opposition to numerical targets for
measuring market-opening. 'There are things that we can give on and things
we cannot give on.'
Deregulation is perhaps the key area on which the two sides can make
progress. It is central to the trade ministry's plans for taking the talks
forward. The Japanese government will announce by the end of June specific
plans for deregulating the country's markets to improve access and stimulate
the economy. It hopes these measures will convince the US that it is serious
about opening its markets further.
What needs to be done is to leave the rhetoric behind and look at what is
realistically feasible, suggests a Japanese trade official. 'The US knows
what Japan fears. We know their frustrations,' he says. The key to progress
lies in whether each side can 'constructively explore a way forward that
takes these concerns and frustrations into consideration.'

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Pact erodes tariff aid for Third World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tariff cuts agreed in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks will lead to
big reductions in the value of special trade preferences for developing
countries and erode their competitive advantage, according to the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad).
A report to this week's meeting of Unctad's committee on preferences
estimates that preferential tariff margins on imports will be cut by about
23 per cent in the European Union, 15 per cent in Japan and 9 per cent in
the US.
Trade covered by the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) will shrink by
some 17 per cent, because of new zero duties agreed in the Uruguay Round, to
about Dollars 120bn (Pounds 80bn) in the three main trading groups.
The preferential share of exports from developing nations to
preference-giving countries will drop from 39 to 32 per cent, Unctad
predicts.
Though most developing countries will benefit from the general lowering of
tariffs and other import barriers in the Uruguay Round, they are anxious to
keep the advantages of trade preferences which help them compete with more
efficient industrialised country producers.
Unctad has called for increased preferential margins and duty-free treatment
for Third World goods following the Uruguay Round deal.
Preference-giving countries are also being urged to extend GSP benefits to
farm products and textiles where import quotas will be scrapped or phased
out under Uruguay Round accords.
Trade under the GSP rose almost 20 per cent in 1992 to Dollars 77bn and is
thought to have increased further in 1993, Unctad says.
There are 16 different preferential schemes benefiting over 160 developing
nations. Trade under these schemes has risen more rapidly than trade in
general over the past 20 years.
However, developing countries have long complained that the GSP is too
restricted in scope and operation. Only half dutiable exports by beneficiary
countries are covered, and only half of these actually receive GSP
treatment.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo sees public investment as solution

<TEXT>
Japan should invest more in domestic public infrastructure to prepare for
its ageing population and reduce the country's widely criticised current
account surplus, according to the government's 1994 white paper on trade,
reports Michiyo Nakamoto from Tokyo.
Japan's current account surplus has largely been recycled overseas, but
given the rise in Japan's elderly population, the surplus should be invested
at home to create the national assets necessary to support future public
life, the white paper points out.
By 2025, the number of Japanese over 65 compared with those between 15 and
64 will rise to 43.2 per cent against 17.3 per cent in 1990, says the white
paper, published annually by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
Public infrastructure investment in Japan is still very low. Sewage
penetration, for example, is lower in Japan than in Singapore, which invests
41 per cent of GDP at home.
The white paper calls for greater investment in housing, public
infrastructure, including information infrastructure and in service
industries. Increased housing investment, in particular, should contribute
significantly to cutting the gap between savings and investments. It also
points out that price differentials between Japan and the rest of the world
stem not only from differences in quality and distribution costs but from
different business practices.
This has kept prices high even as the yen's value has been appreciating, the
white paper says, forcing Japanese companies to move manufacturing overseas.

<TEXT>
Mr Robert Malval, Haiti's acting prime minister, has denounced the country's
military rulers after six months of silence, Canute James and agencies
report from Kingston.
He called on Gen Raoul Cedras and his fellow officers, who have refused to
bow to international pressure, to resign and allow the return of Mr
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president who was overthrown and sent into exile
almost three years ago. 'You have locked our country in the darkness of
night,' an angry Mr Malval told Gen Cedras.
'The time has come for you to leave so that a new dawn may break for the
Haitian people. Morally, you are not worthy of the title of commander in
chief of the armed forces of Haiti.'
His attack followed the usurpation of his powers by Mr Emile Jonassaint, an
81-year-old judge installed by a small group of lawmakers as provisional
president last week. Mr Joussaint appointed a clique of extreme
right-wingers and nationalists to his cabinet on Monday.
In failing to name a premier, Mr Jonassaint assumed the duties of head of
state and head of government. Separating those powers was the chief intent
of Haiti's 1987 constitution, approved overwhelmingly by Haitians a year
after they rose up to end the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship.

The US held its position as the world's leading venue for international
conferences last year, with the UK replacing Spain in second place, said the
International Congress and Convention Association, writes Michael Skapinker,
Leisure Industries Correspondent.
The US had a 7.2 per cent share of international meetings with more than 100
participants in 1993.
The UK moved from 5th place in 1992 to second last year with 6.9 per cent.
Germany was third with 6.3 per cent, up from fourth in 1992. France fell
from third in 1992 to fourth last year with 5.6 per cent. Spain fell from
second in 1992 to fifth with 4.9 per cent.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Caribbean urged to continue reform / Review of the CDB
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean governments must continue to restructure their economies in order
to deal with rapid changes in the global environment, according to the
annual report of the Caribbean Development Bank, published this week.
In a review of its members' economies, the bank which is based in Barbados,
said that the medium-term prospects for Caribbean economies were not
encouraging due to increased pressure on both the private and public sectors
to become more open and more efficient in order to meet the demands of trade
liberalisation.
Without sustained growth in the industrialised economies and changes in
domestic economic policy, the Caribbean region can expect no better than the
moderate levels of growth which most countries in the region recorded last
year, the bank cautioned.
The bank said that whilst some of its borrowing members recorded relatively
high levels of growth last year, the majority turned in a disappointing
performance 'with growth remaining in the lower ranges.' Unemployment rates
stayed high and the fiscal situation of many governments remained tight.
Growth rates of between 7.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in gross domestic
product were recorded last year by some countries, including Guyana, the
Cayman Islands and Belize, the bank reported. Lower than expected earnings
from banana exports adversely affected growth in the Windward Islands of
Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent, the report continued.
Jamaica recorded low growth because of marginal expansion in bauxite and
agricultural commodities, while Trinidad and Tobago's economy contracted
because of the weak state of the international market for oil, the country's
main export.
'The resumption of economic growth in North America had a positive impact on
visitor arrivals in a number of member countries,' the report noted. While
most resort countries in the region benefited from the increase in stay over
visitors and cruise ship calls last year, the industry in the Bahamas
remained weak, the bank said.
The tourism sector will be among the first to reflect an improvement in the
resumption of growth in the main markets, the CDB predicted.
Fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate led to a decline in banana
production and exports, particularly from the Windward Islands. The industry
was affected by changes in banana marketing arrangements in Europe, 'which
will at the outset provide increased access for lower cost Latin American
fruit and eventually result in the phasing out of preferential market access
from traditional countries,' said the CDB.
Cumulative sugar production in the bank's members last year was 732,000
tonnes, three per cent less than 1992 production. The largest fall of 10 per
cent was in Barbados, while the biggest absolute decline was in Jamaica
where production fell 7,900 tonnes.
A fall in crude oil production in Trinidad and Tobago will continue, said
the bank, 'with the outlook for international prices not being particularly
encouraging given the inability of Opec members to limit output to agreed
production quotas, and given the likelihood of the eventual return of Iraqi
production to world markets.'
Weak international prices for aluminium depressed the mining and refining of
bauxite in Jamaica and Guyana last year, the report noted.
The bank concluded that the region is likely to find increasing difficultly
in obtaining external funding, citing the trend for traditional donors to
now consider what they perceive as more pressing needs in eastern Europe and
Africa.

FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Asia offers 'ride' for western exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asia could form a powerful trade bloc against the European Union and members
of the North American Free Trade Agreement if its goods were shunned by the
two groups, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, said last night.
In a warning against protectionism, Mr Goh criticised western politicians
and trade unionists who saw Asia's rapid economic expansion as a threat
rather than an opportunity. He urged industrialised nations to 'ride on the
growth of Asia' by exporting high-technology and high-quality goods.
Opening a conference on Asian business in Singapore, Mr Goh said that to
block Asia's emerging economies, especially China, from world markets would
force them to turn inwards, stunt their growth, lead to 'a more aggressive
and destabilising military posture', and threaten western assets in Asia.
Even a less confrontational western stance, with the EU looking inward and
Nafta looking only southward, would force Asian countries to trade
increasingly between themselves, Mr Goh said.
'Asia has the capital,' he said. 'It saves more than the rest of the world.
Its growth will be slowed, but it will not be stopped. An Asian trade bloc
is not an option of choice. But it is a viable option.'
Mr Goh joined the chorus of Asian leaders who have condemned western
attempts to curb imports from low-wage countries by linking workers' rights
to trade negotiations.
Among his few words of comfort for the west was the assertion that emerging
Asian economies were unlikely to run the sort of trade surpluses seen in
Japan and Taiwan, because countries such as China and India were not
suppressing consumer demand as Japan did in the early stages of development.
By the end of the decade, he said, east Asia could have an annual current
account deficit of Dollars 50bn.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Hong Kong talks on airport resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and China said yesterday their officials would meet on Friday to
discuss the financing of Hong Kong's airport project - the first such
meeting since August last year.
The talks will mark another step towards normalising Sino-UK discussions on
Hong Kong's future, although it is unlikely the two sides will be able to
announce a resolution to their two-year dispute about how to finance the
airport.
Since March there has been a noticeable move by the Chinese to separate
economic issues from those relating to Hong Kong's political development. It
remains unclear, however, whether China will want to agree financing before
the legislative council debates governor Chris Patten's political reform
bill at the end of June.
The government said yesterday it hoped the meeting of the airport committee
would lead to an early agreement on the project. It said it should now be
possible to make substantial progress following the useful and constructive
talks that have taken place in the past two months. At issue in Friday's
talks is the split between debt and equity for the airport and its
connecting railway. Together these two projects will cost about HKDollars
85bn (Pounds 7.3bn).
Two years ago the Hong Kong government hoped that all but HKDollars 16bn of
this sum could be raised in international debt markets. But in the face of
Chinese opposition the government retreated and has since offered to
increase its equity contribution to HKDollars 60bn.
Another issue which is important to China is the amount of land -
principally alongside the airport runway - which will be sold to finance
construction of the project. The Hong Kong government has maintained that
the staggered release of this land - about 60 hectares in all - should be
'additional' to the release of land governed by other Sino-British
agreements.
The Chinese appear to object to this, fearing that property prices might be
upset by the additional land release.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Korea N-plant visit to decide on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Atomic Energy Agency will begin a critical inspection
today of North Korean nuclear facilities that could prove to be a turning
point in the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
The outcome of the inspection will determine whether the US will press for
economic sanctions by the United Nations Security Council against the North
or hold a new round of high-level talks as demanded by Pyongyang.
The three-member IAEA team will try to fulfil two goals.
One is to determine whether the North has removed, without international
supervision, a substantial amount of the 8,000 fuel rods that power its 5MW
reactor, a violation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The North last week reported to the IAEA that it had started to replace some
'damaged' fuel rods, but the extent of refueling operation remains unknown.
The US is worried the unsupervised removal of the fuel rods would allow the
North to divert the nuclear fuel for the production of four or five atomic
devices.
Washington has warned that extensive removal of the fuel rods would force it
to ask the UN for economic sanctions.
The IAEA inspectors will also try to complete an examination of a suspected
nuclear processing plant that was blocked in March.
The IAEA has warned that if the inspection is not completed by mid-May, it
would also refer the nuclear dispute to the UN Security Council for action.
Analysts predict that the IAEA and North Korea may differ on the scope of
the new inspections as they have done over previous checks. But Pyongyang is
likely to make enough concessions to prevent the UN from taking up the
issue.
The US has promised if the current inspections are completed, it would
conduct another round of high-level talks with North Korea on possible
diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
Even if the new inspections reach a satisfactory conclusion, the dispute is
far from being solved.
North Korea is also barring the IAEA from access to two undeclared sites
that are believed to store nuclear waste. The IAEA wants to examine the
nuclear waste, in addition to the fuel rods, to determine whether the North
has previously diverted plutonium from its reactor for its suspected nuclear
weapons programme. The North may only allow inspection of the two undeclared
sites in return for concessions from the US.

FT  18 MAY 94 / LDP to try to unseat Japanese government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The likelihood of change of Japanese government this summer increased
yesterday when the main opposition party confirmed it would seek to bring
down the minority administration.
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, warned
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata he must resign or face a no-confidence vote as
soon as the budget for this year clears parliament.
The budget, delayed by an LDP boycott and the power struggle unleashed by
last month's resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister,
is now expected to pass parliament by mid-July.
Mr Kono's warning suggests for the first time that a previously undecided
LDP is ready for an election. Until yesterday, the Social Democratic party,
the second largest opposition group, was the only main party to call for an
early poll. The SDP hopes to regain some of the seats it lost in last July's
election, while the LDP seeks a comeback, after the end last summer of its
38 years in power.
'You should be fully aware that you do not have the mandate of the people.
This abnormal state of affairs must be normalised,' said Mr Kono yesterday.
The LDP and SDP together can easily outvote Mr Hata's five-party alliance.
The government commands just over 190 votes in the 511-seat lower house. If
he loses a no-confidence vote, Mr Hata must resign or call an election.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Harare sows seeds for an investment harvest / Review of the
progress and potential of an ambitious structural adjustment programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political transition in South Africa and economic reform in Zimbabwe are
transforming the regional business climate, suggesting that Zimbabwe's
investment promotion conference, starting in London tomorrow, will prove far
more successful than its predecessor five years ago.
Then, Zimbabwe had not embraced structural adjustment, and South Africa
appeared headed for long-running, bloody confrontation.
After a slow start in 1991, economic reform in Zimbabwe has accelerated over
the past 18 months with two substantial tranches of exchange control and
foreign payments liberalisation. This was complemented by price
deregulation, labour laws and investment regulations, the commercialisation
 -though not yet privatisation - of some state enterprises, the freeing of
interest rates and a partial exchange rate float.
In January, the Zimbabwe dollar was devalued by 17 per cent and quantitative
import controls were abolished. A two-tier exchange rate system was created
with exporters allowed to retain 60 per cent of their foreign earnings,
selling the balance to the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe at the
official exchange rate.
Initially, the free market rate traded at a discount of some 5 per cent
below the official rate of ZDollars 8 to the dollar, but the gap has since
narrowed to less than 1 per cent, and the market is to be unified later this
year when exporters will retain all their earnings and all current account
transactions will have been liberalised.
This cannot come too soon for some of the multinationals attending this
week's meeting. In an effort to attract new investment, Zimbabwe has -
mistakenly - favoured the relatively few newcomers (Tony O Reilly's Heinz
and Algy Cluff's gold mines being the two most notable) over the
long-standing players such as Unilever, Dunlop, Carnaud Metal Box, Barclays
and Standard Chartered Banks .
For the past decade, pre-independence investors were not allowed to remit
more than 25 per cent of after-tax profits, while new arrivals were allowed
50 per cent. These regulations have since been loosened allowing post-1993
investors 100 per cent repatriation, while existing companies are allowed to
remit 50 per cent of profits.
Zimbabwe is committed to levelling the field, almost certainly this year
which, with the eventual release of blocked funds, will stimulate increased
investment activity by existing companies. Portfolio investment was
liberalised last year when foreign investors were allowed to trade on the
Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. In the nine months since this reform took effect,
foreigners have injected some Dollars 80m into the market contributing to
the 300 per cent surge in share prices over the past year.
All this is very different from the 1980s when foreign direct investment
averaged a mere Dollars 20m a year. Inflows have since accelerated markedly
averaging Dollars 60m a year since 1990. Two big new projects are in the
pipeline; the Dollars 225m BHP-Utah platinum mine at Chegutu and a proposed
Hong Kong-financed airport hotel and casino close to Harare.
The Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIC), set up to facilitate and promote
investment, approved 843 projects worth some ZDollars 5.6bn (Dollars 1.4bn)
between 1989 and 1993. Of these, 100 were foreign and a further 159 were
joint-ventures, valued at Dollars 470m, though not all of this represented
foreign inflows.
In the first quarter of 1994, a further 67 projects were approved,
representing new investment of almost Dollars 200m, of which Dollars 63m was
foreign or joint-venture.
Zimbabwe needs much more; the most disturbing aspect of the ZIC numbers is
the number of jobs created. Investment of some Dollars 800m in the last two
and a half years has generated less than 35,000 new jobs.
With an annual net addition of about 200,000 school-leavers to the labour
market, the implication is that the country needs to invest nearly Dollars
5bn annually, or 25 per cent more than its GDP, merely to peg unemployment
at its present level of around 30 per cent. Clearly, that is not going to
happen, implying a combination of higher levels of unemployment and enhanced
reliance on the informal sector. Higher investment levels are also needed to
kick-start the sluggish economy.
Since independence in 1980, real GDP growth has fallen behind the 3.1 per
cent rate of population increase, expanding at 2.8 per cent annually. As a
result real income per head is lower than at independence and 16 per cent
below its peak of the mid-1970s. Assuming the economy can grow at a steady 5
per cent a year, it will take a decade to regain 1975 living standards.
Policy reform is a significant part of the solution, but weak commodity
prices, adverse weather conditions, and regional political instability have
left their mark on the economy. With commodity prices seemingly on the
upturn and the regional political environment better than any time for over
30 years, investment prospects have brightened considerably.
Regional investment should improve with the political climate, but there are
fears that investors, motivated as the International Finance Corporation
notes, by market size more than anything else, will plump for South Africa's
Dollars 112bn market rather than Zimbabwe's Dollars 4bn. For Pretoria's
neighbours, it is a swings and roundabouts situation.
Market size, infrastructure and logistics dictate that a stable South
Africa, accounting for more than 80 per cent of southern African GDP, will
attract the lion's share of new investment.
But Zimbabwe with its relatively efficient infrastructure, its plentiful
cheap labour and close proximity to the South African hub of Pretoria
Witwatersrand-Vereeniging, should be able to exploit new and different
market opportunities.
For this to happen Zimbabwean business will have to rethink its strategy,
seeking niche markets and going for joint-venture opportunities in alliances
with South African business rather than risking head-on competition.
None of this will happen without continuing, and urgent, policy reform and a
stronger commitment to an economy, that welcomes foreign capital and skills
and facilitates cross-border commerce and investment.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Yemenis in battle for control of key airbase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fighting intensified in Yemen yesterday around the strategic southern
airbase of al-Anad, 40km north of Aden, with northern forces again claiming
victory and southern troops insisting that they retained control.
The battle for al-Anad could decide the fate of Aden, according to military
analysts. Although the southern air force could deploy to other bases, the
fall of al-Anad would open the way for a direct assault on Aden, or enable
northern forces to lay siege to the city.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh would have to decide whether to use the threat
posed to Aden as a bargaining lever with southern leaders, or face the
inevitably high casualties resulting from an attempt to take the city.
Southern aircraft were reported to have flown repeated sorties yesterday
against northern troops on the approach to al-Anad. Captain Abdul Rahim
Qassem, speaking from a new rear southern defence line 18km south of the
base, claimed that the northern forces were being held up outside al-Anad.
'We have control of the base. They have not entered,' he said.
Southern military officials also said that fighting was raging on the
Zingibar front, 55km north-east of Aden. Northern forces appeared to be
preparing for an offensive from al-Anad and Zingibar.
A correspondent for Reuters reported southern soldiers as saying that the
northern troops were attacking in waves. 'They come like human waves. We
spray them with our guns but they keep coming back. They look like as if
they are drugged. They do not stop when we fire, they keep coming,' said one
soldier.
Northern shells were hitting areas 22km north of Aden, the closest so far to
the city.
Arab League mediators said on their return to Cairo from Yemen that northern
leaders had rejected their calls for a ceasefire and insisted that their
southern rivals should surrender.
Mr Mohammad Said al-Bereqdar, the league's assistant secretary-general, said
Mr Saleh opposed any ceasefire which allowed his southern opponents to
regroup and reinforce their armies.
The north was also demanding the surrender of southern leader Ali Salem

The Arab League delegation had been unable to visit southern Yemen during

FT  18 MAY 94 / Machinery order pick-up adds to recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tentative sign of Japanese economic recovery emerged yesterday with a 10.3
per cent increase in machinery orders from February to April. The
improvement suggests a three-year decline in capital investment by Japanese
industry is coming to an end, the government's Economic Planning Agency
said.
Private sector machinery orders fell by 0.2 per cent in April, compared with
the same month last year, a sharp slowdown on the 8.9 per cent annualised
decline reported in March.
This brings the growth in orders for the first quarter of this year to 6.6
per cent, from the final three months of 1993, well above government
forecasts. The agency warns it expects a sharp 13 per cent fall in the
current quarter, but this does not change its view that the worst, for
machinery orders, is over.
The same, however, cannot be said for corporate bankruptcies, which continue
to rise, according to the latest monthly check by Teikoku Databank, a credit
research agency.
The number of corporate collapses with debts of more than Y10m (Pounds
64,000) rose by 1.9 per cent to 1,176 last month, from April 1993, the 15th
month when they have stood at above 1,000.
Separately, Japan's leading companies plan to reduce the number of new
recruits next spring by 18.1 per cent, according to a survey of 723
employers by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic newspaper. That will the
fourth consecutive annual decline.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher (left), pictured yesterday with
Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini, was the first world statesman to visit
Jericho - seat of the new Palestinian autonomous area evacuated by Israel
last week, Julian Ozanne writes. Mr Christopher's visit was clearly made to
demonstrate US support for the Palestinian self-rule deal: 'One of the
reasons I came here is to make it clear to our Palestinian friends that they
are not alone in this endeavour and that we in the international community
will stand with them as they make their historic transition.'

China's prime minister Li Peng has maintained Beijing's tough stance on
human rights, accusing the US of giving undue weight to the views of a 'tiny
number' of dissident Chinese.
Mr Li told Mr Zbigniew Brezinski, the former US national security security
adviser, that China resented interference in its internal affairs and would
not yield to outside pressures.
The Chinese official was speaking just weeks before a deadline for President
Bill Clinton to decide whether to extend China's 'most favoured nation'
trading status in the US.
China, meanwhile, continues to exert pressure on its dissident community
with further detentions and little sign that its most prominent political
prisoner, Wei Jingsheng, is about to be released.
China yesterday briefly detained leading student dissident Wang Dan after he
met a US TV reporting team. He was released by Beijing police after being
held for an hour.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UN agrees new Rwandan force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations security council yesterday agreed unanimously to send up
to 5,500 peace-keeping troops to Rwanda, reversing a resolution last month
that withdrew most of a UN force of little more than half that number.
But the question last night was where the bulk of the troops would come
from, since no western country, including the US, appears willing to commit
contingents.
Furthermore, diplomats acknowledged that the force was unlikely to make much
impact on what the council's resolution termed the 'mindless violence and
carnage engulfing Rwanda'.
Estimates of deaths in 10 weeks of bloody conflict between Hutu and Tutsis
range from 200,000 to as many as 1m.
The US held up a council decision until the last minute, arguing that the
parties to the conflict had indicated no readiness to call a ceasefire or
even to agree to the UN operation.
These reservations, shared by some other western members, were a clear
backlash after the experience in Somalia which has coloured the Clinton
administration's response to all subsequent UN appeals for help. However,
the US is expected to provide some logistical support for what at best is
likely to be a mostly African army.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, has asked 40 African
states to provide troops. Ghana is considering whether to return 500 men it
evacuated from Rwanda last month at the height of the ethnic slaughter.
Nigeria and Tanzania are understood to have offered troops, and Senegal and
Zambia are reported to be considering whether to send soldiers.
In deference to the US, the council will review the situation in Rwanda
after the first deployment phase is completed, including sending in 150
military observers.
Pentagon specialists have warned UN officials that the organisation was
under intense scrutiny by the US Congress and that another failure, such as
that in Somalia, would severely discredit the UN as a peace-keeper.
Under an expanded mandate, the UN force must try to protect displaced
civilians at risk, including refugees and displaced persons, establish and
maintain secure humanitarian areas and secure and support relief operations.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Shoddy meets quality in Transylvania: The bitter contest
between the old and new at a bankrupt Romanian factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A postcard pretty town in the heart of mountainous Transylvania, Codlea is
an unlikely setting for the conflict at the centre of eastern Europe's
economic transformation.
However, over the past few months this sleepy Romanian town has seen a
contest pitting efficient, often brutal, capitalism with its promise of
future prosperity against a rickety, unproductive, centrally planned
economy, with its guarantee of a job but a dismal standard of living for
everyone.
For many of the individual actors, the struggle at the Magura Codlea
furniture factory which employs 1,600 of the town's 25,000 inhabitants, has
been a personal tragedy. One victim was the factory director who committed
suicide when the conflict began to heat up late last year. For the workers,
it has meant coming to terms with western standards of quality and
efficiency after four decades of communism.
The suicide came after the company, privatised at the end of 1992 via a
management buy-out, lost its western export markets, racked up a Dollars 9m
debt and was about to be foreclosed by its creditors, IKEA, the Swedish
furniture retailer, and the Ion Tiriac Bank, a private local bank founded by
the Romanian-born tennis star.
The man now at the forefront of the battle is Mr Hakan Gunnerling, a Swedish
specialist in turning around failing companies, who was sent in by the
creditors to coax or coerce the Magura Codlea factory into capitalist ways.
'Nothing surprises me any more,' says Mr Gunnerling, who, in less than a
year in Romania, has suffered the suicide of a colleague, several pugnacious
strikes - including occupation of the factory by protesting workers - and
sustained attacks in the national media. He has also been advised to hire a
personal bodyguard.
But there is still a certain, almost innocent, western bewilderment in his
explanation that 'now we have the right machinery, we have the necessary
customer, but we just don't have the right people'.
Mr Gunnerling's impatience with Magura Codlea's shoddy socialist past is
apparent the moment he walks into the factory's meeting room. This is one of
Romania's premier furniture factories but visitors must choose their seats
with care because some of the chairs in the room, built in the bad old days
of Nicolae Ceaucescu's socialist autarky, collapse under the slightest
pressure.
'To have chairs like this in a factory which has been producing furniture
for 100 years, it's so awful that its almost funny,' Mr Gunnerling says.
Standing in silent reproach along the walls of the room are the sturdy,
clean-lined bookshelves which, under Mr Gunnerling's stern supervision, the
factory has been producing for IKEA.
IKEA, which has been purchasing furniture from Magura Codlea for more than
two decades and is the factory's principal customer, saw the privatisation
as an opportunity to bring all the factory's production up to western
standards.
According to Mr Gunnerling, Magura Codlea's furniture, in true socialist
fashion, 'could look good when it was packed, but when it arrived at the
end-user it was scratched'.
So Mr Gunnerling, who arrived in Transylvania in October, summoned a team of
IKEA engineers and set about teaching Magura Codlea's workers quality
control and training them in the use of new equipment from IKEA, to be paid
back with future exports.
But IKEA's much-vaunted insistence on high standards ran into the resistance
of a workforce trained in a system in which, as the east European joke goes,
'they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work'. As Mr Gunnerling
discovered, 'not everyone is able to learn to run complicated machinery or
to take responsibility for his work'.
For many of Magura Codlea's workers it was bad enough to be required to make
bookshelves in which the screws routinely matched the holes, but the final
straw was when Mr Gunnerling subjected the company's finances to scrutiny.
He made a discovery which had been obscured by Romania's Byzantine
accounting standards - the company was broke.
'I pointed out to the board of directors that the company is losing money
and will continue to lose money for some time,' Mr Gunnerling said. 'By
western standards, it was bankrupt, and in these circumstances it was normal
for the creditors to take control.'
For Magura Codlea's workers, the creditors' seizure of the company's shares
last December was going too far. 'They still believe they own the factory,'
Mr Gunnerling said. 'Here we have 1,600 directors with 1,600 ideas of how
the company should be run.'
Protesting that the factory had been 'stolen' - by the managers and the
creditors - in mid-January Magura Codlea's employees began a series of
strikes. At the height of the stand-off, Mr Gunnerling told workers
assembled in the factory canteen that their strike was illegal and that
every one was fired, unprecedented in a country where inefficient state
companies still keep thousands of surplus workers on their books.
Mr Gunnerling has since stepped back from that drastic measure but still
plans to lay-off 300 this summer and thinks that 700 is the optimal number
of employees. Production has resumed, although new strikes are always
possible.
The ex-communist government, surprising its critics and acting against the
instincts of many of its ministers, has resisted the temptation to
re-nationalise the factory or to prevent the creditors from taking direct
control.
But Magura Codlea still has too many workers with too few skills, and a
reluctant Mr Gunnerling fears that to maintain the fragile peace in his
workshops he may have to sack the remaining individuals behind the
management buy-out.
It is not a peace treaty, only a ceasefire, with compromises on both sides.
But Magura Codlea has already become a pioneer in a country still only half
way down the road to capitalism.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor, was in Washington yesterday, meeting
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, and Ms Joan Spero,
undersecretary of state for international economic affairs, in pursuit of
his candidacy to be the next director general of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development. His mission is to try to prise loose
crucial US backing for Mr Don Johnston, the former Canadian minister. Other
contenders are Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the incumbent, who is seeking a third
five-year term, and Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry
official.
The next regular meeting of OECD ministers early next month in Paris is
charged with the task of achieving a consensus on the succession, though
Lord Lawson thinks this remains unlikely unless the US changes its mind.
Support appears evenly divided between the former chancellor, Mr Johnston
and Mr Paye, with Mr Schomerus trailing. Lord Lawson wishes to give the OECD
a higher profile in international economic affairs, an argument that might
appeal to the US. He sees the organisation as a key ingredient in the
international policy-making network, along with the Group of Seven and the
nascent World Trade Organisation.

Poor access to finance means that Europe's small and medium sized
enterprises are unlikely to provide a solution to the European Union's
unemployment problem, according to a survey yesterday. Tipped by the
European Commission to become the main source of jobs as European economies
recover, more than half of Europe's smaller companies are not confident that
they have sufficient finance to support their plans, according to a study of
5,000 companies in the 12 member states plus Austria, Sweden and Malta.
Funding is most precarious in France, Greece, Italy, Spain and Austria but
satisfactory in Belgium, Denmark and Holland. The survey showed that most
smaller company finance is short-term. In the UK, 70 per cent fund their
businesses with an overdraft, compared with only 37 per cent in Germany
where loans are preferred. By contrast, more than 80 per cent of German
companies favour loans of two years or more, against only 40 per cent in the
UK.

Air Inter, the French domestic airline, was brought to a virtual standstill
yesterday as unions launched a one-day strike in protest over the
liberalisation of the French airline market. Unions said the introduction of
competition on some of their most profitable routes would compound the
financial pressures facing the loss-making airline. They demanded that Air
Inter be given greater management autonomy from Air France, its state-owned
parent company, and be allowed to operate on profitable European routes.
Last month, the European Commission ordered the French government to open
routes between London and Orly airport in Paris to competition, and said the
lucrative Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles routes must be opened to rivals
within six months. Mr Michel Bernard, president of Air Inter, said the
relationship between Air Inter and Air France would be reorganised during
the summer. An airline official said it was important the domestic airline
remained part of the Air France group, but increased competition on some of
its profitable routes should be compensated by a relaxation in requirements
to serve unprofitable routessuch as between Paris and Quimper, in Brittany.

The minister in charge of debt negotiations with Russia's sovereign and
commercial creditors said yesterday he believed he would conclude deals with
the Paris and London Clubs. However, interest repayments on the Dollars
80bn-plus debt could be no more than Dollars 4bn this year. This would be
the limit the budget could stand, said Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier
for the economy, but it represents only a fraction of the total debt service
obligations for this year. According to the US investment bank J P Morgan,
Russia owes around Dollars 21bn this year, of which Dollars 6.7bn is
interest and Dollars 14.6bn is principal.
Mr Shokhin said Russia had asked for a delay in meeting the Paris Club in
order to work out 'a new draft on repayments' for the present year. The
talks are due to begin in Paris on June 2, and Mr Shokhin said 'we would
like to solve the issue before the (Group of Seven) Naples summit' in July.
His optimism stems from the agreement in March between the Russian
government and the International Monetary Fund on the second tranche of a
Dollars 3bn loan - a move which has increased international confidence in
the government's policies.

A standby loan agreement between Turkey and the International Monetary Fund
seems imminent after the head of the Fund's negotiating mission to Turkey
yesterday publicly endorsed the Ankara government's austerity programme. Mr
Thomas Reichmann, concluding a two-week mission to Turkey, said he was
recommending the programme to the IMF board. Agreement on a letter of intent
could be in place in early July, paving the way for immediate disbursement
of up to Dollars 250m to support the balance of payments. The one-year
standby, which depends on Turkey's quota with the Fund, is likely to be up
to Dollars 500m.
Turkey's austerity programme envisages slashing the budget deficit by half
to TL93,000bn (Pounds 1.87bn) in 1994, through wage restraint, official
commodity price rises, new taxes, and faster privatisation. Turkey will
repay around Dollars 9.1bn in 1994 on its medium and long term debt, in
principal and interest. It is looking for Dollars 3.7bn in new drawings in
1994, according to the State Planning Organisation. A Fund accord is vital
to restore international confidence in the Turkish economy, allowing a
return to commercial debt markets, and is a precondition for World Bank
structural adjustment loans, now under negotiation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's jobless rate, the highest in the European Union, reached a record
24.6 per cent in the first quarter, according to the National Statistics
Institute's latest survey. But the economy ministry said unemployment had
probably peaked and pointed to signs of improvement in the trend. Most
experts believe the quarterly survey overstates the number of jobless but
provides a better reflection of trends than registered unemployment, which
declined slightly in March and April to stand at 17.8 per cent. The
first-quarter survey figure of 3.79m unemployed was 110,000 up on the
previous quarter and 492,000 more than a year earlier. But the ministry said
this partly reflected new arrivals on the job market, especially women. The
ministry predicted employment would start to rise as the economy picked up.
David White, Madrid.
Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said the government expected a
current account balance of payments surplus of between DKr28bn and DKr30bn
(Pounds 2.86bn-Pounds 3.07bn) in 1994 compared with a previous forecast of
DKr24.6bn.
Finland's jobless rate fell to 19.5 per cent in April from 20.8 per cent in
March, the labour ministry said.

infighting between the vast presidential staff and the government. Mr
Shakhrai left the door open for his return by saying in his resignation
letter that he left without having 'taken offence.' He resigned after Mr

launched a concerted attack on the state prosecutor in charge of the
Volkswagen-General Motors industrial espionage probe.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, Social Democrat premier of Lower Saxony and effective
holder of the state's 20 per cent stake in VW, complained of an alleged lack
of fairness and the use of 'questionable' methods in the investigation. His
attack was based on weekend reports that lawyers working for Adam Opel, GM's
German subsidiary, last year hired private detectives to stalk suspect VW
employees - all formerly employed by the US group - and used subterfuge to
win their confidence and gain access to their private property.
Meanwhile, lawyers representing Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriotua, GM's
former global purchasing chief, and colleagues who followed him to VW, said
they planned to investigate the methods used on behalf of the prosecution.
Yesterday's events represented the most vigorous retaliation so far against
the US-based GM group's allegations of the theft of masses of corporate
secrets by Mr Lopez and his associates.
'We will carefully examine the extent to which the state prosecutors' office
tolerated or had knowledge of inadmissible deceptions,' the lawyers said in
a statement issued by VW.
Referring to 'indications' that the Opel detectives had used subterfuge in
their probes, the lawyers said they would also examine the extent to which
the private detectives' methods might have prejudiced the findings of the
official probe.
The statement from Mr Schroder seemed aimed at exerting pressure on the
Social Democrat government in the state of Hesse, Opel's German base and the
seat of the criminal investigations, to intervene. The lawyers' intervention
appeared to signal the start of legal retaliation. While the Darmstadt
prosecutors' office issued a firm denial of the VW lawyers' allegations, the
events may present a chance for VW to open a new front in the legal battle
between the two companies, which has already lasted more than a year.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Italy's privatisation plan set to go ahead: Government has
ruled out delay in flotation of insurance organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's new government has given its strongest signal yet that it will
honour the country's wide-ranging privatisation programme by pressing ahead
with the flotation timetable of Ina, the insurance institute. Shares are due
to be placed on the market at the end of June.
This emerged from a meeting yesterday between Mr Lamberto Dini, Treasury
minister and former director-general of the Bank of Italy, and Mr Giancarlo
Pagliarini, budget minister.
Complex problems surrounding the privatisation of Ina have led to
speculation about delays. Though aware of the difficulties in meeting the
June 26 date set for Ina by the previous government, the Treasury-led
privatisation team is anxious to demonstrate the new government's commitment
to privatisation. They are playing down statements by the populist Northern
League, a key partner in Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, that there
should be a month's delay in all privatisation plans to assess strategy.
Two of the three ministries responsible for privatisation - budget and
industry - are controlled by League ministers. But both have distanced
themselves from the party's call. Both, however, are anxious to avoid
repeating the concentration of control achieved directly and indirectly by
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, in the sale of Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Credito Italiano.
The neo-fascist MDI/National Alliance, Mr Berlusconi's other main government
partner, has so far refrained from imposing its long-standing 'corporatist'
ideas of state ownership. The privatisation process in fact seeks to
dismantle many of the institutions, including Ina, which were set up during
the fascist era.
Mr Berlusconi, in outlining his government's policy programme to the senate
on Monday, promised to accelerate privatisation in the first 100 days of his
government. He singled out Ina, Stet (telecoms), Enel (electricity) and Eni
(oil and gas). All were on the former government's privatisation list, with
Enel and Stet scheduled for the autumn after the latter has reorganised the
state's telecommunications assets under one holding, Telecom Italia.
The opposition has latched on to the omissions in his programme. He
mentioned nothing, for instance, about Alitalia, the national airline, which
has just begun to discuss a radical restructuring programme with the unions
involving cutting a quarter of the workforce and a L1,500bn (Pounds 626m)
capital injection.
Alitalia will test the government's unity both over any confrontation with
the unions and on privatisation. The League and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia
are happy to see the airline privatised with the government retaining a
golden share. The MSI regards the airline as a strategic asset and would be
extremely hostile to significant foreign stake. The objection to foreign
control could apply to Krupp's move to bid for the special steels side of
Ilva, the state steel group.
A broader issue to be tackled within the next few days is the fate of Iri,
the giant state holding. The government's enthusiasm for privatisation
renders Iri increasingly obsolete. Prof Romano Prodi, brought back as
chairman a year ago, is reportedly ready to resign because of differences
over the holding's future.
He was noticeably absent from discussions earlier this week on the
reorganisation of Telecom Italia, which is a key part of the Iri empire and
accounts for an important part of its debt.
The Iri board tomorrow considers the 1993 accounts, which are expected to
show a loss of L10,000bn and debts of L75,000bn.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Pressures on drachma send rates up again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE and AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greek interest rates surged again yesterday as pressure on the drachma
continued, but the currency held its ground against both the D-Mark and the
US dollar.
The three-month interbank lending rate averaged 77 per cent, up from 48.5
per cent on Monday, while the one-month rate reached 100 per cent.
Dealers reiterated that devaluation could not be ruled out, believing
pressure on the drachma would resume once interest rates started to decline,
even if depreciation were speeded up in the meantime. Said one: 'These rates
can't be sustained beyond the end of the month. The drachma may be allowed
to slip 5 per cent until then, but the speculators will still be waiting.'
The drachma weakened only slightly against the D-Mark, closing at Dr148.3
compared with Dr148.2 on Monday. It was unchanged against the dollar, at
Dr247.9.
Government officials voiced relief that the threat of a devaluation
immediately after curbs on short-term capital movement were lifted last
weekend had been averted. They said that new measures to reduce the budget
deficit, including an expanded privatisation programme and a tougher
crack-down on tax evasion, would be announced by next week.
'The speculative pressure has been less than we expected,' one adviser said.
'The crucial matter now is to reinforce revenue-raising measures and gain
policy credibility.'
However, there was little indication that confidence in the drachma was
being maintained. Two new issues of Ecu- and dollar-linked bonds at higher
interest rates, aimed at attracting funds from overseas investors to boost
the foreign exchange reserves, raised less than anticipated. According to
initial estimates, they raised a total of Dollars 250m in funds from abroad,
against a target of Dollars 500m. The government extended the subscription
period for a second day.
Despite the liberalisation of short-term capital movement, Greek investors
may still have difficulty moving funds to other European Union countries.
The complex procedures laid down by the central bank are designed to prevent
rapid capital outflows by deterring investors from exporting money earned on
the flourishing black economy much of which is currently funnelled into
tax-free government bonds.
According to the new Bank of Greece regulations, transfers of more than
Ecu2,000 (Pounds 1,540) must be accompanied by the sender's tax details.
Nearly Dr1bn (Pounds 2.7m) worth of state bonds were claimed yesterday to
have disappeared from the Bank of Greece and officials fear they may have
already been encashed, AP reports from Athens.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Russian minister warns on debt interest payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The minister in charge of debt negotiations with Russia's sovereign and
commercial creditors said yesterday he believed he would conclude deals with
the Paris and London Clubs. However, interest repayments on the Dollars
80bn-plus debt could be no more than Dollars 4bn this year.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for the economy, said Russia had asked
for a delay in meeting the Paris Club in order to work out 'a new draft on
repayments' for the present year. The talks are due to begin in Paris on
June 2, and Mr Shokhin said 'we would like to solve the issue before the
(Group of Seven) Naples summit' in July.
His optimism stems from the agreement in March between the Russian
government and the International Monetary Fund on the second tranche of a
Dollars 3bn loan - a move which has increased international confidence in
the government's policies.
However, the Dollars 4bn which Mr Shokhin said would be the limit the budget
could stand represents only a fraction of the total debt service obligations
for the present year. According to the US investment bank J P Morgan, Russia
owes around Dollars 21bn this year, of which Dollars 6.7bn is interest and
Dollars 14.6bn is principal.
Mr Shokhin's forecast came amid further dire warnings about Russia's
economic plight. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, who resigned yesterday as a deputy
premier, said the government would not survive a continued crisis on
non-payment of wages.
Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs,
said the civic accord on political behaviour signed recently by most parties
and associations would be valueless without a turn upwards in the economy.
Production in the first quarter had fallen by a third in Moscow alone
compared with a year ago.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice party and former first deputy
premier, said in Izvestiya that Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party, was a 'great threat' to Russia's
fragile democracy. In the same newspaper, Mr Boris Fyodorov, head of the
December 12 party and former deputy premier for finance, said 'the very
statehood of Russia is under deadly threat'.

FT  18 MAY 94 / France announces partial pull-out of troops from Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France said yesterday it planned to withdraw more than 2,000 of its troops
assigned to the United Nations in ex-Yugoslavia by the end of this year,
while still remaining the largest single provider of peacekeeping forces
there.
The decision was abruptly announced by Mr Francois Leotard, the defence
minister, on French radio yesterday before UN commanders and allies had been
informed. The foreign ministry was quick to add that the partial pull-out
might be reversed if there was a diplomatic breakthrough in the desultory
peace talks in the region.
These were being further threatened yesterday. Amid reports of heavy
fighting between Serb and Moslem forces in north-eastern Bosnia, and a Serb
artillery attack on Tuzla airport, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
the international mediators, met President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in
Belgrade to try to push forward the peace process.
After discussing Gorazde, a UN 'safe area', and the Bosnian Serb refusal to
comply with the terms of the Nato ultimatum calling for their withdrawal
from the zone, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg headed off to meet Bosnian Serb
leaders in Zvornik, a Serb-held town in eastern Bosnia.
France had already announced in March the departure next month of 900 troops
from the Glina region of Krajina. But Mr Leotard disclosed yesterday that
the 1,350-strong French battalion around Bihac in western Bosnia would leave
in November, leaving some 4,500 French 'blue helmets' on the soil of
ex-Yugoslavia.
In advance of last Friday's meeting with US, Russian and European Union
peace mediators, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, warned that 'the
moment of choice is approaching', and that France would only maintain its
effort 'if all our main partners show the same determination and are ready
to make a sufficient commitment'.
A defence ministry official said yesterday the latest French announcement
was directed not only at the warring parties but also 'the American and
Russians who do not seem to share the sense of urgency which we and the
British have, because of our sizeable forces on the ground'.
France's general military strategy has been to reinforce, for reasons of
safety and efficiency, its presence in Sarajevo, where in fact it added a
third battalion in March. But the defence official said there was a further
specific reason to pull out of Bihac.
'There, we have found ourselves diverted from our original humanitarian
mission because we have been caught in the middle between two factions of
Moslems,' he said.
Meanwhile, Serbian radio said there was heavy fighting to the north-east,
with Moslem forces suffering heavy losses.
But local witnesses said Moslem forces had launched an offensive, with the
Serbs taking serious casualties.
They said that Moslem forces had seized two out of three strategic heights
from where Serb forces previously used artillery to bombard Tuzla, the
second biggest Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east. UN monitors
yesterday reported Serb shelling of Tuzla and its airfield.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Fed raises key interest rates: Markets rally as US central
bank moves to tighten monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a decisive tightening of US
monetary policy by raising two key short-term interest rates by half a
point.
The Fed increased its target for the federal funds rate from 3.75 per cent
to 4.25 per cent. It also announced the first increase in the symbolically
important discount rate in more than five years - from 3 per cent to 3.5 per
cent.
The central bank said the increase in rates was designed 'to maintain
favourable trends in inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion'.
Leading commercial banks responded by announcing a half point increase in
prime lending rates from 6.75 per cent to 7.25 per cent. The increase in
prime rates will raise the cost of a wide range of loans to consumers and
small businesses.
After an anxious morning awaiting a decision from the Fed, Wall Street
responded positively to the rate increases, which were at the top end of
market expectations. Many analysts expected a half point increase in the
discount rate but some thought the federal funds rate would be raised by
only a quarter point.
In late New York trading, bond prices were up nearly two points, pushing the
yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond down to 7.268 per cent. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 49.11 up at 3,720.61. The dollar was
firm against the D-Mark.
Bond prices surged partly because the increase in rates was accompanied by
an official statement that appeared to indicate that the Fed believes it is
now close to achieving its goal of a 'neutral' monetary policy - aimed
neither at expansion nor contraction.
After three earlier quarter-point increases in short-term rates, yesterday's
actions 'substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation that
prevailed throughout 1993,' the Fed said. In financial markets this was
interpreted as meaning the Fed will not push short-term interest rates much
higher for several months. By creating a 'breathing space' it may hope bond
prices will stabilise.
For practical purposes the increase in the federal funds rate was the most
significant of yesterday's rate increases. This is the rate at which banks
lend overnight to each other and acts as a floor for short-term rates
throughout the economy.
The discount rate is the notional rate at which the Fed lends to banks. But
little lending actually occurs at this rate. Moves in the discount rate,
however, have an important symbolic impact by underlining the Fed's
determination to shift the stance of monetary policy.
The Fed's five-strong board of governors voted unanimously for the discount
rate increase, which had been requested by 11 of 12 regional Fed presidents.
Ms Laura Tyson, the White House chief economist, said the administration
neither endorsed nor criticised the Fed's action. It was the Fed's
prerogative to take action to secure a 'sustained expansion with low
inflation'.
The main rationale for yesterday's rate increases was to slow the rate of
economic growth and thus prevent an eventual increase in inflation if the
economy hits capacity constraints. Rapid increases in employment since the
beginning of the year have indicated that growth is running well above the
economy's long-run potential rate of expansion.
But the Fed rate increase was also seen by analysts as an attempt to help
stabilise the dollar on foreign exchange markets.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Ministers poised to agree Post Office sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is poised to press ahead with the sale of 51 per cent of
Royal Mail and Parcelforce, ending months of speculation about the Post
Office's future.
The plan - under which Post Office Counters, which runs 19,000 sub-post
offices, would remain in public hands - has emerged as the front runner
among a series of options to be discussed by senior cabinet ministers
tomorrow.
A decision to proceed with the sale, which has been billed as the last big
privatisation, could raise up to Pounds 2bn, probably via a share issue, but
would be certain to unleash a political storm.
Last night opposition politicians, union leaders and some Tory backbenchers
opposed such a move. Even Lady Thatcher baulked at privatising the Royal
Mail in 1987 when she was prime minister.
By devising a compromise short of outright privatisation the government
hopes to win over the large number of Tory MPs who have expressed concern
about the impact of a sale on Britain's rural post office network. The plan
is understood to take account of extensive consultations between Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Conservative backbenchers,
during the government's 22-month Post Office review.
There is a possibility ministers may delay a final decision until later in
the year on the grounds that more public consultation is needed. Some
ministers would prefer to limit the sale to 49 per cent of the Post Office's
letters and parcels arms.
The Conservative party's manifesto for the 1992 general election commits it
to maintaining a nationwide network of post offices and a universal delivery
service within a uniform price structure.
Senior Post Office executives have been keen for some time to proceed with a
partial privatisation, partly to facilitate the organisation's access to
private finance. Earlier this month, Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive,
revealed that the organisation had made a record operating profit last year.
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers
said last night the proposal meant Britain could 'wave goodbye' to the best
Post Office in the world. He predicted it would mean 'electoral suicide' for
the government.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative MP for Macclesfield, said he would
not support the measure unless given a '100-per cent guarantee' that the
government would hold on to its remaining 49 per cent stake.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Lloyd's reports loss of Pounds 2.05bn: Increase in reserves
to meet US liability claims was 'single largest factor' in result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's, the London insurance market, yesterday reported a loss of Pounds
2.05bn for its 1991 year of account, bringing cumulative losses since 1988
to more than Pounds 7bn.
An increase in reserves to meet US liability claims, mainly from asbestos,
pollution and other health hazards, was the single largest factor in the
result, according to Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman.
Mr Rowland said the loss would put further strain on Names, the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market, but dismissed fears
that it would affect its ability to continue trading.
'Lloyd's has had terrible losses but we will trade forward as certainly
tomorrow as we have for the last 300 years,' he said.
The market, which reports its results three years in arrears, softened the
impact on Names by taking into account some Pounds 533m of so-called 'double
counting' for the first time.
This occurs when Names who have made losses make claims of their own
against:
'stop-loss' policies (which provide cover for losses over pre-set limits),
'errors and omissions' policies (which give cover if agents are successfully
sued for negligence), or
'estate protection policies' (which cover the losses of deceased Names).
The elimination of double-counting also allowed Lloyd's to reduce its 1990
loss, reported last June, by Pounds 596m to Pounds 2.32bn.
Lloyd's will allow Names to borrow against profits, which the market expects
to make this year.
Sharp rises in insurance rates over the last two years are allowing most
syndicates to underwrite profitably, with profits also expected for the 1993
year.
Managing agents, who administer syndicates, are being encouraged to defer
cash calls when they have no immediate need for funds. Even so, Mr Rowland
conceded that the market would call cash 'of the order of Pounds 1.6bn to
Pounds 1.7bn' this year. There are fears that many Names, especially those
who are taking legal action to recover their losses, may be neither willing
nor able to pay.
'The sums needed are usually only obtained with a mask, a gun and a getaway
car,' said Mr Tom Benyon, director of the Society of Names, which represents
loss-makers. 'The 'cannot and will not' losses will have to be picked up by
other Names with the deepest pockets,' he added.

FT  18 MAY 94 / UK's gin drinkers prefer the hard stuff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems the British gin-and-tonic drinker knows what's what.
When some UK distillers sought to improve their margins last year by
watering down the strength of their domestic gins from 40 to 37.5 per cent
alcohol by volume, Allied-Lyons stuck to its guns. It maintained the full
strength of its Beefeater brand.
The dilution saved competitors like Guinness, which produces the market
leader, Gordon's, about 34p a bottle, or Pounds 4.16 a case in excise duty.
Most other gins, including Gilbey's, White Satin and Booth's, followed suit.
But some G&amp;T drinkers, who are estimated to account for about 70 per cent of
gin bought in the UK, decided to stick with the hard stuff.
Beefeater's volume sales have jumped by 25 per cent, despite its premium
price.
Its market share increased last year from 5.6 per cent to 6.6 per cent,
while Gordon's share slipped from 48 to 47 per cent. The overall market fell
by 4 per cent.

FT  18 MAY 94 / Schneider creditors face Pounds 1.8bn losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank creditors to Germany's failed Jurgen Schneider property group stand to
lose up to DM4.5bn (Pounds 1.8bn) - nearly all the DM5bn of debts
outstanding and nearly double the initial estimates when the company
collapsed early last month.
Mr Gerhard Walter, the administrator in charge of the group's bankruptcy
proceedings, said the 121 properties owned by Schneider had a market value
of only DM3bn to DM3.5bn.
He was speaking after the first meeting of creditors to the Schneider group
since it filed for bankruptcy.
The first official estimate of Schneider's deficit suggests that banks are
set to lose far more than was believed in the immediate aftermath of the
collapse. It was then thought that banks would lose a maximum of half of
their outstanding loans.
The company's head, Mr Jurgen Schneider, has been missing since just before
the company's collapse.
Although the figures confirm the Schneider case as the worst property
collapse in Germany since the second world war, bankers said that the
estimates and the assumptions behind them may be unduly pessimistic.
Losses will not crystallise for years, if at all, until such time as the
Schneider properties are sold.
Mr Walter said in calculating the deficit, he had taken into account the
further cash the banks will have to invest to bring the properties into
marketable condition, as well as rolled-up unpaid interest which will
accumulate on the outstanding debts.
The 15 largest properties will need a further DM1bn spending on them over
the next two years to bring them to completion. He estimated that a second
tier of properties would need further expenditure of DM600m to DM650m.
Rolled-up interest would amount to a further DM1bn.
If this is deducted from the group's remaining financial resources, the
total potential exposure mounts to DM7.5bn.
The deficit is the difference between the DM7.5bn and the DM3bn to DM3.5bn
which could be raised from the sale of the properties.
Mr Walter said the calculations were based on a further deterioration of the
German property market over the next two years.
The scale of the deficit is such that craftsmen and trade creditors stand to
lose up to DM250m owed to them by the Schneider group. Individual banks,
however, have agreed to complete Schneider developments and have promised to
pay off trade creditors.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Telecoms groups eye India: Liberalisation plans leave some
tangled lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nagarajan Vittal, chairman of the Indian government's Telecommunications
Commission, reads a letter handed to him by a secretary. It is an appeal
from a VIP for two telephone lines. 'Tell him he can have one. He can't have
two,' says Mr Vittal, handing back the letter and moving on to the next
item.
It is a measure of the shortage of telephone lines in India that the
telecommunications department's top civil servant spends time allocating
individual connections. 'I have to play God here,' says Mr Vittal, 'in big
things and in small.'
If Mr Vittal, a strong advocate of pro-market reform, has his way, in a few
years the telecommunications commission's chairman will not have to help
VIPs secure priority lines. Last week the government approved a new
telecommunications policy, designed to provide telephones on demand by means
of a huge expansion of the telephone network.
Since the government cannot fund this transformation, it is ending the state
monopoly of basic telephone services and inviting private companies,
including foreign groups, to invest. Potential investors have welcomed the
news but have said that much will depend on how changes are implemented. If
bureaucrats drag their feet, as they have in the past, then Mr Vittal and
his successors could still be dispensing VIP connections well into the next
century.
With only eight lines per thousand people, India has one of the least
developed telephone networks in the world; China has 17 per 1,000 people,
Malaysia has 130 and the global average is 100 lines. The country needs
telephones, not only to fulfil its aim of increasing international trade and
investment but also to provide a basic domestic communications network.
Until last week, the government's aim was to increase the number of lines
from 5.8m in early 1992 to 13.3m by the end of the current five-year plan in
March 1997. But this would have left about 2.5m people still on the waiting
list, so the target has been raised to 10m new lines.
The government is relying on private companies to raise much of the extra
Rs230bn (Pounds 4.8bn) it needs on top of Rs330bn ear-marked from public
funds for 1992-97. Even before last week's announcement, private groups,
including foreign companies, submitted 21 plans for telephone networks
together worth Dollars 4bn.
Among the foreign companies are industry leaders such as US West, AT&amp;T, and
Motorola of the US, Siemens of Germany, and Japan's Fujitsu. Ms Boli
Medappa, director of international projects at US West, which plans to
invest up to Dollars 1bn in basic services, says: 'The new policy will
stimulate the rapid expansion of communications networks.'
But it will be difficult to meet the government's demanding timetable, given
the department's past record in accommodating the private sector. With 46
trade unions, representing 470,000 workers, the telecommunications
department has long been suspicious of changes which curb its influence.
Since 1992, when value-added services such as cellular telephones and voice
mail were liberalised, the department has been entrusted with handling
potential competitors from the private sector.
The result has been confusion and delay. Cellular telephones contract awards
made in October 1992 have been challenged by unsuccessful bidders in a case
now before the Supreme Court.
As Mr Amit Sharma, Motorola's executive director for south Asia, says: 'Much
depends on the speed and transparency with which the (new) policy is
executed. Hopefully, the problems and delays that have occurred in licensing
of value-added services will not be repeated now.'
The prospects are not good. The department's trade unions lobbied against
the early entry of private companies and found an ally in Mr Sukh Ram, the
telecommunications minister, who argued with Mr Vittal over the admission of
private companies.
The result is a compromise; while private companies are being admitted, the
department will be responsible for overseeing their entry, acting as both a
competitor in providing services and as a regulator. The unions successfully
resisted plans for splitting the department into a state-owned corporation
and a separate regulatory body.
Mr Vittal yesterday disclosed plans to divide the department into service
and regulatory divisions, and, as head of the department, he alone would
have authority in both areas. Mr Vittal said detailed guidelines would be
laid down soon for the operation of private companies.
These will include a requirement that companies operate in both urban and
rural areas and that tariffs and arrangements for sharing revenue with the
telecommunications department be approved by the government. Mr Vittal said
he expected the first private operators to secure licences in two months.
Proposals involving foreign capital will still be required to win separate
approval from the government's Foreign Investments Promotion Board, which
oversees foreign investment. The permissible level of foreign participation
is to be decided 'case-by-case' but Mr Vittal said he hoped investments of
up to 100 per cent should be permitted.
Even if no new conditions emerge, there are more than enough hurdles for
private companies to clear. Until last week it was not certain that they
would be permitted to enter the race at all; now at least they are under
starter's orders.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Restructuring takes toll on
Orenstein &amp; Koppel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring costs continued to dent results at Orenstein &amp; Koppel, forcing
the construction and mining equipment maker to a loss of DM65m (Dollars
39.1m) in 1993.
However, this is an improvement on the previous 12 months when the group
returned a loss of DM116m.
The company reported an operating loss of DM3m and has set aside DM52m to
finance redundancies and the re-siting of activities in Dortmund.
Turnover in the construction equipment division, which accounts for almost
60 per cent of total turnover, fell 17 per cent resulting in a 'very bad
operating result' which could not be offset by improved results in the
mining and escalator divisions.
The company expects 'a modest profit' this year as it begins to benefit from
a three-year restructuring programme which runs until 1995. O&amp;K, which is 75
per cent owned by Krupp-Hoesch, the steelmaker, recently said it would raise
DM144m with a rights issue.
Escalator sales rose 53 per cent worldwide to DM382m, helped by the UK arm
which won a DM125m contract from the London Underground.

The controversial French abortion pill RU 486 will be made available for US
clinical trials in the autumn through an unusual arrangement donating all US
patent rights to a non-profit population group, Reuter reports from
Washington.
Roussel-Uclaf of France, a subsidiary of Germany's Hoechst, has agreed to
donate all US patent rights to the drug to the Population Council, a New
York-based international non-profit group.
The Population Council is seeking a manufacturer for the drug.
Abortion rights activists hailed the agreement as a tremendous victory, but
anti-abortion groups were angered. The American Life League called RU 486 a
'human pesticide'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Military in Chile adamant on general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chile's democratic government faces renewed embarrassment at the hands of
the military today if, as expected, General Rodolfo Stange resumes his post
as chief of police in spite of government insistence that he step down.
Gen Stange, who is being investigated for the alleged cover-up of police
involvement in three killings, said he would defy government requests to
extend his leave indefinitely.
Under the 1980 constitution handed down by the military regime of General
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's president cannot dismiss commanders-in-chief of
the armed forces, of whom Gen Stange is one. Government spokesmen have
resorted to oblique references to the 'inconvenience' of the situation or to
the general's 'moral' duty.
At one point, public bickering was reduced to a discussion of the legality
of an 'indefinite vacation'.
Behind such semantics lies the conflict between the residual power of the
military, which ruled for 17 years, and that of a four-year-old democracy,
gradually growing in confidence and intent on regaining its traditional
constitutional powers.
President Eduardo Frei, who took over in March, has pledged to democratise
the 1980 constitution. Some commentators argue that Mr Frei may have
deliberately provoked confrontation with Gen Stange in order to galvanise
public opinion in favour of constitutional amendments.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Riva sets its sights on new steel target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN, BERLIN

<TEXT>
Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, has joined forces with German and
Italian steelmakers to bid for the special steels division of Ilva, Italy's
state-owned steel company, only days after dropping its offer for Eko Stahl,
the east German manufacturer.
Fried Krupp of Germany and the Italian companies Riva, Falck and Tadfin,
lodged a bid last week for Acciai Speciali Terni, one of two main Ilva
divisions to be privatised.
News of Riva's decision to abandon its offer for Eko Stahl emerged on Friday
and the Italian company has refused all comment on why it broke off
negotiations with Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency.
In a statement issued yesterday by Lazard and Morgan Grenfell Italia, which
are advising the Italo-German bid for AST, the members of the consortium
promised 'a long-term commitment' to the state-owned company.
Iri, the Italian state holding company, is also reported to be considering
offers from Steno Marcegaglia of Italy and the French-owned Ugine, and two
separate bids for the flat steel division of Ilva.
The Treuhand, meanwhile, is looking for a new buyer for Eko Stahl. It has
been trying to sell the company for three years and the European Commission
had approved a DM813m (Dollars 487m) German government subsidised
modernisation plan provided privatisation was complete by June 30 this year.
The agency has wanted to modernise the plant by integrating its steelmaking
and its steel processing operations. That would involve building a new hot
rolling mill. At present, Eko Stahl ships its slabs for hot rolling to
plants in western Germany. These are then returned and cold rolled.
Eko Stahl and the Treuhand have struggled to find credible ways in the past
few years to sell the plant. One plan involved converting the site into a
large modern mini-mill to melt scrap metal. This would have allowed them to
close the last two working blast furnaces, but would have involved heavy job
losses.
Even with steelmaking retained on the site, the modernisation plan - which
would save 3,000 jobs until the end of they year and guarantee 1,700 until
2004 - is viewed with scepticism by the industry
Mr Ken Iversen, chairman of Nucor, a large integrated mini-mill operation
based in North Carolina, has his doubts. 'In terms of efficiency, the
management might just about get away with it with these large numbers. But I
am not so sure,' he said. 'It would be difficult to save lots of jobs and
have efficiency at the same time.'
Eko Stahl employed more than 12,000 before German reunification in 1990.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Sell-off to value telecoms group at over Dollars 11bn: Share
price to be announced next month for biggest Dutch privatisation issue on
record

<TEXT>
Shares in the state-owned Dutch postal and telecommunications company are to
be sold to investors early next month at between Fl 46 and Fl 52 each,
valuing the company at Fl 21bn to Fl 24bn (Dollars 10.9bn-Dollars 12.5bn).
The Dutch government, which yesterday released details of the long-awaited
sell-off, said it would float up to 138.15m shares in Koninklijke PTT
Nederland (KPN), representing 30 per cent of its 100 per cent holding in the
company. The banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro, will be allowed to sell an
additional 20.72m shares if demand is heavy.
If the shares are offered at the top end of the range and the banks exercise
their option to sell the extra tranche of shares, the flotation could raise
more than Fl 8bn for the state,
At the lower end of the range, the shares would still be worth more than Fl
6bn, making the flotation the biggest in the history of the Amsterdam stock
exchange.
The price per share will be announced on June 6 after a book-building period
among institutional investors. The subscription period opens the same day
and runs until June 9 with trading in KPN shares expected to start on June
13.
The price range of Fl 46 and Fl 52 is roughly in line with predictions by
analysts, who had forecast a flotation price of between Fl 45 and Fl 55.
About half the shares are likely to be sold in the Netherlands, with the
rest divided among the UK, US and the rest of the world.
Late last month, the banking syndicate announced that private investors
would receive a price discount of about 5 per cent on allotments up to 75
shares. They will also be given preferential treatment in the allocation of
shares, though details have not yet been released.
Government officials said yesterday some 200,000 potential private
shareholders had requested detailed information about the flotation.
Mr Wilco Jiskoot, ABN Amro's senior executive vice-president for equity and
merchant banking, said 'pre-marketing' talks had been held with 1,000
institutional investors around the world in the past three weeks.
The company's first roadshow took place yesterday in Amsterdam. Roadshows
will be held in more than 20 other financial centres in Europe, North
America and East Asia.
The shares are to be listed in Amsterdam and on Seaq International in
London. KPN is expected to apply for a listing in New York by the time the
government sells a second tranche of shares in two or three years. The Dutch
state's eventual aim is to reduce its shareholding to about 30 per cent.

'framework talks', aimed at opening Japan's markets in areas ranging from

<TEXT>
Moslem forces yesterday tried to push forward around Tuzla, the biggest
Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east, as an upsurge of fighting
defied renewed international efforts to end the war in Bosnia.
Sarajevo radio said the Bosnian army had advanced on Mount Majevica, high
ground overlooking Tuzla, one of six UN 'safe areas' in Bosnia. The radio
also said the centre of Tuzla and the north-west part of the Tuzla airfield
came under Serb fire. Serbian radio, quoting military sources, confirmed
heavy fighting in the region. The Bosnian army push is seen as a move to
strengthen the land links between Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica, the three main
government strongholds in Bosnia.
Some European observers felt the international community's failure to come
out clearly in favour of a specific peace plan has fuelled the renewed
fighting.
In particular, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has been
criticised for agreeing on Friday to a deal giving the Moslems and Croats 51
per cent of the territory and then appearing to contradict this position on
Sunday by acknowledging the possibility that the Moslem-Croat Federation
might win as much as 58 per cent of the land.
The Moslem-Croat offensive may also have been encouraged by the US Senate's
vote last week, urging the US government to lift the Bosnian arms embargo.
.
General Sir John Wilsey, joint commander of British Forces in the former
Yugoslavia, told reporters yesterday that 'uncertain political messages make
things difficult for us on the ground.'
In Belgrade, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy, met Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic and called for the urgent implementation of a
plan, agreed on Friday in Geneva at a meeting of the foreign ministers from
Russia, the US, and the EU.
Mr Churkin said Mr Milosevic 'very strongly supported' the immediate
cessation of hostilities, but was leaving it to the Bosnian Serbs to decide
on the other aspects of the plan.
The agreement calls for a four-month ceasefire and for the Bosnian Serbs to
keep 49 per cent of the war-torn country with the remaining 51 per cent
allotted to the newly created Moslem Croat federation.
Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-styled Serbian state, offered
the possibility that the Serbs may consider the settlement, although Bosnian
Serbs have previously rejected the deal, demanding 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Speaking to a Serbian newspaper, he said: 'The Serb side is ready to change
the borders (on the basis of the 51:49 split) inasmuch as this creates a
functioning state. As long as this would mean that the international
community would consider trading quantity for quality.'

The beleaguered French press yesterday gained yet another new recruit when
the first issue of Paris 24.00 landed on the capital's news-stands despite
production problems that halved the size of its print-run.
Paris 24.00 managed to produce only 50,000 of a planned 110,000 copies, but
its first issue was virtually sold out by lunchtime. The new daily, which is
aimed at the mass market with a mini-tabloid format and FFr3 cover price, is
described by Philippe Lecardonnel, editor-in-chief, as a 'city paper' that
could be 'read in 15 minutes on the metro without getting your fingers dirty
or poking your neighbour in the eye'. Paris 24.00 is the third new daily
launched in France this year. InfoMatin and Aujourd'hui, two tabloids which
were introduced in January, have seen their daily sales settle at 95,100 and
74,000 respectively.

<TEXT>
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, 38, a Russian deputy prime minister, became the first
casualty of the recently reformed Russian cabinet when he yesterday lost his
post as nationalities minister, though hr kept that of deputy premier.
His successor, Mr Nikolai Yegorov, is a governor of the Krasnodar region who
has shown conspicuous loyalty to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and appears
to be benefiting from it. Like Mr Shakhrai, he is from a Cossack background.
The Russian press has speculated that Mr Shakhrai's loss of position stemmed
from his sturdy opposition to Mr Dzhokar Dudayev, president of the breakaway
autonomous Russian republic of Chechnya - with whom the Russian president is
now seeking a rapprochement.
Mr Shakhrai had earlier called for presidential elections in Chechnya as a
condition for talks with a man who has defied Russian central authority for
more than two years.
Mr Shakhrai had created a centrist grouping in the small but influential
Party of Unity and Accord, which boasts two deputy prime ministers, Mr
Shakhrai and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for the
economy. Both have taken a centrist position after some time in the liberal
camp, and both have strongly supported Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime
minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mead Corporation, the US paper group, said yesterday it would divest Mead
Data Central, its electronic information operation, and concentrate on its
core forest products business.
Analysts said the information business, best known for its Lexis/Nexis
on-line legal, business and general news services, could fetch more than
Dollars 1bn.
Mead said it had retained Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, to advise on
divestment alternatives but it thought a sale to a strategic buyer was the
most likely alternative. It hoped to complete a deal this year.
Mead bought the business in 1968 for Dollars 6m. Last year it had sales of
Dollars 551m and pre-tax profits of Dollars 50.4m. Mead said the subsidiary
was on track to 'far exceed' its 1993 sales this year.
Through its various Lexis services, MDC is the leading global provider of
on-line and CD-Rom legal information, while Nexis provides a wide-ranging
general and business news retrieval service.
Analysts said Mead was selling at a good time, when MDC's results were
accelerating and potential buyers were interested in broadening their
information services base for the mass-market development of multimedia. The
forest products industry is starting a cyclical upswing.
Mr Steven Mason, Mead chairman, said it was a time of opportunity in the
paper industry and the company believed it could maximise shareholder value
by devoting all its resources to what it knew best. MDC's growth potential
could be best realised independently of the group.
If the business were sold, Mead would use the proceeds to strengthen the
core business. Possible uses include focused acquisitions, further
productivity and quality improvements, debt reduction and a stock buy-back.
Mead shares closed at Dollars 44 1/2, up Dollars 1 1/4.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Air Products covers loss on
derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air Products and Chemicals, the US industrial gases group which last week
took a Dollars 60m after-tax charge in its second quarter to cover losses on
five derivatives contracts, said yesterday it would absorb an additional
Dollars 9m charge in the next quarter to cover the cost of closing out the
contracts.
The Pennsylvania-based group said it terminated the interest rate swap
contracts to reduce the company's earnings exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.
Air Products is the fourth US company to take a charge against its earnings
this year because of problems with derivatives agreements sold by Bankers
Trust, the New York bank. Procter &amp; Gamble, Gibson Greetings and Mead
Corporation incurred losses with contracts bought from Bankers Trust.
The bank last week said it sold derivatives to companies so that they could
manage their debt and investment portfolios, and continued to believe the
contracts were useful to clients.
Air Products had decided to stick with the contracts, recalculating their
value at the end of each quarter. But the contracts were leveraged, which
magnified the potential for losses and left Air Products open to the
possibility of losing more money if interest rates continued to rise.

Goldstrike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US interior department has finally granted American Barrick Resources
full title and ownership of the 1,800-acre Goldstrike property in Nevada,
which contains North America's biggest gold mine.
American Barrick, controlled by Mr Peter Munk, the Toronto financier, will
now acquire the property for USDollars 5 per acre from the US government.
It will also be exempt from mining production royalties now proposed in
Congress that would total about Dollars 700m over Goldstrike's life.
'This gives us full security for the Dollars 1bn we invested to develop the
mine,' said Mr Vincent Borg, Barrick spokesman. The company bought the
property in 1987.
Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, has been pushing for higher prices for
federal public lands and production royalties via changes to the 1872 US
Mining Law.
American Barrick early this year persuaded a US court that Mr Babbitt had
overstepped his authority by trying to change the 'patenting' system by
which mining companies gained the final title to federal lands they are
working.
Although Mr Babbitt called yesterday's signing of the Goldstrike title 'the
biggest gold heist since the days of Butch Cassidy,' Mr Bob Miller, Nevada
governor, said American Barrick had met all commitments and is a big
contributor to the state economy.
Goldstrike provides most of American Barrick's gold output, estimated at
1.8m oz in 1994 and 2m oz in 1995.

FT  17 MAY 94 / London 'likely to add 50,000 office jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central London is likely to see a growth in office employment of between
50,000 and 65,000 jobs by the year 2000, says a report published yesterday.
The growth could generate demand for 10m sq ft of extra office space, St
Quintin, the chartered surveyors, say.
However, the growth in jobs is likely to be less important in generating
demand for offices than the need for City occupiers to change and upgrade
their accommodation. A quarter of City tenants are housed in unrefurbished
buildings built before 1970.
The projections are based on the assumption that London retains its position
as Europe's leading financial centre. However, it highlights a number of
threats to that position, including increased teleworking and competition
from other centres such as Frankfurt.
Mr Peter Damesick, head of research at St Quintin, emphasised the
uncertainties involved in making long-term projections. 'Even the modest
increase in occupied floor space in our projections is not guaranteed,' he
said.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Channel 4 seeks to alter revenue rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 is likely to launch a formal campaign later this month to persuade
the government to alter the rules that govern its financial relationship
with the ITV companies. The channel could have to pay several hundred
million pounds over the next 10 years.
The rules were drawn up to provide a safety net against a serious drop in
income for the channel once it started selling its own advertising time. But
Channel 4's revenues have increased.
In October, Channel 4 told the Commons national heritage committee that it
could end up paying Pounds 200m to ITV over the 10 years of its licence.
Channel 4 executives now fear the amount could be very much more.
The safety net, which was spelt out in the Broadcasting Act 1990, means that
Channel 4 has to give to ITV 50 per cent of any advertising and sponsorship
revenues earned above 14 per cent of the total of its UK non-satellite
revenues. A further 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund and Channel 4 is
allowed to keep the rest. In return, if Channel 4 revenues fall below 14 per
cent of UK non-satellite revenues, the channel is compensated out of the
reserve fund and then by ITV. In February, after it handed over Pounds 38.2m
to the ITV companies for 1993, Channel 4 said it would seek to renegotiate
the terms of the safety net.
The channel, which is thought not to have asked the government for the
safety net, is concerned about the increasing amount of its money going to
the competing ITV companies. The total this year could reach Pounds 50m -
although the channel has recently had a dip in viewing figures.
A final decision on the exact aims and terms of the campaign will be taken
by the Channel 4 board on May 23 and announced along with the publication of
its annual report the next day.
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, yesterday refused to discuss
the campaign ahead of the publication of the report.
BT yesterday launched a service for broadcasters and facilities houses which
enables them to transfer programme material and commercials in digital form.
BT said the service was the first of its kind and would protect picture
quality and prevent the delays associated with delivery by couriers.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Extra lookalike laws ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brand manufacturers yesterday attacked a government announcement ruling out
action on supermarket 'look-alike' products in the trademarks bill, which
today starts its line-by-line Commons committee stage scrutiny.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, junior minister responsible for technology, said
yesterday the 'overwhelming majority of views' in a consultation exercise
were against using the bill to protect brand names against lookalikes.
The government said the bill, which will broaden the definition of
trademarks, would provide extra protection for brand names and should be
given a chance to work. It would consider further legislation if brand
owners could show that problems had continued.
Mr John Murphy, spokesman for the British Producers and Brand Owners Group,
whose members include Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Gillette, Mars, Nestle
and Procter &amp; Gamble, said the government response was 'entirely
insufficient. The problem is a very serious and immediate one and strong
action is needed now'.
The British Retail Consortium and the Consumers Association welcomed the
announcement. The association said the opportunity for manufacturers to
initiate passing-off actions was a sufficient legal safeguard against unfair
competition.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Asian bank tries to reverse closure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A director of Mount Banking, the small Asian-owned bank, yesterday tried to
overturn in the High Court the Banking Appeal Tribunal's decision to uphold
Mount's closure by the Bank of England in 1992.
In its first ever case, the tribunal found last October that the Bank had
been right to assess Mount's two directors and shareholders as not 'fit and
proper' to run a bank.
Counsel for Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah claimed that many of the original
grounds for the Bank's decision had not been upheld by the tribunal and that
it had changed the charges from 'not fit and proper' to 'may not have been
fit and proper'.
Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah, the other director and owner of the bank, did not
appeal against the tribunal's decision. The hearing is expected to last
about three days.

FT  17 MAY 94 / American Express tests new card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Express, the US-based financial services company, is test-marketing
a credit card in the UK aimed at individuals who do not have an American
Express charge card but who fit the cardholder profile, Norma Cohen writes.
The move comes at a time of increasing competition in the credit card market
with several providers launching products which undercut traditional bank
providers on both interest rates and annual charges.
American Express has been test-marketing a similar credit card product in
the US and Canada for several months and is likely to launch it in North
America first.
American Express is considering a range of annual fees and interest charges
which will be lower than those of bank-sponsored cards but higher than those
of the most competitive products on the market.
The company said that, in spite of the surge of new entrants to the credit
card business, 'we think we can compete in our market'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (12): It started in
London back in 1839 - The persistent dream of winning cheap electricity from
chemical fuel cells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The race to achieve ever higher thermal efficiencies from combined-cycle gas
turbine power stations may be the most crucial in the short term for the big
equipment suppliers, but other 'next generation' technologies are not being
ignored.
One of the most interesting involves solid oxide fuel cells. Both Siemens
and Westinghouse are involved - separately - in developing this technology.
The direct conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy in a simple
hydrogen/oxygen-based fuel cell was achieved in 1839 by Sir William Grove in
London. Fuel cells with liquid electrolytes have been used in space travel
but terrestrial applications have remained limited to specialised uses in
military and telecommunications.
However, according to Siemens, with advances in knowledge, and especially in
materials science, there is evidence that the 'forgotten' electrochemical
conversion of energy can equal or perhaps even surpass today's successful
energy technology under current ecological boundary conditions.
There are various types of fuel cells, depending on the type of electrolyte
used, and two broad classifications, low-temperature and high-temperature.
Among low-temperature cells, Siemens has been developing the polymer
electrolyte membrane (PEM) type since 1982. These run on very pure gases,
are easily transportable, and are available up to 200-300KW. But their cost
means they are likely to be used only in specialist applications.
A second low-temperature type with phosphoric acid electrolytes is also
available in 200KW units, which can be used in combination up to 1MW, says
Siemens. Their thermal efficiency in combined heat and power applications
can be as high as 90 per cent, but the cost per kilowatt produced is high.
Interest is now focused on the high-temperature type of fuel cell, and
particularly solid oxide fuel cells which operate between 950 and 1,000degC
and have sophisticated ceramic electrolytes.
'The technology is more difficult but there are big advantages,' says Dr
Hans Bohm, a senior executive at Siemens' KWU power generation unit.
The hot exhaust gas from the cell could be used in conjunction with a gas
and steam turbine combined cycle, giving a relatively high electrical
efficiency of about 68 per cent for a 40MW plant. Other combinations, for
example an industrial CHP plant, could attain a total fuel efficiency of 75
per cent.
The cells are still very small scale - even a 1KW version will not be
available for a few months, says Dr Bohm - and stacks of 300-500KW will be
needed for even modest commercial or industrial power generation. Achieving
that will take several years.
Westinghouse, meanwhile, has announced a two-year contract valued at Dollars
7.3m for a programme to develop and demonstrate solid oxide fuel power
systems for the NASA Lewis Research Centre. The multi-phase programme will
focus on developing transportable solid oxide fuel cells to produce
electricity for military applications. The cells will use hydrogen-based
fuels such as jet fuel and diesel fuel to produce direct current power with
very low emissions.
The programme will culminate with the demonstration of a fuel cell with peak
output of more than 30KW. It will also produce conceptual designs which will
lead to both commercial and military applications of solid oxide fuel cell
technology.
Mr Frank Bakos, vice president and general manager of the Westinghouse power
generation business unit, says: 'This technology's high efficiency and very
low emissions will make it an important power generation resource in the
coming decades.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (11): Grimy name to
live down - Diesel makers seek a bigger market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diesel engines, the workhorses of everything from vans and buses to ships
and small-scale power generation, are not normally associated with
generating power on a large scale.
This is perhaps not surprising given the fast growth of gas turbine combined
cycle power generation over the past decade. Most statistics on thermal
power generation tend not to give diesel a separate category of its own, yet
according to Diesel and Gas Turbines Worldwide new orders for diesel, dual
fuel and gas-engine power plants grew to a record 7,000MW last year, about
12 per cent of the annual global power market.
Quietly, diesel engine producers are working to address the common
perception of diesel power as dirtier than rival methods of generation, and
invest heavily in producing equipment that can be used for reliable,
baseload power generation.
Mr Pentti-Juhani Hintikka, Finnish president and chief executive officer of
Strasbourg-based Wartsila Diesel Group, is naturally enthusiastic about
prospects for an industry of which his company is the leader - it claims a
20 per cent share of the diesel power plant market and has the broadest
product range.
Mr Hintikka believes diesel could in time lift its share of the power plant
market as a whole to 25-30 per cent, depending on how the industry develops,
and says that already over the past five years it has cut down the lead of
gas turbines over diesel engines from eight-to-one to four-to-one in terms
of total power capacity.
The type of engine and of customer is very varied. Wartsila delivered
1,400MW of power plant installations last year, with half going to
south-east and east Asia. China emerged as an important customer -
Wartsila's Dutch subsidiary won a contract for a 110MW power plant in
Guandong province, while its Finnish company is supplying 13 diesel
generator sets to the Pan Yu plant, also in Guandong and due to be completed
by the end of the year. Short lead times were an important a factor in
winning the business.
Several larger heavy fuel-burning diesel plant deliveries were completed to
independent power developers and the mining industry in Central and South
America, containerised plants were delivered and commissioned in Russia,
while in Europe orders were received for combined heat and power-type gas
engine installations.
The bread-and-butter business for the diesel engine industry has for years
been the heavy fuel oil-burning engine, with which Wartsila, for example,
has had great success in India. But in the mid-1980s, recognising that gas
was becoming the fuel of choice for power generation, the company began a
major effort to develop a gas-burning diesel engine, and now claims to be
industry leader in gas and gas-diesel engine technology.
There are two types of engines that burn gas. First, there is the gas-diesel
engine, which Wartsila pioneered in 1987. The important advantage of these
engines over every other type of prime mover is that they can run on any
type of fuel from heavy fuel oil to natural gas, and with computer control
can be switched from one fuel to another without any interruption in
operation.
This flexibility, says Mr Hintikka, was a major argument used by Wartsila to
clinch an order in the Philipinnes last year. The second basic type of gas
engines uses so-called 'lean burn' technology, with spark ignition and a
lean air-to-gas mixture that raises thermal efficiency and gives very low
NOx emissions. The concept is ideal for smaller power plants in the 400 to
3,000kW range, says Wartsila.
Mr Hintikka has a twin strategy for increasing the use of diesel power. In
developing countries, the aim is to offer a reasonable price and fast
construction times, but Wartsila also wants to be a player in the
industrialised world, where high efficiency, reliability and low emissions
are the priority.
In particular, Mr Hintikka is looking to exploit the independent power
producer (IPP) market in regions as diverse as the US and south-east Asia.
IPP clients accounted for 45.6 per cent of Wartsila's diesel power plant
sales last year - 'they are really setting a new trend, making it important
for us to perform better,' says Mr Hintikka. They are followed by utilities
which accounted for 25.7 per cent of sales and industry with 20.4 per cent.
The remaining 8.3 per cent came from natural resources and other customers.
To succeed against gas turbines, diesel power has to be competitive in terms
of thermal efficiency and emissions. By including a steam turbine, gas
engines can be used in combined cycle formation, and Mr Hintikka says
Wartsila has designs for 100MW plants with thermal efficiency of 54 per
cent, closely comparable with combined cycle gas turbine generation.
As for emissions, the relative performance of gas engines and gas turbines
depends on how they are measured. The diesel engine industry prefers to
measure emission levels in terms of grams per kilowatt-hour, under which
diesel engines come out cleaner, but gas turbines emerge on top if emissions
are measured on parts per million (volume-based).
There are size constraints on diesel power, Mr Hintikka admits. Ten engines
is probably the maximum practical number in each plant, and at 16MW apiece
plus a steam turbine total power output of 200MW is possible. Beyond that
size, the efficiency of gas turbines improves, further loading the odds in
their favour.
Even with this limitation, though, Mr Hintikka believes there are plenty of
opportunities for diesel power. The traditional heavy fuel oil market will
remain, but the real growth will be in gas engines in both the
industrialised and developing countries.
The key technological challenge, he says, is to keep improving thermal
efficiency while keeping emissions under control, involving continuing heavy
spending on research and development.
At the same time, as lead times are so important to winning orders Wartsila
Diesel is engaged in much the same kind of continuous cost reduction and
manufacturing reorganisation as has taken place among the gas turbine
producers, against whose performance it measures itself.
An example are the changes at the Wartsila SACM Diesel plant at Mulhouse,
where employment has fallen from 1,000 in 1989 to 750 now. Productivity has
risen as lead times have been reduced, through a combination of investment
in new machinery and simplifying and shortening the route taken by engines
as they progress through the plant towards completion. Mr Matti Tulkki,
president and chief executive of the French unit, quotes reductions in
internal lead times from seven months to 1.5 months, or from 11 months to
five months for the biggest engines.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): Privates on parade
 -Pat Kimber studies electricity reform in the UAE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAT KIMBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United Arab Emirates, in common with many Gulf states, is affected by
the continuing low oil revenues. So for the past few months there has been
talk of privatisation and the introduction of independent power producers
(IPPs).
Privatisation, it is argued, would release funds for other projects, cut
bureaucracy and speed decision-making.
The opposing arguments are practical and emotional. They include the
difficulties of private sector involvement in a complex power-producing
system and a previously unchallenged policy of cheap electricity for the
people.
But now things are changing. An official announcement that the government is
to finance a study on the privatisation of public utilities came on the
heels of the federal Ministry of Electricity &amp; Water's (MEW) hint that it
will phase out subsidies.
Tariffs have remained unchanged since federation in 1971, with no regard to
power costs or inflation. Electricity prices will now begin to be raised -
initially from two US cents to a still very low three cents a unit.
Close attention has been paid to what the neighbours are doing. British Gas
in Bahrain and international group UPGI in Oman are already building gas
turbine plants. In Qatar the government has set up a private company which
will eventually run all its power stations.
Rumours have been circulating in Dubai that private sector companies are
ready to construct power plants on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) and
build-own-operate (BOO) systems, so popular in the Far East.
It is not surprising that Dubai - the long-established trading centre of the
region - should be the prime mover on privatisation since it has four
separate power and water authorities.
The UAE was formed by the federation of seven emirates - Abu Dhabi, Dubai,
Sharjah, Fujeirah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Qwain. Before federation
each emirate had its own utility and it was assumed that the newly set-up
MEW would take responsibility for the whole country.
It never came about. The three large emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and
Sharjah still run their own electricity organisations while MEW looks after
the four smaller emirates which have comparatively little income and very
scattered populations.
MEW's budget this year is around Dollars 100m, according to minister Humaid
bin Nasser Al Owais. This will provide another 150 megawatts in the northern
emirates which the federal ministry administrates.
MEW is headquartered in the federal capital, the city of Abu Dhabi, under
minister Al Owais. The deputy minister, Saaed Majid Al Shamsi, works mainly
from Dubai. 'MEW is politically responsible for electricity and water,' he
said.
'We represent the UAE internationally - for instance on negotiations for the
proposed Gulf grid project. We also cooperate with the electricity companies
in the three large emirates - especially on tariffs which are highly
subsidised throughout the country.'
Of the UAE's entire total installed capacity of 5,500MW, some 900MW is
controlled by MEW and is mostly gas turbines with 130MW from diesel
generating sets in the more remote areas. It is also responsible for a 132
kilovolt transmission network which is being upgraded by UK consultants
Ewbank Preece.
Power in Abu Dhabi emirate (including the city) is looked after by its own
Water and Electricity Department (WED). The WED is now in the process of
adding some 1,000MW to its present generating capacity of 2,440MW. By far
the largest slice of this will come from the Dollars 1.8bn 732MW Al Taweelah
B power and desalination plant - an extension to the original 253MW Al
Taweelah A commissioned in 1985.
Al Taweelah B is being built by a consortium headed by Asea Brown Boveri,
the Swedish-Swiss multinational, and including ABB Kraftwerke of Mannheim,
SAE Sadelmi of Italy and Six Construct of Belgium. Tractebel of Belgium is
the consulting engineer for the project which will be the world's largest
power and desalination station when it comes on stream in 1996. There is
certain to be yet another extension and ABB looks to be a frontrunner for
this contract when it is announced.
Other WED power projects under construction include Medina Zayed (60MW), the
200MW Abu Dhabi main power station extension and 100MW at Al Ain.
A 200MW gas turbine station with desalination plant is also being built in
Mifra by a consortium led by Ansaldo Energia with gas turbines by Siemens.
Deutsche Babcock of Germany has a Dollars 74m contract to undertake power
station maintenance and refurbishment work. WED has commissioned UK
consultants Kennedy &amp; Donkin (recently merged with the US Rust organisation)
to study existing transmission networks and make recommendations for future
demand. Ewbank Preece is overseeing two new 220kv links and the enhancement
of an existing 220kv overhead line system.
Proposals to build a load despatch centre to monitor all the water and
electricity flows in Abu Dhabi emirate have finally been accepted by WED.
The Dollars 90m contract has been awarded to ABB.
Electricite de France (EdF) is consultant for the project which will involve
a regional centre in Al Ain. Power Measurement of Australia is supplying
instruments to monitor the grid system.
Sharjah is in a construction boom reminiscent of Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. The Sharjah Electricity and Water Department
(SEWD) currently produces some 700MW, nearly all from its Layyah station in
Sharjah town. Two General Electric Frame 9E gas turbine units and additional
desalination plant are now being installed.
This will help to meet the high summer peak when the 24-hour air
conditioning demand often overwhelms the emirate's ability to cope with a
rapidly increasing population attracted by the rapid building programme.
Distribution remains a problem on a network which started life supplying
power to the long-departed British forces base and airfield. A new link is
to be built from the Sajaa gas field to Layyah and further major power line
installations are planned.
Dubai has seen a phenomenal growth in its power supply since the first
lights were switched on in 1961. The recently set-up Dubai Electricity &amp;
Water Authority (DEWA) has grown out of the Dubai Electricity Company which
dates back to 1959.
Capacity was then just 1.4MW from privately owned generators. Now it is
nearly 2,000MW and increasing, as more plants come on stream this year. In
March, the 457MW Jebel Ali G power and desalination station built by a
Siemens-led consortium was fully commissioned.
Jebel Ali E is undergoing a Dollars 81m conversion to combined cycle by a
consortium led by ABB Kraftwerke. Kennedy &amp; Donkin is consultant for the
project which includes ABB SAE Sadelmi for civil works and boiler supply by
Combustion Engineering (Italiana).
The extension will add two waste heat recovery boilers to the GE Frame 9E
gas turbines installed in 1992. The much-talked-about Jebel Ali H is almost
certain to appear in DEWA's plans before the year is out.
Dubai's primary 132kv transmission system voltage has been reinforced by a
400kv network utilising the latest technology.
The construction work was undertaken by the National Thermal Power Company
of India (NTPC) which has recently opened an office in Dubai to supervise
its increased workload in the emirates.
Last year, DEWA was frequently in danger of having to cut power supply. This
would have been a severe blow for the extremely efficient utility and for
the people of Dubai who enjoy a highly-sophisticated lifestyle.
Kennedy &amp; Donkin is advising DEWA on upgrading its control and management
systems but the possibility of black-outs has forced power engineers into
thinking that yet another large station, either combined cycle or steam
turbines, must be sanctioned. It could be the UAE's first IPP.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (10): Latin America
starts to turn on the lights again - End of debt crisis offers hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By any measure, Latin America's need for new power generating capacity is
huge. The World Bank expectsdemand of Dollars 24bn a year for power projects
in the region in coming years.
There is no doubting the need: the debt crisis brought new spending on power
projects almost to a halt across the region. The big electricity deficit
that developed has led to widespread power cuts in many countries. In some,
such as Colombia and Honduras, it has had a palpable effect in slowing
economic growth in recent years.
The debt crisis brought about another development: budget stringency led
many governments to shed responsibilities, to privatise and to encourage
privately-financed projects in areas previously in the government domain.
Yet handing over more responsibility to the private sector has raised
questions about how growth in generating capacity will be financed,
particularly since the big project financiers for governments - the World
Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank - are unable, or have limited
ability, to lend direct to the private sector.
The reaccommodation of Latin America in the world's financial markets has
helped to ease the way, although many international banks remain inhibited
from lending for a variety of reasons. Only Chile - the pioneer in
developing private electricity generating capacity in Latin America - has
developed its local capital markets sufficiently not to depend on foreign
finance.
Bankers agree that the necessary, if not sufficient, condition for private
finance is the establishment of a regulatory regime that lenders feel they
will be able to trust over a long period of time.
The pricing of electricity is of huge political significance and governments
are often tempted to keep prices down to preserve their popularity. A study
by the Latin American Energy Organisation (OLADE) showed that in 1990 only
five Latin American governments were charging prices at or above long-term
marginal cost. 'This is changing quite rapidly,' said Mr Vijay Chaudhry,
head of the power division of the International Finance Corporation's
infrastructure department. Now more and more governments are introducing
realistic pricing policies that send the right signals to investors.
Not everywhere, however. In Brazil, where government ministers have spoken
about bringing in private generating capacity, the local price of
electricity is under 5 US cents per kilowatt/hour. 'You can't build world
scale generating capacity at that price and and make money,' said Mr J.
Scott Swensen, senior portfolio manager at Scudder Latin American Trust for
Independent Power. This trust, which has investment of Dollars 100m, was
launched with the idea of generating some Dollars 500m from institutional
investors.
In Mexico, where the government has ostensibly allowed
independently-financed power generation, the state electricity company has
made life difficult for would-be private-sector investors.
Mr Swensen says many investors are comfortable with Mexico and there is a
big scope for large-scale investment in power generation there. There have
been some recent signs of progress on the long-delayed 700MW Samalayuca II
plant near the US border in the state of Chihuahua, south of El Paso, Texas.
This envisaged a 20-year build, lease and transfer agreement, with plant to
be owned by a consortium led by GE.
Mr George Aguilera, general manager of GE Power Systems,Mexico, told a
conference in January that he expected Mexico to add 18 gigawatts to its
generating capacity over the next decade, with steam turbines accounting for
nearly 55 per cent of orders.
New generation orders in Brazil were expected to reach 22GW Argentina 11GW,
Colombia 4.5GW and Venezuela nearly 10GW. He predicted that gas turbines
would account for 45 per cent of the generation mix, with steam turbines
steady at a little over 25 per cent and hydro installations a little under
30 per cent.
Some, of these figures might seem too high. When generating capacity already
under construction comes on stream in Argentina, for example, some observers
think the country may even have an electricity surplus. Private refurbishing
of existing plant has already generated important gains in capacity. With
heavy rains helping hydro-electricity generation this year, prices fell to 4
US cents per kilowatt-hour.
But it is not only in the large economies that private generating capacity
is coming on stream. Two companies, Amoco and Southern Electric
International, have just won a bid in Trinidad &amp; Tobago to expand generation
to the installed 1,100MW capacity.
And even in countries where the overall pricing regime is not particularly
investor-friendly, a growing number of stand-alone private projects aimed at
generating electricity for a group of users is emerging. This seems
particularly workable where the potential users have a foreign exchange
generating capacity - it has been used in the Dominican Republic to provide
power for a group of hotels.
Overall, manufacturers of power generation equipment are enthusiastic about
the prospects. Mr Aguilera of GE commented: 'Latin America and the
Caribbean, when combined with the US and Canadian markets, make a potential
trading bloc that could surpass the European common market, and more than
hold its own against the emerging mega-market of Asia.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (10): Reprieve for
debt-laden company - Profile, prospects have improved for Chicago-based
Stone Container
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stone Container, the Chicago-based paper and packaging manufacturer, is
counting on this year's modest but steady increases in linerboard and
newsprint prices to rescue it from the financial conundrum that has brought
it three consecutive years of deepening losses.
Stone, a 68-year-old company which started as a family business that traded
in twine and used corrugated cartons, entered the 1980s as a
vertically-integrated packaging company with sales of Dollars 600m. Then,
under the tutelage of Roger Stone, a grandson of the founders and a disciple
of junk bond king Michael Milken, Stone Container ballooned to a company
with Dollars 5.7bn in sales during its peak year, 1990.
However, the growth was achieved through a series of highly leveraged
acquisitions that left the company in debt. The purchases coincided with a
boom in the cyclical paper and packaging business, and the biggest were made
at the height of the market.
The largest of these, the purchase of Montreal-based Consolidated Bathurst,
came in 1989 at a price of Dollars 2.6bn. Consolidated Bathurst owns four
newsprint plants in Canada, and one in Ellesmere Port in the UK.
Analysts say Stone's acquisition of Consolidated Bathurst was an exercise in
bad timing. 'Basically, Stone paid a high price for Consolidated and got
stuck with a lot of debt just as the market (for paper and container board)
weakened and cash flow was going down,' says Brian Bogart, a bond analyst
for Duff and Phelps.
As a result, Stone Container entered the 1990s more than Dollars 4bn in
debt, and with cash flow that was not adequate to meet both operating needs
and debt-service obligations. Annual losses grew from Dollars 49.1m in 1991
to 1993's record Dollars 358.7m. The company's desperate need for cash led
to a dilutive plan for a Dollars 500m equity offering early last year that
was aborted after the announcement sent Stone's shares into a tailspin,
depreciating their value by half.
However, since then the markets for Stone's primary products have
strengthened. The industry announced price increases for newsprint and
linerboard in March, and has been successful at implementing them.
Linerboard supplies are particularly tight, with manufacturers, including
Stone, operating plants full-out in the first quarter. Stone announced a
second Dollars 40 per tonne price increase for linerboard effective June 1,
and is optimistic it will stick. At the same time, discounts for newsprint
have been trimmed.
The market turnaround has given Roger Stone the reprieve he needs to
restructure Stone's mountain of debt and ward off creditors.
In December, he created a company called Stone-Consolidated using most of
Consolidated-Bathurst's assets, and then sold a 25.4 per cent stake in the
new entity to Canadian investors hungry for new offerings.
A series of smaller asset sales have followed, and the company has not ruled
out selling a further stake in Stone-Consolidated as a means of raising
cash.
In February, the company completed a public offering of 16.5m shares of
common stock and Dollars 710m in senior debentures. The proceeds from the
Dollars 925m offering were used to prepay creditors.
Ira Stone, Stone Container's chief spokesman, says the company has met all
of its requirements for long-term debt maturing through 1995 and much of
1996.
However, the debt clock continues to tick, with another Dollars 732m in
long-term debt due in 1997 and some Dollars 2.9bn due thereafter.
Even with some debt relief and what appears to be an upswing in business
conditions, analysts say Stone has a rough year ahead. 'I think their
business will continue to get better, but they still lost money in the first
quarter, even with the price improvements,' says Mark Rogers, an industry
analyst for Prudential Securities. If annualised, the first quarter loss
translates into a Dollars 500m deficit for the year, he said.
Part of the problem is that even though product prices strengthened in the
first quarter, they still did not recover to the point where they were in
the first quarter of 1993. Forest products analysts says that if the forest
products market continues to firm it will be in the areas where Stone is
most heavily invested - linerboard, corrugated containers, and newsprint and
market pulp.
Mr Bogart, with Duff and Phelps, says Stone may not see a profit until 1996.
'Stone has done a great deal of financing to stay ahead of its debt
maturities, and now its cash flow is improving,' he said. 'They have a high
degree of operating leverage, and each price increase has a generous impact
on their bottom line.'
However, he said, Stone faces hefty environmental charges to clean up air
and water emissions at its plants and factories. Those charges, according to
the company, could be as high as Dollars 400m.
Shareholders appear to be banking on Stone's leveraged position in a rising
forest products market. Stone Container shares have nearly trebled from a
1993 low of Dollars 6.50 2 per share to more than Dollars 16 recently.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (9): Ready to exploit
changing political climate - Profile, the South African producer, Sappi, has
been hit hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a rough few years for Sappi, the South African producer that
claims top position on the continent in pulp and paper production. Not only
has it had to contend with the industry-wide downturn, but a severe South
African recession, compounded by the worst drought of the century, has
severely weakened the domestic market and forced the company to write off a
chunk of operations.
On top of that, South Africa's volatile political situation has played havoc
with Sappi's international expansion programme, first by making it difficult
to get permission from the South African Reserve Bank to export funds, and
then, as a result of the currency's recent slide, exaggerating the effect of
losses in its new offshore operations.
Domestically, therefore, while Sappi remains dominant in the market, the
company has been hit hard on all fronts. The effects of the three-year local
recession was aggravated by increased competition from imports, particularly
from Brazil and Finland, which have exploited the country's low tariffs on
paper products to exploit the top end of the South African market at low
prices.
Despite all this, aggressive expansion has seen the company's turnover rise
from R2.9bn (Dollars 580m) in 1990 to R5.54bn in 1994, but after-tax
earnings have dropped over the same period from R604m in 1990 to just
R142.2m in 1994.
Now, however, Sappi believes the worst is over on both counts, and it is
well placed to exploit the expected upturn in the market and take advantage
of South Africa's return to economic growth and its newfound international
respectability.
Executive chairman Eugene Van As says: 'The changing political climate is
creating new business opportunities for our operations.'
The company is a fully-integrated producer and its divisions encompass all
sectors of the industry from raw timber to finished papers. Its core
operations together supply more than half of South Africa's total paper
requirements.
Sappi grows its own timber on 340,000 hectares of forest land in the
southern Africa region, most of which is then used in the company's own
plants. These in turn are divided into Sappi Timber industries, kraft
papers, fine papers and pulp.
The timber operations supply structural wood products for the building and
mining industry, as well as particleboard and medium density fibreboard for
use in home furnishings. For its other products, the group has three fine
paper mills and three kraft paper mills around the country, used for
packaging and a wide range of home, school and office requirements. Its
Usutu pulp division, based in Swaziland, is the lowest cost producer in the
world of unbleached kraft market paper.
Sappi's forests benefit, in non-drought years, from the local climate, which
allows for fast growth of trees suitable for pulp. Combined with access to
some of the cheapest electricity in the world, this puts the company among
the cheapest producers in the world despite the relatively high quality of
its output.
This cost competitiveness is true of most of Sappi's South African
operations, helped by a combination of cheap inputs and low delivery costs.
And, given the company's substantial excess capacity, Mr van As believes
that the end of South Africa's recession, combined with increased spending
plans by the new government in areas such as education, will significantly
benefit the local paper market thus helping lift domestic results in the
near future.
Over the past few years, however, the export market has become the main
focus for many of the company's divisions. Sappi now ships a wide range of
products, accounting for around 65 per cent of total output, to all parts of
the globe, with east Asia and Europe being dominant,
Spearheading this drive is the company's SAICCOR division, the world's
lowest cost dissolving pulp producer, which reserves nearly all of its
production for overseas demand. The operation has a capacity of 450,000
tonnes and is undergoing a R1b expansion plan which will make it by far the
world's biggest single producer.
To complement these exports, over the past few years the company has focused
on increasing its overall foreign exposure and its foreign asset base.
In addition to being listed in Frankfurt, Paris and London, the company now
runs a substantial European operation, with subsidiaries in the UK and
Germany, making it one of the largest producers of paper products on the
continent.
However, despite impressive recent productivity gains and improvements in
output, these acquisitions have proved very costly for Sappi. The group's
five paper mills in the UK, acquired in 1990, were particularly severely hit
by the British recession, although they have managed to increase market
share.
Similarly, Sappi's high profile purchase of Hannovier Papier the biggest
German producer of coated papers, made in 1992, has also suffered from the
domestic recession there. As a result, the company has proved a severe drain
on resources and its losses have severely depressed Sappi's bottom line
because of their denomination in D-Marks.
However, the sell-off of some assets has recently improved Hannovier's cash
base, and here, too, Sappi feels that it has turned the corner and is in an
excellent position to exploit the upturn.
'Our European operations are very much in the value-added area of the
market, encompassing high-quality coated and uncoated papers, and we expect
to be in the black for 1994,' asserts Mr van As, citing a 24 per cent growth
in exports last year as support for this view.
That investors share this view is evident in Sappi's share price, which has
been buoyant in spite of the the company's recent dismal results.
However, some analysts warn that this picture may be overly rosy,
particularly as much of the group's machinery in the UK and South Africa is
old and outdated, requiring a hefty dose of new capital expenditure over the
next few years.
'The company's basically healthy, but it will probably take a little longer
to achieve substantial profitability, especially in Europe,' warns
Christopher Sloan of brokers Fergusson Brothers Hall Stewart.
Nonetheless, Sappi has managed to increase its market share on the
continent, helped by the successful operations of Sappi Trading, a
Zurich-based marketing arm formed in 1991 that conducts its activities
through Speciality Pulp Trading in Hong Kong and regional distributors in
Europe, Africa and America.
South Africa's increased respectability as a trading partner has allowed the
group to start tapping previously closed markets, and overall exports have
been growing rapidly. Further expansion, particularly in east Asia and the
Americas, is expected over the next few years.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (8): Crackdown on illegal
loggers - Indonesia has the largest rain forest in the world after Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Indonesian forestry ministry recently announced that it had banned
a large timber company from listing shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange,
the move caused a stir. For the ministry imposed the ban because of its
suspicion that the company was involved in illegal logging.
It would certainly not surprise timber industry afficionados if the
allegation were true. What created the interest was that after many years of
complaint about lack of resources and information, the ministry was now
taking steps to enforce the law.
Indonesia has the largest rain forest in the world after Brazil. It totals
144m hectares and covers 70 per cent of its land area. The country has long
been aware of the value of its forestry resources and the need to conserve
them.
Government policy concentrates on control of illegal logging and the
introduction of higher value added products, a reduction in shifting
cultivation by forest dwellers and the provision of new employment, and the
establishment of renewable timber plantations to support a fast-growing pulp
and paper industry.
Log exports were banned in 1985, and low interest loans offered to companies
establishing plywood factories. As a result, exports of plywood have jumped
from USDollars 991m that year to USDollars 3.2bn in 1992. Total exports of
processed wood products, including furniture, reached USDollars 4.2bn in
1992, the third largest export earner after oil and textiles. Principal
markets are Japan and South Korea.
At the same time, the pulp and paper industry has also shown remarkable
growth. The industry has been privatised and capacity is expected to grow
from 1.5m tonnes of pulp and 3.2m tonnes of paper to 14.6m tonnes of pulp
and 7.2m tonnes of paper over the next 10 years.
With pulp production costs of USDollars 250 a tonne, significantly lower
than European and North American producers, Indonesia is expected to become
a significant producer. Exports of pulp and paper have already risen from
188,000 tonnes in 1987 to 660,000 tonnes in 1992.
The timber industry is dominated by the giant Barito Pacific Timer, the
largest listed company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the holder of 5m
hectares of forestry concessions, an area larger than Switzerland.
Barito is controlled by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a young ethnic Chinese
Indonesian businessman with close links to Indonesian President Suharto and
his family. It exports 95 per cent of its annual production of 1.3m cubic
metres of wood products and 90,000 tonnes of adhesives.
Barito had sales of USDollars 459m last year and net profit of USDollars
145m, a rise of almost 100 per cent on the previous year. The company is
benefiting from a rise in plywood prices from around USDollars 300 a cubic
metre in late 1992 to more than USDollars 500 a cubic metre now.
The company made an initial public offering of shares last year, raising
USDollars 292m. It has plans to expand into the pulp industry and has
purchased a total of 660,000 hectares of forestry land, some of which is
already replanted.
Barito last month signed a preliminary agreement with Marubeni and Nippon
Pulp and Paper of Japan to establish a USDollars 1bn pulp plant with a
capacity of 500,000 tons. This is expected to come on stream in 1997. It is
also acquiring timber assets in Malaysia.
Another large ethnic Chinese-owned business group, the third largest in
Indonesia, is the principal participant in the existing pulp and paper
industry. The Sinar Mas group, a long established business with interests in
banking, property, food and agribusiness, controls the two principal listed
companies, Indah Kiat and Tjiwi Kimia.
Indah Kiat, with timber plantations and mills in Sumatra, has production
capacity of 790,000 tonnes of pulp, of which 410,000 tonnes has just come on
stream, and 344,000 tonnes of paper, backed up by a timber concession of
300,000 hectares.
The company had turnover of USDollars 305m in 1993, up 53 per cent on the
previous year but earnings were hit by lower world pulp prices and fell from
USDollars 57m to USDollars 42m.
Brokers W. I. Carr expect a recovery this year as the new pulp output pushes
forecast sales to USDollars 483m and improved export pulp prices and
domestic paper prices increase net profit to USDollars 76m.
Sinar Mas's other big producer, Tjiwi Kimia, has a production capacity of
21,600 tonnes of pulp and 394,000 tonnes of paper. It supplies 35 per cent
of the domestic paper market and 50 per cent of the local stationery market
and exports 40 per cent of its production.
Its expansion plans involve upgrading to high quality papers such as
non-carbon required paper and cast coating paper and installing new
machinery.
The company's turnover last year was up 25 per cent to USDollars 289m and is
forecast to rise by a similar amount this year. Net profit was USDollars
37m, up 19 per cent. A surge in the domestic price of paper to USDollars 900
per tonne, compared with USDollars 600 per tonne internationally will push
up profits this year.
But the government is expected to move to reduce tariffs and surcharge
against imports, currently at 40 per cent, to reduce prices. Nevertheless,
Tjiwi Kimia is expected to increase net profits for 1994 by 39 per cent to
USDollars 51m.
Rapid growth in environmental action groups has accompanied the rise of the
timber industry in Indonesia and companies have been regularly hit by
complaints. Indorayon, a large pulp and rayon producer which had earlier
been accused of polluting water supplies, suffered a serious chlorine leak
at its North Sumatra plant last year and was forced to cease operations for
a time.
Indorayon produces long and short fibre pulp with a capacity of 260,000
tonnes backed up by 269,000ha of tropical forest and 86,000ha of pine
forest. Its rayon plant has a capacity of 60,000 tonnes.
Forestry and environment officials have been quick to investigate listed
companies' pollution controls and have enforced requirements to install
expensive waste treatment facilities. Indah Kiat was fined last year for
allegedly acquiring timber from improper sources.
But environmentalists believe there is still much to be done, especially in
the monitoring of illegal logging. They point out that, according to
Indonesia's own rules on sustainable forest management, the maximum amount
of timber that can be cut is 31.4m cubic metres a year. But actual demand is
44m cubic metres, almost 40 per cent higher.
More effective monitoring of resources, plus better tax collection from
timber corporations are the main recommendations from action groups for the
future control on one of the country's most valuable resources.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (8): Partners see
growth potential - Unrest fails to dent Russia's attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Undeterred by the political upheaval in Russia over the past 12 months,
western power equipment suppliers have been forming a number of joint
ventures to ensure they are positioned to exploit the country's long-term
growth potential.
Leaving aside the controversial issue of where the financing will come from
to fund the virtual rebuilding of the Russian power sector, there is general
agreement among suppliers on what needs to be done.
First, the oldest Chernobyl-type nuclear power stations have to be closed
down, and the newer reactors should be modernised. Secondly, new power
stations have to be built quickly to replace the older nuclear stations -
and for a country with the world's largest gas supplies that suggests
quick-to-build gas-fired combined cycle plants.
Thirdly, the existing gas-fired stations in Russia need to be repowered to
make them more efficient - ending the wastefulness that has developed
because supplies of gas are so plentiful.
The joint ventures are aimed at addressing one or more of these needs but
are also intended to recognise that, as Mr Fritz Gautschi, a senior
executive in ABB's power generation business, puts it, 'Russian potential
clients have little or no hard currency'. This means that, as far as
possible, high-value added machinery has to be built in Russia rather than
imported.
Mr Gautschi sits on the board of two joint ventures which ABB has announced
in the past few months in Russia. In September, the Swiss-Swedish group
formed a joint venture with Saturn, a Russian company that produces
aero-engines and other high-tech equipment. The venture, ABB Uniturbo, will
supply power generation components and was thus a precursor of a second,
bigger deal announced by ABB in January.
In this deal, ABB teamed up with Nevsky Zavod, a big manufacturer of gas and
steam turbines, to create St Petersburg-based ABB Nevsky, which will make
the latest ABB designs of turbines, power plants and related equipment for
the Russian market.
The two ventures have begun with a total workforce of 1,800, and will work
together, with Uniturbo supplying parts to Nevsky. Thus ABB is developing a
network of interdependent plants which is analogous to the system operating
across much of the modern western equipment industry.
One of the challenges, however, is to develop the similarities with the west
throughout the supplier base for the factories. Suppliers of strategic
materials, which after the break-up of the Soviet Union may not even be in
Russia, are having to be educated about supplier-customer relationships,
says Mr Gautschi.
Within the factories, though, ABB is on schedule with such things as
introducing its processes and methods, reorganising layouts, and training
employees. The aim, says Mr Gautschi, is to train local people as quickly as
possible.
Much as in the few other western companies with manufacturing joint ventures
in Russia, the general manager of the ventures is Russian while his deputy
is a non-Russian. ABB has also brought in outsiders as financial controllers
and engineering experts.
Mr Gautschi will not say how much ABB has spent on the ventures, but says it
is a significant sum if all the investment in training, and management time,
is included.
He stresses, though, that the investment is not done out of charity.
Depending on how the first year works out, ABB is looking for the ventures
to start producing a positive payback after about two years.
The ABB ventures are hoping to clinch their first orders in the next few
weeks, but meanwhile Siemens of German has already delivered equipment from
Interturbo, its St Petersburg-based venture with turbine manufacturer LMZ.
Last month, Interturbo completed its second 150MW gas turbine, which like
the first will be incorporated by Siemens into world market projects.
Interturbo will also manufacture four additional gas turbines for the St
Petersburg Northwest combined-cycle cogeneration power station and a further
four units for the Aktyubinsk IPP combined-cycle plant in Kazakhstan.
Last year,Siemens also announced two further power-related ventures in
Russia. In August, it said it would co-operate with Kaluga-based KTZ,
Russia's largest manufacturer of industrial turbines, in the production and
marketing of industrial steam turbines and power plants.
Three months later, Siemens announced it was establishing a Moscow-based
joint venture, Interautomatika, to handle the engineering, sales and
marketing of Siemens instrumentation and control equipment for
fossil-fuelled power plants. Siemens sees the venture as a milestone towards
playing an active role, as a partner in the Russian power supply industry,
in the modernisation of the country's power plants.
If the European suppliers have more solid evidence of activity from their
joint ventures, their US rivals have also been active or are at least hoping
to be so.
Westinghouse last month announced two power-related business agreements
which will significantly increase its presence in Russia.
An agreement signed with Minatom, the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy,
will enable Westinghouse to begin establishing partnerships that will
concentrate on modernisation and safety enhancement of operating nuclear
power plants, and on completing plants that are under construction by
applying current safety technology.
As part of the deal, there will also be a joint venture for the design and
manufacture of instrumentation and control systems and another that will
provide nuclear fuel cycle services worldwide.
In a second agreement with RAO Rossi, the world's largest utility, the US
company will become involved in projects to improve power plant efficiency
and reduce emissions.
The two organisations will jointly pursue opportunities to modernise
existing turbine generation, repower older stations with state-of-the art
equipment, and develop new power projects. The companies will do engineering
jointly, but will also have co-manufacturing initiatives with other leading
Russian companies.
General Electric, meanwhile, does not yet have any direct power-related
joint ventures in Russia, although it was a signatory to a deal in 1991
between Anglo-French GEC Alsthom, with which it has technology links, and
the St Petersburg-based Kirov Works. The venture is producing 25MW gas
turbines for gas-pumping applications.
But Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems Europe, says
Russia is 'pretty fertile ground for partnerships'. GE views itself both as
a supplier of gas turbines to Russia and as a potential partner with a
Russian steam turbine manufacturer to serve the combined cycle market.
In time, GE wants to become a local player in Russia, he says, and would
prefer to develop more of a 'greenfield' partnership with a smaller company
rather than with an existing large organisation.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (7): New ways of taking
the heat - How ABB is working to make gas turbines even more fuel efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thermal efficiency is a key factor in power generation equipment, and it has
long been a barrier to further development of gas turbines.
The conventional way to improve the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine is
to increase the heat of the gases coming through the combustion chamber. But
the problem with that is that the greater the heat, the more durable the
critical components, such as turbine blades, must be.
Manufacturers of both aero engine and industrial gas turbines have for a
long time been straining against the endurance limits of metals and applying
ever more sophisticated techniques to remove heat transmitted from the gas
to the blades.
Through this approach, net thermal efficiency of gas turbines in combined
cycle configurations has risen from the 40 per cent range in the early 1980s
to the 55 per cent level today. However, manufacturers know there is not
much further progress to be made through this route, not least because, as
heat increases, so do nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, one of the three international suppliers of
industrial gas turbines that runs some distance behind market leader General
Electric of the US, startled its competitors last September by announcing a
new range of turbines based on a novel approach to the problem of raising
thermal efficiency.
The main innovation in the new GT series is the adoption of two combustors,
instead of one, installed sequentially along the rotor and separated by a
single-stage turbine. The idea is that more power can be generated for each
increment in heat.
An initial burst of power is generated in the single-stage turbine by the
expanding gases coming out of the first combustor and then further power is
generated in the normal multi-stage turbine following the second combustor.
The concept has long been used in steam turbines.
Zurich based ABB said the first versions of its new GT series turbines would
achieve gross thermal efficiencies of 58 per cent to 58.5 per cent, roughly
two per cent higher than any other machine in the market. This improvement
could give a combined cycle user more than 15 years savings with a present
value of Dollars 40m, ABB claimed.
Ironically, ABB first produced a dual combustor gas turbine in the 1950s,
but with silo type combustors over the top of the turbine. They were well
suited for dealing with difficult fuel combinations, but not particularly
efficient. One problem with them was that the fuel did not spread evenly as
it changed direction to move into the turbine, and so left a high volume of
emissions.
To solve this problem, ABB developed a more efficient, multi-nozzle burner
in the late 1980s, which it claimed would reduce NOx emissions from 60 parts
per million to 25ppm.
At the same time, it was developing an anular combustor system similar to
those used in aero-engines. The idea is to wrap the combustor nozzles around
the turbine so that the fuel flows evenly - and in-line rather than
perpendicularly - into the compressed air stream, contributing to better
performance as well as fewer emissions.
ABB installed its first anular combustor in a peaking power turbine built by
Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan under licence for Tokyo Electric Power
last year. It is a 164MW 50-cycle (hz) installation, and the design was
approved for general use in Japan by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) at the beginning of this year.
From there, it was a relatively small step to think of putting anular
combustors into a sequential combustion configuration. One potential
complication was that the whole machine would have to be lengthened to
accommodate the extra turbine and combustor, possibly creating a need for a
third bearing and perhaps a second rotor. But ABB found that its rotor, made
of welded discs, was strong enough to support the additional load suspended
between two bearings at each end.
The company is offering two GT models. The GT24 for 60 cycle power systems
is to produce 165 MW of power and achieve gross efficiency of 58 per cent in
combined cycle applications. The GT26 for 50 cycle applications, will
produce 240MW of power and achieve 58.5 per cent efficiency.
The claimed Dollars 40m cost saving from these systems was based on a 15
year period, with 20 per cent equity financing, an average nine per cent
interest rate and a fuel cost of Dollars 5 per million Btu. 'The saving
would be greater if the fuel price goes higher,' says Fritz Gautschi, senior
vice-president and general manager of ABB's turbine division.
ABB announced an initial Dollars 50m order for the GT24 from Jersey Central
Power and Light in New Jersey, USA, which will initially be a single cycle
peaking power application. It is to be delivered at the end of this year and
upgraded to combined cycle by September, 1996.
The group has been very pleased with the reaction to its new approach.
'There has been enormous interest from customers and from engineering
consultants, and a total absence of mudslinging from our competitors,' Mr
Gautschi says.
That is not to say that competitors are uncritical. Mr Rodger Bricknell,
vice-president, marketing and product management of GE industrial and power
systems, suspects the claimed efficiency gains will be less than advertised
once the gross figures are boiled down to net figures.
ABB concedes that GE's best performing F series turbine at Seoinchon in
Korea achieves net efficiency of 55.3 per cent, only 1.4 points less than
the planned level of the GT24. But the average of the eight turbines
installed at Seoinchon is over two points lower, ABB believes.
Bricknell also wonders if the GT24 is going to operate at a significantly
lower temperature than the 2,350F of the F series. ABB said it would be
'slightly below'.
Bricknell says GE believes there were ways other than sequential combustion
of achieving significant thermal efficiency gains, 'but we are not in the
habit of giving the competition something to shoot at'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (7): A region well
positioned to cash in - Latin America's forest industry has continued to
expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America's forestry industry, dominated by Brazil and Chile which
account for 90 per cent of regional exports, has continued to expand in the
face of tough global conditions. Although some companies saw profit margins
squeezed last year - as new capacity came on stream just when the market hit
rock-bottom - most are well placed to take advantage of any sustained
upturn.
As profits in the northern hemisphere are sapped by tough environmental
requirements and high costs of labour, energy and transport, production of
pulp and other wood products is seeping south.
Latin America, which boasts 27 per cent of world forests, is well positioned
to cash in. Costs are generally low and environmental legislation, although
tightening, is more lax as governments drive for economic growth.
The continent's greatest asset is its climate. In Brazil trees grow all year
round, halving the normal cycle of eucalyptus plantations to five years.
Radiata pine, which accounts for 80 per cent of Chile's 1.6m hectares of
plantations, grows in a quarter of the time it takes in Canada.
Such natural advantages have led to huge investments in Brazil and Chile,
where an estimated Dollars 9bn was spent between 1987 and 1992, mainly in
the pulp sector. Such investment has transformed Latin America from a net
importer of wood products in 1987 into an important exporter, now accounting
for 15 per cent of world pulp supply. Analysts predict that, within 10
years, Latin America could be accounting for 30 per cent of global trade.
Although Chile faced tough conditions last year, Eladio Susaeta, of Chile's
Wood Corporation, predicts a 20 per cent rise in export volumes in 1994 and
earnings of Dollars 1.45bn. Mr Juan Moya of the National Forestry
Corporation (Conaf) sees industry confidence reflected in last year's
130,000 hectares of new forest, at 10ha per Chilean, one of the world's
highest planting rates.
The industry, entirely privately-owned, has advanced rapidly since the
mid-70s when it counted on only 300,000ha and exports of Dollars 125m.
Generous planting subsidies have quintupled the area of man-made forests,
which should double again to 3mha by 2005.
Planting is expected to continue apace, despite the end of state subsidies
next March, because of the commercial incentives to supply Chile's six pulp
mills which have a total annual capacity of 2m tonnes. Three mills came on
stream in 1992, all with substantial foreign participation, nearly doubling
potential output. One, the Santa Fe plant, fed by eucalyptus, marks a trend
towards faster-growing hardwoods for the production of short-fibre
cellulose. The Santa Fe mill, a Dollars 460m joint venture between Scott
Paper of the US, Royal Dutch/Shell and Citibank, has a 230,000-tonne annual
capacity.
Pulp makes up less than half of Chile's forestry exports, with sawn wood,
planks and chips also exported. Several Chilean companies are looking at
projects in Argentina's potentially rich, but underdeveloped, forestry
sector.
Unlike Chile, Brazil's industry has not had the advantage of a stable
macro-economic environment, but has managed to prosper despite regular
changes at the finance ministry and skyrocketing inflation. Some Dollars 6bn
has been invested in as many years, with billions more waiting for better
conditions at home and abroad.
The industry has exploded over the past two decades, trebling output of
paper and board and lifting pulp production from 1.1m tonnes in 1973 to 5m
tonnes currently. In 1992, Aracruz Celulose became the world's biggest
producer of short-fibre pulp, earning Dollars 460m from sales of 977,000
tonnes after a Dollars 1.2bn expansion of its Espirito Santo mill.
The potential for further increases in installed capacity are enormous.
Mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce - which has five big
reforestation and pulping projects, some involving Japanese investment -
could boost pulp output by 1.7m tonnes by 2000.
Brazil, in contrast to Chile, has a huge internal market of 150m people
which devours 75 per cent of domestically-produced paper and more than 60
per cent of pulp. But this still leaves about 1.3m tonnes of paper and 2m
tonnes of pulp for export which last year fetched Dollars 1.5bn.
In addition to pulp and paper, Brazil also earns more than Dollars 500m
annually from exports of logs, planks and wood manufactures. This year, pulp
and paper production are expected to rise by 8 and 6 per cent respectively,
according to Mr Horacio Cherkassky, president of industry association ANFPC.
Few doubt Brazil's potential to better its ranking as the world's eighth
biggest pulp producer.
Such expansion plans will need, however, to take account of Latin America's
growing environmental awareness. In Chile, for example, where a law on
native forests is working its way through parliament, much controversy has
been raised by the commercial exploitation of 100-year-old native lenga
trees to provide woodchips for Japan. Last year, Chile earned more than
Dollars 100m through exporting chips produced predominantly from native
forest species.
Forestry companies argue that native forests are exploited rationally in a
manner which protects by placing a commercial value on land that might
otherwise be cleared for agricultural use. Mr Moya of Conaf says the subject
has provoked 'much passion and little logic' and that Chile, a poor country,
must make adequate use of its resources. Conaf says that 90 per cent of
Chile's forestry industry uses man-made wood.
Mr Nicolo Gligo, a Santiago-based UN expert, says the industry could be
sustainable, but only if tougher regulations are enforced. He would like to
see a ban on all chips produced from native species. Of industry claims that
it plants more trees than are felled, he says: 'I am in favour of
plantations but in addition to, not as a replacement of, native forests.'
Whatever merits differing arguments may have, the fact remains that 200mha
of Latin America forest have been destroyed in the past 30 years, according
to the Food and Agriculture Organisation. If the forestry industry is to
enjoy a long, prosperous future in the continent it must reverse that trend.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (6): Tormented by the rising
yen - Huge problems are besetting the Japanese industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's paper industry is going through the shredder. Plagued by
over-capacity, poor demand, plunging prices and high financial costs, the
industry has most recently been tormented by the ever appreciating yen.
Corporate profitability has plunged. But if the causes of the Japanese paper
industry's present crisis are deceptively simple, the remedies remain
elusive.
The scale of the problems besetting the Japanese paper industry are huge,
but the most significant remains over-capacity, a self-inflicted wound.
During the bubble years of the late 1980s, paper demand increased 1.3 times
GNP growth, which itself was buoyant at that time. As paper and board
selling prices rose and raw material prices sank, thanks to the rising yen,
so virtually every company took advantage of cheap funding to increase
capacity. Paper manufacturing capacity rose from 13.5m tonnes in 1987 to
19.5m tonnes by 1991 as 43 state-of-the art paper machines came on stream.
The basic problem facing the industry is that this 44 per cent rise in
capacity was not matched by a commensurate increase in demand. Indeed, as
the new capacity came on stream, Japan began to slip into the longest and
deepest recession since the second world war, an economic downturn which
continues to grip the country. Demand for paper and board, which during 1992
tumbled for the first time in 11 years, fell again last year, according to
the Japan Paper Association (JPA).
'Demand for newsprint, wood-free printing papers, and art papers all fell
last year,' says Kiyoshi Shirakawa, deputy general manager of the
international department. 'Only light-coated papers increased.'
'The Japanese market is in deep depression. There is no growth and there is
massive oversupply in almost every grade. Paper prices are falling and most
companies are losing money,' explains Mr Tadahiro Kondo, general manager of
the international division of the JPA.
The plight of the industry, already suffering from weak demand and excess
capacity, has been exacerbated by the appreciation of the yen which has
sucked in imports and hit the ability of Japanese paper manufacturers to
export their excess production. The US dollar, valued at Y145 in 1990,
plummeted to nearly Y100 this month (May).
Japanese paper exports plunged by 31.7 per cent last year to only 474,400
tonnes, while paperboard exports also slid, down 23.3 per cent to 161,700
tonnes. Barclays de Zoete Wedd estimates imports of paper and board rose
just under 10 per cent last year, although volumes remain small at about
110,000 tonnes a year, according to Mr Kondo at the JPA.
Given poor demand at home and abroad, falling exports and rising imports,
output of paper and board fell for the second year running during 1993, down
1.9 per cent at 27.7m tonnes. Meanwhile, paper production, which had fallen
2.6 per cent in 1992, dropped another 2.4 per cent this year, according to
the JPA. Operating rates have fallen brutally, from 93.7 per cent in 1989 to
82.1 per cent last year. Brokers Smith New Court expect them to fall further
to 79.5 per cent.
The impact of overcapacity on prices has been brutal. In the last quarter of
1993, the prices of tissue paper fell 16 per cent, while high-grade paper
tumbled 12 per cent. The prices of almost every grade of paper, except
newsprint remain on a downward curve.
Corporate profits among the paper companies have fallen five years running.
The sector's pre-tax profits are now almost entirely dependent upon sales of
marketable securities, according to Smith New Court. Both Mitsubishi Paper
and Settsu were forced to sell these to avoid losses during the first half
of last year, for example.
Faced with such a dire environment, the Japanese paper and pulp industry has
reacted by implementing a series of gigantic mergers. In April last year,
two of the country's largest groups, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp,
fused to create Nippon Paper Industries, Japan's biggest paper company by
turnover.
The following October, Oji Paper, the country's largest paper maker, and
Kanzaki Paper, the seventh biggest, also combined to create New Oji Paper,
Japan's largest paper manufacturer in terms of tonnage. Smaller alliances
include the link between Honshu Paper, the leading paperboard manufacturer,
and Takasaki Paper, the 11th largest paper group, to share distribution and
purchasing channels.
The benefits of such mergers have not yet fully materialised, however. Sales
and distribution costs have been cut, as have financial costs, but the
willingness to reduce labour costs - representing about 12 per cent of all
costs - remains limited. The paper companies, like other Japanese groups,
are reluctant to make compulsory redundancies, cutting the number of
employees through reduced graduate recruitment and early retirement. Nippon
Paper Industries has managed to cut its headquarters staff by 400 since the
merger through such means. But according to BZW, the only company to cut
aggressively has been Tomoegawa Paper which is in particular difficulties.
Another response has been to sell assets in an effort to reduce debt.
Daishowa Paper Manufacturing, Japan's third largest paper group, has been
forced to announce a five-year restructuring plan aimed at reducing debt
from Y434bn in March this year to Y270bn. In addition, two creditor banks,
the Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, and a shareholder, Marubeni,
have sent in managers to help management. The company expects to make a net
loss of Y28.2bn during the current financial year.
The prospects for the industry remain grim. The price of pulp, representing
half of raw material costs which in turn represents 42 per cent of total
costs, have begun to rise. Previously, the paper companies had been
benefiting from a fall in pulp prices from a peak six years ago of Dollars
820 a tonne, to a low last year of Dollars 370, according to Nippon Paper
Industries. Prices in December reached Dollars 500 a tonne, the company
adds.
The big question is whether the paper companies will be able to make price
increases stick given the sickly state of demand. BZW does not expect them
to succeed. The danger is the paper groups will be caught between rising
pulp prices - partly offset by the appreciation of the yen - and static
paper prices. Their unwillingness to cut capacity - and cede market share -
means there is unlikely to be an improvement on the supply side. The one
exception has been Nippon Paper Industries which scrapped a plant at
Yatushiro last June.
Meanwhile, most of the industry's overseas investments has been aimed at
securing upstream supplies. The industry has wood supply ventures in
Australia, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the US, Canada, Brazil and
Chile. Last year, for example, New Oji Paper and Nissho-Iwai formed an
acacia and eucalyptus plantation joint venture on New Britain Island.
Mr Kyoji Hanamizu, general manager of public relations at Nippon Paper
Industries, says it is highly unlikely his company will build capacity in
Japan for a long time. Any new production is likely to be linked with the
company's plantations, probably in Indonesia where the company is
participating in a Y100bn 450,000 tonnes a year pulp mill based on acacia
trees. Given the high operating costs in Japan, the future of the Japanese
industry is clearly going to be overseas.

on their frequent visits to his company's headquarters in Glasgow. He puts
them up in a company guesthouse with a Chinese cook.
Doing business in China is all about building long-term relationships and
establishing trust, says Mr Gibson, chairman of Gibson Group. For the small
but fast-growing power plant contractor, these relationships are vital - all
its business is in China.
Mr Gibson worked for Babcock before setting up an engineering contracting
business, Gibson Wells, in 1978. Four years later, the company was sold to
Foster Wheeler, but not before it had won a contract to build the power
station for the Daqing oilfield in Heilongjiang province.
In 1990, Mr Gibson bought the company back from Foster Wheeler for a nominal
sum. He had been working in the late 1980s for GEC selling power stations in
China, and saw a 'massive niche' building smaller power stations there that
would not interest the big boys of the industry.
Having completed one contract already, albeit some years previously, Mr
Gibson had a head start in winning further business in China. Since 1990,
his company has picked up three more power contracts, all for coal-fired chp
plants: two 30MW stations, Wa Fang Dian and Che Re Gou at Dalian, and a
Pounds 35m contract for a plant at Fushun.
Much to Mr Gibson's surprise, he also won a contract last year from the
Dalian Municipal Engineering Department to supply a traffic light system for
the southern Chinese city. Gibson Group has no expertise in traffic lights,
but Dalian wanted to work with the company, and Gibson Group is now working
with GEC to fulfil the contract.
Already, the company has won some Pounds 70m of business from China and
turnover is running at Pounds 35m a year. Signing of a contract worth about
Pounds 65m for a 120MW coalfired CHP station at Dadong, Guangxi province, is
near.
All this for a company with fewer than 50 employees and only six permanent
staff in China, in two offices in Beijing. Mr Gibson has often considered
increasing the Chinese representation, but says the Chinese want to work
with a British company and have the opportunity to visit the UK.
Mr Gibson, meanwhile, has made around 40 trips to China building the
long-term relationships that have brought success. 'They trust us,' he says.
Patience, he makes clear, is a virtue when negotiating contracts - 'nobody
can make a decision, but everybody has a veto,' says Mr Gibson. The process
can take years, and it is always necessary to have some talks continuing
while other contracts are being carried out, to maintain momentum. The
company has already spent three years - and Pounds 600,000 - bidding for the
Dadong contract.
But Mr Gibson quotes a saying that often proves to be the case when it seems
that negotiations have become bogged down intractably: 'In China, everything
is impossible, but anything is possible.' In other words, somehow, a way
will be found round a problem.
Mr Gibson has also benefited from good contacts at home. Former Prime
Minister Edward Heath has helped the company, and Mr Gibson will be
accompanying Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, on a visit to China in
the autumn.
He has also struck up a good relationship with the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). While some
exporters moan about the help they receive, Mr Gibson says he has received
strong support. The four recent Chinese contracts were financed with aid
from the UK, while the forthcoming job will be paid for with a
'super-subsidised loan'.
Mr Gibson is now positioning the company to participate in much larger power
station contracts in China, up to about 350MW. The company is working very
closely with Rolls-Royce on one contract for which Gibson Group is
contributing its relationships with the prospective Chinese clients. But it
needs to work with Rolls-Royce and similar companies to handle contracts of
such a size, says Mr Gibson.
For the future, a number of smaller Chinese contracts are being discussed,
along with three much larger build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes involving
Mission Energy of the US and Rolls-Royce. Each scheme would be worth about
Pounds 300m, says Mr Gibson, but it will take another two years to get
contracts signed.
Mr Gibson has been looking very seriously at Vietnam, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Indonesia, but has plenty to do in China even if he has all
his eggs in one basket.
He is not worried by the political problems between the UK and China over
the future of Hong Kong, although he says the row is 'bloody annoying'.
Echoing a view typical of UK businessmen eyeing the Chinese market, he asks
why democracy is suddenly so important now in Hong Kong when it wasn't 10,
50 or 100 years ago.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (6): Faint smell of gas
 -Trends among Asia's utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The uphill campaign by independent power producers to establish a strategic
foothold in the state-dominated Asian electricity industry has received a
sharp boost in the past year as a result of several private sector projects.
At the same time, overall energy growth in Asia will boom at 4 per cent per
year over the next 20 years, says the International Atomic Energy Agency,
more than double the growth in the west.
Natural gas will be the fastest growing energy fuel in the region, providing
a further spur to independent producers as gas-fired units can be built
twice as fast as coal units.
The recently-negotiated projects underline the growing acceptance by
national governments, notably in South Asia and Southeast Asia, of the need
for greater public accountability and the reduction in electricity price
subsidisation. These changes in perception are helping establish a more
hospitable environment for independents to negotiate their deals.
In India, the US Enron Power Development Group signed a 20-year power
purchase agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which will
allow it to supply the first phase of a 2,015MW gas-fired (LNG) powered
plant and related facilities.
The scale and nature of the project - costing more than Dollars 2bn and
using an imported fuel - makes the deal exceptional in a catalogue of some
70 Indian power projects seeking private sector partnerships. The first
phase, now nearing construction start, calls for a 695MW unit costing
Dollars 930m, to be followed by a 1,320MW second phase. Equity partners with
Enron are General Electric and Bechtel of the US.
The build-own-operate project will recoup its costs from the MSEB through
the sale of power at 7.5 US cents per kilowatt hour. The deal followed about
18 months of negotiations - not long by international standards - and came
on the heels of a similar package of independent power deals involving
British companies National Power, British Gas and Rolls-Royce, the largest
of which is a 1,000MW coal-fired power station at Visakhapatnam on the
Andhra Pradesh Coast.
Independent power producers are also encouraged by the success in Indonesia
of a US-Japanese consortium's 1,200MW coal-fired Paiton power project on
east Java. The deal is the first sizeable independent power deal in
Indonesia and involves project leader Mission Energy of the US and partners
General Electric of the US, Mitsui of Japan and PT Batu Hitam Perkasa of
Indonesia. Construction will start early next year with full power from the
project planned for early 1998.
The breakthrough in Asia's third-most populated country, after China and
India, has sent power plant equipment suppliers and potential project
sponsors scurrying to the archipelago.
Enron, for example, recently submitted a feasibility study for a joint
venture agreement for Indonesia's first large gas-fired plant in East Java.
The 500MW integrated power project is aimed at taking advantage of Jakarta's
policy to bring gas-fired power generation into Indonesia's mix of coal, oil
and hydroelectric power generating stations.
The restructuring of the industry is not limited to independent power groups
setting up alongside state utilities. There is also the overhaul and, in
some cases, market flotation of the state groups themselves. The main
reasons are to ensure the delivery of efficient electricity plant quickly
and to relieve the state of the onerous financial burden of build all plant
under its own wing.
Legislation was passed in Pakistan in April to authorise the sale to the
private sector of thermal power stations operated by the Water and Power
Development Authority. Indonesia's PLN is also being prepared for a minority
flotation, along the lines, two years ago, of the 22 per cent divestiture by
the Malaysian government of Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the state utility.
Thailand's Electricity Generating Authority is preparing to set up private
sector subsidiaries and is hiving off some thermal power units to
independent power operations. The Manila government is grooming the National
Power Corp. for flotation and plans to allow power distributors to built
their own power stations. Even Singapore's efficient Public Utilities Board
has announced that its gas and electricity business will be commercialised
in about two years.
It is doing so as it prepares the groundwork for the Dollars 5bn 4,800MW
Tuas oil-to-gas power complex, to be built by the end of the century.
In terms of equipment supply, the ascendancy of gas as an important power
station fuel is stimulating more interest in gas-fired projects, both by
independents and the state utilities. Despite the move to privatisation, it
is state utilities which still provide the vast majority of orders, although
this is diminishing steadily.
According to David Genever-Watling, chief executive of General Electric
Industrial Power Systems of the US, the Asian power generation equipment
market should account for 45 per cent of all power equipment orders in the
1990s. This meant 462,000MW of power equipment orders. Of this, 206,000MW
would be for coal/steam turbines and 84,000MW for hydropower, emphasising
the point that hydro and coal potential in Asia are available in enormous
quantities, albeit not always in the right places.
Significantly, gas, which scarcely figured in the equation a decade ago, is
now looming larger, with a prediction of 82,000MW for combined-cycle and
37,000MW for gas turbines. GE's prediction also noted that nuclear equipment
over the next 10 years would account for 50,000MW of orders, although this
is concentrated mainly in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.
China is only now making its first foray into nuclear and Indonesia will not
be a factor for a decade.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (2): Paperwork expands -
Forest products fight for survival in the electronic age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of a paperless society has hung over the forest products
industry for decades. As people turn from newspapers to television, from
letters to phone calls, and from office memos to electronic mail, paper
should be going the same way as quill pens, copper kettles and buggy whips.
Yet paper consumption continues to grow.
Even in North America, where the electronic age has progressed furthest,
demand grew by an average of just over 2 per cent a year between 1971 and
1990.
Jaakko Poyry, the Helsinki-based consultancy, forecasts that consumption in
North America will rise by 1.6 per cent a year to 2005, with average
personal use climbing from 300 kg to 309 kg. 'There's still a psychological
desire for the feel of paper,' says Mr Dick Storat, chief economist at the
American Forest and Paper Association in Washington DC.
The growth of electronics has brought some comfort to paper makers. Computer
suppliers have yet to find a substitute for their bulky manuals. Computer
magazines have mushroomed. Products such as uncoated freesheet, otherwise
known as plain white paper, have gained a new lease of life. As personal
computers become just another household appliance, the paper used for
printers has become a value-added consumer product, complete with brand
names and fancy packaging.
Could forestry industry leaders be lulling themselves into a false sense of
security? Mr Henrik Ehrnrooth, Jaakko Poyry's chief executive, cautions that
forestry has traditionally been a capital-intensive rather than a
technology-driven industry.
Research and development spending is low compared to many other sectors. The
forestry industry's conservatism is reflected in a widespread assumption
that future growth in paper consumption will come mainly from incremental
improvements to existing products, rather than an exciting breakthrough that
could dramatically broaden paper's horizons.
Pressure from the environmental movement has diverted much of the industry's
R&amp;D and new capital investment towards conserving and recycling paper,
rather than finding new uses for it. Some companies are going even further
by experimenting with materials other than wood as an ingredient in fresh
paper.
Weyerhaeuser, the US forest-products group, is using pulped wheatgrass from
fields in central Oregon as a supplement to woodpulp. Other US producers are
working on ways to revive the old Chinese practice of making paper from
hemp.
A process similar to paper-making has been developed to produce lightweight
'spunbond' fabrics from natural and synthetic fibres. These fabrics are
increasingly used for diapers and sanitary towels. In Japan, scientists are
said to have found ways of producing synthetic cellulose fibres, the basic
ingredient of paper. For the moment, none of these alternative materials
seems likely to displace wood entirely as a raw material. But everyone
acknowledges that technology is moving at a rapid and unpredictable pace.
Paper makers' confidence in the future rests mainly on the assumption that
fast-growing demand in newly-industrialising countries, especially China and
south-east Asia, will more than make up for slackening consumption in the
developed world. Consumption in China is currently only about 20 kg a person
every year, about 5 per cent of the level in North America.
Most paper companies' efforts to broaden consumption centre on producing new
grades with a combination of improved brightness, printability, smoothness
and strength.
Paper is now used in such diverse products as hospital gowns and heavy bags
that store animal feed or heavy automotive parts.
Each producer hopes that its own new grade will find a niche where
competition is minimal and margins high. SCA, the Swedish group, measures
its managers' performance partly by the number of new products they launch.
Not surprisingly, some new products are more successful than others.
Extra-smooth and bright newsprint has enabled newspapers to improve
dramatically the quality of their colour reproduction. But demand for coated
kraftliner - thick cardboard with a glossy white finish, designed as a
packaging material for items such as fine glassware - has been
disappointing.
Forest products companies are also seeking new uses for their raw material.
The popularity of engineered wood products, which share many attributes of
building materials such as steel and aluminium, has grown enormously in
recent years.
Wood components are increasingly being assembled into entire roofing and
flooring systems.
Canfor Corporation of Vancouver puts grass seed and wood-fibre residues on a
textile base to make lightweight 'take-home' lawns, which can be rolled out
in a garden like a carpet. Another Canfor product, known as Woodmat, is
formed into interior car door panels, dashboards, kitchen cabinets and
packaging trays. Much of the industry's effort is directed at replacing
increasingly restricted supplies of high-quality, old-growth timber with
smaller, lower-quality trees.
Mr Chip Dillon,an analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York, predicts that
North American production of oriented strand board, which is made from
multiple strands of low-quality timber, will grow by 6bn sq ft over the next
four years. Plywood capacity will shrink by at least 2bn sq ft.
Some questions about forest products' future may be answered by an ambitious
US task force which was set up in August 1993 by the Environmental Defence
Fund and six big paper consumers, including McDonald's (fast food), Johnson
&amp; Johnson (healthcare products), Time Inc. (magazines), Prudential Assurance
and NationsBank.
The participants plan to consult a wide range of groups involved with paper,
including producers, environmentalists, investment bankers and graphic
designers, in the hope of learning how paper can meet world demands. The
taskforce is expected to complete its work in early 1995.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (5): Newcomer with a strong
base - Profile, AssiDoman is Sweden's fourth largest forestry group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AssiDoman has just joined the branks of Europe's top ten forestry groups,
and Lennart Ahlgren, its president, is clearly relishing every minute of the
experience.
Not only does he display an ebullient confidence in wood as a raw material -
'I firmly believe this is a product for the future' - but he has a clear
strategic vision of the group's development. 'Our objective is to be
Europe's leading company in the fields of packaging paper, paper-based
packaging and sawn timber,' he states.
Lest anyone should doubt him, Mr Ahlgren has been busy even in the few weeks
since AssiDoman emerged in its current form, following a state-orchestrated
merger and privatisation. It has made a successful bid for Ncb, a partially
state-owned forestry group, and acquired a Swedish saw-milling operation.
Further acquisitions would seem only to be a question of time, not least
because the company wants to make good use of its financial strength to back
its strategic ambitions.
A lot has happened in a short time. A few months ago, AssiDoman did not even
exist. It was formed at the start of the year from the merger of two wholly
state-owned forestry groups, Assi and Doman. In March it gained new 590,000
shareholders when the state sold out 49 per cent of its holding, garnering
SKr7.6bn in Sweden's largest ever privatisation. When shares in the group
began trading last month, its market capitalisation amounted to SKr16bn.
With 1993 sales of SKr14.6bn, AssiDoman is Sweden's fourth largest forestry
group after Stora, SCA and MoDo. It claims to be the world's largest private
forest owner, with 3.4m hectares of productive forest land. It also ranks as
Europe's fourth largest producer of sawn goods, with annual output of
950,000 cubic metres, and one of Europe's five biggest producers of
corrugated board. Operations span nine European countries, with 5,000 of the
group's 12,000 employees based outside Sweden.
Mr Ahlgren says the emphasis on packaging and large forest holdings provide
the group with considerable resilience in an industry notorious for its
cyclical peaks and troughs. But this is just one aspect of a strategy based
on high-quality products, added value, and greater material processing.
The starting point for the strategy is virgin fibre, which is hardly
surprising given the company's extensive forestry reserves. 'We will
concentrate on virgin fibre and will invest in existing mills in Sweden to
upgrade production,' says Mr Ahlgren. In fact, the Ahlgren philosophy can be
summarised by the word 'concentration' - concentration on virgin fibre,
concentration on sawn goods, concentration on packaging and packaging
material. 'We won't get involved in printing and writing papers or tissue,'
he stresses.
The other priority is financial stability. The group has a healthy cash
flow, and an equity-to-assets ratio which, at around 50 per cent, is
surpassed by few forestry groups worldwide. Results are on rising trend,
with a profit of between SKr1.2bn and SKr1.5bn expected for this year, after
last year's SKr876m.
Without the strong financial base, it is unlikely that the group would be
emphasising its expansion strategy so forcefully. The programme can be
summarised as follows:
In Sweden, the company will continue to build up its saw-mill operations,
both by investment and acquisitions, aiming to reach an annual production
level of 1.1m to 1.2m cubic metres in the next two years.
In Europe, where many of the packaging operations are based, the group wants
to be close to its markets and is looking to bolster its position in
segments like corrugated board. Although it has a relatively strong market
position in the UK, Danish and Swedish markets, its share in countries like
France and Germany is low.
The acquisition of Ncb - a packaging company - will not leave much of a dent
in AssiDoman's finances, as the bid only valued the company at some
SKr1.4bn. But most analysts believe Mr Ahlgren is hatching something bigger,
including, possibly, a strike at his former company, Korsnas, where he was
managing director for seven years. Though coy on the subject, Mr Ahlgren
admits there would be a 'natural overlap' with Korsnas, which is also strong
in packaging and sawn timber. There have also been suggestions that the
group might be interested in buying MoDo Packaging from MoDo.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (4): Trees are being cut
down to size - Recycling continues to increase, but can it replace the
forest?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste paper recycling has become a way of life in most industrial countries.
But in the process, it has raised issues for the forest-products industry
which are far from mundane.
The crux of the problem in North America is that mills are concerned about
their ability to collect enough waste paper to meet recycling targets.
In Europe, the problem is precisely the opposite. Legislative decrees and
government subsidies have flooded the market with used paper at rock-bottom
prices.
The trend towards recovering and recycling used paper is furthest advanced
in Germany. By mid-1995, 80 per cent of used packaging paper and paperboard
will be collected, and at least 80 per cent of that will be recycled.
Legislation is also in the pipeline requiring the collection of 60 per cent
of newsprint, magazine and office wastepaper.
In the US, the American Forest and Paper Association estimates that, for the
first time last year, more paper was recovered than was sent to landfills.
Nearly 60 per cent of corrugated materials but only one-third of all
packaging paper is recycled.
US papermakers aim to recycle half of all waste paper by 2000, compared with
about 40 per cent now. Dick Storat, the AFPA's chief economist, estimates
that to reach this target, the collection rate for corrugated material will
have to reach 80-85 per cent in urban areas.
US paper mills find it increasingly difficult, however, to lay their hands
on cheap recyclable material.
They face stiff competition from local governments and from a growing number
of waste-to-energy plants. Mr Storat estimates that about 10 per cent of
paper which might normally go to landfills or recycling plants is being
channelled into energy generation.
Municipalities are eager to collect recyclable materials to help raise money
for their waste-management services. The terms of bond issues floated to
finance waste-to-energy plants frequently require municipalities to control
the flow of combustible materials.
The paper companies want free-market forces rather than municipal ordinances
to decide what happens to discarded paper. 'Trust us to put it in the
products where it makes the most sense,' Mr Storat says.
Two cases before the US Supreme Court, involving ordinances passed in
California and New York, are expected to help clarify the contentious issue
of when a household or business gives up ownership of its waste material.
At present, the recycled content of different types of paper varies widely.
Recycled fibre makes up more than 90 per cent of low-grade corrugated
materials and 80 per cent of board produced in the European Union. But the
proportion is only 7 per cent in fine printing and writing papers, where the
strength and cleanliness of virgin fibres have so far proved irreplaceable.
The degree to which recycled material can continue to replace virgin fibres
is a tricky question for forestry companies. Enthusiasm for recycling among
Scandinavian and Canadian producers in particular, is tinged with
nervousness about the future of their vast investments in trees.
'There's a misunderstanding that recycling can replace the forest,' says Jan
Remrod, director-general of the Swedish Pulp and Paper Association. The
industry has strong misgivings over a Belgian proposal for an 'eco-tax',
which would be levied on virgin materials as a way of pressuring paper
producers to raise the recycled content of their products.
The forestry companies have so far been able to demonstrate that
high-quality papers require a high proportion of clean, strong virgin
fibres. Even recycled material needs to be topped up with
fresh-from-the-forest fibre. Scientists estimate that cellulose fibres
cannot be recycled more than five or six times, even for the lowest-grade
paper products.
The forestry companies also hope to convince environmental groups and
consumers that trees are among nature's most renewable products. Not only do
new trees grow where old ones are cut down, but recycled fibres can be used
as a fuel when they are too worn, dirty or short for paper-making.
The problem for the industry is that the tide is moving towards an
ever-higher recycled content in an ever-widening variety of products. The
technology to de-ink printed papers is improving by leaps and bounds.
The AFPA forecasts that the rate of growth in consumption of all grades of
recovered paper will far outstrip new production capacity over the next two
years.
In the case of printing and writing papers, demand for recovered material is
projected to jump by more than a third, compared with a 6 per cent increase
in capacity. The recycled-content in these grades is expected to rise from
10 per cent to 15 per cent over the next six years.
David Refkin, director of magazine paper purchasing at Time Inc, the big US
publisher, predicts that at least three-quarters of the 250,000 tons of
paper Time buys each year - mostly lightweight coated groundwood grades -
will be recycled stock by 1996.
Sensing which way the wind is blowing, Scandinavian and North American
companies are now directing the lion's share of their capital spending to
facilities based on recycled materials.
Commercial common-sense dictates that mills whose main feedstock is waste
paper are more likely to be built close to heavily-populated urban centres
than to natural forests.
The Nordic forestry companies' biggest projects at present are the
recycled-newsprint mills being put up by Finland's Enzo-Gutzeit, near
Leipzig, Germany, and by SCA of Sweden at Aylesford in the UK. MacMillan
Bloedel, of Vancouver, has spent years trying to gain regulatory approval
for a CDollars 1bn recycled-newsprint mill near Sacramento, California.
A growing number of producers are also moving into waste paper collection as
a means of securing their raw-material supplies. In their search for a cheap
but reliable source of waste paper, many North American tissue makers now
place their own collection bins at strategic points in urban areas.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products  (3): Green lobby focuses on
logging practices - Management of trees has become a hot topic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Axel Springer, the big German publishing house, sent its paper suppliers a
detailed questionnaire late last year, requesting information on their
forestry practices.
In March, two UK paper companies cancelled pulp contracts with MacMillan
Bloedel, the Canadian forest products group, after environmental groups
threatened to organise consumer boycotts in protest at 'clear-cut' logging
in British Columbia. Incidents like these confirm that forest management has
become a hot topic, with increasingly tangible commercial consequences.
Companies that cannot demonstrate 'good' techniques are facing the threat of
customer boycotts. In Nordic countries and North America, the issue of which
trees to cut and how to cut them now grabs more headlines than pollution by
pulp and paper mills, the industry's traditional environmental bugbear.
Concern has arisen because of fears that logging is systematically
destroying biodiversity, in contravention of the Rio environmental accords
of 1992. It is not just a question of whether replanting exceeds harvesting
levels. It is also about protecting old trees, animal species, soil quality
and unique environments. In Sweden, for example, as many as 200 species are
thought to be threatened because of the impact of conventional forestry
practices.
Environmental pressures to protect forests have helped push lumber prices to
record levels in recent years. The volume of timber sold by US government
agencies has shrunk from 12.5bn board feet in 1987 to an estimated 4.5bn
board feet this year. The impact has been most keenly felt in the US
north-west, where efforts to protect the spotted owl have halted logging in
federally-owned forests.
The Clinton administration promised last year to relax the curbs. The
administration proposed a compromise in late April, which would allow
limited logging in the area - provided the plan does not become bogged down
in the courts by forestry companies or environmentalists, both of which are
unhappy with some of its contents.
Environmental groups have identified the main villain as clear-cutting,
which involves completely clearing large areas of forest land with little or
no heed to fauna and flora. Greenpeace in Germany has led the way in Europe
by insisting on an end to the practice - a demand which has led to the
actions of companies like Axel Springer.
One result is that forestry conservation, cultivation and felling methods
are coming under scrutiny as never before. This is forcing changes to
traditional forestry practices and leading to a more active role by
governments.
Many Nordic forest companies insist they no longer clear-cut, although, in
most instances, neither have they gone so far as to adopt the practice of
'thinning' that many environmentalists advocate.
Companies in Scandinavia and North America have instead opted for a
compromise - reducing the size of clear-cut areas, allowing some trees to
remain standing, building fewer logging roads and restricting felling around
rivers and lakes, which are favoured wildlife habitats.
Juhani Pyykkonen, a forestry manager with United Paper Mills, one of
Finland's biggest forestry groups, says the company now cuts a maximum of 10
hectares at one go - and between 2 and 4 per cent of the trees are left
standing.
UPM has phased out chemical treatment and ploughing; stopped planting
non-indigenous pines; started using biodegradable vegetable oils to
lubricate forest machines; and placed more emphasis on natural regeneration
(seeding not planting). Increased resources are also being put into
education, so that forest managers can recognise sensitive environments and
adapt their harvesting methods accordingly.
Not for the first time, the industry feels that it is unfairly under
assault. But there is no doubt that it is feeling the pressure.
Sweden is discussing an international forestry certification system with the
Worldwide Fund for Nature. Similar moves are afoot in Canada, including
independent audits of individual companies' forestry practices.
Governments, too, are doing their bit - though not always to the liking of
the forestry industry or its employees.
Sweden introduced a new forestry law at the start of the year, to give equal
priority to production and environmental goals. Finland has just announced
proposals which will double the amount of protected 'wilderness forest' to
600,000 hectares, as part of its nature conservation programme.
British Columbia's social-democrat government has promised to expand the
province's protected park and wilderness areas to 12 per cent of the
province, from about 8 per cent now. Although the industry has signed on to
that target, strong disagreements remain on precisely which pieces of land
should be barred from resource development.
A storm has also erupted in BC over suggestions by a government commission
that the 12 per cent target be augmented by large tracts of 'regionally
significant land', such as corridors between existing parks, covering about
8 per cent of the province.
More than 20,000 loggers showed their displeasure at a rally in Victoria,
the provincial capital, in March. Such protests appear to have cooled the
government's ardour for setting aside protected areas.
'New knowledge from research, demands from customers and new legislation are
the main forces promoting the development of environmentally sound forestry
practices,' says Jan Remrod, managing director of the Swedish Pulp and Paper
Association. But he stresses that the process carries a cost.
Besides time spent on planning and education, it is estimated that the
restrictions will cut long-term harvest levels in affected areas by 10 per
cent. That may be a cost that the bigger companies can absorb. But for the
small private farmers who dominate forest ownership in Sweden and Finland,
it is another matter.
Companies and governments alike appear to be nearing the point where
environmental friendliness in the forests may have to take a back seat for a
while to commercial and political realities.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (2): Hong Kong groups
lead the charge - China's huge electrification plans will ensure
opportunities for many years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
China is currently astride the world's most ambitious power development
programme, having set itself a target of 300,000MW of installed capacity by
the turn of the century.
The programme, according to China's Ministry of Electric Power, calls for a
further 12,000MW of capacity to be added this year, boosting levels from the
end-1993 figure of 176,000MW. The pace of new power additions will be
accelerated on a year-by year basis and will reach a remarkable rate of
20,000MW per year in new power plant additions by 1996 at least.
The programme is breathtaking by global standards and exceeds by a wide
margin expansion programmes being planned by other developing nations. Even
if the target is not achieved, the gains still will be substantial enough to
provide exceptional business opportunities for western equipment suppliers,
consultants, banks and companies seeking partnerships in the power sector.
Not surprisingly, the front runners in Chinese joint ventures are such Hong
Kong-based groups as the private sector utility China Light &amp; Power (CLP);
Gordon Wu's CEPA, a division of Hopewell Holdings; New World Development,
Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings.
An increasing number of outside groups is joining the long queue. Among
these are the US Wing Group, as well as equipment manufacturers General
Electric and Westinghouse Electric; PowerGen and BICC of the UK and numerous
other companies from Europe, Japan and North America.
According to the Ministry, a total of 35,000MW of capacity will be up for
grabs by foreign independent power developers between now and 2000. Without
such foreign help, its ambitious targets will fall far short of target. It
has identified a total of 34 projects, both large and small, which it wants
to see developed on a build-own-operate or build-operate-transfer (BOO-BOT)
basis.
Most of its proposed foreign partner programmes are coal-fired, and some
small hydroelectric schemes are also being considered for the private
sector. However, the government wants to diversify its energy sources for
foreign joint ventures, particularly along coastal sites where coal is not
easily available owing to rail transport problems, away from coal and hydro
and into other fuels, notably piped gas, LNG and nuclear.
This will be a big challenge in that the two power sources comprise
virtually all China's electricity supply. A natural gas pipeline will supply
the first 2,400MW phases of Hong Kong's Black Point power station starting
in 1996. The complex is owned by CLP of Hong Kong. Preliminary discussions
suggest that some of the gas, taken from Hainan Island, could be used for
other power stations, but that will depend on the Hainan reserves. At
present, the gas is the only such supply being used for power generation in
China.
Several foreign ventures are bidding to establish LNG terminals along the
China coast, notably the Wing Group, which is examining terminal sites in
the Shanghai region. The LNG would have to be imported but would alleviate
coal pollution and transport problems.
The World Bank recently announced a Dollars 255m development loan to boost
natural gas potential in Sichuan Province to underpin a Dollars 945m scheme.
The aim of the scheme is to cut down reliance on coal, particularly for home
heating, and to create a base of gas for power station use isn the region.
A major development is China's nuclear programme. The first 950MW unit of
the Anglo-French-built two-unit complex at Daya Bay, 50 km northeast of Hong
Kong, went on line over the winter and is now delivering electricity to
China Light &amp; Power. The second unit is now completed and is being prepared
for commercial operation. A further complex is planned nearby, also to be
foreign built. A further complex of similar size is being planned for
Yangjiang, near Macau, west of Hong Kong.
China is also operating a separate 300MW domestically- engineered reactor in
the northeast and is planning new home-built units of 600MW each, with
consultancy help from Electricite de France. In all, it hopes to see some
7,500MW of nuclear capacity operating or near completion by 2005.
A major reason for the reliance on foreign help is the fact that China's own
power equipment manufacturers are operating at full tilt and producing only
mid-range technology. For manufacturers, the willingness to transfer
technology and form joint ventures with Chinese counterparts will be the key
to success.
According to Nomura Research Institute in Hong Kong, China's manufacturers
are capable of producing up to 400MW hydroelectric power generators and
thermal electric power generators with a maximum 600MW capacity. China's big
three equipment makers are China Harbin Power Plant Equipment Group;
Shanghai United Electric Corp.; and Dongfang Electrical Machinery Works, the
last of which is in the process of trading shares on the Hong Kong stock
exchange. All are understood to be seeking major equity shareholdings from
their foreign counterparts.
It is their output shortfall that has helped open the doors to western
hardware supplies, analysts say. These imports, which generally cost about
50 per cent more than locally-manufactured goods, are now estimated to
contribute about 20 per cent of China's annual installed capacity.
Indeed, so serious is the domestic equipment supply problem that China's
giant Three Gorges hydroelectric project, which is projected in the early
part of the next century to reach 22,000MW, will require at least 12 of its
26 hydraulic turbines to be foreign supplied, say Beijing officials.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (3): Land of the rising
paradox - Japan buys little but imports are no longer taboo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Japan's power equipment market is changing fast, presenting foreign
suppliers with opportunities to cash in on one of the world's largest but
toughest markets.
Japan is a mature economy where overall growth has skidded to a halt after
several decades as one of the world's top performers, and its increase in
electricity demand has slowed accordingly.
According to Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), Japan's largest power
company, which sells about a third of the country's total electricity, total
Japanese electricity demand will rise from 689bn kwh in 1993 to just 885bn
in 2003. In the 10 years between 1965 and 1975 it tripled.
Estimates for annual growth in the generation equipment market are
correspondingly low. Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MEC), which provides
machinery in power projects run by its cousin Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
(MHI), reckons Japan will yield around 84GW of new capacity over the next 10
years.
'It is a very mature market,' says Del Williamson, president of GE Power
Systems Asia. 'The low growth has continued to decline. Percentage wise it's
like the US - in the one to two per cent range.'
Two growth areas will be plants running off liquid natural gas (LNG) and
nuclear energy.
Japan has always been extremely nervous about the fact that it depends on
the outside world for almost all its energy requirements, and has been
trying to cut down the amount of power it generates from oil to reduce its
dependence on the Middle East. LNG and nuclear has been a major feature of
this policy.
In 1973, Japan generated 60 per cent of its electricity from oil, but last
year that was down to 16 per cent. In 2003 the figure is expected to fall
further to 10 per cent, according to Tepco.
LNG accounted for 33 per cent of total electricity generation in 1993, which
should rise to 37 per cent 10 years later, while the nuclear proportion will
increase from 25 per cent to 26.
There is also a move towards upgrading existing facilities with equipment
that is cleaner and more efficient. The main feature of this is
combined-cycle systems, which can boost energy use efficiency some five per
cent to around 48 per cent.
'The modernisation and upgrade and replacement is similar to what was seen
10 years ago in the US,' says George Butterfield, president of Westinghouse
Energy Systems Japan. 'A lot of equipment for the growth period in Japan in
the 1960s and 1970s is reaching the age for modernisation.'
Tepco says it has already increased capacity by replacing some of the
thermal facilities it started up during the period from the late 1950s to
1970. It is now considering scrapping a plant in Shinagawa in Tokyo,
consisting of three 125MW generators, and building a 1,108GW facility
instead.
Recently, however, recession and two successive cold summers, which cut
electricity demand from air conditioning, have eaten into the power
companies' revenues, prompting them to rein in their spending on new capital
equipment. Tepco announced in April that its capital investment for the
1994/95 fiscal year (ending March 31, 1995) will fall 0.2 per cent from the
previous year to 1.692 trillion yen - its first decline in seven years.
Combined investment by Japan's 10 electric power companies is likely to slip
below five trillion yen in the year, from 5.01 trillion in 1993/94.
'Investment by the utilities has been very strong, but it's starting to
slow,' says Timothy Marrable, a senior analyst at Baring Securities (Japan).
While there may not be much good news for Japan's market as a whole, it at
least looks more enticing for foreign companies.
Pressure on Japan, especially from the US, to reduce its enormous trade
surplus has led the government here to encourage companies in all sectors to
look beyond their domestic suppliers and buy equipment from abroad.
'The requirement to import more equipment to offset the balance of trade has
caused Tepco to buy even more equipment on a direct basis from outside
Japan,' says Mr Williamson of GE. 'It's opening the door a crack at least to
outside suppliers.'
However, with the yen reaching unprecedented highs over the last six months,
many companies, under pressure to cut costs are all too glad to do this.
Tepco recently announced it would publish annually a list of equipment
purchases it is planning for each year. Also, starting with Tepco the power
companies are planning to increase the proportion of outside procurements
they make through competitive bidding which currently accounts for only
around a third of these.
Westinghouse's Mr Butterfield sees costs as the main factor in the
industry's new openness. 'I don't believe there's been restrictions in the
power industry. It's difficult to do business here because of the
expectations of the customer in the power industry and I think some of these
expectations are reasonable,' he says. 'The power companies themselves have
taken the initiative to go to the world looking for components and
equipment. I think cost is more of an issue (than trade friction).'
Up to now most of the business won by foreigners in Japan has been through
relationships with Japanese makers rather than through direct sales.
Westinghouse has worked closely with MHI, while GE has relationships with
both Hitachi and Toshiba.
GE's co-operation with Toshiba in the gas turbine field has included
providing combined-cycle units for Tepco's Futtsu Thermal Power Plant in
Chiba, near Tokyo, commissioned between 1985 and 1988.
It is supplying Hitachi with three of the seven gas turbines for a 1,650MW
Chubu Electric Co plant near Nagoya, and building nuclear reactors and
supplying two 1,350MW steam turbine generators for the world's first
advanced boiling water reactor plants in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast.
Part of a Toshiba-led project, these are faster and easier to construct than
ordinary boiling water reactors and will also run more safely and
efficiently.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (4): Too quiet at home
 -Japan's Big Three join race for East Asian orders

SLOW GROWTH at home is making Japan's power equipment makers turn to the
high growth East Asian markets.
They are led by Toshiba and Hitachi, better known for their light
electronics products, and Mitsubishi, the heavy industrial group.
While the electronics industry has been suffering over the last few years,
both Toshiba and Hitachi have remained profitable thanks to their heavy
electrical businesses.
Now, however, these divisions are also in trouble as Japan's economy slows
and as Japanese companies become increasingly ready to take advantage of
cheaper imports.
For the Japanese power equipment makers this competition reduces their
margins even when they succeed in winning domestic buiness. 'Until now, the
power companies have stuck with particular makers,' says Katsuro Tsujiyama,
manager of the power systems marketing planning department at Mitsubishi
Electric Corp (MEC), which provides generating equipment and electrical
systems for power stations contracted by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI).
'But this system is collapsing, partly because of pressure from America and
Europe,' he says. 'It has a big effect on us. Buying abroad is cheaper and
the power companies can get us to reduce our prices.'
The solution they have hit on is a traditional one for Japanese companies:
look abroad. However, this time they are not eyeing Europe and the US, whose
markets are marred by recession and trade friction, but Asia. Countries with
fast-growing economies such as Malaysia and Indonesia are still plagued by
power shortages which they want to remove as soon as possible.
'We're thinking about developing countries,' says Hiroharu Takayasu, deputy
manager of the overseas marketing group of MEC's power department. 'The
priority market now is Hong Kong - the economy is growing and its light
industry is getting bigger. China is the biggest hope for the future and
Thailand has a lot of potential.'
Baring Securities (Japan) reported last year that MHI's Asian sales could
well rise from around 10 per cent of total parent turnover in the year
ending March 31, 1993 to around 30 per cent over the next five or 10 years.
The company's power equipment division increased its export ratio from 30
per cent in fiscal 1991 to 35 per cent the following year, it said.
The pattern of increasing demand is similar throughout the region. First,
demand comes from industrial development. Countries inviting foreign
investment need a solid infrastructure, a major aspect of which is electric
power to run factories. Later, consumers using the products of these
factories create further demand.
However, countries vary widely in how they award contracts to satisfy this.
China, says MEC's Takayasu, while having the largest potential, is one of
the trickiest markets. Foreigners angling for contracts have to negotiate a
maze of opaque regulations and tariffs, which often vary from state to
state.
Thailand, on the other hand, is clear and open, making it, he says, 'the
hardest in the world'. The Mitsubishi group has received an estimated Yen
30bn order for three steam turbines and generating equipment for Indonesia's
Surabaya thermal power station, which will make a total of 24 steam turbines
it has supplied to that country's electricity generating authority.
Hitachi and Toshiba are moving in the same direction, a policy that sits
well with their company-wide strategies to get into emerging consumer
markets: as well as making electricity generating equipment, they also need
electricity to set up consumer goods factories and to see their products
being used in people's homes.
Most developing countries want to develop their own equipment industries to
a degree, so participating in their markets often means local joint ventures
or co-operation at the technological or manufacturing level rather than
exporting completed products, according to Toshiba.
While India, Vietnam and the Asean nations are all attractive markets, China
stands out with its vast population, double-digit economic growth and
untapped natural resources. Hitachi says there are already plans there to
add 15GW of new capacity annually. Two thirds of this will be in thermal
plants, to take advantage of the country's abundant coal, and Hitachi
announced last November a joint venture, Beijing Hitachi Huasun Control
System, to make and sell control systems for thermal plants in China.
In January, it set up a joint venture with Harbin Electric Machinery Works
to provide engineering services for electricity plants, mainly in
hydro-electric power. It hopes this company will later become a base for
supplying generating equipment.
