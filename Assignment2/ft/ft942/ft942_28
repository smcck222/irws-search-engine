FT  16 MAY 94 / Foreign outrage at Japan tax rises

European and US companies operating in Japan are receiving swinging
increases in their tax bills, following systematic investigations of their
profitability by the Japan's National Tax Agency.
Tax increases running to hundreds of million dollars have been imposed on
Coca-Cola, the US manufacturer of soft drinks, Roche and Ciba-Geigy, the
Swiss pharmaceutical groups, and Hoechst, the German drugs group.
Other big companies, including US chemicals group DuPont, are currently
being assessed by the Japanese tax authority and fear similar increases.
The National Tax Agency has alleged that many western companies have been
under-reporting profits earned in Japan in order to minimise their tax
bills.
They accuse western companies of levying excessive royalty payments on their
Japanese subsidiaries and associates.
It is also alleged that the Japanese offshoots are being charged too much in
transfer prices for materials imported from their parent companies in the
west, to boost the profits of the central operation at the expense of the
Japanese arm.
Executives of the affected companies say privately that they believe the tax
increases are a reprisal for substantial tax increases imposed on Japanese
companies by the US Internal Revenue Service.
The IRS alleged that Japanese companies have inflated the transfer prices at
which they ship goods to their US subsidiaries.
'This is a really serious problem,' said Roche, which received a bill for
Y10bn (Pounds 65.8m) in additional taxes for the three years between 1990
and 1992.
Ciba-Geigy, which was charged an additional Y5.7bn in taxes for 1990 to
1993, said: 'This assessment is unjustified and outrageous . . . The company
will use all possible avenues to oppose this assessment.'
A Swiss official said Swiss tax officials would be visiting Japan in the
coming week for talks on the tax increases with the National Tax Agency.
Coca-Cola (Japan), which is the single largest taxpayer among foreign
affiliated companies in Japan, is appealing against a Y15bn tax penalty
recently levied, and also wants bilateral government talks.
Hoechst refused to quantify how much increased tax it faced, but said it was
appealing to a Japan-Germany intergovernmental tax committee.
Mr Terry Symons, a partner of accountancy firm Price Waterhouse specialising
in transfer pricing, said: 'The public face of the National Tax Agency is
reasonable and co-operative. But at a local level, that co-operation is
ignored, international rules are not understood and officials are
aggressive.'
He also warned: 'Some western companies are so concerned, they are
considering not putting new investment into Japan.'
Mr Mark Bedhingham, chairman of the European Business Community in Japan,
said: 'There is a lot of vagueness and a lot of areas that require
interpretation (in Japanese tax rules).'
A Japanese Ministry of Finance official insisted the National Tax Agency
followed OECD guidelines in deciding whether transfer prices were being set
at excessive levels by western companies.

FT  16 MAY 94 / S Korea cools nuclear tensions: North's move seen as bluff
to win concessions on inspections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
South Korea has voiced doubts about North Korea's claims that it is removing
spent fuel rods from its nuclear reactor without the supervision of
international observers, who want to test them for clues to the North's
suspected nuclear weapons programme.
The US has warned that North Korea's action could scuttle negotiations over
international inspections of the North's nuclear sites and force the United
Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions.
But officials in Seoul believe Pyongyang's notification of the fuel rod
replacement to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday may be part
of a bluff to win new concessions on inspection procedures.
North Korea may be trying to force the US to hold a new round of high-level
talks before allowing the IAEA access to the fuel rods. The status of the
nuclear reactor refuelling may be revealed later this week, when the IAEA is
expected to resume an inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities that
were blocked in March.
North Korea last week agreed to accept the inspectors after the IAEA
promised it would not demand immediate inspection of the fuel rods being
unloaded from the 5MW reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
The IAEA wants to analyse the fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has
previously diverted plutonium from the reactor to develop nuclear devices.
The reactor started operation in 1986, but was shut down for three months in
1989. The IAEA suspects that North Korea could have unloaded some of the
rods during that period and reprocessed the fuel for nuclear weapons.
A dispute over the fuel rods has blocked progress over nuclear inspections
in recent weeks. The IAEA previously asked to examine the fuel rods once
they were removed from the reactor. But North Korea rejected the demand and
threatened to replace the fuel rods without IAEA supervision, which would
violate the international nuclear safeguards agreement.
The US has expressed concern that unsupervised replacement of the fuel rods
would allow North Korea to divert enough plutonium to produce four or five
nuclear devices in addition to the two it is suspected of already
possessing.
Washington threatened to ask the UN Security Council to impose sanctions
against North Korea if it replaced the fuel rods without international
oversight.
The conditions for the IAEA's supervision and testing of the fuel rods could
be the subject of a new round of high-level talks between the US and North
Korea.

FT  16 MAY 94 / China tries to cure stock market ills
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is postponing new stock listings in an attempt to ensure that
companies seeking investment from the public are sound, and it wants to
increase the role of investment funds to calm its volatile stock markets.
The official Xinhua news-agency reported that a considerable portion of the
stocks scheduled to be issued this year to local investors, known as
A-shares, will be postponed to 1995.
China had planned to issue about Yn5.5bn (Pounds 418m) of A-shares in 1994
to enliven its flagging securities markets, which have fallen sharply in the
last year. The postponement does not affect B-shares, denominated in dollars
for foreign investors.
Government authorities, who have also sought to impose stricter discipline
on the country's futures exchanges, are seeking to rebuild public confidence
in the stock market.
Disillusioned Chinese investors have been deserting the two stock exchanges,
in Shanghai and Shenzhen, in droves for bonds and other securities. The
shift has come as many newly listed companies have not met expectations.
The State Council Securities Committee said the development of China's stock
market should be conducted on a 'step by step basis'. It said that, in
future, companies planning public offerings would be obliged to accept
'six-month-long coaching by relevant departments'.
Meanwhile, stock issuing quotas allocated to local governments for this year
will be delayed until 1995, the committee said.
The government also plans to strengthen its supervision to 'prevent market
manipulation and insider trading'.
The authorities will encourage the development of investment funds and it is
hoped these will become the 'backbone of the future stock market'.
Lack of a strong institutional presence in the markets, which have been
dominated by individual investors, has contributed to their volatility.
China has not yet promulgated a national securities law which is presently
in its seventh draft. Market managers in the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges
say a new national law is require urgently to help rebuild confidence.
Last week, the government announced that it would increase the number of
B-share listings to enhance activity in that market. At the end of 1993,
some 42 companies' B-shares were being traded.

FT  16 MAY 94 / UK troops to exercise in Poland: Dutch-German initiative
aimed at easing Russian concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company from the British army will today start a military exercise in
Poland that is small in scale but large in political importance. It will be
the first set of war games by British troops in a former Warsaw Pact
country.
The four-day manoeuvre, which will focus on peace-keeping and involve 96
British soldiers, is one of the first concrete signs of the long-mooted
military relationship between eastern and western Europe coming to life.
In a related move, Germany and the Netherlands yesterday announced an
initiative to upgrade the powers of the 52-nation Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
This initiative will be welcome in Moscow and could help to allay growing
Russian concerns over ties between its former allies and members of Nato.
The German-Dutch proposals coincide with ideas mooted by President Boris
Yeltsin during his visit to Germany last week, and they suggest that a
tentative compromise is emerging over the extension eastwards of Nato. The
proposals would give the CSCE the right to address the UN Security Council,
and in some circumstances to intervene in conflicts without the agreement of
the warring parties, in other words to impose a settlement.
According to a German foreign ministry statement, a decision by the CSCE to
intervene in conflicts would be taken 'by consensus'. This could suggest
something short of absolute unanimity among the CSCE's 52 members, which
include the US, Canada, all European states and former-Soviet republics.
Moscow badly wants international approval for a de facto Russian sphere of
influence in the Commonwealth of Independent States. The German-Dutch ideas
say the CSCE should become involved in 'peace-keeping' in the CIS, and in
practice this is likely to refer mainly to Russian forces.
This week's Anglo-Polish exercise, in the Polish town of Kielce, has been
arranged by London and Warsaw bilaterally, but is being billed by Britain as
a project 'in the spirit of' Nato's Partnership for Peace plan.
Poland has been the quickest of the former Warsaw Pact nations to build
military ties with Western Europe, both bilaterally and in the context of
PFP.

FT  16 MAY 94 / EU seeks even-handed policy towards Russia and Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union will today make a start at trying to forge a more
even-handed strategy toward Russia and Ukraine, whose neighbourhood rivalry
remains a source of instability on the continent.
Barring last-minute objections, EU foreign ministers in Brussels are likely
to give the go-ahead to a new 'partnership' agreement with Russia whose
ambitious goal is a common free-trade zone by the end of the century.
However, in a sign of 'new thinking', the EU is balancing its Russia policy
with a deeper engagement in Ukraine, whose nuclear arsenal and collapsing
economy make it the regional danger spot.
Ministers will today examine a European Commission paper which calls for a
host of new initiatives to strengthen political co-operation and overhaul
the command economy in Ukraine.
The plan recommends Ecu100m (Pounds 79m) in emergency food aid and measures
to improve nuclear safety, particularly the dismantling of the Chernobyl
plant, which experts estimate could cost between Ecu300m and Ecu500m.
Chernobyl funding will be a key topic at the Group of Seven industrialised
countries' summit in Naples in July.
Ministers may baulk at the Commission's food aid plan because of conflicting
evidence of food shortages and worries that emergency shipments could
distort local agricultural markets. Some countries may also delay approval
of the documents in favour of waiting for a deeper analysis of the Ukrainian
political economy.
A senior EU diplomat said Russia had modified its earlier resistance to
having the EU bolster its relations with Ukraine. But Brussels had to tread
carefully in the light of Russia's (and its own) insistence that economic
aid should be linked to Ukraine's meeting its pledge to ratify the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The EU recently completed a 'partnership' agreement with Ukraine which is
slightly less generous than the EU-Russia pact now virtually complete.
Ministers are weighing an invitation to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk
to attend a signing ceremony.
The EU-Russia partnership pact is likely to be approved, provided ministers
agree to settle the two controversies which have plagued negotiations over
the past 18 months. These are the EU's treatment of Russian uranium exports
and Moscow's treatment of European banks operating in Russia.
France, the EU's largest producer as well as consumer of enriched uranium
for its nuclear power plants, has been worried about being undercut by
Russian exports. A new safeguards regime operating until 1997 may ease
French concerns.
Member states are less enthusiastic about the banking offer because it
restricts EU banks to no more than 12 per cent of the total capitalisation
of the Russian banking system, with Moscow offering a non-committal review
after five years. But Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, believes
it is the best deal on offer.
Agreement would pave the way for Mr Boris Yeltsin to stage a high-profile
visit to western Europe, possibly via an invitation to attend the European
summit in Corfu next month.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Russian power sale proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAO, the Russian state-controlled electricity company, would be split up and
its power stations restructured into a series of competing companies under
proposals being considered by the Russian government.
KPMG Management Consulting of the UK, which drew up the proposals as part of
a European Union sponsored study, acknowledges the system would lead to
price rises for consumers. This is in part because it would enable subsidies
to be eliminated.
However, the proposed structure would help reduce costs and stimulate
investment needed as power demand increases later in the decade, it says. It
could also provide a framework for the industry's full privatisation,
although KPMG believes that is not essential.
So far about 20 per cent of RAO's shares have been offered to workers and
private individuals.
The country's 72 local distribution companies which also generate some power
themselves, have been established as joint stock companies with some shares
distributed to the private sector. However, RAO still owns majority stakes
in most of them. RAO also runs the country's largest power stations.
KPMG's system, which draws heavily on the UK electricity industry structure,
says RAO's large power stations should be formed into independent generating
companies.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Ukrainians tend their gardens amid muddle and weakness: Jill
Barshay on the consequences of government paralysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's future is looking as uncertain as ever, despite the convening of a
new parliament last week.
The parliament was unable to elect a head and is preoccupied with forming
politically expedient, but unstable, coalitions and arguing over the
imperfect election law which brought it to power.
No decisions appear to be in prospect on critical issues, such as whether to
hold next month's presidential elections or to launch economic reform.
President Leonid Kravchuk is so weak he cannot amass enough support to put
issues on the parliament's agenda and the government, which is likely to be
replaced in the coming months, is paralysed by infighting and the election
season.
Negotiations with Russia have collapsed over division of the Black Sea
Fleet. An International Monetary Fund group is in Kiev, but Ukraine is still
unable to meet the rather lenient conditions required to release Dollars
700m (Pounds 480m) in loans.
'Ukraine is a rudderless ship, with no direction, drifting at sea,' said one
western diplomat.
Despite the depth of the governmental paralysis, Ukraine remains socially
and political stable. There have been no mass protests or strikes for nearly
a year. While Crimea is continuing to strengthen its links with Russia, it
has stepped back from outright secession. Nuclear warheads are being
transferred to Russia according to the deal brokered by the US.
Inflation has been reduced from 90 per cent a month last December to 6 per
cent in April. A market economy has been slowly emerging as private
businessmen openly flout Kiev's stifling laws to survive.
But this promising underground economy, largely of trade and services, is
functioning without rules, providing ample opportunity for growth in
organised crime and corruption.
At the same time the legal economy has plummeted further. After years of 20
per cent annual declines, Ukraine's official statistics show a 34 per cent
drop in GDP in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period
last year.
Last Friday the factory which produces the affordable, albeit shabby,
Zaporozhetz car announced production was to be halted because unreasonable
taxes were taking 100 per cent - and more - of profits. Mr Kravchuk has been
squeezing the debt-ridden state industry for his budget while those who
produce non-durables have easily evaded taxes.
Ukrainians, on average, earn about Dollars 18 a month - 40 per cent short of
the Dollars 30 required to buy a basket of basic goods, such as bread and
butter. Instead of going to work, Ukrainians spend most of their time
planting vegetable gardens at their dachas to ensure they do not starve this
year.
Discontent among the old ex-communist establishment, Mr Kravchuk's main
support base, is a great problem for him. His rhetoric on economic reform
threatens their easy access to state subsidies as his policies destroy their
ability to maintain even low levels of industrial production.
Having previously said he would not stand in the presidential race and
prepared to cancel presidential elections and rule by decree, Mr Kravchuk
made an about-face and registered as a presidential candidate at the end of
April.
Though still trying to garner support to postpone elections through frequent
television and radio broadcasts, the dejected leader left the opening
meeting of parliament alone without uttering a word last Wednesday.
The continuing muddle may provide a victory to the left if elections - both
presidential and local - are held next month. Communists will be able to
argue that the current decay is the result of market reforms, a potent
notion in Ukraine where living standards were much higher under Soviet rule,
rather than the result of inaction.
'Reform has never had a chance here, but it's being hung out to dry,' says a
western official.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, sworn in as Italy's prime minister last Wednesday,
faces his first parliamentary test this week when the programme of his
right-wing government is put to a vote of confidence.
His Freedom Alliance, which won the March general elections, has an easy
majority in the chamber of deputies but needs to attract external support to
win in the senate.
Government failure to win confidence in both houses would open up a
political crisis that could lead to new elections.
Mr Berlusconi formulated last week the outlines of his programme with his
main allies - the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance. But he has been finalising details over the weekend after
receiving suggestions from individual ministers.
The programme is set to give priority to deregulation, tax reform and
privatisation. It will be outlined first before the senate today. Particular
attention will focus on how Mr Berlusconi chooses to tackle the issue of
privatisation. The Northern League has hinted it will seek a 30-day freeze
on all privatisation to re-examine existing procedures.
The senate vote of confidence is expected on Wednesday and that of the
chamber of deputies by the end of the week.
In the 315-seat senate, Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance has 156 seats but
needs 164 to be assured of a majority. Against this there are 117 senators
in the progressive bloc and 34 belonging to the Popular party. There is a
further 'mixed group' that comprises 19 seats plus 11 life senators.
When the various parties voted for a new speaker last month, the government
candidate won by a single vote. To be assured of a comfortable working
majority, Mr Berlusconi must be able to rely on some of the former Christian
Democrat senators.

FT  16 MAY 94 / New drive to save Eko Stahl as Riva pulls out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EISENHUTTENSTADT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency last night launched a new effort to
salvage eastern Germany's largest steel mill after the decision by Riva, the
private Italian steel company, to pull out from buying the plant at the 11th
hour.
The Treuhand said it had appointed Mr Hans Apel, a former Bonn cabinet
minister, to find a new investor for the Eko Stahl mill.
The steel plant, once a pillar of communist industry, has been drastically
scaled down but is still vital to the town of Eisenhuttenstadt, near the
Polish border, a region of high unemployment.
Mr Apel's appointment was announced after the Treuhand held emergency talks
with management, trade union and state and local government officials.
Treuhand president Ms Birgit Breuel said all parties supported Mr Apel's
nomination as a mediator to solve the latest crisis over Eko Stahl's fate.
Mr Manfred Stolpe, premier of Brandenburg state, said tentative talks had
been started with the west German steel industry. Some parties had already
expressed interest, he said.
Earlier, the people of Eisenhuttenstadt displayed little confidence a buyer
would be found. 'It is now pretty hopeless,' said Mr Wolfgang Hirsch, a
38-year-old who used to work at the Eko Stahl steel mill. 'If the mill
closes, Eisenhuttenstadt has nothing else to offer its 50,000 people. The
town was built in 1951 around the new steel mill which the communists
located here.'
Before German unification in 1990, the mill produced an annual 2.5m tonnes
and employed 12,000 workers. Today, it produces 900,000 tonnes and has 3,000
full-time workers on the payroll.
'Many of the unemployed from the mill just sit at home,' said Ms Birgit
Henschl, a nurse at the local hospital. 'They drink more and more. They have
no perspective. Many young people have already quit and gone to west
Germany. We thought the Italians would save the plant.'
Riva withdrew at the weekend despite the go-ahead by the European Commission
for the Treuhand to earmark DM813m (Pounds 325m) for the plant. The capital
would be used to modernise the cold rolling mill and invest in equipment for
manufacturing hot-rolled flat products, both aimed at converting the
loss-making Eko Stahl into an integrated and competitive mill.
Riva's decision to pull out was apparently precipitated by a row with IG
Metall, the engineering union. Riva had wanted to reduce the workforce by
700 to 2,300 as soon as possible, while the union wanted the jobs to be
slowly phased out up to the end of the year. Both sides also failed to agree
on the composition of the supervisory board.
The collapse of the Riva deal will be greeted with relief by west Germany's
steel manufacturers, who opposed the modernisation plan. They had argued
that construction of a modern hot rolling mill would pose a threat to the
industry.
As a compromise, a consortium, led by Thyssen and Preussag, the steel
manufacturers, proposed buying 50 per cent of Eko Stahl's cold rolling mill,
closing down the hot-blast furnaces, and securing 1,000 jobs for the mill's
subsidiaries. The Treuhand rejected the plan.
The Treuhand's insistence on creating an integrated steel mill at
Eisenhuttenstadt, at considerable expense to the taxpayer, reveals a shift
in its own philosophy.
In 1990 and early 1991, the agency rushed to close enterprises - such as
Interflug, East Germany's airline, on grounds it was making losses and not
worth restructuring. In that period, the number of jobs in eastern Germany
fell from 9.3m to 6.2m.
Since then, the Treuhand has increasingly anchored its economic/ideological
philosophy in social and political considerations. An official of the West
German Steel Federation agrees. 'Eko Stahl is a political issue. The
Treuhand and the government cannot afford to close it down because there's
nothing else in the region,' he said.
The Treuhand goes one stage further in justifying its attempts to save Eko
Stahl. 'We will try to find another buyer for Eko Stahl because, eventually,
a modern, integrated steel mill on the borders with eastern Europe has a
great chance,' an agency official said. 'We have to restructure and look to
the long term because we have to turn some of these regions of eastern
Germany into highly competitive industries. Otherwise there will be a
desert. That is what Eko Stahl means.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / Athens curbs on capital movement lifted early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek drachma could face more pressure today, following the government's
unexpected decision at the weekend to lift all remaining restrictions on
short-term capital movement, six weeks ahead of the July 1 deadline.
Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, said the decision to speed full
liberalisation was taken 'to rebut speculators' expectations and unfounded
rumours' of a devaluation in the run-up to the deadline.
Economists described the move, which brings Greece into line with European
Union rules on free movement of capital, as a bold attempt to pre-empt
speculative attacks on the currency as the date for lifting curbs
approached. However, they pointed out that there was now little likelihood
of a drop in interest rates.
The government aims to buttress the drachma this week by launching a new
issue of Ecu and dollar-linked drachma bonds, which are popular with both
domestic and foreign investors, at interest rates of 7.5 and 7.7 per cent
respectively.
The Bank of Greece spent almost Dollars 1bn, equivalent to about 9 per cent
of the country's foreign exchange reserves, to support the drachma following
the D-Mark's strong rise last week.
The Greek currency fell from Dr147.2 to Dr148.1 against the D-Mark last
week. On Friday, the interbank three-month rate jumped above 25 per cent,
from 19 per cent at the start of the week.
However, central bank officials dismissed the prospect of a massive outflow
of capital with the disappearance of curbs that prevented Greeks from
holding bank accounts or making short-term investments abroad.
There is greater concern about the effects on the Greek currency of lifting
the ban on short-term borrowing in drachmas by international investors.
However, the bank still appears committed to its 'hard drachma' policy under
which the Greek currency will be allowed to slide by only 7 per cent this
year against other EU currencies.

The minister in charge of revamping Poland's state administration resigned
yesterday, saying the left-wing government was blocking the reforms, Reuter
reports from Warsaw.
Mr Michal Kulesza accused the government of rebuilding a communist-style
power structure in the state administration.
'Within a few months, the government has rebuilt the (communist)
nomenklatura, which had been dismantled over the past four years,' he told
PAP news agency.
Mr Kulesza, a professor who is a non-party expert on state administration,
said the ruling ex-communists and their Polish Peasant party allies were
replacing officials at lower and lower local administrative posts with their
own members.
He said the government's policies were threatening Poland's future
membership of the European Union and could lead to the elimination of
genuine local self-government.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Turkey struggles as IMF team flies out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Officials of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fly out of
Turkey this week, leaving Mrs Tansu Ciller's conservative-led coalition and
its economic policies in limbo.
Agreement on a stand-by facility from the Fund is at least six weeks away,
and it will probably be September before structural adjustment credits from
the Bank can be approved.
In the meantime, Turkey has to hold the line on wages, meet its own
extremely tough targets on fiscal adjustment and service its Dollars 66bn
(Pounds 45bn) foreign debt.
The Fund's endorsement of the austerity programme which Mrs Ciller unveiled
on April 5 is vital to unlock funds, without which Turkey may have
difficulty financing its balance of payments.
The domestic markets remain jittery.
Even with interest rates in the overnight market soaring, the currency is
tottering at around TL34,000 to the dollar, representing a 60 per cent
devaluation since the start of the year.
Bankers are concerned that without the Fund's approval, further commotion
could hit the international markets. Turkey's long-term debt credit rating
has already been downgraded three times this year by Standard &amp; Poor's, the
US rating agency.
For this reason alone, the Fund seems likely to endorse the programme and
agree a letter of intent, even with some misgivings.
In particular, the Fund is understood to be doubtful about whether the
inflation targets, on which the whole programme is based, can be achieved.
Inflation touched 24 per cent in April, in the wake of the one-off price
rises on official commodities. According to Mr Necati Ozfirat, head of the
State Planning Organisation, inflation will fall to 7 per cent in May, and
28 per cent for the second half of the year as a whole. Turkey's
year-on-year inflation was 107 per cent in April.
Achieving such a target will depend in part on a political consensus; wage
talks are due in June with both the civil servants and workers in the state
industries.
The revenue side looks more solid. One-off tax charges on the rich have been
passed by parliament. Parliament passed decree powers for three months
allowing the government to prepare companies for sale.
Indeed in April the budget deficit fell from TL7,300bn in the same period in
1993 to 300bn last month - although the fall is partly explained by the
large amount of tax falling due in April.
Last week, in another encouraging development, the Treasury sold bills at
the domestic auction for the first time since the start of the year. The
issue was a small one, the Treasury receiving offers for TL6,000bn-worth of
one month paper at 12 per cent a month.
With international markets temporarily closed off, domestic debt auctions
are the only way, short of printing money, that Turkey can finance its
domestic budget.
Together with agreement from the banks to convert a part of their maturing
Treasury bill portfolio into three-year paper, inflation-indexed plus 6 per
cent, the government is slowly restoring confidence in the markets.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Dutch parties to discuss coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three Dutch political parties will this week begin exploring the formation
of a coalition excluding the centrist Christian Democrats (CDA) from
government for the first time in modern Dutch politics.
Queen Beatrix has appointed three elder statesmen from Labour, the
right-wing Liberals and the left-of-centre D66 to hold preliminary talks on
the possibility of creating a cabinet without the CDA.
The CDA of the outgoing prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, suffered heavy
losses in general elections on May 3. Labour, which had ruled as a junior
coalition partner with the CDA for five years, also lost seats in parliament
but emerged as the biggest party overall. The Liberals and D66, by contrast,
made strong gains at the polls.
The Queen's appointment of three 'informateurs' to explore a new coalition
brings the possibility of a cabinet without the CDA a step closer. But there
are still formidable hurdles on the road to a left-right cabinet, an untried
phenomenon in Dutch politics.
The three politicians - Mr Klaas de Vries for Labour, Mr Gijs van Ardenne
for the Liberals and Mr Jan Vis for D66 - will have to try to bridge the gap
between Labour, which wants no new reform of the social security system, and
the Liberals, which is proposing a radical cut in benefits provided by the
state.
The three men do not hold seats in the lower house of parliament and are not
involved in the day-to-day politics of their parties, making it easier for
them to explore options than it would be for colleagues who stood in the
election.
If the three make progress, their party leaders may then be asked by the
queen to launch formal negotiations on a new coalition.
However, the process could take weeks, and any failure to agree would give
the CDA a chance to return to government and avoid relegation to the
opposition benches.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Polls show Gonzalez lagging
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID WHITE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The damage that recent corruption scandals have done to Mr Felipe Gonzalez's
Spanish government is shown in a series of opinion polls giving the
conservative opposition a decisive lead in next month's European parliament
election.
The polls also show the ruling Socialists losing their absolute majority for
the first time in the regional parliament of Andalucia, where elections are
being held at the same time as the European ballot on June 12.
Mr Gonzalez, launching his party's European campaign in Madrid on Friday,
said it would have to make 'an enormous mobilisation effort'. He admitted
that the elections were taking place at 'an extremely delicate moment'.
The daily El Mundo, which has spearheaded allegations of corruption and
financial misconduct by senior officials, published a poll yesterday showing
the Socialist share of the vote falling to 32.8 per cent, against 40.2 per
cent in the last European election four years ago.
This was almost five points behind the conservative Popular party, whose
vote was shown rising to 37.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent in 1989.
This would give the Popular party 27 of Spain's 64 European parliament
seats, against 15 at present. The Socialists would lose three or four of
their current 27 seats.
Another poll commissioned by the conservative Barcelona daily La Vanguardia
gave the Popular party a lead of 5.9 points, although half its respondents
were undecided or had decided not to vote. A majority thought the government
was not doing enough to combat corruption, and almost 45 per cent thought Mr
Gonzalez should resign.
An earlier survey published by the right-wing Madrid newspaper ABC showed
the Popular party 6.8 points ahead. All the polls pointed to a strong result
for the Communist-led United Left.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Survey will add to calls for postal liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will tomorrow come under renewed pressure to
liberalise postal services, with the publication of a survey revealing
significant dissatisfaction with the reliability and cost of services.
The poll of business postal users in Belgium, France, Germany and Spain
comes as the latest draft paper by the commission on drawing up a new
regulatory framework indicates a move towards greater liberalisation.
The Commission's paper, entitled Proposal for Regulatory Framework for
Postal Services in the EU, says arguments to justify restrictions on the
operation of direct mail and cross-border mail 'are not sufficiently
convincing'. Following publication of a postal green paper in 1992, the
Council of Ministers last December asked the Commission to come up with
legislative proposals on changing the regulatory regime before July 1994.
Businesses now hope the EC will increase competition in postal services,
liberalising direct mail and cross-border mail and opening express services
and the mailing of publications to greater competition.
The survey was commissioned by the European Federation of Direct Marketing
Industries representing companies such as Time Warner and Readers Digest. It
was not conducted in the UK or Holland because both countries have already
begun to liberalise postal services.
The federation's research shows that many business postal users are unhappy
with charges and the reliability of services. In particular, more than 70
per cent of German businesses are dissatisfied with postal charges and more
than 80 per cent of Spanish businesses with reliability.
Businesses believe the liberalisation of the postal service in the four
European Union member states will improve the quality and reduce the cost of
services.
Almost unanimous support exists for the principle of using any private or
public postal service in any EU country.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Britain and France agree last-minute deal on Orly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and France agreed a compromise yesterday on the opening up of Orly
airport in Paris to UK airlines, just 24 hours before the escalation of a
potentially damaging dispute.
Under the accord, reached after two days of intensive telephone negotiations
between the two countries' transport ministers, France agreed to open Orly
to flights from London by the end of next month at the latest.
Britain, meanwhile, will consider improving access for French airlines to
London airports, particularly Heathrow, in line with European regulations.
British Airways and Air UK had threatened to defy a ban by the French
government and launch services to Orly this morning. They had announced
plans to start flights to the airport in southern Paris following a ruling
last month by the European Commission which said France must immediately
open the London-Orly routes.
After the agreement was announced, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport
minister, said it was 'a victory for European open skies'. The dispute had
been 'the first test case' for implementing the European Union's new
liberalised air transport market.
Mr MacGregor's French counterpart, Mr Bernard Bosson, who had warned British
airlines against trying to fly to Orly without official approval, described
the deal as equitable.
The dispute came to a head last week when Mr Bosson declared that the
planned London-Orly flights could not start until a number of problems had
been resolved. These included measures to ease congestion at Orly,
environmental considerations for local residents and improved access to
Heathrow for French airlines.
In a joint statement, the two governments said France would do 'everything
in complete transparency' to solve the problems at the airport, in
accordance with European provisions.
BA and Air UK both welcomed the agreement. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chairman, said: 'Our objective all along was to secure our right to fly to
Orly and we have done that.'
Air UK will delay starting its Orly services from London's Stansted airport.
Both BA and Air UK will continue operating services to Charles de Gaulle,
Paris's other airport.
Mr MacGregor confirmed that Britain would continue to oppose French plans to
inject FFr20m (Pounds 2.3m) of fresh capital into Air France, the
financially troubled French national carrier.
He also said the UK would continue to take a strong position against state
subsidies for other European national carriers.
The UK and its airlines are also expected to keep putting pressure on France
to open Orly, the main airport for domestic French destinations, well before
the end of the June deadline.
Despite the agreement, the French government faces more opposition from
trade unions to increased competition on domestic airline routes.
Union groups at Air Inter, the domestic subsidiary of Air France, are
planning a one-day strike tomorrow to protest against the liberalisation of
the French airline market.
The French government is also resisting the timetable of deregulation which
has been demanded by the European Commission. It is appealing to the
European Court of Justice against a Commission ruling that the Orly-Toulouse
and Orly-Marseilles routes must be opened to competition within six months.
TAT European Airlines, BA's French affiliate, said yesterday's agreement
encouraged it to believe that France would implement the Commission's ruling
on these routes.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Hope of Ulster peace progress: Reynolds calls for positive
UK response to Sinn Fein queries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday raised hopes that
clarification for Sinn Fein of last December's Anglo-Irish declaration might
at last break the deadlock in the search for peace in Northern Ireland,
writes Philip Stephens, Political Editor.
But Mr Reynolds' comment that written questions about the declaration from
Sinn Fein were 'answerable' coincided with the murder by the IRA of another
British soldier in a rocket attack on an army outpost in Armagh.
Speaking in the US where he held unscheduled talks at the weekend with Mr
Bill Clinton, the US president, Mr Reynolds, also indicated that Dublin and
London would not wait indefinitely for a positive response from the
Republican movement.
Mr Reynolds, pictured above right with Mr Clinton during a ceremony in
Indianapolis honouring Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr, told RTE
radio: 'The questions by and large are answerable, and I hope that the
British government will see them in that light, and will give the most
positive response they can.' He added: 'I think the vast majority of people
in Ireland - and Britain - want to see a breakthrough, and move this latest
roadblock out of the way.'
But in a speech in Chicago where he received an honorary degree from the
University of Notre Dame, Mr Reynolds displayed his frustration at the IRA's
refusal to end its campaign.
Stressing the two governments' commitment to secure a new broad-ranging
political accord to replace the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, Mr Reynolds
said: 'The leaders of the Republican movement know that we still hope they
will opt to play their part . . . They must also know, as Edmund Burke once
put it, that there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue.'
Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, signalled that the two
governments were drafting plans for a comprehensive political settlement.
British ministers said the questions submitted by Sinn Fein, passed to the
London government by Dublin last week, would be published within the next
few days. Alongside them would be the government's responses.
But Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was determined that
Britain would not be drawn into negotiations on the declaration unless and
until the IRA ended permanently its campaign of violence.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, gave a clear hint during a weekend
meeting of the areas in which the IRA was seeking clarification.
These include the timescale in which Britain expected to see agreement
between all the people of Ireland, the constitutional options it foresaw as
realistic alternatives to the status quo and the basis for the 'Unionist
veto' on change in the north.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Blair urged to reach accord with top leftwing opponent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, front-runner in the Labour leadership contest, was urged by
supporters last night to strengthen his candidacy decisively by striking a
deal with one of his leading rivals on the left of the party.
The suggestion came as Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown,
shadow chancellor, faced calls from among Labour's so-called modernisers to
resolve possible competing leadership claims quickly.
A clutch of weekend opinion polls confirmed Mr Blair's advantage over other
contenders to succeed Mr John Smith, who died last Thursday. But Mr John
Prescott, the party's employment spokesman, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade
and industry secretary, kept open the option of standing as 'traditionalist'
candidates.
Amid intense behind-the-scenes manoeuvrings, the eventual outcome of the
leadership election remained clouded by left-right differences,
long-standing personal rivalries and rival ambitions of leading party
figures.
Despite agreement by all potential candidates not to campaign until after Mr
Smith's funeral on Friday, shadow cabinet members said informal soundings
over the next few days would be critical in shaping the contest.
Bargaining has been complicated by the fact that many trade union leaders
are reluctant to endorse any particular candidate publicly. The introduction
of one-member-one-vote ballots will greatly reduce the influence of union
executives.
The suggestion that Mr Blair might reach an agreement with one of the
traditionalist candidates came as his supporters admitted that the
41-year-old MP for Sedgefield needed to broaden the basis of his support.
Mr Prescott and Mr Cook have made it clear they would find it much easier to
work with Mr Blair as party leader than Mr Brown.
But Mr Brown's friends were claiming powerful support for his candidacy
within the shadow cabinet and among leading figures in the union movement.
They said the bandwagon running in favour of Mr Blair underestimated Mr
Brown's much stronger ties with grassroots Labour supporters.
The pressure on the two leading modernisers to reach an amicable accord
within the next week followed inconclusive discussions last week in which
they staked out their respective claims. They have agreed to reassess their
relative support later this week. Colleagues said there was no pact between
the two but the hope was that one would step aside in favour of the other.
Mr Bryan Gould, heavily defeated in the leadership contest two years ago by
Mr Smith, predicted the outcome of the manoeuvring would be a contest
between Mr Cook and Mr Blair which would be won by the shadow home
secretary.

FT  16 MAY 94 / DTI accused of 'going soft' over policy on competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officials at the Office of Fair Trading, the competition watchdog,
are increasingly concerned that Mr Michael Heseltine's Department of Trade
and Industry is softening its stance on competition policy.
The growing frustration among senior competition policy officials is
reflected at Westminster, where several influential backbenchers are setting
up a lobby group, The Competitive Forum, to press for a tougher
consumer-oriented competition policy.
The advocates of a stricter policy believe the DTI and the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission have relaxed policy to help create strong UK champions
capable of competing in global markets, an approach advocated by Mr
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
The approach has been taken up by Mr Graeme Odgers, the former businessman
appointed MMC chairman a year ago, say the critics. They argue that the MMC
is operating a competition policy tailored to the needs of business rather
than the consumer.
Further evidence of the lower priority the DTI is giving to competition
policy is the sharp fall in the number of cases referred to the MMC, say
consumer groups and competition lawyers. Of the 112 mergers examined by the
OFT since May last year, only three were referred to the MMC by Mr
Heseltine. He was expected to underline the policy shift in his long-awaited
competitiveness white paper originally due out today. It has been postponed
until next week, out of respect for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who
died last Thursday.
Concerns that the MMC has gone soft on abuses of market power, which
surfaced after the 1992 report on the supply of new cars, have been
rekindled by recent reports on leading perfumes and ice cream, which left
market positions intact.
Competition officials' fears that the MMC is increasingly putting the
interests of industry ahead of those of the consumer, are likely to be
reinforced next month, when the MMC report on the price of compact discs is
expected to clear the record industry of price-fixing.
Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association director of policy, says the
MMC's recent reports mean 'the UK is now regarded as being a soft touch when
it comes to abuses of market power and anti-competitive agreements'.
Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough and chairman of the Commons
Treasury committee, is launching The Competitive Forum.
Mr Odgers denies that the MMC has become soft on competition. But he does
admit he is 'four-square' with Mr Heseltine's views on privatisation,
competitiveness and deregulation.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Russian PM vows to hold firm on economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin has pledged to continue tight
money and credit policies, in spite of having reached what he calls 'the
trough of the crisis' in the country's economic transformation.
Mr Chernomyrdin, writing in today's Financial Times, predicts that his
economic policies will produce inflation of between 7 and 8 per cent a month
by the end of the year, down from a high of about 30 per cent at the end of
last year.
He acknowledges that the consequences of reform have been a drop in
production in the first quarter of about 25 per cent, compared with the same
period last year, but says that this did not, and will not, deflect the
government's course.
Referring to the intense pressure from ministers to increase spending, Mr
Chernomyrdin says that every member of his cabinet 'fully understands that a
strong rouble is the indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian
economy'.
'Our common task is clear,' he writes, 'that every Russian citizen should
know that everything his government does is directed to protect the
purchasing power of the roubles he earns.'
He also holds out the prospect of the beginnings of an economic revival in
the near future.
'We are now living through the trough of the crisis. In the next few months,
we can make a break from the basic negative tendencies which have held back
our development in the last two or three years.'
However, he makes clear that he does not envisage mass factory closures and
a strong rise in the unemployment rate, as that would 'sharply worsen the
political and the social situation in the country'.
Mr Chernomyrdin presents, for the first time, the outline of an action
programme on structural industrial change which divides enterprises into
three groups: those which are adapting successfully; those with the
potential to do so but which need state help; and those which are 'hopeless
enterprises which should be closed down in accordance with a law on
bankruptcy'.
The third group, however, will only be closed when a social safety net is in
place to deal with the employees thrown out of work. It is an issue on
which, he says, the government is now working in association with western
financial institutions.
'The issue here,' he says, 'is the possibility of channelling the
international financial credits towards the resolution of, above all, social
problems.'
Mr Chernomyrdin, seen in the west as, at best, a reluctant reformer,
displays himself in his article as one who revels in the changes ushered in
by privatisation and by the transformation of cities and their 'dejected,
sombre queues' into places with 'smart advertising hoardings and attractive,
lively goods'.
He takes grim satisfaction in castigating 'ultra radicals' who warned
western institutions not to advance further funds.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Simply too embarrassed to own up: The present government's
hypocrisy will give its opponents an easy time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are, of course, all deeply impressed by the decision of the Conservatives
to abstain from political debate in the immediate aftermath of the death of
John Smith MP. However, I suspect that the late Labour leader would have
pointed out that the Conservative party had more to gain than Labour from
such an absence of debate.
It is not the least of the many ironies surrounding Smith's sudden death,
that it came at a time when he had at last found an issue with which he
could harry the government into panic.
Do not believe everything that is said by way of eulogy: until last week the
Labour Leader had become increasingly criticised by his own backbenchers for
his seeming inability to create trouble for the government, rather than
merely sit back and watch the conservatives fight among themselves.
But, in his relentless harrying of the government's conduct in the House of
Commons, as it secretly condoned the talking-out of the disabled persons
bill, Smith had returned to his element.
The facts are simple enough. The bill, sponsored by backbenchers of all
parties, was designed to make it compulsory for all buildings and workplaces
to be easily accessible to the disabled.
The government had discovered that this measure, which it affected not to
oppose, would cost many billions of pounds to implement. Therefore, Nicholas
Scott, Minister for the Disabled, gave authority to his civil servants to
assist Conservative backbenchers with the drafting of a myriad of blocking
amendments, which eventually destroyed the bill.
For reasons which remain unclear, or are all too clear, depending on your
view of the man, Scott told the House of Commons that the government had no
part in this fairly mundane piece of sabotage. Only after the debate was
over, and the government got its wicked way, did Scott admit to the
subterfuge and apologise for misleading the House.
A bit late, that, for the disabled, although one could imagine that some of
them - in the manner described by Damon Runyon in the Lemon Drop Kid - had
become so angry that they miraculously rose from their wheelchairs.
The problem for Scott is that while the cost of the measure proposed was
clearly unacceptable, it was politically incorrect for a minister for the
disabled to say so. Better to pretend that the government was not opposed to
the measure, and let apparently maverick Tory MPs carry the political odium
of playing Scrooge to the handicapped millions.
This form of hypocrisy is, unfortunately, entirely characteristic of the
current government. Even when it is promulgating measures which rightly seek
to reduce public spending, it insists that it is doing so for reasons of
beneficence.
The Child Support Agency, for example, should properly be called the
Exchequer Support Agency. The government noticed that social security
payment to single mothers had got out of hand, and decided that the only way
of evading those demands was to chase fathers for the money - even if those
fathers had previously discharged their financial responsibilities by a
one-off payment through an agreed court settlement.
This revenue-driven policy was defended by the government on the spurious
grounds of social engineering, as if it was any business of the state to
interfere in agreed court settlements between a man and wife.
Similarly the Deparment of Health likes to defend its policy of Care in the
Community on the grounds that paranoid schizophrenics will all have a much
nicer time wandering about the streets, rather than being locked up in
secure accommodation.
No health minister has ever had the guts to say: 'We must save money in the
National Health Service and closing down asylums is a lesser evil than
closing down even more hospitals.'
For as long as the government is too embarrassed to admit to its motives -
which, I repeat, are not bad ones - the job of the Opposition will be made
joyfully simple.
John Smith's successor will have a wonderful time.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Private View: A chairman's moonlight sonatas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amateur pianists may gnash their teeth in envy at the Yorkshire accountant
who, while head of a large British engineering company, played the Grieg
concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at London's Festival Hall.
They should take comfort instead. For, says Sir Trevor Holdsworth - he is
now chairman of National Power - business is a lot less difficult and
frightening than preparing and performing a concerto.
When at home in Chelsea, Sir Trevor practises on his 'A' model Steinway for
at least half an hour before breakfast, and leaves for work at 8.30.
'Pianistic jogging,' he calls it - a fixed routine of scales and arpeggios
to flex the fingers, wrists and arms.
I asked him if the secret was knowing how to practise.
'Yes, it's discipline. As people get older they say: 'Now I've got time, I'm
going to take up the piano.' There's no way they're ever going to be able to
do it. You realise how much is built in by instinct; and the discipline you
need, you've got over as a child when it was still interesting. Trying to do
that intellectually at 60 must be almost impossible.'
Why did you keep going?
'You can't escape it.'
Did you think of it as an investment for your old age?
'Er . . . yes. In the sense that it was a lovely interest to have outside
business. Also you don't actually get worse as you get older whereas in
practically everything else, you do. I've probably still got a musical
handicap of minus four where my golfing friends are struggling.'
Far from deteriorating, pianists usually improve with age: like the late
Artur Rubinstein whom Sir Trevor used to meet regularly in the 1970s when
they both stayed at the Savoy. 'Rubinstein was inclined to be mischievous
and say you shouldn't practise for more than two hours - it's a waste of
time.'
Apart from the Grieg, Sir Trevor has performed the Schumann concerto (also
in A minor), Mozart's K453 in G, K488 in A and K595 in B flat, and given
recitals of Chopin, Debussy and others.
He was as modest as only a serious amateur can be: laconic, discreet,
reflective and good-humoured. But his sentences tended to die uncompleted
and sometimes he knocked on the table while talking as if to drum up
thoughts. In Who's Who his recreations are simply described as 'music,
theatre'.
He started to play at the age of five and was forced by the grammar school
to drop his favourite subject, science, because he wanted to take music in
the sixth form. Why did he not make a career of it?
'I think actually I was very good at theory, at harmony, counterpoint,
figured bass - lovely] - which is pure learning, and yet probably fell short
of the final perfection, which is pure sound, which is instinctive.'
You are not the complete musician?
'Well, I might fall short because . . . it is too intellectual. Yes. I can
memorise, by rules rather than by sound. I always slightly worry when I play
in public. I know it absolutely perfectly. I could write it out. I could
tell you the whole harmonic structure, which I feel sometimes is not quite .
. .' He left the suggestion hanging.
Unlike the musical children of the suburban middle classes, young Trevor was
not pushed. His father was a bookie. Sir Trevor called it turf accountant.
'My parents were very Yorkshire, very down to earth,' he said. 'They didn't
think it was a career for a boy at all. As soon as it started getting
serious they thought 'mmm . . .' They were probably right, actually. If
there is any doubt, then you shouldn't be a musician. I think they felt
there was a doubt.'
And you suspected yourself you would never reach the top?
'Yeah. I didn't find myself being very upset when the answer was no.'
Let me imagine the scene, I said: Bradford boy . . .practising secretly at
night . . . ('No, no,' he laughed) . . . father comes up with a strap . . .
says 'Get off that bloody piano ('Yes, yes') before I give you a right
thrashing'. 'No, no. They were very proud of me really. I was turned out to
play and they bought a small grand for me.'
His real mother died suddenly when he was only eight and he was brought up
by a stepmother, intelligent and determined, but not interested in the arts.
Did he think his ability came from his mother?
'My real mother? Yes, I do. Because I just sense she obviously liked
singing, very much - not too serious, sort of Gilbert and Sullivan level,
but very keen. Yes, I can remember that.'
I thought I heard an echo of this later when I asked Sir Trevor who his
favourite pianists were. He named Ashkenazy, Brendel, Horowitz (especially
playing Scarlatti), then added:
'The piano's quite difficult. I almost think the voice and violin are more
musical. I can be moved by them more easily. Maybe when you're listening to
a piano you're always thinking about how it's done.'
Did you keep going in memory of her?
'No, not consciously. But I often think that if she'd been around she
probably would have been much more encouraging.'
You don't feel thwarted?
'I don't actually.' He almost whispered. 'No, not really. I got involved
with the other things so much it became a marvellous hobby and I kept it
going wherever I was, whatever I was doing.'
So after school, and the war still on, Trevor Holdsworth joined Rawlinson,
Greaves &amp; Mitchell, chartered accountants.
A two-year interlude with the British Forces Network as a 'staff pianist'
broadened his taste to encompass jazz and light music. Later, he wrote
popular music for television.
He spent 10 years with Bowater, the paper makers, then 25 with GKN, turning
a fading manufacturer of nuts and bolts into a motor supplier with a world
dominance in front-wheel drives. He became president of the Confederation of
British Industry. He is director or chairman of three small companies, one
medium-sized (Allied Colloids, makers of water-absorbent polymers) and two
large: National Power and the Prudential.
His wife, Patricia Ridler, connived at his double life: she was a repertory
actress who played the violin. She died last year, also suddenly, of
septicaemia and Sir Trevor has taken up her place on the board of the
National Youth Theatre. There are three sons, all in business.
What, I asked, are the rewards of playing the piano?
'That you can have a parallel interest.'
But stamp-collecting is a parallel interest.
'Music is the ultimate, I think . . . pure sound. It's far deeper and got an
emotional involvement as well. It's got everything.'
Are you an emotional type?
'Yes, I think so. Really, quite.' Then, sotto voce: 'I suppose it's
controlled. Yes. Yes.'
You've spent all your life with businessmen. Are they stunted in this
department?
'Well, I find a lot of them are really quite interested in it . . .' But his
tone suggested otherwise.
Do you feel different?
'Not consciously, no.' He whistled as if thinking whether to change his
mind, but didn't.
Do you find business creative?
'Yes I do, actually. I regard it as very creative when you get it right.
Marvellously creative.'
Does the piano teach you useful things?
He toyed with the idea, then said: 'I've always been very good in business
on concepts and strategy and that sort of thinking. Whether that is a sort
of sonata form . . . Good music is all about starting with something and
developing it, in a satisfactory form. There might be some spin-off between
the two there. Probably is.'
Or perhaps you are a hard-headed businessman who approaches music the same
way, which is why you never became a professional?
'That would be a description hard to pin on me. I get it right, perhaps,
more often than I get it wrong, but not from being hard-headed.'
People call you laid-back. What does that mean?
'Well, that I don't appear to be hard-headed and thrusting. Actually,
there's a sort of illusion about business, that it's all action-oriented.
There's a feeling you should be rushing around, taking decisions, bang-bang.
That's a mistaken impression.'
Sir Trevor refuses business breakfasts. Had he stuck to that rule?
'I've hardly broken it, ever. I gave up City lunches as well for a time.'
Perhaps this is the musical connection - that your attitude to business is
more reflective?
'Yes. It is, actually. Probably.'
It's the music that matters, not the notes?
'I'm much more interested in the objective. Then you can fill in the piece.
Until I talked to you today I hadn't actually tried to formalise it.'
Have you discovered useful things about yourself at the keyboard?
He whistled and pondered. 'The one thing that I've found . . . that when I'm
doing it I'm not thinking about anything else. That's the one thing that's
all-absorbing. Yes. When I'm building up to a concert, I work very hard. I'm
always very nervous. And yet, appearing in public for other things . . . the
CBI for two years . . . I'm totally in control.
'I still want . . . ' He knocked at the table. 'Yes, I still like a
challenge. I'd like to be able to do it a little easier. Yes, it's that
competitive spirit again.'
Are you going to say that running a business is a piece of cake by
comparison with working up a concerto?
'Yeah, it is. After all, we get away with murder, don't we? I mean you're
not on test every time. In business you get away with being very slack, or
sloppy. You're not being tested every day, are you?'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Major in his bunker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have to admire John Major's insouciance. He is the prime minister of
Britain, and has made a pig's ear of it. Is he despondent? Not on your life.
He is getting quite bolshie, as witnessed by his recent declaration, outside
10 Downing Street, that if any usurpers from his own party had a mind to
topple him, there he would be, togged up and waiting - ready to repel them.
You can judge the perilousness of Major's position by the fact that
virtually his only supporter in the media is dotty Woodrow Wyatt.
There can be no danger in calling Wyatt dotty, given the eclat with which he
prods and punches those around him - even fellow columnists on The Times. On
Tuesday, Wyatt accused poor old Smoggie, William Rees-Mogg, of making a
'daft suggestion' - replacing Major as prime minister with Michael Heseltine
and appointing Major foreign secretary.
(On austere newspapers, columnists do not swipe at each other like that.
They treat each other respectfully, with a wintery smile or a nod; there is
certainly no rudery.)
So worried was I by Wyatt's latest encomium on John Major's behalf that I
rocked up to Downing Street to see Major myself, as I do occasionally. These
visits are always jolly. We enjoy a large supper of bacon, chops, eggs,
tomatoes, mushrooms and fried bread. And then I try to persuade Major to
walk the plank - to quit gracefully, and silently, for the good of the
country.
He wasn't there. But the visit was not wasted, for I came to hear of the
extreme measures being taken by the PM to turn 10 Downing Street into a
fortress.
My informant was a cove named Major Julian Summerbee, allegedly loaned by
the army to help the prime minister dig himself in. Readers of a literary
bent may imagine there to be similarities between Major Julian Summerbee,
whom I met at 10 Downing Street, and the major in John le Carre's latest
novel, The Night Manager - Major Corkoran, assistant to le Carre's arms
dealer, Dicky Roper. Perhaps there are similarities, though that is not
something on which I could comment.
When I encountered him, Major Summerbee was smoking a Turkish cigarette and
studying various lists.
'Hello, love,' he said. 'You seem forlorn and lost.'
'Am I?' I riposted. 'I am looking for the prime minister.'
'Not here, sweetheart,' said Summerbee. 'He 'coptered off an hour ago.
Probably something and nothing.'
'So what do you do?' I asked.
He replied: 'Readying for the siege, dear. I'm an expert on survival. You
are talking to the man who wrote the survival manuals for the SAS, the paras
and the Royal Marine Commandos. Traps. Tools. Weapons. Wilderness first-aid.
Minimising water loss. Ropes and knots, of course. Signalling and
navigation. Coping with Mother Nature. Terrain. Movement. Shelters. I'm a
pan-specialist, actually: tropical, desert, temperate - polar, if you like.
They are all the same at heart, heart.'
'What are those lists you've got?'
He puffed out a smoke-wreath. 'Weapons and traps, old love. I'm prioritising
our plans. You would be amazed, dear, at the lack of readiness in this
building. Here we are, about to be assaulted by crazed and vengeful Tories,
and no thought at all has been devoted to weapons and traps.'
'Traps?'
'Deadfalls, mainly, triggered by tripline release action. Also a few spear
traps. They are quite delicious. I also want snares and noose sticks, though
time is running short.'
'Weapons?'
'Bows and arrows, lover. I've stipulated yew staves 4ft long, tapering from
a central width of 2in to  5/8 in at the ends. There's a yew table upstairs
which the servants are cannibalising. For the string, always use rawhide.
Arrows are easy, heart: 2ft long,  1/4 in wide, smooth and straight as
possible, notched at one end, with arrow flights made from feathers, paper,
light cloth or trimmed leaves. Arrow-heads? I can see you are gasping to
hear. Answer: tin, flint, bone or hardwood. Personally, I love tin.'
I reeled into the night. The determination with which John Major is digging
himself in had caught me unawares. As I retreated down Downing Street, Major

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: New team faces old problems - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arts Council's new team of Lord Gowrie, chairman, and Mary Allen,
secretary general, went on show this week and found itself facing the same
old problems: inadequate funding and the intractable question about
orchestras.
With the government committed to reducing its grant to the council by around
Pounds 25m in real terms over the next four years, money remains the
paramount problem. The council will lobby hard for more cash, but knows that
the opening of the National Lottery floodgate next January could,
ironically, scupper its chances.
The council will have the task of channelling around Pounds 10m a month of
lottery revenue into building projects for arts companies. Treasury
ministers reckon that this must improve the ability of these companies to
boost their incomes, and they will turn a deaf ear to pleas for more annual
subsidy.
Mary Allen seems to favour fewer, but better funded, Arts Council clients.
But she promised this week a 'steady as we go' policy, with plenty of notice
for clients who face a chop in their grants. These could well include
orchestras, although no announcement is likely until December when the
current review of musical life in the provinces, undertaken with the BBC,
reaches its conclusion.
In the meantime the council must find a new music director to replace Ken
Baird, just one of the victims of the council's ill-conceived attempt to cut
London orchestras. Favourite is Anthony Sargent, who currently supervises
the generous arts and music budget of Birmingham Council.
Is rock and roll a dying art? Given that most of the money-making rock
artists are now aged around 50, why should not rock, like the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood in art and fin de siecle decadent poetry in literature, be an
art form that has run its natural course?
The fact that those old Krakens, the Rolling Stones, are heaving themselves
together for one more tour of the American stadia this summer seems to
confirm the fact. They are revivalists of a moribund musical form, like Pink
Floyd and the Eagles, now also both playing the US.
The clincher is the question: which pop stars under 30 could currently fill
Wembley Stadium? None. In fact no pop concerts are planned there this
summer. An era seems to have passed. The American giants - Springsteen,
Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson (none under 30) - who could take on Wembley
are staying at home: perhaps they are doubtful of their pulling power.
This is bad news for Wembley, which can make Pounds 3m a concert. Also bad
news is that Sony, the entertainment conglomerate, is pouring money into an
alternative rock venue, the Milton Keynes Bowl, which it part owns. Not
surprisingly it now books its stars, like Springsteen in 1993, there rather
than the Stadium.
The die is cast. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, has committed itself
to closing in 1997 for essential re-building work which will, in four years,
bring its backstage facilities from the 19th to the 21st century.
By an odd coincidence English National Opera at the Coliseum also expects to
close in the summer of 1997 for a Pounds 30m facelift. Both companies want
to take advantage of the lottery money that will be splashing around then,
although Covent Garden is eyeing the Millennium Fund while ENO fancies the
cash distributed through the Arts Council.
Opera lovers need not despair. Both companies have hit upon the nearby
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, as their temporary home and there are already
discussions revolving round the ENO popping in for a year, and the Opera
House filling it for the remainder of its three years in the wilderness. The
problem has been the rental asked by owners Stoll-Moss, and what to do with
the current production there, Miss Saigon.
But suddenly there is a new player in the game. Apollo Leisure looks likely
to acquire the derelict Lyceum, almost opposite Drury Lane. For around
Pounds 7m, it is suggested, the theatre could be restored to its late-19th
century glory and could become an effective 2,000 plus seater which would
suit Covent Garden very well. Or it could house any musical displaced from
Drury Lane by the opera companies. The glimmerings of a deal are forming,
and one in which the revitalised Arts Council is playing an active role.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: A monumental landscape - William Packer welcomes a new
home for Henry Moore's work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Moore, born in Castleford in the old West Riding in 1898, was famously
a Yorkshireman, even though he left his native hearth for ever as a young
man. His career and reputation may have been made in London and the South,
but there was not a day in his long life in which his every utterance did
not declare his origins in the North.
He always acknowledged the formative influence upon his creative imagination
of the local landscape sub-consciously and intuitively, long before he ever
knew he was to be an artist, let alone a sculptor. There were the medieval
carvings in the church nearby at Methley, the monumental outcrops of rock on
the moors at Adel and the high, gently rolling line of the surrounding hills
against the sky. Moore in his maturity would always lift his work high into
the air, to give it thus those limitless possibilities of space and scale.
From his student days he worked outside whenever he could as he carved his
way through his college holidays in the garden of the Norfolk schoolhouse,
where his sister Mary was headmistress. 'Sculpture', he said, 'is an art of
the open-air. Daylight, sunlight is necessary to it. I would rather have a
piece of my sculpture put in a landscape, almost any landscape, than in, or
on, the most beautiful building I know.' His hero, Michelangelo, might well
have taken issue with him on the latter point, but for Moore it was true
enough, and right.
The surprising thing is only that hitherto we have had in this country no
near-permanent opportunity to see his work as he would have wished. There
have been shows in the open-air galore, notably the 80th birthday
retrospective in Hyde Park in 1977, and more recently in the Yorkshire
Sculpture Park itself. The orchard and garden at Perry Green, Moore's home
in Hertfordshire, also have works dotted about, just as they were in his
lifetime, but that was ever a working arrangement, with work-in-hand put out
to be seen in the space available, and then away. Only the great Sheep Piece
in the field next door was ever consciously and permanently set into the
landscape.
Nothing could be more appropriate, therefore, than that the Yorkshire
Sculpture Park, of which Henry Moore was the first patron, and the Henry
Moore Foundation should have negotiated the long-term use of what was the
Deer Park of Bretton Hall, for the siting of a significant number of his
works. The Wakefield Metropolitan District Council, which embraces
Castleford, has owned this land, some 96 acres, since the late 1970s, and
runs it as a country park.
The fear might have been that this would be some kind of cultural take-over,
with art being rammed down people's throats who only want a bit of fresh air
and a nice walk. Nothing could be further from the truth. The people of West
Yorkshire have long grown used to the idea of sculpture in the landscape,
and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park itself is one of the most popular
recreational resorts in the north of England. And the installation is
beautifully judged, with its 16 pieces set discreetly to punctuate and
inform the landscape. In all it is the happiest of collaborations between
national, cultural and local interests. Even the sponsor, Hickson
International, is local, with factory in Castleford and offices in Leeds,
where Moore first went to art school.
The principle is that the Henry Moore Foundation, which owns the works, will
renew the display piecemeal over the years, with each fresh work being
carefully considered in its particular site. As it is, we walk westwards up
the valley towards the house, with the lake below and the slope of the hill
above. Each piece stands alone, yet we are teased forward by the hint of
another beyond the trees - here a figure reclining magnificently below us in
its grassy hollow, there another high above and majestic against the sky.
Far ahead the 'Large Two Forms', Stonehenge in scale as in effect, holds the
great open centre of the park, pulling all together. And all around the
trees themselves turn to shimmering sculpture in the sunlight, the folds and
fall of the ground itself come into high relief, and the sheep munch away,
rubbing themselves against the bronze, dozing in the shade.
Henry Moore in Bretton Country Park: Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Bretton Hall,
near Wakefield, from May 12; sponsored by Hickson International.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Enfants terribles dance on - Clement Crisp on works by
Michael Clark and Matthew Bourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To re-choreograph the Stravinsky/Balanchine Apollo is rather like re-writing
Hamlet: the act of a dolt or a mad genius. For all his zany ways and
interminably prolonged adolescence, Michael Clark is no dolt. Nor does he
qualify as a mad genius. Rather, in his O, in which he does indeed give new
choreography to Apollo, he shows himself a commanding and wonderfully
imaginative creator. At last, say I, he has come of age.
O is in two parts. In the first, the 'enfant terrible' still dominates in
the choice of deafening, hell-sent rock, but this din accompanies dance of
mature understanding. At the Royal College of Music, Manchester, on a stage
bare save for six doors at the back, Clark explores a sequence of long
adagio phrases. He is simply dressed in a leotard; the movement stretches
out as his body unfolds, revelling in the curves of those perfect legs and
feet, with the contraposto of his torso a ravishing balance and complement.
His colleagues - three women, one man - follow discreetly in his footsteps
(the Clark feet still a marvel of the dance world in shape and flexibility).
There comes a wild coda when dress and dance are tatterdemalion, yet the
final impression is, despite the maniac blast of the accompaniment, very
pure.
But the point of O is its second part, an interpretation of Apollo. It was
with this score, in its white, formally serene measures, that Balanchine
found himself, and found the way forward for classical ballet in our
century. I hope it is not too fanciful to think something of the same for
Michael Clark.
The stage is dominated by a large reflecting box-structure, diagonally
placed. Incident flashes off its sides - Leto giving birth to Apollo; the
muses' entry - then as the music announces Apollo's manhood, Clark is
brilliantly seen in its illuminated interior. White-suited, he awakens,
stretches. Emerging from this altar-womb - its opening a thrilling coup - he
dances. The action is sufficiently pinned into Stravinsky's music (and
momentarily - the famous finger-touch with Terpsichore - into Balanchine's
text) to make dramatic sense. But what thrills eye and mind - and heart - is
the grace of Clark's movement language: its linear virtues, its imagination
(he writes as well for the Three Muses as for himself), and its lovely
logic.
His own performance is superlatively good: noble, carved in light,
Apollonian in its formal order. He demonstrates what Virgil Thomson, writing
about musical craftsmanship, called the 'twin privileges: freedom and
responsibility'. So Clark has at last found the freedom to use his own
dance-style fully - the style proposed in the first part of O - and shown a
responsibility to his score and to the exquisite rightness of his own
physique as a symbol of Apollonian grace.
I have in the past hated what Clark has done because unworthy of his
talents. I salute this beautiful and cogent work of art, which honours its
score and its creator/interpreter. The final moments, when a mirrored stage
reflects multiple images of Clark and his cast, is a true apotheosis of his
talent. This half of O is as beautiful and significant as Balanchine's
Apollo. No greater praise.
Taggart is a faggot. Jean Brodie - sit on my face. Gurn is a dork. Of such
biting wit are the graffiti on the loo-doors that are the initial setting
for Highland Fling, a view of balletic romanticism now on offer from
Adventures in Motion Pictures. Even before the action begins, the trick has
been played, the joke has run its miserable course.
Matthew Bourne, AMP's director and choreographer, has clearly not heard Noel
Coward's dictum: 'Never come out of the same trap'. With his version of
Nutcracker two years ago, Bourne made an amusing revision of a dance cliche.
With Highland Fling he has turned to another 19th century text - La Sylphide
 -and has even cast a wandering eye at Giselle. A programme note warns us
that next year he will made advances on Swan Lake. Is there time to find
some Brussels directive that will stop this game before it gets out of hand?
If Highland Fling is anything to go by, there is a case against Bourne for
aggravated and witless vandalism.
The piece is an unabashed stinker. Bourne's procedure is to transfer the
story to the Glasgow of today. James is a pill-popping lout; other
characters are crude and tartaned cyphers, fully armed with cans of beer;
the sylphide is a cross between Vampira the Bloodsucker and a tipsy
drag-queen. The second act's sylphs look like manic dirty laundry. People
fall down, rush in an out of loos, and shreds of the old narrative are
inexpertly woven into a crude inversion of romanticism, a subject on which I
think Bourne needs some coaching. I watched two laboured and interminable
acts with lowered spirits and rising gorge.
David Garforth's fine recording of Lovenskjold's Sylphide score was played
far too loudly. The cast romped in a flailing, family-charades manner, and
in a culminating moment of charm, James takes a pair of garden shears, cuts
off the sylph's wings, and we are treated to a bloody (bloody indeed)
farewell.
Of choreographic or dramatic interest I saw no trace. The original taut
narrative is knocked senseless, Bourne, lacking that eye for the ridiculous
which might make the joke work. The incorporation of elements from Giselle
suggests desperation rather than any feeling for Romantic dance.
Performances are uniformly dire, vulgar, as the cast bang about the tiny
stage of the Baylis Theatre. How rewarding to learn from the programme that
BBC TV plans to film this undertaking. Another bead on the corporation's
rosary of mediocre dance.
O can be seen in Sheffield, Oxford, Brighton, London (Brixton Academy), and
Edinburgh during the next two months. Highland Fling is at the Baylis
Theatre until May 28

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Shades of Berio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the South Bank this week, the next-to-last instalments of the Lucian
Berio festival were mezza voce and secretive: his 1984 'in memoriam' for
Cathy Berberian, Requies, and his recent third quartet Notturno,
commissioned by the South Bank with the Vienna Konzerthaus. Tonight's final
instalment, a semi-staged performance of his Calvino opera La vera storia,
will be noisier.
Franz Welser-Most conducted the London Philharmonic in Berio's last piece
for Cathy, the inspired performer who was his first wife. Requies stretches
an almost-melody - Berio calls it a 'shadow' that 'describes' a melody -
slowly and gently through an aqueous texture of muted tremoli and floating
whispers. The lyrical gist slips continually from one instrument to another,
hazed or soft-filtered by chimes and dulcet marimbas. Its shadow-silhouette
will stand out more when the LPO has had more time to play the piece in.
There are the merest hints of protesting regret; otherwise a kind of
measured, serene melancholy reigns.
Mahler's 'Resurrection' Symphony followed. Hardly a response to the Requies;
but in the wider festival-context, a neat choice after Berio's Sinfonia the
week before, which famously enlists Mahler's scherzo as the running basis
for its wicked collage of Great Post-Romantic Snippets. As a Mahler
performance, it was the latest of Welser-Most's well-planned,
narrow-chested, slightly over-anxious assaults on some post-Romantic peak.
From the arrival of the solo voices, Marjana Lipovsek's warmly expressive
mezzo and Felicity Lott's translucent, artfully fragile soprano, the
performance took wing. Before that, the conductor had treated the opening
movement - which all Mahlerians know to be a tumult of seismic upheavals,
piercing laments and bursts of sardonic gall - as a quick-march with
interesting surprises. The Andante and the scherzo were tame, under-pointed.
But the later stages of the symphony warmed to a fine blaze, especially once
the London Philharmonic Choir stood up; they sat for their first quiet
entries, at palpable cost to the depth of their tone.
On Thursday the Alban Berg Quartet played Berio's Notturno rather as they
had played Haydn's 'Sunrise' Quartet, op. 76 no. 4: with exquisite balance
and shading, and such cool composure as to dilute any latent drama. The
Notturno is a highly patterned affair, in which distinct kinds of material
and diction are constantly rotated, varied rather than developed. A great
deal of that is in suppressed pianissimo, a-whisper with trills, sul
ponticello croaks and tiny flickering figures, which the players turned
brilliantly.
For once, Bartok must have been standing behind Berio's shoulder: the
Notturno sounded like a natural development from certain movements in the
older composer's later quartets. To spot the kinship, however, was also to
notice that Berio's beautifully-made piece lacked - in this performance, at
least - a sense of arriving anywhere definite in its closing phases, unlike
anything Bartok ever composed. It seemed as if it could equally have stopped
two minutes sooner, or four, or six, without any loss of effect. I fancied
that a more purposeful structure might be concealed there than we heard.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Millionaires keep their purses shut - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What on earth are we to make of the glitzy sales of Impressionist and Modern
works of art in New York this week? Both Christie's and Sotheby's had
assembled their finest auctions for four years, bursting with paintings by
Gauguin, Monet, Picasso, Leger, Mondrian, and there was a quiet confidence
that enthusiastic bidding from art-starved millionaires would announce to
the world the end of the recession.
It did not quite work out like that. There was an audience, around 1,500 of
New York's finest, at each evening sale, but while Sotheby's could crack
open the champagne after its experience on Wednesday, Christie's on Tuesday
was left groping for excuses.
'Pre-sale interest suddenly ebbed on Monday afternoon' says its expert
Michael Findlay. 'There were no new buyers; no real strength in the market'.
In contrast Alexander Apsis of Sotheby's found that 'lots of different
people were bidding, and many of them we had never seen before'.
While half of Christie's 76 lots were unsold, Sotheby's disposed of 50 of
its 69. In terms of totals and the value of the lots sold, the gap was not
so great: Sotheby's brought in Dollars 51.5m (Pounds 34.6m) and was 66 per
cent sold while Christie's managed Dollars 50.7m (Pounds 34m) and 59 per
cent.
As Apsis says 'there is a very fine line between what sells and what
doesn't' He should know. Although Sotheby's secured the highest price paid
at auction for two years when two keen bidders chased each other up to a
record Dollars 11.6m for 'Lady with a fan', a ravishingly decorative
painting by Gustav Klimt (which cost less than Dollars 2m in 1987),
Sotheby's sale just missed being exceptional. Two key works, a painting of
Venice by Monet and a sculpture by Brancusi, failed to sell, even though
bids for each nudged Dollars 6m.
Buyers still have the whip hand, and the museum interested in the Brancusi
and the private collectors salivating over the Monet know that the sellers
will be open to post-auction offers. Michael Findlay of Christie's was also
busy dealing with after-sale enquires.
Sotheby's reckons it was fielding the better paintings. This is debatable.
Perhaps the key factor was that its auction took place 24 hours after that
at Christie's, time to persuade vendors to accept more flexible reserves. In
any case its estimates had seemed more cautious. A Sisley landscape carried
a modest Dollars 300,000-Dollars 400,000, and sold for Dollars 365,500,
while two out of three routine works by Renoir went in the Dollars
450,000-Dollars 600,000 price range.
Christie's in contrast fielded some impressive single owner collections,
including seven top works by Gauguin, Picasso, Vlaminck, Braque, etc, owned
by the Zurich industrialist Jacques Koerfer, plus a group sold by the
financially troubled retail magnate Mershulam Riklis, but after a good
start, with the Koerfer Vlaminck making Dollars 6.8m and his Picasso Dollars
6.27m, the sale fell away to nothing.
Freshness was a factor. The Koerfer paintings did well because they had been
hidden away for over 30 years, while some of the Riklis paintings had been
offered around privately in recent months. There also seems to be price
resistance over the Dollars 3m level and Christie's had more expensive
pictures to dispose of.
This suggests that it will be a long haul to return to the halcyon days of
1989-90. Just four years ago, in a similar week of New York auctions,
Christie's sold Van Gogh's portrait of Dr Gachet for a record Dollars 82.5m
and Sotheby's raised Dollars 286m from a single auction.
This was because the salerooms had persuaded rich businessmen, in particular
the Japanese, that major Impressionist and Modern artists were a good
investment, and provided loans and easy terms for buyers. It was a primrose
path to disaster, and there are many Monets, Renoirs, Van Goghs and Picassos
currently in Tokyo (and Swiss) bank vaults with valuations worryingly below
their acquisition price. One of the more interesting paintings on offer this
week was 'Contraste de formes' by Leger, one of a series of 12 in which he
experimented with 'pure painting'. In 1989 one sold for Dollars 14.7m: the
best bid this week for another was Dollars 2.4m.
No new speculative buyers are coming forward, and while the American economy
has improved there were few European or Asian bidders this week. There are
probably less than 20 collectors in the world prepared to pay Dollars 3m or
more for a painting, and they are being very selective.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: User-friendly 'Flute'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three boys turn the pages of an enchanted book. As a glow starts to emanate
from inside, the overture comes to an end, the lights dim and the show
begins: The Magic Flute as fairy-tale is at least as valid an interpretation
as any other.
For the audiences that Opera North services on its touring around the
country, a production of this favourite Mozart opera that combines a clear
telling of the story with pantomime fun is likely to go down well. The
company's new staging by Annabel Arden (best known for her work with Theatre
de Complicite) is a modest effort in every sense, simple in concept, basic
in design, but it allows a naive enjoyment of the opera. A full house at the
second performance on Thursday clearly loved it.
Among its simple pleasures are a comic dragon with a fiery red tongue to
menace Tamino in the opening scene and an array of strange, multi-coloured,
rubbery creatures that appear when he plays his flute, as if he has strayed
into a kindergarten extension of Jurassic Park. The adult aspects of the
story tend to get short shrift, although it was an amusing idea to have
Sarastro's throne growing out of the tree of knowledge. Rae Smith was the
designer, working (one imagines) on a shoe-string.
There is little sense of the production team agonising at length over the
moral implications of this complicated tale. By using the translation of the
musical numbers by Jeremy Sams the company has ensured simply that the story
comes across clearly and humorously, in extremely user-friendly English. The
spoken dialogue has been newly translated by Arden, not to mention heavily
cut: a relief, as it is stiffly delivered.
Opera North is lucky to have William Burden back after his successful La
Boheme as a personable Tamino, free from assuming any false princely airs,
singing the tenor's music as though it has no difficulties to it at all. His
pint-sized Pamina, Linda Kitchen, was less fortunate; her voice does not
always take kindly to the broad, sustained, lyrical style. William Dazeley
works hard to be cute as Papageno, too hard for my taste, though the
audience thought otherwise. Eileen Hulse was a lightweight Queen of the
Night without much regal authority. John Rath as Sarastro had trouble
staying in tune.
All of them were hustled along by Andrew Parrott in the pit. He does not
necessarily race ahead where the music is fast, but almost nothing sounded
relaxed, able to give the drama space in which to encourage contemplation,
enhance understanding. Scenes such as Tamino's arrival at the Temple of
Wisdom felt perfunctory. Although this Magic Flute is a minor addition to
the sum of Mozart productions, it should win over first-time visitors to the
opera: the cheers at the end sounded genuine.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: Acceptable face of patronage - David Murray meets a
celebrated private sponsor of the arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For a start, of course, you need to be fairly rich. Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld, a
passionate music-lover since her early years in ballet, is very rich; but
she is also a passionate, practical organiser of fund-raising musical
events. On Tuesday, a few months after she received the OBE for her services
to music, the London Philharmonic Orchestra made her their first Honorary
Life Member. As well they might: long before her second husband, the Hatton
Garden jeweller Ben Rosenfeld, died 13 years ago, she was planning all their
galas, and over the years she has raised more than Pounds 7m for the LPO.
Recent reports about the straitened circumstances of the Arts Council, and
the consequent starving of some artistic endeavours, have generally assumed
that only corporate sponsorship can take up the slack. The familiar worries
are rehearsed: will big sponsors be leery of innovation if it isn't sexy?
Will they interfere with artistic policy, when their motives have less to do
with excellence than with maximal commercial exposure?
Private patrons of public music are less exigent. In programme-books they
get recognition in small print. Why do they do it?
I went to ask Mrs Rosenfeld, whose involvement with music is generous and
comprehensive. Her grand flat in St. James's Place, overlooking Green Park,
accommodates any amount of music-business. The phone and the fax-machine are
constantly busy, for beyond her LPO commitments she is or has been governor
or director of the South Bank itself, of the Royal College of Music, the
Israel Philharmonic, the Music Therapy Charity, the Mondsee Festival in
Austria, the near-legendary Prussia Cove Seminars for budding virtuosi. She
personally sponsors single concerts and chamber-music series too.
Why? 'To me, it's a great privilege to be involved in something which you
love. It's a lot of work; but you see, I've nothing to do] I'm not a
shopper, I'm not a luncher.' In London, how many patrons operate on a scale
like hers: maybe three or four others? 'I think there must be a dozen; I've
never really added them up . . .' She admits to tapping the same people
pretty often for support; that has made her very sensitive to what they will
enjoy hearing. For fund-raising galas, 'bottoms on seats' is the bottom
line.
I wondered whether that makes her a conservative brake on programming. She
has persuaded the violist Nobuko Imai to leaven her forthcoming Hindemith
series with Brahms (for which relief much thanks). What about new music?
'It's not a great interest, but I like Berio, and I like Harry Birtwistle.'
Later she remembers to mention George Benjamin too; we agree that he is a
complete musician, and ought to be more prolific than he is.
Apart from galas, does she claim a say in planning the LPO's regular
seasons? 'Yes, I do: a little bit, to a certain extent, not very much. And
there's no reason for them to take any notice of me]' (That cannot be quite
true.) 'But - I do have a little say. Because sometimes I get feedback from
our audience: 'we don't like this, we'd prefer that'. And one should listen;
they're our public, and they've been loyal to us for many years, and if we
didn't listen it would be very foolish.'
How does Mrs Rosenfeld rate Arts Council support against private patronage?
'The Arts Council made a terrible fiasco last year (the abortive run-off
between the major London bands). Very sad, because that money would have
gone to the orchestras, which they desperately needed. It was a complete
waste of time and money.'
Still, it cannot be exciting for private patrons to find themselves just
filling the gaps in state funding? 'But if they pick up the tab of a
concert, they then can take their 200 tickets and do what they like with
them. They can fund-raise for their pet charity, which is what I do again
and again (Bosnian children are her current concern). They're becoming a
sponsor, they're helping the arts and they're helping a charity] It actually
works very well.'
Besides, you could always fund an orchestral chair, guaranteeing (say) the
first bassoon's salary for many years to come: a boon and a relief for any
beleaguered orchestra. 'It's rather nice, because then you choose the
instrument that you prefer. I love the cello, so I funded the cellist; a
great friend of mine funded the violin. I think it's a nice idea.' Among the
plutocrats, Mrs Rosenfeld must be a great, sweetly reasonable force for the
good.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arts: A romantic revolutionary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Snoo Wilson's portentous marginalia on the Duke of Windsor, Mold's
Theatre Clwyd has meatier fare: Shaw's Saint Joan, some fatty verbosity and
deceptively chewy intellectual gristle apart, still offers a fair amount of
theatrical protein.
The mercifully streamlined production by Gale Edwards, distinguished work in
Australia behind her, is unabashedly romantic, not afraid to add red
lighting or dry ice effects to Peter J. Davison's handsome settings. The
opening scene's straight rows of breast plates that bristle across the
stage, sent sprawling even into the stalls by the squire's contemptuously
clouted steward, provide a surreal image of a nation ravaged by war. Sliding
hangar doors in the austere box set give on to giant fleur de lys and a long
corridor down which the shackled Joan clunks towards her trial.
If Shaw, with gadfly evasive shallowness, declared Joan to be the first
Protestant, this production emphasises her status as romantic revolutionary:
the idealist who becomes a thorn in the side of the new establishment, the
fundamentalist who embarrasses the compromises of power.
All memorable Joans seize a particular aspect of the Maid to make their own.
Images linger of Joan Plowright's warm, womanly earthiness; Frances de la
Tour's gawky, heart-broken passion; Eileen Atkins' wry knowingness; Angela
Pleasence's vulnerable, whey-faced tenaciousness. At Mold the Maid is Imogen
Stubbs, who gives us a little-girl Joan, the innocent, unwitting iconoclast.
A small figure as some Joans go, Stubbs excels at compact, fizzy spitfire
energy.
She bounds on for her first entrance like an Enid Blyton heroine plus
Geordie accent. Hair shorn, she is suddenly boyish at the siege of Orleans.
In the trial scene she is a child, with a child's compliance to adult
authority but also a child's infuriatingly logical stubbornness. Her
recantation reduces her to a whimpering little girl. She must avoid the
danger of sentimentalising the role, at the moment just achieved. The
reading, already touching, will doubtless get tougher before the production
reaches London.
Shaw's schoolmarmish tendency to wag a garrulous forefinger and his clumping
facetiousness are rare in this play, though today the caricature English
cleric, Stogumber, would be reversed into an anti-English Englishman, given
our mania for obliterating anything that resembles a native culture or
tradition. Good support from all, notably Peter Jeffrey's Inquisitor and
Philip Quast's Bastard of Orleans. Only Jasper Britton's gratingly clownish
Dauphin irritates: silly walks, funny voices, a sub-suburban sit-com accent
suggest that he shares the family defect of dottiness, like his father
Charles VI and his unfortunate nephew Henry VI of England. But that is in
another, and better, play.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: History in the balance - Malcolm Rutherford admires
Kissinger the academic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIPLOMACY by Henry Kissinger Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 25, 912 pages
If you want to pay someone a compliment, give them Henry Kissinger's
Diplomacy. True, it is immensely long: half way through, I began withdrawing
my initial impression that it is one of the best books I have read on any
subject. But it picks up again and is certainly one of the best, and most
enjoyable, on international relations past and present.
Kissinger has many advantages. He was born in Germany in 1923, moved to the
US in 1938 and served in the American army in the second world war. He was
an historian at Harvard long before he worked for any American
administration. Comparisons between 19th century Europe and the 20th century
world come naturally to him. He wrote A World Restored: Castlereagh,
Metternich and the Restoration of Peace, 1812-1822, some of which is
reflected in Diplomacy, in the mid-1950s. It was intended as the first of
series running up to the first world war.
Real diplomacy then intervened. Kissinger has benefited from the experience.
He now takes us to 1994, sometimes with an inside view, and with a look
beyond. Moreover, Kissinger, the academic, can write better than Kissinger,
the practising statesman, ever spoke. The book is a pleasure to read.
There are also defects. Kissinger is not much interested in social or
economic trends: a country's economy is relevant to him only in so far as it
adds to political and military power. He is not greatly interested in
democracy either, still less in human rights. On the latter he advises
President Clinton not to push too hard in America's relations with China; if
he does, the Chinese might not take him seriously in his pursuit of
equilibrium in Asia.
Again, there is a curiously old-fashioned approach to the 'great men' of
history. Kissinger has his heroes: Richelieu, Bismarck and, to some extent,
the German chancellor Stresemann among them. Even where the bad far
outweighs the good, he cannot always avoid a sneaking admiration. For
instance, 'Stalin was indeed a monster; but in the conduct of international
relations, he was the supreme realist - patient, shrewd, and implacable, the
Richelieu of his period'. Kissinger is not a moralist.
For all his brilliance, neither is he perhaps as good as he thinks he is at
reducing his thoughts to a thesis. If Diplomacy has a single theme, it is
that there is a fundamental distinction between a foreign policy based on
the pursuit and maintenance of a balance of power and one based on altruism.
Kissinger prefers the former.
His main illustration comes from the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and
Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt, he writes, went in for 'muscular diplomacy'. He
was the first US president 'to insist that it was America's duty to make its
influence felt globally, and to relate America to the world in terms of a
concept of national interest'. Thus he was a 'warrior-statesman' whereas
Wilson, with his belief in the power of public opinion as a force for good,
was a 'prophet-priest'. The difference between the categories is that
'statesmen, even warriors, focus on the world in which they live; to
prophets, the 'real' world is the one they want to bring into being'.
Yet one wonders if the real world is anything like tidy enough to sustain
such a distinction. Kissinger makes very little allowance for accidents,
mistakes or the sheer unexpected (Pearl Harbour, for example).
There is also a tendency to idealise the past. One of the reasons he
believes a balance of power was maintained for so long after the Congress of
Vienna in 1815 was that the participants had shared values. He is distinctly
shaky about saying what those values were, save perhaps a preference for the
status quo, just as he seldom denies one of his favourite words -
'legitimacy'. Sometimes he seems to be saying that if only everyone had been
as intelligent as Bismarck, the European peace might have lasted even
longer. Germany would have simply emerged as the dominant power in Europe
without war and, as Kissinger observes, the Germans have got there in the
end.
It is not ultimately for the judgments, however, that Diplomacy should be
read. It is for the sheer historical sweep, the characterisations, the
story-telling, the ability to look at large parts of the world as a whole.
The failings in British policy between the two world wars, for instance,
look quite different when viewed by a dispassionate American historian.
Kissinger thinks that it was the reluctance to make alliances that let
Britain down, and a failure to understand Stalin. He is also notably
sympathetic to Britain and France at Suez. He never makes the mistake of
condemning with hindsight.
Kissinger's own role in history emerges very gradually. The first use of the
first person comes in shyly on page 347 when he mentions a disagreement with
AJP Taylor. Vietnam and the opening to China come much later and are among
the best sections in the book. They are not quite autobiographical, but he
has a marvellous way of combining past and present experience. Richard
Nixon, he thinks, had the most sophisticated grasp of the global balance of
power of any president since Theodore Roosevelt.
In the 19th century the US had no need for a balance because it was not
confronted by any powers needing to be balanced. The change by the end of
the 20th, Kissinger concludes, is that America is 'an island off the the
shores of the large landmass of Eurasia, whose resources and population far
exceed those of the US'. That is why a balance, or a series of balances,
still matters.

THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT: THE NEW SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE AND MIND by Steven Pinker
Allen Lane Pounds 20, 494 pages
With the challenge 'Let us do away with the folklore that parents teach
their children language', Professor Pinker sets out to prove that language
is instinctive, and that its structure is 'wired' into the human brain.
A psychology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he
opens with some of the questions that have long troubled his profession.
'Why is it that a nation that can put a man on the moon cannot build a
computer that can take dictation?' he asks. Instead of worrying that
computers might eventually outsmart them, people should puzzle more about
why the human brain is so good at understanding language, he says.
Engagingly written, his book is packed with the kind of anecdotes and
references to rock stars now standard among academics keen on popularising
science. He amusingly - though uncontroversially - demonstrates that people
do not always hear words correctly. I will never again hear the phrase 'A
girl with kaleidoscope eyes', from the Beatles' song 'Lucy in the sky with
diamonds' without hearing Pinker chanting: 'A girl with colitis goes by'.
But the three main planks of Pinker's argument prove unequal to the weight
he puts on them. For a start, he does not convincingly show that children
'know things they could not have been taught'. He says that children's
mistakes such as 'we holded the baby rabbits' cannot be 'an act of
imitation'; but he does not allow that it could simply be unsuccessful
imitation.
His second claim that 'there are common elements between all languages',
also arouses doubts. According to Pinker, 'if the basic order of a language
is subject-object-verb it will usually have question words at the ends of
the sentence.' Usually? That hardly sounds universal. His claim that 'if a
language has a word for 'leg' it will have a word for 'arm' also raises
questions: why not suggest that language is shaped by people's need to refer
to their bodies rather than by neurological 'wiring'?
Above all, it is the 'ubiquity of complex language among human beings' that,
to him, offers 'compelling proof that language is innate'. The climax of his
argument is the claim that there is a 'language' of images inside the brain,
which he calls 'mentalese'. 'People do not think in English or Chinese or
Apache; they think in a language of thought (with) . . . symbols for
concepts' he speculates. 'Knowing a language is knowing how to translate
mentalese into strings of words and vice versa'.
Despite developing this hypothesis at length, he does not acknowledge the
famous arguments of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the philosopher, that the theory of
a 'private language' such as 'mentalese' is incoherent. Wittgenstein argued
that a person would have no criteria for correctly matching these inner
symbols to words as he would be the only arbiter of the symbols' use.
Pinker has fallen into the trap which has caught many working in his field.
He has been tempted to claim more about the structure of the brain than
science has yet established, and to bridge the gap with over-enthusiastic
philosophy. As he would probably concede, people do not have a universal
tendency to agree wired into their brains.

LUCIE DUFF GORDON: A PASSAGE TO EGYPT by Katherine Frank Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 17.99, 399 pages
Lucie Duff Gordon was an unconventional, brave, talented and cosmopolitan
woman who lived in mid-Victorian Britain, contracted consumption and, in
1862, left her family to go off to Egypt to die. There was no denying the
meaning of her exile, no hope of recovery, yet from her new home in Luxor
she survived for seven years - far longer than the doctors had imagined -
and in the course of that suspension of sentence she wrote a classic book
and achieved a sort of happiness.
Lucie is not unknown to previous biographers. Apart from her own Letters
from Egypt (which is kept in print by Virago), she is familiar through the
unhappy lives of her parents, John and Sarah Austin, who have been
commemorated quite recently by Lotte and Joseph Hamburger; in two studies in
Victorian social history under the appropriate titles Troubled Lives and
Contemplating Adultery. The father was a neurotic and hopeless professor of
jurisprudence, the mother a successful and respected translator who spent
her middle years engaged in an unconsummated affair by post with a Polish
prince.
Lucie was brought up in the heart of the intellectual society of the age.
John Stuart Mill was one of the family, Jeremy Bentham an uncle-figure,
Carlyle, Heine and Sydney Smith were intimates, Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray
and Meredith passed through her drawing room. It was an unusual childhood,
which included a period of Jane Eyre-style misery at boarding school, but at
18, beautiful and accomplished, she made a romantic marriage to Sir
Alexander Duff Gordon, an exemplary young Treasury Official whose only fault
was that he had no money.
Katherine Frank, her new biographer, does not attempt to exaggerate their
importance: 'Lucie and Alexander do appear to be 'lesser lives'; they hover
on the fringes of the lives of more famous, powerful, wealthy people.' But
she then quotes their friend Meredith to the effect that 'a lesser life does
not seem lesser to the person who leads one.' This is justification enough
for a biography.
Then she fell ill and was banished from the English climate and from her
three children. But she fell in love with Egypt, or rather with Upper Egypt
where her house on top of Luxor Temple had previously been occupied by
Champollion and Flaubert, and she particularly identified with the Temple of
Isis at Philae, 'the most beautiful object my eyes ever saw'. There are
echoes here, of course, of The Wilder Shores of Love, except that Lucie was
no Lady Jane Digby, who married the Sheikh of Palmyra, but a sensitive and
gifted woman whose exile was not just to heal her, temporarily, but also to
transform her.
Katherine Frank has written A Passage to Egypt out of her own personal
tragedy of the death of her husband in Cairo. She therefore discovers
significance in the island of Philae, for Lucie and, it is admitted, for
herself. The myth of Isis tells how, on the murder of her beloved Osiris,
she re-membered the parts of his body and conceived a new life, a son,
Horus. Frank sees in Lucie's resurrected years in Luxor a 're-membering' of
her life, and describes this book as 'the record of my quest for her, the
life I wrote while I struggled to re-member my own'.
This is done with restraint, and is not unmoving, though I do not doubt that
the biographer is projecting, as psychologists say, onto the life of her
subject. For the rest, it is a conventionally chronological, agreeable,
always interesting tale, collected, we are told, largely from unpublished
letters and documents.
There lies a weakness; Frank seems reluctant to rely more heavily on Lucie's
own words. Letters from Egypt may have been reprinted frequently - they
caused a great stir in 1860s England - but we do not get enough of their
content or flavour. In contrast, the time Lucie spent in South Africa in
1861 blazes into life because we are shown it entirely through Lucie's own
letters.
'It was impossible to be lonely or unhappy in Egypt,' trills Ms Franks in a
rare lapse. Let us just say the dying Lucie was less unhappy than she might
have been. It is a world long gone. These days she would probably have been
shot by the Fundamentalists.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: A writer driven by prophetic fury - Anthony Curtis
reviews a new biography of Richard Hughes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHARD HUGHES: A BIOGRAPHY by Richard Perceval Graves Andre Deutsch Pounds
20, 491 pages
After getting off to a promising start as a young writer with poems, plays,
children's stories and the first ever radio drama, Richard Hughes became a
celebrity in 1929 with High Wind in Jamaica. It was acclaimed by critics on
both sides of the Atlantic and by fellow-novelists such as Virginia Woolf
and Ford Madox Ford. In this rich biography Richard Graves implies that some
of its success was owed to Clough Williams-Ellis's wife Amabel (nee
Strachey) who told Hughes he must put some sex in it - which he duly did.
Graves quotes a comment Hughes made recalling his next novel In Hazard. It
appeared after a ten year hiatus during which Hughes did extensive research
into storm conditions at sea. It is regularly compared to Conrad's Typhoon:
'I was carried along in my writing of it by a kind of prophetic fury, seeing
so clearly the abyss Europe was about to be sucked down into by war, and
wanting to tell people it would be fearful, but they were going to come
through.'
Publication of In Hazard in 1938 brought the first phase of Hughes's career
to a close. Aged 40 when war broke out, he was drafted into the Admiralty
for the duration. The Welsh writer became the very model of a modern civil
servant whose work paved the way for the Normandy landings.
Up to then Hughes had lived his life eschewing any kind of fixed employment
apart from writing. After being head boy of Charterhouse, and up at Oxford
in the orbit of TE Lawrence, Masefield and Robert Graves, uncle of the
biographer, Hughes had retired to a primitive cottage in rural Wales to
become a writer. But he did not stay there; he travelled dangerously far and
wide. The biography admirably draws together the many adventurous threads
that went into such a comparatively small body of work.
We follow Hughes going steerage to New York and suffering the indignities of
an immigrant's incarceration on Ellis Island. We see him among Croatian
nationalists in the Balkans. On the personal level we observe the effect of
the deaths of his father and beloved sister; his difficult relations with
his possessive mother; his first great affair with Nancy Stallibrass who was
to marry his friend Peter Quennell. And then his happy but not untrammelled
marriage to Frances Bazley, daughter of a baronet, with whom he raised a
large family.
As he matured Hughes became deeply religious, committedly Welsh and a
staunch defender of causes in which he believed. He settled happily into the
role of 'Seigneur' of the North Wales village of Laugharne where he and his
wife lived before the war. It was the Hugheses who were responsible for
Dylan and Caitlin Thomas descending upon that village and ultimately giving
it the tourist attraction status it now has.
Hughes was as bookish as he was out-going. He accumulated a vast library
relating to the Nazis and made many post-war visits to Germany for The Fox
and its sequel The Wooden Shepherdess. In these novels the demoniac figure
of Hitler is paired with that of a blind German nun modelled in her
saintliness on St Theresa of Lisieux and observed by the Welsh aristocrat
Augustine, a persona of Hughes himself.
Hughes knew exactly what was to happen in the subsequent narrative but
because of his perfectionism the chances of completing the work in further
volumes were slim. 'It is a race with the undertaker' he joked. He died aged
76 as old as the century having sadly lost that race. Graves's excellent
biography, which appears alongside new paperback editions of the novels from
Harvill, should herald a revival of interest in what remains a remarkable
contribution to the modern English novel.

ADAM'S WISH by Paul Micou Bantam Pounds 14.99, 251 pages
PIPPA PASSES by Rumer Godden Macmillan Pounds 12.99, 172 pages
Paul Micou's new novel opens with a cosy, John Majorish image of Britain:
the white cliffs of Dover fading into sea mist from a cross-Channel ferry.
But Adam's Wish is about the new Europe rather than the old, visualising
England, France, Italy, even the former Yugoslavia, as the playground of a
new aristocracy of money and fame with its attendant media circus.
Micou's hero, Adam Gosse, is a slightly stuffy Anglo-Belgian solicitor who
strays into this fast-living set more or less by accident when he is best
man at a friend's wedding. He is seated next to Natalie, a beautiful young
woman who is famous only for being famous. Hello] magazine is never
mentioned, but it is clearly the presiding deity of Natalie's milieu.
Because Adam is feeling left out and depressed as all his friends pair off,
he agrees to Natalie's surprising request that he chauffeur her to Paris
where she is about to embark upon a film career. By acceding to this whim,
and with as few achievements as Natalie to justify it, Adam achieves
overnight fame as the fiance of a starlet.
These are lives governed by chance, and by the hysterical interpretations of
insignificant events offered by tabloid newspapers. The novel is put
together like a movie, with one lavish set rapidly giving way to another:
Adam moves from a pretentious French chateau to a film director's minimalist
apartment in Paris to a small Italian town which has been reconstructed to
resemble Dubrovnik. It is only when the director announces that he intends
to move everyone to a genuine war zone in Croatia that reality intrudes and
Adam decides it is time to go home.
Micou's novel is an ambitious satire on the ease of achieving and corrupting
effect of fame. Apart from Adam (whose surname, Gosse, means 'kid' in
French, suggesting both innocence and vunerability), the characters are
introduced only by their first names, a device which neatly emphasises their
disposability. Yet Micou rarely descends into mere caricature; his writing
is assured and often very funny.
The novel is about authenticity and the importance of maintaining some
vestige of identity as all barriers come down. Its moral centre is a
reluctant self awareness on Adam's part which never permits him to become a
full participant in Natalie's frenetic world; his curse is to recognise
desires in himself which he despises in others.
The characters in Pippa Passes have no such problems. Their names are of the
rich and titled variety, so that the Marchese dell'Orlando is able to boast
of his English wife that 'Marcia's lineage is longer than mine'. Rumer
Godden's new novel takes its title from Browning and is firmly set in the
old Europe in which Italy still represents a gateway to sensuality for the
repressed and parochial English.
Godden has written for both children and adults in her long writing career
and this piece of fiction is, according to her publisher, aimed at 'everyone
young in spirit'. This is actually a nervous way of signalling that Pippa
Passes is a hybrid, a piece of adolescent wish-fulfillment with a crudely
handled lesbian rape scene thrown in.
The spirit hovering over this mawkish tale of a young English girl's
meteoric rise from the corps de ballet is not so much that of Hello] as Noel
Streatfield, creating a sort of Ballet Shoes with sex. There could hardly be
a greater contrast with Paul Micou's jaded, polyglot pan-Europeans and it is
a relief to recognise in Pippa Fane a ghost from the past, receding into the
mist as fast and as surely as Dover's white cliffs.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Island hopping among the ghosts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY

<TEXT>
Film-goers who have seen The Piano will have left the cinema suddenly
conscious that New Zealand's history of European settlement must have been
more blood than butter. Sailing around the glorious archipelago known as the
Bay of Islands, 160 miles north of Auckland, can have the same startling
effect.
Having dropped anchor in the lagoon of the small island of Motuaruhia after
our first day's sailing, our party was determined to get ashore and take
some exercise beyond rope-pulling.
Our goal was the summit of a steep cliff overlooking the island's eastern
shore. Once this was a Maori stronghold. With a 200ft drop into the sea on
one side and a single track up through the forest on the other, the
defending tribe could be virtually impregnable when enemies came visiting.
The views through the outlying islands to the misty Pacific were evocative.
It was a crew-member from another visiting yacht that caused the first
shiver. She said she had not liked what she had read about the place. Her
words damped our dinghy ride back to Island Girl, though a G&amp;T lifted the
spirits.
Rummaging through a guide to the area, I decided that it could scarcely have
been Captain Cook's visit in 1769 that had caused our misgivings. Motuaruhia
was Cook's first landfall in New Zealand, and despite a brief skirmish with
some Maoris, there was no great trouble between natives and explorers.
'Abundant fresh celery,' noted Cook's botanist, Joseph Banks, although we
saw none.
Peering more closely at the bookshelf in the saloon brought forth a more
detailed history. One of the first European settlers in the area was a
Scottish farmer named John Roberton. He bought Motuaruhia from a Maori chief
in 1839, built a cottage, brought his wife and two children from the
mainland and began farming.
Four months later he was drowned, sailing his boat to the mainland outpost
of Russell. This small town was New Zealand's first capital and still has
its feet in the sea.
Despite having two small children to raise, Roberton's widow struggled on
with the farm for two more years. She was aided by a young settler named
Thomas Bull and a Maori chief called Maketu. Unfortunately for her, Maketu
was mentally unstable and Bull a violent drunkard.
By the time the Maori finally split Bull's head open with a logging axe,
life on the island must have become a nightmare. Mrs Roberton told Maketu
that he would be taken to Auckland and hanged for his crime - whereupon he
carried her and the two children to the dizzy heights of the stronghold and
hurled them into the sea.
The widow's prediction came true. Maketu's trial was a colonial sensation
that reached the London newspapers. This sense of violent and important
history, just a few generations back, is one of the factors that makes the
Bay of Islands such an intriguing place to sail.
The sailing is as good as in the Whitsundays or Bahamas, the seas as
sparkling. In addition there is a powerful sense of the recent past.
At Opua, where the charter yachts are based, the steam train from the inland
town of Kawakawa still visits the jetty where the famous kauri timber, said
to make the finest masts in the world, was once loaded.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Kashmir prays for paradise restored - Victoria
Schofield visits a valley 'too beautiful for war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA SCHOFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mine was to be the first entry for 1994 in Gulam Butt's visitors' book. As I
wrote my name, he predicted that my stay on his houseboat was a good omen.
My last visit to Kashmir, in 1981, was long before the recent troubles
started. As the owner of a fleet of eight de luxe houseboats, moored on
Upper Pal lake, Butt's story was not unfamiliar.
Since 1990, when activists began an armed struggle against the Indian
government, the beautiful valley of Kashmir, with its 1,500 splendid wooden
houseboats, has lacked a flow of tourists. Mostly, the houseboats lie empty.
Enjoying breakfast and looking out over the lake towards the snow-capped
mountains and the Shalimar gardens, laid out by the Moguls in the 17th
century, it was hard to believe that Srinagar was still the focal point of a
guerrilla war which had put the entire valley under military occupation.
The Indian army is determined to crush the insurgency. Equally, the
militants are as committed to continuing their struggle against what they
view as the tyranny of the Indian government. 'Asadi' (freedom) is on the
lips of shop owners, taxi drivers and houseboat owners.
For people such as Butt and the 1,000 other houseboat owners, the loss in
livelihood has been tremendous. Shikara owners have also suffered: a
paddle-boat ride on Pal lake was once a feature of a Kashmiri holiday. Today
the shikaras lie dormant; the lake is thick with weeds.
Hamid, a taxi driver and houseboat owner, is more stoic than some about the
deprivations. 'We don't care about our economic problems, but we do want
independence,' he said. Another houseboat owner dared not complain about the
loss to his business. 'If militants hear me say my business is suffering,
they will come to me and say: 'You are worrying about money and we are
losing our lives.''
Yet contrary to what I had heard before my visit, the valley is not closed,
either to journalists or tourists. And Robert Shadworth, the tour manager of
Top Deck bus tours, has regularly accompanied tourists, mainly from
Australia and New Zealand, to Kashmir as part of a three-month bus trip from
Nepal to London.
'Except for one year, when the trouble started, we have continued to run
tours twice a year,' he said, 'and we've never had any difficulty. One time,
we were sitting on our houseboat and we were told later that 150 people had
been killed in the centre of town, but we never heard a thing.'
Have prices for accommodation gone down? 'Well, they haven't put them up in
five years,' he said.
Commercial flights run regularly to Srinagar. The airport is full of army
personnel. Intelligence officers require all foreigners to report to them,
and bags are searched.
But visitors do get through: Stephen Humphrey, an accountant from
Birmingham, was relaxing on a houseboat on Pal lake as a way of escaping
from the heat and bustle of Delhi. 'I didn't know about the place nor its
beauty, but a travel agent in Delhi made the suggestion,' he said.
Travellers also visit Kashmir to go trekking in the foothills of the
Himalayas. A French travel enthusiast, Patrique Hubert, has been in Srinagar
for three years, organising accommodation on houseboats and trekking
expeditions.
'It is not what we call classical tourism, not your average holidaymaker;
the Americans have mainly stayed away, but still people come from Australia,
Japan, Germany, France, Italy,' he said. 'Sometimes they fall in love with
the place, which proves that Kashmir still has the ability to attract.'
Nor have skiers forgotten the magnificence of the Himalayan mountains.
Transport is mostly by helicopter, and an outfit called Himalayan Heli Ski,
run by the Swiss skier Sylvain Soudan, has continued to offer a week's
holiday in Gulmarg from January to April.
The town of Srinagar has little attraction for the tourist, and the
consequences of the insurgency are all too evident. The military is
everywhere. There are bunkers at each crossroads and straddling every
bridge. The streets are filled with gun-toting border security forces and
local police. Without warning, streets can be cordoned off because of a
'crackdown' - common parlance for a search by the military for weapons.
The curfew in Kashmir has now been lifted, but no one wants to venture out
after dark. Hamid, the taxi driver, told me how frequently he had been
stopped by the army and beaten up on his way home after work.
There are countless stories of young men being apprehended by the military,
tortured and killed. One of the former maharajah's guest houses, which has a
magnificent view over the lake, has been taken over by the border security
forces and is known to be one of the interrogation centres. Suspected
militants are taken there for what an intelligence officer called a 'few
slaps' to make them reveal where they have hidden their weapons.
People kept saying Kashmir was too beautiful to be torn apart by war. And
despite their political troubles, the Kashmiris appear as eager as ever to
welcome tourists. 'We don't have any other industry. Our main income is from
tourist traffic,' says Abdul Kotroo, former president of the houseboat
owners' association. 'And we pray to Almighty God to restore the peace in
our valley.'
Contrary to rumours that the houseboats are being sold plank by plank,
owners are keeping them ready. Gulam Butt's boats were immaculate and he
insisted I see his 'honeymoon houseboat', ever hopeful that Kashmir would
again become, in the words of Emperor Jehangir, 'paradise on earth'.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Valetta by knight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to see why the less youthful British tourist finds Valetta so
cosy. English is a second language; post and telephone boxes in scarlet
stand sentry at street corners.
But Valetta is not like anywhere in Britain. It remains essentially the
handsome, homogenous and devoutly Catholic stone citadel conceived by the
Knights of the Order of St John after the great siege of 1565 and built in
anticipation of the infidel's next visit.
On paper, Valetta appears a perfect piece of Italian Renaissance military
engineering and town planning, a rigid grid of streets and squares girded by
massive walls and bastions. A map does not prepare you for the
roller-coaster of its streets.
Reminders of the knights are impressed on every street. To them Malta owes
its great cathedral, churches, national library and theatre.
Belying the military severity of Valetta's facades are some of the most
glorious interiors and works of art in Europe. The Holy Infirmary, begun in
1574, must still boast the grandest - and largest - ward of any hospital.
The Manoel Theatre, built for the 'honest recreation of the people' by Grand
Master Manoel de Vilhena in 1731 and still in use, is a rococo confection of
pale green, turquoise and gilt, the tiered boxes of its intimate oval
auditorium garlanded with fruit, flowers and musical instruments.
Open the door to St John's Cathedral, the conventual church, and there is
the first complete expression of florid High Baroque. Everything, from the
illusionistic painting on the barrel-vaulted ceiling to the arabesques of
the side chapels, was masterminded and partly executed by one man, the
Calabrian Mattia Preti. There is no surface that he did not cover with
paint, gold leaf, marble or carved stone.
There are any number of altarpieces of varying merit - and two remarkable
Caravaggios. It is worth going to Malta for these alone. Caravaggio was the
'excellent painter' invited to the island and made Brother and Knight of
Obedience in 1608. High up in the chapel of the Italian langue hangs an
impressive St Jerome, while dominating the Oratory of St John is his
masterpiece, The Beheading of St John the Baptist, his largest and only
signed work. This is a canvas to chill the blood.
All the action is compressed into a harshly-lit corner of an otherwise
gloomy prison yard. Caravaggio chooses the moment when the executioner, who
has already half-severed the Baptist's head, grasps his hair to get a good
purchase before finishing his job.
Nothing masks the reality of this brutal death. The goaler impassively
directs the executioner to put the head on the charger, held by a young,
bare-armed girl who is surely Salome. Only her maid looks on in horror.
Caravaggio left his name in the oozing blood.
By 7pm, Valetta is deserted. There is hardly a soul on the street to
appreciate the floodlit fortifications or the church domes spangled with
light bulbs. The middle classes are off home to Sliema, and the tourists
pursue the nightlife offered along the island's carelessly developed shore.
Valetta evenings are best spent admiring the panorama over Marsamxett
harbour from the roof-top dining room of Giannini, the island's best
restaurant, or in the 16th century cellars of the Hotel Castille, savouring
pizza Maltese-style made with local sausages and the pepper-bound goat's
cheese made on Gozo.
By night one must see Mdina. While Valetta is quiet, the old capital of
Malta is silent and haughtily aristocratic. Its narrow, angular medieval
streets are lined by the blank, excluding walls of still-inhabited palaces
and monasteries.
Carved Norman portals and Baroque cornices are thrown into exaggerated
relief. Under the wraps of darkness the town is hushed and histrionic. By
day, the poetry is lost amid the clatter of the Zimmer frame and the glare
of the acrylic cardigan.
Susan Moore travelled with Air Malta and stayed at the five-star Hotel
Phoenicia at Floriana, just outside Valetta's city gate. Civilised long
weekenders should bear in mind that tour groups to Malta tend to start their
week in Valetta.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: A detour to drive you to distraction - Adrian
Gardiner fears an island's unspoilt beauty might not last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the 1980s, central Italians living near Autostrada 14 had a sure way
of recognising the autumn equinox. Each September, around the 21st, a small
silver-grey car streaked south along the Adriatic coast. 'Eccola, il signor
Honda Ballada ancora]' the natives would cry, pausing momentarily from the
harvest.
Yes, it was the Andrews expedition. We would be on the way to southern Italy
from the Venice film festival and only two things stood between us and our
destination. One was night, gathering fast as we reached the frontier
between Abruzzo and Puglia. The other was the sinister, looming bulk of the
Gargano peninsula.
You have to stop over: but where? Do you turn right into the boring
flatlands around Foggia? Or do you clutch the complete works of Mrs
Radcliffe and head for the gothic Gargano: a dead cert for any film-maker
seeking locations for The Mysteries Of Udolpho.
The first time I took the Gargano route proved so memorable that I never
gave it up. Picture a giant, rearing carbuncle half-way down Italy's coast.
Turning off the autostrada, you go up a gentle rural incline for a few miles
before the real roller-coaster starts.
Twisting roads along beetling cliffs; pines yawing and writhing;
unidentified animals baying at a Salvator Rosa moon; and ghost-eyed houses
teetering on impossible slopes. This may be the most spectacular coastline
in all Italy, including its better-known twin, the Amalfi peninsula on the
western shore. I loved it so much on my first visit that I spent three
nights there, seriously disrupting my hotel booking in Calabria.
The order of towns I stayed in on the Gargano was Peschici, Vieste and Monte
Sant' Angelo. The first is a visual knockout. Built as a 10th century
anti-Saracen emplacement, its threadwork of streets and domed houses have
their own semi-Arabic air, as if one has strayed into a transplanted casbah.
Though the coast here is at its wildest, there are good bathing spots, plus
caves and ruined watchtowers.
Peschici is heaven. Vieste, moving south-east, is more humdrum but more
habitable. The land dives to an accommodating flatness and you can sit at
seafront cafes, sipping a Bellini (peach juice with sparkling white wine),
as if you were in normal Italy. Good beaches, too.
Even in Vieste there are a couple of treats. The ferry service to the
Tremiti islands lets you explore these limpid land-dots 40kms off the coast.
The second treat is the wooden trebucca in Vieste itself, which stands on
the edge of the old town. A large contraption of unthinkable antiquity, this
brainstorm of timbers, ropes and pulleys is still used by fisherfolk to
catch mullet. Watch them do it; say a few encouraging words; then buy, cook
and eat the fish.
My last night was spent in Monte Sant' Angelo and here, I am afraid, all
restraint must be thrown to the winds. The coldest night I have ever spent
in Italy was also the most exhilarating. Though it sits atop a mountain, as
its name suggests, MS'A is less spectacular than Peschici but more real.
Where could one eat, please? Oh, in Signora So-and-So's dining room - she
takes in friends and strangers. And there we were after knocking at an
unsigned, unnumbered house and being led through the family sitting-room
(kids watching TV, baby being fed, grandma doing what looked like the
football pools) into the teeny dining-room, where we sat down to sip hot
minestrone and quarter a flavoursome fish, surrounded by the cat, the dog
and the local priest.
And where could one sleep? Oh, in Signora Such-and-Such's place - she puts
up waifs, strays and fugitives. So we froze through a slim-sheeted night in
two beds on a stone-flagged floor with a view through the window of
star-crowded sky and infinite, quilted, velvet-dark valley.
Time moves on and McDonald's may move into Monte Sant' Angelo any time. Give
the town a try before it does. Of archaeological interest are St Michael's
sanctuary, where the saint is said to have made several personal appearances
during the 15th century; and the splendid Norman castle with its views over
the town and valley. It is not floodlit, so take a torch at night.
In the middle of the Gargano peninsula is the vast and intermittently
picturesque foresta Umbra. Go by car. 'Public transport is thin on the
ground,' says one guidebook, putting things gently. But there are hundreds
of roe deer to compensate.
A quick camera-pan round the Gargano may give you a glimpse of other beauty
or interest spots. Pugnochiuso (south of Vieste) has an eye-striking coast
and good bathing plus a couple of the peninsula's rare resort hotels. Vico
Del Gargano (south of Peschici) is a steep, ancient village. Rodi Garganico
(west of Peschici) has fine sandy beaches. And San Giovanni Rotondo and San
Marco in Lamis are two saints' towns further inland that stand sentinel
between the foresta Umbra and the autostrada.
Much of Gargano, it must be said, is ill-equipped for mass visitation, and
some of the cheaper out-of-town hotels are built in the hope-and-prayer
style of much southern Italian development.
But when love is semi-blind even handicaps become part of the beloved's
charm. We have not mentioned the people of the Gargano. These have undergone
even less touristic development than their towns. They still look at you, as
you drive through their streets or along their suicidal coast roads, as if
you are mad. Do not attempt to get out of the car and reassure them.
Think, rather, that they are probably right. A degree of madness is a help
when making that fateful motorway decision to leave dull flatness and head
for these frightening heights. I found that the people, once a natural
rapport develops, are of the best rough-diamond quality. Yes, they will have
you into their homes; yes, you will pay the proper price. But you still feel
part of the family, even of the landscape, as their rooms and hearts and
wines (try the red Castel Del Monte) and earthy cooking secrets open up
before you.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: Developers move in on the Black Pearl - Nigel
Andrews heads for the hills on the Adriatic coast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They call it the Black Pearl of the Mediterranean. The Romans knew it as
Cossyra. To the Phoenicians it was Yrum, the isle of birds. From the highest
point of Pantelleria, Montagna Grande, the continents of Europe and Africa
are visible 100 miles apart. To the north is Sicily; to the south Tunisia.
Though the island belongs to Italy, Arabic names survive in the villages of
Khamma and Bugeber. Bazaars in the main town, also called Pantelleria, sell
African jewellery and clothes richly embroidered with tigers and elephants.
This is not package-tour territory - not yet. Last September the EU gave
Pantelleria a grant: part of an initiative to promote Mediterranean islands
and create employment in tourism and service industries, for mechanisation
is reducing the numbers of traditional jobs on the land.
A quarter of the island's 8,000 population works on wine production. The
famous one is Passito, a dessert wine similar to Sicily's Marsala. Once
picked, the grapes are spread out to sunbathe for three weeks, losing half
their water content (Passito means 'past it'). The result is a sweet
amber-coloured wine of about 16 per cent alcohol; there are also less potent
crisp dry white table wines such as Cossyra.
A second important local industry is growing capperi. Capers form the base
for many sauces. The piquant flavour goes well with swordfish, mussels,
squid and other seafood.
Pantelleria has an area of only 32 square miles. You can sail round it in a
day - the best way to view the rocky coastline, sculpted by erosion in
places into strange shapes. The Punta dell'Arco promontory is nicknamed
dell'elefante because it resembles a huge trunk dipping into the sea. Cacti,
palms and olive trees, figs and prickly pears all flourish in the
sub-tropical climate.
The landscape is dotted with dammusi, dwellings built by the Saracens.
Arched doorways and passages reflect the lack of building timber on the
island, while white-painted cupola roofs serve to collect another rare
commodity, water.
Older than the dammusi are the sesi: remains of neolithic tombs from 5,000
BC built of black cindery rock. The best-preserved examples are at Mursia,
south of Pantelleria town.
The people of Pantelleria, the panteschi, retain their own dialect:
casteddru, for example, in place of the Italian castello. They concede their
capital is not the most beautiful town. Thirty-three days of shelling in the
second world war demolished many buildings, which were replaced with the
unattractive low-rise flats common elsewhere in suburban Italy. Part of the
EU grant is earmarked for improving the town's image and to make safe its
centrepiece, the massive Barbacane castle.
A recently-installed plaque on the castle wall reminds you that, though you
are on a remote island, the politics of Sicily and the mainland are never
far away. It commemorates Paolo Borsellino, the Palermo magistrate who, with
his bodyguards, was assassinated by the Mafia last July.
Crime is almost unknown on Pantelleria. In a small community everyone knows
everyone else, and anyway escape is difficult. There is one little airport
and an overnight ferry to Trapani in Sicily.
The island's remoteness helps make it - for now - an upmarket destination.
Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has a holiday dammuso where he entertains
foreign royalty. Well-off Romans and Milanese come in August, many for the
cure, for the volcano of Montagna Grande still slumbers. In two dozen places
steam wisps out of the rocks; a cave at Sataria is a natural sauna. The only
lake, Specchio di Venere (Venus's mirror), is rich in sulphur and potassium.
Bathing in it - or, better, rubbing your body with lakeside mud - is claimed
to be good for the skin.
Private developers, attracted by the EU's money, are preparing plans for a
spa centre. Rudimentary facilities for scuba diving and wind surfing will be
upgraded. A dozen lidos - there are no beaches on Pantelleria - are planned
round the coast. A yacht marina is scheduled for the main port. Scauri on
the south coast has a small harbour, but the weather frequently makes its
use difficult (as we discovered, needing three attempts to land).
Improved transport is another priority. It is hoped to introduce a hydrofoil
service to Malta, 100 miles east, where the airport is already on the
international map and large enough for charter traffic. For accommodation,
the island's 1,000 beds will be increased by introducing agriturismo in
renovated dammusi. This form of self-catering has been successful in
mainland Italy and is a growth market.
Will all these developments, over the next four or five years, spoil
Pantelleria? Go now, and experience the uncommercialised beauty of the Black
Pearl. It may all be different in a few years.
Avoid August, the Italians' holiday month. January and February are wet and
in late May the sirocco, a hot sticky wind from the Sahara, blows. Sea
temperatures stay relatively high to December. Self-catering villas or
dammusi are available from about Pounds 350 per week, sleeping four. There
are only a few hotels, including The Port (inquiries: via Borgo ltalia,
Pantelleria, TP, Italy, tel: 0923-911257). Half-board is around Pounds 300
per person per week.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Property: Squire Heseltine slated for appeal - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Heseltine, the Trade and Industry Secretary and squire of Thenford,
Northamptonshire, has appealed against the refusal of South Northamptonshire
council to let him thatch Manor Cottage at Thenford with Norfolk reed and
install sealed double-glazing units. The building is listed, and the case
will now go to a Department of the Environment inspector in Bristol.
The council refused because the reed was not the typical thatch of the
region and the windows were not appropriate to an old listed building. It
ruled both elements would change the look of the village as well as the
cottage, and would be a precedent for similar changes elsewhere. The
traditional local product is wispy, long straw.
The cottage has slates which probably replaced the original thatch in the
last century. After the refusal (Weekend FT, March 19/20), Heseltine applied
again to make alterations using slates. The council has allowed that, which
enables Heseltine to start work. But it looks as though he still hankers for
thatch, on his terms.
The appeal will probably take three to four months. That is the fast-track
procedure, when the inspector views the property and both sides make written
submissions, but there is no public inquiry. I shall keep you posted.
If you are selling a farm with cottages, think twice about dividing it into
lots, says Nicholas Leeming of Humberts. Following the last Budget, you
might lose a large part of any gain to the Inland Revenue.
The complication arises from the disparity between what has happened since
March 31 1982 (the base date for long-held capital items for CGT purposes),
to land prices, which have hardly risen, and to the prices of homes, which
have doubled - or more.
If the farm / estate is sold as a whole, the indexed loss on the land (which
probably increases its base value by 80 per cent) can offset the gains on
any cottages, with the result that there is likely to be little or no CGT
liability.
If the holding is divided, each lot is assessed separately, so that CGT on
cottages (one lot) cannot be offset by any indexed loss on the land (another
lot). The Budget allowed indexation only for diminishing or extinguishing a
gain, not for creating a loss.
An amendment modifies this new ruling for 1993 / 94 and 1994 / 95 and allows
Pounds 10,000 of indexable losses for private persons which can be carried
forward from 1993 / 94 to 1994 / 95, or used in 1994 / 95 alone.
Even with this concession, sellers of farms will probably find it
advantageous to sell the property as a whole rather than in lots where the
indexed loss on the land exceeds Pounds 10,000. Buyers should keep in mind
that there is normally a discount for buying the whole.
Two ritzy houses in London are for sale at about Pounds 5m. No 47 Rutland
Gate, SW7 is set at Pounds 4.95m freehold through De Groot Collis (071-235
8090). It is a beautifully restored end-of-terrace house with views north
along the square and, from the upper floors, past the Brompton Oratory to
Battersea power station, Westminster Cathedral and Crystal Palace. I admired
the joinery especially.
No 1 Cumberland Place, NW1, on the east side of Regent's Park, costs Pounds
5.85m for a 72-year lease from the Crown. It is also an end-of-terrace house
but this terrace, designed by John Nash, has only four houses which look
from the outside as if they form one exceptionally grand house. From De
Groot Collis or Lassmans (071-499 3434).

FT  14 MAY 94 / Property: Tax farming - an old crop is revived / Gerald
Cadogan finds that the price of the rich soil of England is rising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Last year was one of the cheeriest for farmers for a long time. They made
profits. How 1994 will be, it is too early to judge as little has happened
down on the farm except lambing. In the short-term, prospects look good. But
it is not clear what the effect will be of the European Union review of its
Common Agricultural Policy in 1996. UK land prices have risen, but, even
though insurance companies and pension funds have been disinvesting for
several years, the market echoes the groan from the residential market:
'There is not enough for sale.'
The turnaround came with Black Monday in September 1992. As the pound fell
against the European Currency Unit, CAP payments to farmers rose by around
20 per cent. Helped by lower interest rates on overdrafts, farming swung
into profit.
The other development was the change in 1992 in inheritance tax. Under
certain circumstances agricultural land qualifies for 100 per cent relief
where before the ceiling was 50 per cent.
These changes govern the market. The green Ecu, which is what CAP support
prices are set in, is worth about 92p. In August 1992, when land prices were
at their lowest, it was 80p and its peak since Britain left the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was 98p. The typical price
for bare land (meaning free of houses, cottages and other buildings) in the
south of England peaked at around Pounds 2,000 an acre in the late 1980s,
fell to Pounds 1,000, and has recovered to around Pounds 1,250 with
considerable variations. (At such a price, a yield of 6-7 per cent is quite
feasible.)
Near Grimsby in Humberside, Walter's recently sold 450 acres in lots, some
for 25 per cent above the guide price of Pounds 1,500. Andrew Macpherson of
Clegg Kennedy Drew reports bare land going for around Pounds 1,600 an acre
in the sale of the Exton Grange estate in Lincolnshire which is currently
being agreed. The land figure is 'at least 20 per cent higher than we would
have achieved 12 months previously'.
Many of the buyers are neighbouring farmers who want to increase their
acreage to take best advantage of the CAP payments. Some, says Rupert
Bradstock, of buying agent Property Vision, are charitable trusts, attracted
by the yield and the security. In effect, they are following the ancient
pattern of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges, who have disinvested far less
than the insurance companies and other financial institutions.
Jim Ward, of Savills Agricultural Research, estimates that those
institutions released about 50,000 acres in 1993 (as in 1992) and that their
holdings have shrunk from a peak of 500,000 acres to about 200,000.
Eagle Star is selling the Dunley estate in north Hampshire between
Winchester and Newbury. The estate is 2,136 acres and includes 1,600 acres
of arable land and a first-class pheasant shoot. The guide price from Strutt
&amp; Parker and Smiths Gore is Pounds 3.5m for the whole. Interest is
'staggering', says James Laing of Strutt &amp; Parker.
Also in Hampshire, Hays Farms (Hursley) is for sale. This subsidiary of Hays
plc has a company tenancy of 5,500 acres and 34 dwellings from property
company St Martin's. Savills must receive tenders by May 31.
Foreign buyers, with the exception of some Danes and Dutch eager to farm in
the UK, look for sporting estates. British buyers now include the rich eager
to take advantage of the new inheritance tax rules. Sell a house in the
English home counties, says Christopher Wilson of buying agent Wilson &amp;
Wilson, and put the proceeds into a farm with vacant possession. Work it for
two years, perhaps by contracting out, and IHT will vanish. His firm and
accountants Grant Thornton have formed a 'City landowners service' to handle
this sort of work.
To qualify for the IHT exemption, you must be using the land to make a
profit. That could include a sporting estate, as long it is not just for the
owner's recreation, says Bradstock. But the value of the house and the value
of the land must balance so that the Revenue will not regard the farming as
just a ploy to escape IHT. Bradstock suggests 500 acres as a minimum. Laing
fears that some owners - or their heirs - may receive a shock when the large
house is refused exemption.
The law's emphasis on proper husbandry mirrors best farming practice. There
is no point going into farming, unless you are committed. It is often
frustrating, which is why farmers are traditionally moaners. And it needs
time and capital. That is why most farmers want to pass the business on to
their children.
A successful recent sale was Jays Farm at Roundhurst, a smallholding of 162
acres near Haslemere in Surrey, which Hamptons Messenger May sold at auction
for Pounds 433,500.
At the beginning of the year Count Christoph Grots and German investors put
together an estate in east Norfolk that had been split more than 100 years
ago. Deciding to buy the 2,090 acre Burnley Hall estate (which includes 580
acres of Grade 1 silt land), they asked Royal Life about adding the adjacent
930 acre (all Grade I silt) Winterton and Somerton estate. The total bill
was nearly Pounds 6m for some of the best land in the country (Grade I Silt
land in Norfolk is about Pounds 2,250 an acre) which also has the first wind
farm in East Anglia. Brown &amp; Co was selling agent for both estates.
An estate in east Norfolk, on the market for the first time since 1640,
(when the Preston family bought it) is Beeston Hall with 570 acres and
pheasant and duck shooting. No footpaths or rights of way cross the estate.
The house is Georgian Gothic. This attractive morsel is priced at Pounds
1.5m from Francis Hornor or Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
In south Humberside, Savills is selling the 1834-acre Worlaby estate, with
its Georgian house and a 16,000-bird poultry unit, for about Pounds 3m. The
sale of Tonge's Farm in Lincolnshire will be a good test of the market,
Robert Hindle of agent Walter's says. It is the first commercial farm for
sale in the area for some time, and has 3.5m tonnes of sand and gravel to
offer as well as the arable land. He has already sent out more than 600 sets
of particulars. The guide price is Pounds 1.29m. Tenders are due on
Thursday.
So farms are coming to market, even if some farmers have decided not to sell
but pass the farm to the children. Strutt &amp; Parker reports instructions on
34 farms across the country totalling almost 20,000 acres, as against 25
farms and 12,000 acres a year ago. Some buyers are happy to purchase farms
with sitting tenants (who are otherwise well placed to buy themselves out).
And with less pressure from the banks to sell land to reduce the overdraft,
those who do sell are in a strong position.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Outdoors: Snow poses a threat - FT Round the World Ski
Expeditio - Arnie Wilson on the hazards of skiing in the Himalayas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Himalayas, potentially the greatest ski area in the world, almost
wrecked our plans to ski every day of 1994.
Since arriving in India, we have been forced to scramble over rocks and
avalanche debris in search of skiable terrain, to follow snowploughs along
roads and ski on snow bridges across streams swollen into torrents by
melting snow.
Merely getting this far was stressful enough: our connecting flight from
Delhi to Bhuntar, in the foothills, was almost four hours late. Then we
discovered that the Rohtang Pass - where we were scheduled to ski - was
hopelessly blocked for the last 25kms after heavy unseasonal snow.
Driving into the mountains, still two hours from any snow, we heard an
ominous bump-bump-bump from a back wheel. A flat tyre at almost 3pm - time
was running out. My companion, Lucy Dicker, and I, both felt a sinking
feeling: after skiing for 124 consecutive days would this be the day we
failed?
At least our driver was carrying a spare, albeit quite bald. For the
remainder of the journey into the Kullu Valley - the Valley of the Gods - he
kept glancing anxiously at the replacement to make sure it was still with
us.
At last we entered Manali - 'the Queen of the Hill Stations' - consisting
almost entirely of hotels, the only function of which is to cater for hordes
of trekkers and tourists: the trekkers to trek, and the tourists, especially
those from the rest of India, to escape from the heat and dust of the big
cities such as Bombay and Madras into the cool mountain air, perhaps to
frolic in the melting patches of snow.
Entire families had rented red wellington boots, fur coats and gloves from
shacks along the route, and sometimes skis and boots as well, to make a turn
or two or simply pose for photographs. Everyone from grandmother down took
delight in simply scrambling up the banks of snow and slithering down again.
But Lucy and I needed something a little more ambitious. We had to take to
the roads.
In spite of many hairpin bends and precipitous drops, Indian drivers treat
the narrow mountain pass to the Rohtang skiing area like a main street in
Delhi, sounding their horns at every opportunity.
Still short of our intended destination, we were forced to stop - we needed
an army permit to travel further. But in the absence of the slightly sullen
Major Randhawa, all we could do was to find the longest section of linked
snow patches, self-consciously snap on our skis, and set off. We managed
just under half a mile - not much, but at least we had skied in India the
day after skiing in France.
High above the army checkpoint, two huge snowploughs were trundling along
the pass towards Rohtang; a third was being repaired by mechanics. For the
next few days we went in search of new terrain, driving as far as we could
behind the snowploughs as they inched towards Rohtang.
In our search we ran the gauntlet of snowslides and rockfalls and in one
particularly hair-rasing section of the route - a series of a dozen
zig-zagging hairpin bends - huge blocks of snow and rock would suddenly
appear.
The skiing was dangerous and inelegant: Lucy dislodged a rock and slithered
10 yards down a gulley before I managed to disentangle her. The rock then
fell on me.
The next day I fell through a snow bridge but my skis stopped me falling
into the stream below. I was struggling to climb back to the road when an
oily hand reached out to haul me over the parapet. It was one of the
snowplough repair men. And on our last day in India, we skied in monsoon
conditions.
In spite of the extraordinary kindness shown by our hosts, who resuscitated
us like ringside assistants between rounds in a boxing match, we shall never
forget the perils of the Rohtang Pass.
After the Valley of the Gods, night skiing in Tokyo's new Ski Dome was going
to be an absolute doddle.
Travel arrangements were made by the Indian Tourist Office in London and
Span Tours 'n' Travel, 36 Janpath, Delhi.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Outdoors: When the French grayling rise - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an out-of-season camping ground two men sat under the roof of a closed
dance floor in a downpour. A table was spread and products of the region
were arrayed; meats, cheeses, wine - le picnic: a big part of the French
fishing experience. In front of us, through dripping walnut trees, sped the
river, a coffee-coloured flood, carrying autumn's first leaves. The Dordogne
river was, as it frequently is, a torrent.
It is a happy moment when the rain stops. Through the lightening cloud came
the glimmering sun. And as the air warmed, they appeared, white, black, and
yellow, from the luxuriantly-vegetated valley, insects for fish to feed on.
In unpropitious conditions we resorted to what the French call 'combing the
water', and the English 'fishing down the pool'.
The usual French method on the Dordogne is to spot rising fish and then cast
to them. Our intended quarry was the grayling, a little-understood member of
the trout/salmon family, which has a high and colourful dorsal fin. A
grayling must rise a few times in the same place to interest Beber, my
fishing guide. He is a Deep Nature man.
From the larvae on the bottom of the stones he can tell the health of the
water. The shadows falling through the trees give him pleasure. The strange
strands of white mist carrying cool air down the opposite bank stir echoes
of his childhood, spent on this self-same river. Fishing for him is not an
extraction process: it is a rustic ritual in which the emotions must be
thrilled to the right pitch if the catch is to be pleasurable.
The grayling feeds actively in spring when fly-life emerges, and again in
September, October and November to replenish the reserves for winter. Its
season coincides with the times on the Dordogne when fishing is possible
because the canoeists have gone home - and most attractive, because the
vacated landscape is itself again. As trout fishing ends, grayling begins.
Grayling country is appealing. The Dordogne near Argentat runs through
oak-wood valleys. In Britain we fight to conserve our few surviving native
woodlands: in France there are hills of uninterrupted natural woodland.
In the valley-bottom, walnut orchards line the bank, mixed with small fields
of maize, and sunflowers. Velvety-brown Limousin cattle crop rich grass.
Tight building control has kept intact a homogenous native architecture that
is centuries old. Stone-slab roofs with steep pitches crown fairy-tale
houses with peep-hole windows. Big buildings never look big, their grey
towers and high walls protruding like outcrops of rock.
The rivers carry gudgeon, pike, perch and rudd. Eels and crayfish are
present too.
This great biomass of fish in the greenish-black river is vigorously
depleted by many comers. A French fishing licence entitles you to an
immeasurable mileage of fishing water for a pittance. In the Correze alone
there is 5,000km of public angling water.
Poaching practices are almost as numerous and complex as the regulations
specifying methods and keep-sizes for different species in different
regions. They include the deployment of poisonous washing-up liquid (bottles
of it litter the bushes) used to kill little fish in the feeder-streams.
Even the fish-filled field-drains are attacked after rain. As fast as these
practitioners remove the fish, farmed replacements are tipped in. In the
Correze alone 10 tonnes of large trout are introduced each year, and 600,000
small pike. Grayling are still mostly wild.
To purists like Beber it is all haywire. Money spent breeding fish for
anglers could be saved if the Dordogne's multifarious fishery was properly
controlled. For example, if grayling were protected during their breeding
season. But French fisheries are left to run themselves: the departments
(regions) in central France maintain a force of only around seven fishery
inspectors each. This under-muscled team spends much of its time as far from
river-banks as possible, for example in the safety of the hatchery.
The Correze is glorious country, from the plateau of which a huge landscape
unfolds. The castles and changeless scenery give it a strangely medieval
feeling. As I freed a golden dace twiddling on my line, an osprey flapped in
fixed position over the water up-river and a kingfisher darted along under
the opposite bank.
In rural France, tolling church bells emphasise the quietness of the land.
Under the trees across the way a very old man was slowly assembling his
tackle. I felt part of deeply-ingrained customs on time-worn soil.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Gardening: Where Rockefeller found culture - Paula Deitz
visits a garden where new American money met, andfell for, old European
traditions of landscaping and architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULA DEITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, as the New York Waterway ferry boat eased away from the Manhattan
dock into the Hudson River, the captain called out that there was a fair
wind and slack water. This meant a smooth cruise up the river between tides
to Tarrytown, New York, an auspicious beginning to an important house and
garden event: Kykuit, the country villa that was home to three generations
of the Rockefeller family was welcoming visitors for the first time. Perhaps
not since Mount Vernon, George Washington's mansion in Virginia, was opened
to the public has there been such a stir and excitement among those
interested in historic houses and gardens.
Far from being the ostentatious display of a style called 'robber baron
architecture', Kykuit (the Dutch for 'lookout') was essentially a home for a
family that remained as modest as it was wealthy.
The house sits 500ft above the Hudson at the highest point in Westchester
County. It is 30 miles north of Manhattan in the middle of the Rockefeller
estate at Pocantico Hills. The house and gardens were constructed between
1906 and 1913 to take advantage of the spectacular and uninterrupted views
of the Hudson Valley and the river that runs through it.
Although John D Rockefeller bought the land and contracted to build the
house, it was the constant advice of his son, Junior, that turned the
project from a simple country cottage into the important residence Junior
believed his father deserved.
The Rockefeller name is associated with good architecture and conservation
causes that have resulted in saving land both in the US, particularly the
cliffs along the Hudson, and in the Caribbean. The family has preserved the
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden in Maine, designed for Junior's wife in the
1920s by Edith Wharton's niece, Beatrix Jones Farrand, the garden designer.
Kykuit is interesting as a study of how Rockefeller father and son, two men
accustomed to the simple life of the mid-west, began to develop an interest
in the cultivated European tradition that links the house with its special
landscape.
The architect is recorded as Delano &amp; Aldrich, but the vision behind the
Palladian design of the house and the terraced gardens was provided by
William Welles Bosworth, an architect who excelled in the beaux arts style
that combined Italian, French and English traditions.
Bosworth began his professional life in the office of park designer
Frederick Law Olmsted and continued his studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts
in Paris before beginning work at Kykuit where he laid out the gardens. The
villa appears to have been modelled to conform with his garden design rather
than the other way around.
Wharton's book, Italian Villas and Their Gardens, with romantic
illustrations by Maxfield Parrish, was published in 1904. For the next few
years their ideas were in the air. The figure surmounting the largest
fountain in Kykuit's forecourt is of the god Oceanus, after the one by
Giambologna in the Boboli gardens in Florence. This fountain is the source
for the water features throughout the garden, all of which are in perfect
working condition.
As a compendium of garden design history nothing has been left out. There is
a grotto in the style of Hubert Robert's at Versailles. The landscape is in
the tradition of William Kent. Olana, the home which painter Frederic Church
built further up the Hudson to offer the best river view, is also an
inspiration.
Where the garden is formal, as in the walk of clipped limes leading to a
Temple of Venus, it has all the crispness of the best ordered green garden.
This allee forms one side of an enclosed garden. At a right angle is a
Moorish that terminates at the Tea House, a small pavilion of rusticated
stone decorated in an ancient Roman style. Bordering the rill on either side
are rows of topiary cones inspired by those in the park at Sceaux.
Below this terrace on one side is the brook garden through which flows a
serpentine stream with columbine, iris and pansies along the rocky banks.
On the river side, the series of levels begins with an orange tree terrace
with an ironwork balustrade of grapevines. This was crafted by Tiffany to
Bosworth's designs, as were the lanterns and other decorative metalwork in
the gardens.
The swimming pool terrace below is one large oval pool with a pebble floor
and spillways on either side spanned by stone bridges covered with clematis
vines. North of the house is a wisteria pergola and a semi-circular rose
garden punctuated by columnar junipers.
Where the terraces end the rolling countryside begins. Each generation of
Rockefellers left its mark. The most recent addition to the gardens is the
collection of modern sculptures placed within the outdoor rooms by Nelson
Rockefeller, the former vice president of the US.
Because many of these works are from the 1950s, this collection already has
a period look, but few sights are more arresting than Aristide Maillol's
crouching sculpture 'Night' by the hedge that divides the garden from the
long expanses of green.
On Nelson Rockefeller's death in 1979, the house and garden were left to the
National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund
maintains Kykuit, which has also become a conference centre, thanks to a
splendid renovation of its Coach Barn by the architect Herbert S. Newman.
Public visits to Kykuit are being managed by Historic Hudson Valley. For
reservations and advice on how to travel to Kykuit call 914-631 9491.
Admission: Dollars 18 (Pounds 12.30); children and old people Dollars 16; by
boat, Dollars 50. Closed Tuesdays.
In her article on magnolias in the Weekend FT of April 23, Patricia Morison
referred to Packard's Smetterling. The correct name of the variety is
Picard's Schmetterling.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Gardening: Doctor, about my eritrichium . . . - Robin Lane
Fox seeks advice on plants from Jack Elliott, one of Britain's most revered
gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the spring winds were still cold, I stood in the gardens of Dr Jack
Elliott, one of our greatest plantsmen, and asked him how a keen gardener
could become a better gardener.
Elliott ought to know. For years, he tended one of the best collections of
rare bulbs in Britain. He has grown more rare alpines beautifully than you
or I have killed in the past 10 years. He has a sky-blue Tropaeolum azureum
in flower in his cold greenhouse and a Magnolia proctoriana in the main
garden. He has judged the finer points of hardy plants in national shows and
presided over their great societies.
If I was an eritrichium, I would grow for him - and not just because most of
his professional career was spent as a GP, most recently in Ashford, Kent.
The Elliott view is many sided but the main advice for self-improvement is
clear: join a specialist national society and buy a load of grit. In pots
topped with grit, you can then grow the rarities which the societies send
you from their seed lists.
His advice is my advice, except that he has been better at living up to it.
On two Sundays in the year, he opens the gardens at Coldham, Little Chart,
near Ashford, and each time those in the know descend on his plant stall and
clear the better things out soon after opening time at 2pm.
Everything is grown in a proper garden compost: the M20 may be a long road
but where else do you go to buy the latest hardy Diascias, properly-rooted
Haberleas, the new blue veronica from the Caucasus, and things such as
Verbascum creticum, which ought to be yellow-flowered but which I have never
even seen?
The next Sunday opening is July 3 and word is getting around: Coldham is
within striking distance of the Channel ports and within the fall-out zone
of the new Channel rail link. Since mid-April, coach-loads of French
visitors have been tripping across to nearby Sissinghurst, pre-booked and
undaunted, therefore, by the changeable weather. There have even been one or
two French at Coldham, including a visitor keen enough to ask for the blue
Tropaeolum.
As a past president, Elliott recommends membership of the Hardy Plant
Society at Little Orchard, Great Comberton, Pershore, Worcestershire. Like
the Alpine Garden Society, it issues superb plant lists and helps to raise
your ideas of the possible. In my own garden, I realise how I owe to these
societies my particular plants of the month, the cream-yellow broom Cytisus
kewensis and the curious yellow and black-flowered Prophet Flower, or
Arnebia.
Easy plants of this type come to your notice through other experts' writings
but will seldom turn up in the local garden centre. The tactic of society
membership and seed-raising is particularly well suited to small gardens
where the baseline can be made up of specially-chosen small hardy plants and
then given height with an upper layer of tall shrubs, small shrubs and
climbers on both.
It is far easier to design an original and lasting garden by this route of
self-improvement rather than by following a colour-chart of a book and its
advice on siting a barbecue and planting the spreading green Prunus Otto
Luykens.
How do you raise new seeds when you are sent them? You sow them in a light
mixture of peat, perlite and sharp grit: you surface them with about  1/2 in
of grit and when you transplant them, you move them into a more solid
compost with yet more grit. Like most experts of his generation, Elliott
remains a convinced gritter, ordering finely-crushed grit from a builders'
merchant and then surfacing each pot of seedlings and each of his raised
beds.
I failed his test for experts, of course. Coldham's gardens have odd forms
of almost anything between the tennis court and the pleasing design of
occasional beds. Near the house, the climate is vastly kinder than mine and
I excuse myself from joining the long list of know-alls who have failed to
diagnose a rather spiky shrub with dark leaves as a Pittosporum anomalum.
But I did notice tips which we can hunt up in our books: the pale yellow
Anemone seemanii, which is 3in high but nonetheless lights up an entire
flower bed with its flowers, or the use of white perennial Cardamines
against shaded walls where we might think of nothing but Hellebores. They
are easy and handsomely leaved and are a treat for spring.
What is life like, I wondered, if you are slave to thousands of pots,
custodian of a unique yellow paeony and a grower of rarities such as Parrya
or pink double Anemonella?
You need the neat temperament and the patience, both of which I have noticed
in gardening doctors or dentists, perhaps because they have to be methodical
and meticulous. It also helps to have a friendly climate, a deep soil and an
expert neighbour.
Elliott, now in his 60s, remarks on his debt to the great plant collector,
Paul Furze, who lived nearby and brought him seed from bulbs found on his
many expeditions to Turkey and the Middle East.
Eventually, disease attacked even the doctor's fritillaries: 'Botrytis hit
the frits,' as he puts it. He then concentrated on his other strong suit,
alpines and small hardy plants.
Sometimes, I think my garden looks like a mortuary, at other times a
hospital, not just because the beds are filled with vegetables. Perhaps if I
was a real doctor, too, they would look like an exemplary waiting-room in
which everything looked pleased and healthy and growing up in gratitude.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Motoring: Car for a soft day - Stuart Marshall tests the
Saab 900 convertible in the Irish rain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irishman and I looked out at the Atlantic rollers breaking on a rocky
beach. 'Sure, 'tis a nice soft day,' he said. I knew what he meant. It was
fine rain, but it would have soaked through a shirt and sweater in about two
minutes. Yet, the wipers of the Saab 900 convertible on slow setting easily
kept the screen clear.
Many might have thought that Ireland, where all those soggy Atlantic fronts
first hit land, was an odd place to hold the international press launch of a
convertible. I would not disagree. But there was method in the sensible
Swedes' apparent madness.
The 900 convertible is not one of those fair-weather soft-tops. The hood is
thick and triple-layered, with a proper glass back window incorporating
defroster elements. And all you have to do to turn a virtual saloon into a
completely open car is release two clips and press a button. Then, with a
whirring of electric motors, the hood folds behind the back seats and
disappears under a hard panel, flush with the body top.
Lowering it takes about 25 seconds. Irish weather being what it is, I was
relieved to discover it went up again just as quickly. The 900 convertible
really is a car to use confidently when the forecast is bright periods and
frequent showers, heavy at times.
There is a choice of three multi-valve engines: a 150 horsepower, 2.3-litre;
185hp, two-litre turbo; and 170hp, 2.5-litre V6. Five-speed manual
transmission is standard. A four-speed automatic is a Pounds 995 optional
extra on the 2.3i and 2.5 V6, but not the 2.0-litre turbo.
Compared with the three-door 900 hard-top coupe, of which more in a moment,
the convertible has slightly softer suspension. The ride was excellent on
the nearest thing to a motorway you can find in south-west Ireland. But on
the rough switchbacks that pass for country roads, it was not difficult to
make the V6 automatic's front suspension touch the bump stops.
To be fair, I was driving it much harder than a typical owner would and the
manual gearbox 2.3i and two-litre turbo - lighter at the front end than the
two-pedal V6 - were less inclined to use up their suspension travel.
Saab has gone to great lengths to make the convertible body as rigid as
possible; it is 70 per cent stiffer in torsion than the previous one, itself
a standard-setter for freedom from shake.
It would be too much to expect the 900 convertible to be as rock-solid as a
900 hard-top coupe, but it was only when driving on the roughest stretches
that I felt a suspicion of sideways movement through the steering column.
(As a passenger, it was not noticeable.)
At moderate speeds, there is little noise or wind buffeting with the hood
down and side windows up - not much more when all four side windows are
retracted by the single touch of a button. Full-sized people can sit
comfortably in the rear seats and the boot is of practical size, with an
opening like a cat flap in the back seat allowing skis to be carried.
Seats are leather-trimmed. The driver's air bag is standard and the front
passenger's an optional extra, although both have belts that pre-tension on
impact. The front screen pillars - stout enough to support the car's weight
 -inevitably are a bit awkward to see round. And, like those of all
soft-tops, the 900's hood does create a small blind spot in the rear
quarter.
Unquestionably, the most joyous one to drive is the two-litre turbo. Saab
says it is good for 143mph (230kph). Much more importantly, it is by far the
quickest from 40-60mph in fourth gear and 50-75mph (80-120kph) in fifth.
Safe, rapid pick-up, not tyre-smoking standing starts, is what matters in
the real world although, for the record, the turbo's 0-60mph (0-96kph) time
is an impressive eight seconds. At fairly low revolutions, the turbo
produced enough torque (pulling power at a given engine speed) to amble
gently through villages in fourth or fifth gears. Given its head on the open
road, the twin balance shafts kept the engine as smooth as a six at high
revolutions.
The 2.5 V6's performance is quite close to the turbo's, while that of the
less powerful 2.3i is more than adequate for most 900 convertible buyers.
The firmer suspension of the coupe might have made for a joggly ride on
Ireland's crumbling byways but, on the smooth roads of Italy, the hard-top
was a delight. 'You will,' said Saab's veteran rally ace, Erik Carlsson, as
I set off that morning, 'find our new 900 coupe is a real Saab.'
Prices will be Pounds 23,995 for the 2.3i, Pounds 27,895 (2.5 V6) and Pounds
27,995 (two-litre turbo) when they reach British showrooms next month.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Sport: Battered survivors limp into last leg - Sailing /
Keith Wheatley previews the Whitbread's last dash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the Whitbread race poised for the final dash east across the Atlantic
from Fort Lauderdale to Southampton, one wonders if it will be a Kiwi
double.
New Zealand Endeavour has an 18 hour 21 minutes lead in the maxi class; and
Yamaha, skippered by Auckland yachtsman Ross Field, is 10 hrs 26 mins ahead
of her closest W60 rival, Intrum Justitia. Grant Dalton, in charge aboard
NZE, is also close to his personal goal of being the fastest boat around the
world overall.
Dalton has always maintained that he built a maxi-ketch simply because
research said it would go round the 32,000-mile course up to four days
faster than the smaller, lighter W60 class opposition. That prediction has
proved over-optimistic since, with 85 per cent of the race gone, Endeavour
is only 11 hours ahead of Yamaha. However, mid-summer weather in the north
Atlantic is generally light and this should favour the maxi class with their
huge sail areas.
Yamaha's fifth leg victory was as unexpected as it was welcome to the crew.
They had consistently been second or third into every port and were
thoroughly sick of the bridesmaid role. Ross Field punched the air with
delight as he crossed the line. He attributed Yamaha's win to reading the
weather correctly, good tactics and excellent crew work.
Field gave the specific credit for getting the weather right to
meteorologist Nik White, who joined the boat in Auckland. 'Nik has limited
sailing experience, worked for the New Zealand met office for two or three
years, is highly qualified and we don't let him up on deck,' said Field. 'He
tells us what he thinks is going to happen and we position the boat
accordingly.'
White may have set a Whitbread trend. Dennis Conner announced this week that
he was cancelling plans to sail on the last leg with Winston and sending
weather expert Bill Biewenga in his place. Biewenga, a veteran of three
previous Whitbreads, has often worked as a consultant for single-handed
racers, giving them optimum weather routes by radio from a land base.
Field's elation was short-lived as the Florida stopover was consumed by
allegations that Yamaha had broken rules relating to outside assistance
during leg one. The claims were made by deposed women's crew skipper Nance
Frank as part of her US litigation against race officials and yacht owners.
In essence, Frank claimed that her navigator, Adrienne Cahalan, (Field's
fiancee) had been in fax contact with Yamaha swapping weather information
from different parts of the course. This would be a clear breach of standard
yacht racing rules if proved. Field, a former undercover detective with the
New Zealand police force, obeyed orders when his own lawyers told him to
'take the Fifth' and say nothing.
The international jury for the race took refuge in procedure when it
declined to open a hearing because no current competitor had lodged a
protest. This was in spite of claims by race director, Ian Bailey-Willmot,
that he had evidence to authenticate Frank's allegations. So Field and his
crew were excused a trial, but left with allegations hanging heavy in the
air. Field declared himself 'very bitter' about the outcome.
Also shaking his head over cruel fate was Tokio skipper Chris Dickson. They
arrived in Fort Lauderdale eight days after Yamaha, the last boat in the
14-yacht fleet. Tokio lost her mast, and with it the chances of winning the
race she had dominated, five days into the leg.
'The boat came very upright. I heard a lot of feet running around on deck
and someone said 'Oh No. The mast has gone.' It was snapped at the bottom
spreader. There were broken bits everywhere,' said Dickson on reaching
Florida. 'I have never experienced anything like it, we felt numb, really
numb. It crossed our minds to pull out of the race when the chance of
winning evaporated. But after a while the crew, to a man, decided that we
would finish the job.'
The man with the biggest hurdle to face is probably British sailor Lawrie
Smith, skippering Intrum Justitia. They had been lying second to Tokio, had
virtually discounted a challenge from Yamaha, and now find themselves having
to fight to get back in the race.
'It's terrible. You feel it's all going against you,' said Smith over the
misfortune that had his boat parked in the Doldrums while Yamaha disappeared
over the horizon.
'However, luck tends to even itself out. We hope there will be a lot of
breeze in the next leg, we always do well in that.'
New Zealand's domination of the Whitbread has obviously led Wales to think
that there may be an X-factor in the race favouring small proud nations used
to handling sheep. The first entry for the 1997 / 8 race has just been
announced in Cardiff. Welsh Dragon will be skippered by the Anglesey-born
international helmsman Edward Warden-Owen and is backed by the Cardiff Bay
Development Agency.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Sport: Can the FA Cup deliver quality? - Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Football Association succeeds in buying Wembley Stadium, it could
make the crumbling monument more attractive to football fans by improving
the quality of entertainment provided by its own FA Cup. Over the last two
seasons both semi-finals as well as the final have been played at Wembley -
but the only people who can have enjoyed the experience are Arsenal fans and
accountants.
Wembley is the only English football stadium that can seat more than 50,000,
albeit in extreme discomfort. It is the only ground where so many people -
335,000 - could have been bored witless by the nine hours of dreary FA Cup
fare that stretched from the start of the Arsenal v Tottenham semi-final
last year through to the dying minutes of extra time between Oldham and
Manchester United last month.
The Manchester roar that greeted Mark Hughes' late equaliser against Oldham
provided a reminder of the wonderful atmosphere Wembley can generate.
The omens are good for today's FA Cup final. The sun will shine. The perfect
pitch will glow a beautiful green. The stands will be decked in royal blue
and rich red. United, cocks of the north, will carry the aura of deserved
champions. Glenn Hoddle, manager of Chelsea, the plucky southern underdogs,
may even offer us a precious glimpse of his graceful talents. On the other
hand the spectacle may be undermined, yet again, by the weaknesses of the
two teams: United's are in their heads, Chelsea's in their feet.
United, an almost-great team, are also a team of many paradoxes. Chelsea,
being a much more limited side, offer just one: the contradiction between
the style of Hoddle the player, and of Hoddle the manager.
In the league this season, United did not show the weakness under pressure
that destroyed them two years ago. When Blackburn closed in, United raised
their game. Paul Ince plucked draws from defeats with late equalisers
against West Ham and, crucially, against Blackburn.
United showed the same resilience against lowly Oldham last month. But
before that, they had been outplayed for an hour and three-quarters.
United have been below their best in other big cup matches: they lost the
Coca Cola cup final 3-1 at Wembley to Aston Villa; they threw away a
three-goal lead against Galatasaray in the European Cup and, saving their
worst performance of the season for their most important match, were gutless
and witless in the away leg.
This is the second United paradox. This afternoon's team stands on the verge
of greatness and on the verge of break-up. The regular first team contains
seven non-English players. They cannot all play in European Cup games. So
manager Alex Ferguson must contemplate changes.
One player at risk is Mark Hughes, an old favourite but thirtysomething and
a Welshman. He may find himself displaced by an English goal scorer because
United's tally of 80 Premier League goals represents a poor return for the
pace, imagination and variety of its attacking play.
Over the last two seasons, Ferguson has been prepared to loosen his control
over the team and pick more unpredictable attacking players. The tough,
diligent Brian McClair has been replaced by the rough but delicate Eric
Cantona; Andrei Kanchelskis and Ryan Giggs - out and out wingers - play
every week, replacing safer options such as Mike Phelan, Mal Donaghy,
Clayton Blackmore even Lee Sharpe.
Giggs still has games where his brain seems to be in neutral; and Cantona,
who seems to be sent off every time United play in black, is wanted for
questioning by the FA. But United have survived his suspensions because of
Ferguson's careful and costly policy of stockpiling reserve players, many of
them hardly needed because the team escaped serious injuries this season.
Chelsea have not been so lucky: striker Mark Stein only returned last week,
but scored twice; and Hoddle has been nursing injuries all season. He will
probably only pick himself as substitute.
The difference between the style of Hoddle the player and Hoddle the manager
causes much confusion: Hoddle the player was elegant and imaginative - his
team, for the most part, is neither.
There is a misconception in British football that toughness means running
around kicking people. For that reason Hoddle, an inept tackler, was accused
of a lack of toughness. Yet every time he played, Hoddle knew the 'tough'
men would kick him - but he still played his way: holding the ball in
midfield, creating a little time and a little space until the right pass was
available. That required real toughness.
Hoddle's team reflects the tough and practical side of his nature. He has
made the most of his resources, and his team is hard-working and
well-drilled. Its greatest strength is in defence. Hoddle has bought Gavin
Peacock and Mark Stein - a panic buy but the right panic buy. But he has
also sold skilful players. He received a good price for the ageing Andy
Townsend, but parted with two younger talents: Graham Stuart to Everton and
Ian Pearce for a knock-down Pounds 300,000 to Blackburn.
Both had a reputation for unpredictability. Perhaps Hoddle did not feel
Chelsea could afford that yet. He will be happy today if his team repeats
the pattern of this season' two league games against United: brave,
resourceful defence, a goal from Peacock and a 1-0 win.
If Wembley is treated to a repeat of the first of those two league games,
when United played with verve and flair, and Chelsea defended with passion,
it will be a great afternoon. If the two teams reproduce their second
meeting, when sullen United were stifled comfortably by Chelsea's defensive
approach, the fans will have time to reflect on how hard and cramped
Wembley's seating is.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Sport: Manifesto for a sporting right-hander - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major's lament that 'summers will never be the same', after the death
late last November of cricket's great commentator, Brian Johnston, has
quickly passed into popular sporting language.
A book about Johnston has been produced, with that title and last weekend,
BBC television broadcast a programme in tribute to Johnston, with that name.
One of the programme's speakers was Major and it was striking how much
better he is at talking about cricket than talking about politics.
But why separate the two? There is a hit-and-miss tradition in England of
using cricket as an aid to public affairs and preaching. The prime minister
knew enough of it to present President Bush with a cricket bat on an
official visit to the US, admiring as he did so America's victory over
England in the only cricket match the two countries have played, in the
1850s. Missionary diplomacy at its best, with England humble throughout.
As far as I know, history does not record the president's reaction to the
bat. Given the prime minister's love of cricket, perhaps history would have
a happier future to record for him if he would let his favourite game
decorate his political life once in a while, perhaps as an agent of
eloquence.
It does not seem possible, alas, to keep politics out of cricket. The
d'Oliveira affair is one among many examples of that. But might not cricket
be allowed to cheer up politics a bit?
Every time English politics goes into a grim patch, I remember C Northcote
Parkinson's comment in his famous 'Law of Delay' on cricket as a model for
democracy. I can see that it might have less appeal for a government in
power. 'Most would agree that Parliament must continue to exist. While it
does so, the two parties must play a game modelled, apparently, on that of
cricket: a game in which no innings can be prolonged for ever.'
Some politicians have a good go at it, though. Stanley Baldwin, renowned for
his 'safety first' politics, sometimes used clever tactics in playing safe.
He was fond of cricket and when A P F Chapman led England to victory over
Australia in the winter of 1928/29, Baldwin sent him a telegram designed to
keep both countries in good humour. Chapman kept it all his life.
'Hearty congratulations on victory after a most gallant fight of which both
sides may feel proud.' A good bit of medium pace politeness on a sensitive
Commonwealth wicket.
By the time that was sent, no one publicly attributed to cricket the
grandiose serenity attributed to it a generation earlier. Bishop Welldon,
for instance, once Bishop of Calcutta, was a man devoted to travel who had
accompanied the 1903/04 English Test team to Australia, on the Orontes. When
he returned, he wrote a 'breezy and genial introduction' to P Warner's book
How We Recovered The Ashes, and used it to sing the praises of international
cricket matches.
'They tend as well to excite and promote a kindly feeling between the
nations that take part in them. They have brought Englishmen to Australia
and Australians to England. They associated them as members of the same
great national family.'
Inspiring himself as he wrote, the bishop ended up declaring that the reason
Australia and New Zealand had supported the mother country in her recent war
with South Africa was 'the fostering of mutual respect through international
athletic competitions at home and in the colonies.'
Bishop Welldon was one of a number of sporting idealists who saw cricket as
a tool of imperial peace-making in the early years of the century.
The 1932/33 Bodyline tour had an opposite effect, with diplomatic relations
between England and Australia in danger of being severed and Downing Street
calling special meetings to try and cope with the furore arising from
Douglas Jardine's 'leg theory' bowling tactics in Australia.
Jardine remained silent until the weight of pressure and the outspoken
reporting of the tour prompted him to speak, back in England in February
1933, praising his men and quoting Kipling.
His men stood by him. Bodyline was a cricket issue which only attracted
pronouncements by public figures attempting to keep the peace. It was the
sort of cricket issue that the government was glad to leave behind, although
England had won the series.
Not long ago the Pakistani government and, to a lesser extent, the English
government were faced with a cricketer who mixed cricket and politics in a
way few have done. His country's government denounced him in high style and
his country's cricketers were glad that when events reached a peak, he was
past his best with the bat and they had no reason to speak.
Aftab Gul was a student leader in the frenzied years of the late 1960s. He
played cricket for Lahore University, where he was a law student. When
England toured Pakistan in 1968/69, Aftab was selected for the Lahore Test
because, it was said, students threatened to disrupt the match unless he
played.
His scores of 12 and 29 did not do much to glorify the cause of student
reform, there were some 'minor riots and skirmishes' and the Tour was a
troubled one.
Aftab was a talented, but erratic, opener and in three years played in six
Tests. His politics led him to a spell abroad and when Pakistan's government
claimed to have found ground-to-air missiles in his garage, it refused to
re-admit him.
He applied for political asylum in Britain. It was not granted and, quite
rightly, cricket was not mentioned as his government vehemently deplored his
politics.
Clearly the tone to adopt when bringing cricket into politics is a peaceful
one. Public speaking with little touches of cricket is a rare and neglected
art, to be carefully used. I think Bishop Welldon tended to excess. But then
Archbishop Temple tended to the philistine with his sole remark about
cricket: 'I have always looked on cricket as organised loafing.'
It is probably time for a senior politician, rather than a churchman, to
take his chance and talk cricket. As Johnston used to say, with a twinkle in
his eye, to anyone who was nervous, 'Go on. It's always worth a go. You
never know what might happen.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Lunch with the FT: Young master of moviedom - Michael
Thompson-Noel talks to Tim Bevan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last night, the hit film Four Weddings and a Funeral opened in London,
having gushed big revenues at the US box-office. At face value, Four
Weddings is a quintessentially English film, which is why it is being touted
as the most successful such product since A Fish Called Wanda.
Four Weddings was shot in London just over a year ago. Its male lead is the
stiff-upper-lipped English heart-throb actor Hugh Grant - already a lust
object in Japan and the US. It cost Dollars 5m, some of which came from the
British television company, Channel 4. Four Weddings' production company,
Working Title, is London-based. And its executive producer, Tim Bevan, 36,
could pass as James Bond.
Yet spend two hours in Bevan's company and you realise that the phrase
'British film industry' is passe, despite pleas for subsidies for British
film-makers. What London has become is the main branch office of the
English-language movie business. This is not to belittle it but precisely
the opposite, especially for a producer of Bevan's status.
I met him at Alastair Little's restaurant in Soho, London, which is
informal, minimalist and excitingly expensive. Bevan asked for a goat's
cheese salad, grilled sole, mineral water, a glass of dry white wine and a
double espresso. Very Hollywood Hills, which is not surprising: he spends
half his time there. He has given up cigarettes, but was pleased to see my
Marlboro. 'Please go ahead,' he said. 'I am the world's most dedicated
passive smoker.'
He is tall, athletic-looking, fresh-faced and frank: a skilled charmer but
capable, no doubt, of considerable toughness. His first film, 10 years ago,
was My Beautiful Laundrette.
He told me that Four Weddings and a Funeral looked like grossing Dollars
40m-Dollars 50m world-wide, which is starting to sound like an
under-statement.
'Would that make it your biggest?'
Bevan choked on his fish.
'Yes, the biggest by a long way. Laundrette, for example, which cost Dollars
1m, didn't do great money though it made a few careers. Four Weddings, in
contrast, is going to spew money. It has had a fairly charmed run. Nothing
major went wrong during its shooting, and it opened in the US with a huge
push: brilliant reviews, very strong marketing, and then word-of-mouth.'
'If it's such an English film, why open it in America?'
'Oh - all quite deliberate. We platformed it. British film audiences are
susceptible to movies that have succeeded in the US. It went to No 1 in
America with no drop-off after six weeks, and also to No 1 in France.'
Bevan's partner at Working Title is Eric Fellner, an equally well-regarded
young producer, whose first film - a hit - was Sid and Nancy. One of them is
usually in London, the other in Los Angeles, where they have a house in the
Hollywood Hills. Both are married to actresses, Bevan to Joely Richardson,
Fellner to Gaby Delall.
They divide projects between them. Their lifestyles have been portrayed as
'flash cars, power wives, hot tubs and Sunday night red-eyes to LA, the Big
Apple and back', and their ambition as the making of stylish, commercial
films aimed at maturing yuppie audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.
They have the track records to succeed. And they certainly have the backing.
Working Title is now a fully-owned subsidiary of PolyGram, of the
Netherlands, a big-time entertainment company with plenty of ambition.
Bevan says that he chanced into film-making. Otherwise he might have been a
journalist. 'Originally, as an independent film-maker, Working Title lived
hand-to-mouth. But Eric and I certainly learned how to produce movies. We
have had our fair share of dogs, but also of bad films that made money as
well as good films that did well. Yet to do what you want to do as a
producer you need a great deal of money behind you.
'Prior to PolyGram, I spent 99 per cent of my time trying to raise finance.
The beauty of PolyGram is that I now have a great deal of time to spend on
making films.
'Movies are a bit like the aerospace business, fully international but also
a cottage industry. The village where the movies' cottage industry is based
is Los Angeles, so even if we shot all our films in Britain we'd still need
to have an office in LA. That is where the money, the distribution muscle
and the talent is - writers, actors, agents - even for quite small TV
productions. Even to hire British talent, you have to go through Hollywood.
Movies are talent-driven.'
At present, Working Title has five projects in advanced development -
serious talking, final budgets - plus one being shot, about the Black
Panther movement, and about 20, says Bevan, in preliminary development -
money being spent, a writer at work.
'How about film violence?' I asked. 'What do you think of the British
government's recent move to tighten the censorship of screen violence and to
crack down on retailers who peddle violent videos to under-age children?'
He swirled his coffee.
'In parts,' said the producer, 'My Beautiful Laundrette, which was not cut
10 years ago, was extremely violent. There was one shot, I remember, where a
man's head was smashed through a car windscreen. Very violent. If I were
making Laundrette today, they'd probably want me to cut bits out. Would I
fight for every frame of that film? You're damn right I would, though I am
against gratuitous violence. That is not something that interests me.
Film-making is about truth and the honesty of the characters.'
'All right,' I countered. 'Let's be specific. Let's take torture. Suppose a
script calls for a character to be strapped to a chair and for another
character to take a cigarette lighter to his ear, or even to his eye, right
there on screen. Why should that be necessary? Are there any circumstances
under which a producer could possibly justify such material?'
Bevan scrunched up his eyes. 'I hate to say this,' he said, 'but I think
almost certainly that the answer is Yes.'
The British end of the English-language movie business is in up-beat mode.
'Here is an example,' said Bevan. 'There are five young British actors at
present - Liam Neeson, Daniel Day-Lewis, Hugh Grant, Ralph Fiennes and Gary
Oldman - who are all under 42 and so talented that you can open a picture
with any one of them. That is extremely rare.'
I said: 'How about London film critics? Aren't they the lamest dogs?'
Bevan's face cracked with laughter. Again he swirled his coffee. 'They have
often had a go at me,' he said. 'They've been there far too long. Always the
same old faces.'
At 3pm precisely, without indicating that he was remotely in a hurry or had
anything better to do than sit and drink espressos, Tim Bevan said goodbye
and eased his tall frame back into the Soho snarl. Probably caught the
red-eye.

FT  14 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Stand by your man - in Versace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fashion editors and writers have failed to tackle a significant problem
again exercising the minds of well-born ladies across southern Europe. What
does she wear on that first, all-important visit to the prison where her
husband or lover is held on a charge of corruption or embezzlement?
The rules, which had been dictated by Milan's elite San Vittore jail, are
under attack from Madrid's Alcala-Meco prison. The Italians turn up in a
combination of bella figura and haute couture.
But politics plays a role: if your man is a leading socialist you wear
Versace, for he is designer to those who formed the once sturdy backbone of
Italian socialism: millionaires, media stars and intellectual glitterati. It
is Krizia for Communists while Christian Democrats prefer Armani.
Spanish scandals have shown that the rules are not as strict as I had
assumed. The wives of the former governor of the central bank, Mariano
Rubio, and his investment broker, Manuel de la Concha, last weekend made
their first visit to Alcala-Meco. For the occasion they wore T-shirts and
jeans in one case and a sober little suit in the other.
Elisa Rodriguez Lopez, described as the former girlfriend or fiancee of the
fleeing ex-boss of the Guardia Civil, Luis Roldan, even though she is
married to someone else, chose an interesting anti-paparazzi combination for
her appearance before the parliamentary commission investigating the matter.
A huge Kelly bag, a crumpled power suit and an Hermes scarf held over her
dark glasses.
I imagine there is a good deal of telephoning prior to the decisions that
are made in such cases. It seems the need to present a defiant image looms
large in such cases.
My inquiries among French female colleagues elicited the information that
something 'fabuleux' for any such occasion would be the correct choice in
France - 'St Laurent or Dior, but not Lacroix'. In England, however, it
would be well-cut tweeds and a loose cashmere sweater.
But enough of this semiotic speculation - we must return to the question of
the comparative reaction of Italians and Spaniards to their corruption
scandals. The fashion test indicates that the Spanish are individualistic,
an impression confirmed by further study.
This may be because Italy's blanket approach, kicking out everybody remotely
associated with the authorities, is not working well. The new government
there will probably turn out to be little better than the old, and, as this
week's cabinet list showed, it contains nastier elements than anything
thrown up by the old crowd.
As the last prime minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, pointed out in an
interview in la Repubblica, the process of forming a government under Silvio
Berlusconi in no way departs from the standards of the long decades of the
corrupt ancien regime.
Ciampi himself, as a non-politician, had formed a government in a matter of
hours and produced what was thought to be the best administration Italy has
enjoyed for some time. But that went by the board and tradition has
reasserted itself.
In Spain, lessons have been learnt, but maybe not by the conservative
opposition. The Madrid ABC wants to chase everybody out.
It was, however, nice of it to recall a remark of the socialist prime
minister, Felipe Gonzalez, of two years ago: 'We don't have a problem of
corruption that's any worse than that of neighbouring countries. What we
have is a problem of public opinion because of the decision of some people
to turn this topic into a weapon and an instrument of propaganda.'
The paper then argued Gonzalez was corrupt because of the way in which Rubio
and De la Concha had been treated - thrown into prison 'in defiance of
elementary rights'.
El Pais is more friendly to the government and rejected an Italian solution.
In a Jesuitical sermon, it argued that many responses to the present 'crisis
of confidence' were possible. But it was no use just getting rid of the
socialists.
'The socialist Titanic is sinking, but its captain must not abandon ship
until the whole voyage, and its crew, have been redeemed: only then can he
resign or sack others, now he is hanging on until history absolves him.'
In Italy it never crossed anyone's minds to think in terms of absolution or
redemption.
But there are areas in which tales of corruption among Iberian folk do
follow the rules set by others. Those governing the lifestyle of men fleeing
justice, and their lady friends, remain remarkably unchanged.
The magazine Interviu last Monday carried a traditional picture of the
fugitive Luis Roldan on an anonymous beach 'in underpants, accompanied by
half-naked women'.
One of the compensations of associating with men on the run, rather than
those inside, has always been that neither they nor you have to worry about
what to wear.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Sexual harassment - or simply fascism at work?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Financial Times has reviewed documents which confirm the salient points
of this personal account of events in a local authority social services
department. Names have been changed to protect the accused.
A young shop steward called Helena, is proposing that a supervisor, Colin
Maynard, be boycotted by union members. He has been seen on the corridor
where he worked until the management agreed to a union demand that he should
be banished to another building.
I ask: 'What do you mean by boycott?' Another steward replies: 'Have no
dealings with him. Make it clear to him that his behaviour is unacceptable
to the membership.'
Helena asks: 'Is there a seconder?' A hand goes up.
Maynard was in charge of a team of female administrative staff, several of
whom were unhappy with the way he managed. They took the matter to a
women-only subgroup of the union. Following their complaints, and
investigation by the organisation's equal opportunities officer, a charge of
sexual harassment was brought against Maynard.
                     *     *     *
He was then removed from the office where his team worked. A union bulletin
written by the women's convenor explained the disciplinary action that was
being taken under the sexual harassment procedure. It stated that Maynard:
Was pedantic about work and would often send a document back to be re-done
because it contained one error, a misspelling or a wording he did not like;
Picked on certain staff and asked them to re-do items of work;
Laughed about staff's errors, criticised their work in front of others,
criticised staff in their absence, and had reduced some to tears;
Acted insensitively over funeral arrangements and other personal matters and
made it unnecessarily difficult for a female shop steward and a woman to
attend union meetings;
Consistently worried staff over small arithmetical errors on their time
sheets;
Kept secret records of staff sick leave;
Constantly observed staff time-keeping;
Interrupted people to correct them while on the telephone;
Openly disapproved of staff taking maternity leave;
Gave no praise to the women in his team.
Perhaps Maynard was a very unpleasant supervisor. But consider the wording
of this complaint: keeping 'secret sickness records' sounds mean-spirited
and obsessional; but it is only another way of saying that Maynard kept
confidential sickness records. That was part of his job.
That he 'gave no praise to the women in his team' and 'made life difficult
for a female shop steward' implies discrimination; but there were only women
in the team.
However, the suggestion of sexual discrimination primes the context for the
one item of alleged behaviour that has a potential link with gender: that
Maynard 'openly disapproved of staff taking maternity leave'.
Yet if he was guilty of this, it is not what he was accused of. Whatever
Maynard's faults as a manager, the one thing absent from these allegations
is sexual harassment.
The union's bulletin acknowledges that the sexual harassment charge had
'problems', but said the union agreed to participate to 'ensure that the
manager was never in a position to harass women in the way he had been doing
for seven years.'
At the time, I tried to obtain the union's formal definition of sexual
harassment without success. However, the popularly understood meaning of the
term is: repeated, unwelcome sexual overtures. And Maynard, a middle-aged
married man, had to explain to his wife that he was being disciplined for
sexual harassment.
Meanwhile, Maynard was deposited in a corner of the divisional director's
small office, working on a box-like affair about the size of a schoolboy's
desk. When I saw him there, I asked him how he was. He began to cry.
Privately, a lot of people, both in the union and out of it, sympathised
with Maynard. Several female colleagues told me they abhorred the
proceedings against him. But they mostly remained silent. One said she could
not dissent publicly because she would then have to resign from the women's
committee.
I looked for a reason not to involve myself but found myself drawn in.
I asked that Maynard's situation should be brought to a meeting open of the
full shop membership, since only the women's section had been consulted so
far.
The union representative was sympathetic, but was worried about the reaction
from the women's section. I sympathised. About a year previously I had been
deemed by its convenor, Deborah Kirby, to have raised something
inappropriately at a meeting where she had been calling for a strike. She
shouted at me with a combination of righteous fury and hints of tears. I was
paralysed. So, apparently, was everyone else.
To his credit, the rep came back to tell me that the Maynard issue would be
discussed at a full shop meeting in three weeks. However the meeting was
cancelled three times. Then Maynard disappeared and interest in the issue
waned.
So, four months on, 40 people are discussing the fact that Maynard's small,
balding form has been seen in a corridor near his old section. Helena asks
that all those in favour of boycotting Maynard raise their hands. There has
been no debate, apart from my question.
I say: 'Hang on - can we discuss this before we vote?'
Helena says impatiently: 'This whole situation was discussed months ago.
There's no point wasting everybody's time going over the same old ground.'
Several people murmur agreement.
'OK,' she repeats, 'all those in favour . . .'
A lot of hands go up.
I interrupt again: I splutter that this is a human being you are all voting
to do something to - someone who has already had to go through being accused
of something he did not do.
This is greeted by a chorus of jeers and sighs. But quite a few people are
saying nothing. This includes at least one person who has said in private
that she abhors what is going on.
I am stung with anger: 'Whatever else Colin Maynard did, he doesn't seem to
have sexually harassed anybody - has he? All I'm saying is that we should
discuss what he's actually done, and . . . '
I was interrupted by Deborah Kirby, the women's convenor: 'Paul, don't you
think you're being rather ingenuous here. The original complaint was made
months ago. If you had a problem with it, the women who made the complaint
are just down the corridor from you.
'Why did you not just go and discuss it with them? We're not prepared to let
the women of that team be put through even more distress just to satisfy
you.'
So the boycott is agreed with only one vote against - mine. After the
meeting, I arranged to meet the union's district officer. But when he
discovered I was only a rank and file member, he said: 'I'm sorry, I didn't
realise. I can't talk to you.'
Four of us then wrote expressing our disquiet to the union. None of us
received a reply.
                     *     *     *
So what happened to Colin Maynard?
I believe he carried on working where he was put - a middle-aged man with a
blot on his record is not well-placed to seek alternative employment.
The process described above will be recognisable to anyone with even the
sparsest knowledge of the history of injustice.
The ingredients were classic: a backdrop of popular dogma, a scapegoat
depicted as a monster, group conformity, the formidable leader who
over-simplifies, and finally the bureaucrat who will take the power but
leave the moral responsibility. It is called fascism.

FT  14 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: A child of the sixties celebrates a
birthday - Lucia van der Post on Habitat, 30 years old this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1964, when Habitat was born, I was a young mother in London, wheeling a
great high-sprung pram up and down the King's Road from World's End, where
we lived, to Peter Jones, Sloane Square, where I went in search of a carpet
or a lampshade or a chair that I liked and could afford. I was almost always
disappointed.
I had four floors of a terraced house to furnish and little money or
experience. Finding few things that I could bear to bring across the
threshold, I began to think I had very peculiar tastes. Certainly that was
how many shopkeepers of the day treated me, implying that anyone who stocked
the kind of things they imagined I wanted would soon be out of business.
My husband was completely nonplussed at how extraordinarily picky his young
wife had turned out to be. The trickiest scenes took place in the linoleum
department where the prevailing tastes of the day ran to bright renditions
of shells, stones or ancient Greek mosaics.
Then Habitat opened, on May 11, 1964. Oh, the relief. It was perfectly all
right not to like fringed velvet three-piece suites, to want no truck with
lampshades perched upon porcelain dolls, to prefer sturdy pale pine to
Formica, to find visual repose in a simple white Japanese paper lantern, to
prefer one's salad tossed in a hand-turned wooden bowl rather than a plastic
one.
It is almost impossible to convey to the post-Habitat generation just what
the birth of that first shop meant to the young marrieds of the 1960s. The
clarity and simplicity of the vision was stunning.
Sir Terence Conran's avowed mission was to prove that 'functional can be
beautiful, and beautiful must be affordable'. One design journalist was so
carried away she felt 'as if she had died and gone to heaven'. It was much
more than a shop - it offered the promise of a warmer, more sun-filled way
of life.
This week, Habitat was 30 years old and celebrated its birthday by offering
a small selection of goods stocked by the original shop at the original
prices - Japanese rush bugs at 18p, director's chairs at Pounds 5 each, six
Paris glasses for 75p, bentwood chairs for Pounds 6.50.
All these things are marvellous illustrations of the longevity of what we
have come to call good design. The director's chair, the bentwood chair, the
paper lanterns, the plain linen, the rush or willow ware, the simple wooden
products - all have much the same timeless air as, say, an 18th century
piece of Wedgwood creamware, a piece of Shaker furniture, French bistro
pottery, 17th century English silverware. All of them should go on looking
good for years to come.
Tasteful, attractive, functional things, Habitat proved, did not have to
come with fancy price tags. We still have at home, doing sterling service,
some of the items we bought all those years ago - a couple of red
Magistretti rush-seated chairs, white painted bentwood chairs, a
black-stained ash desk top on trestles, storage units and countless
earthenware casseroles, white porcelain pots a la creme, white souffle
dishes. I am as pleased with them now as I was then.
If you look at Habitat today, it is good to see that Vittorio Radice, the
managing director, has kept to his avowed intention of taking Habitat back
to where it all began.
'Sir Terence Conran,' he told me a couple of years ago, 'had a wonderful
concept and as long as he kept to it the stores flourished. They were all in
beautiful buildings that were special to their towns. It was only when he
took his eye off the ball and they took Habitat into huge sheds in edge of
town sites that the merchandise deteriorated and the image became seriously
damaged.' The 1980s Shabitat jokes began.
Look through a current catalogue - or better still, visit one of the stores
 -and you will see the original concept is alive and strong. The stores
today are light, bright airy places, just as I remember that first store in
the Fulham Road.
It has grown up a bit, in that the sofas look plumper, softer, more
welcoming. The textiles reflect our modern preoccupation with the earthy and
the natural. There is some lovely appliqued bed linen and plenty of the
attractive rushware that brought in the original customers - look for rattan
dining chairs, for storage chests, for tumbler covers, for picnic baskets
and a wonderful reclining chaise-longue for just Pounds 149.
There is, as always, a touch of the ethnic - galvanised iron baskets and
lanterns, an Edo paper lantern, a Dakari tray table from India. Having run
out of new cuisines to introduce us to (remember the tagine, the wok, the
pasta-maker?) kitchenware has reverted primarily to the simple and the
classic with the occasional exuberant burst of hand-painted Italian
ceramics.
In the Habitat of today you can find most of the basic ingredients a young
household needs. It has once again become a place that the design world
feels it needs to watch.
David Davies, the designer responsible for some of the most interesting
retailing projects around, firmly believes that today it is one of the best
home furnishing stores in the world. He says: 'I travel a lot and I do not
know of one to beat it for the mix of products, the incredible style and the
very affordable prices. The textiles, the cushions, the throws, the fabrics
are exceptionally well-priced and so is the furniture. Where else can you
buy a really good chair for Pounds 49? My office is full of them.'
The 1980s' jokes are drying up.

FT  14 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: Dunhill joins Linley for the royal box -
Lucia van der Post on a joint enterprise which has produced some fine
containers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred Dunhill, that most English of enterprises, has teamed up with Lord
Linley, that most entrepreneurial of royals, to produce a series of boxes -
most of them designed to be humidors - on quintessential English themes. If
the very notion of hours and hours of intricate effort devoted solely to
producing exquisite boxes seems strange, it is worth remembering that fine
wooden boxes, exquisitely wrought, minutely detailed, are part of an
old-established English tradition.
Lord Linley himself has long been intrigued by boxes and made his first one
 -a birthday present for his grandmother - when he was just 15. 'It was made
of English walnut and had secret mitre dove-tails. She uses it still - it
appears regularly at the end of meals when it is used to hand the cigars
around. So when Dunhill came to me and suggested that we embarked on a joint
enterprise it appealed to me at once.
'My company had already made jewellery boxes for private clients as well as
cabinets to hold spectacles, pens, watches and so I was delighted to explore
the possibility of producing decorative boxes for cigars.
'The team came up with the idea of using architectural themes from the
repertory of England's greatest architects - we had already explored
architectural motifs in some of our furniture but none of them are exact
renditions of any given period, more they aim to capture the flavour and the
style.'
Dunhill's brief was that it would provide the humidor expertise (Alfred
Dunhill started up as a supplier of accessories to the newly chic hobby of
motoring, but it eventually became best known for its tobacco business) and
David Linley's company would contribute the decorative container.
It might now seem politically incorrect to produce exquisite receptacles for
carcinogenic symbols of high living; but both Dunhill and Linley say that
all the boxes can be customised for other purposes - holding jewels
(coronets and tiaras?), stamp collections, pens or beads.
Two years on and the boxes are now ready. There are five designs (based
loosely on the architectural styles of Christopher Wren, Pugin, Inigo Jones,
William Kent and John Soane) and just 10 boxes of each design. They measure
14ins high, 10 1/2 ins wide and 10ins deep and, if used with the humidor
fitting (which is included in the price) hold 250 cigars. Each style,
though, has a much larger run of what Linley calls 'disciple' boxes - these
are smaller but in similar mood and are considerably cheaper.
They are exquisitely made but, and Lord Linley is adamant about this, they
are designed to be used. 'The lovely thing about wood is that it gets better
with age.'
Each is made by hand from mainly English woods such as walnut, oak and ash,
while ebony, satinwood and black sycamore have been used for the inlay.
Making the boxes involves intricate crafts such as marquetry, inlay and
wood-carving ('using wood to paint with', as Lord Linley puts it), all of
which is very labour intensive.
'We are beginning to see many people who want something designed and made
specifically for them and not for some abstract market' - that individuality
is what these boxes are all about.
Who, you might legitimately wonder, could possibly be prepared to pay Pounds
1,500 - the price of the smaller, disciple boxes - let alone the Pounds
9,500 or so that the larger boxes command?
The boxes are currently on a world tour, progressing at a hectic pace with
their royal designer (and his wife) accompanying them. Six have sold in New
York, three in Chicago. This week was San Francisco's chance. Next comes Los
Angeles and Hong Kong, while London must wait until Wednesday May 25 when
they go on sale at Dunhill at 30 Duke Street, St James's, London SW1.

You enter the little auberge and the waiter hands you the menu. Your mind
goes blank. Just what is potage Longchamp? What is lingue? What is loubine?
You have forgotten - or you never knew - so one of those interminable
franglais conversations takes place as you extract the meaning from a
recalcitrant waiter. There is another way. Take Tessa Youell and George
Kimball's pocket guide to French Food and Wine (Pounds 5.95, Carbery, 240
pages). It is not a new publication but it has been reprinted and is worth
mentioning again for those who want to remove the frustrations of
understanding often complex menus.

Hors d'oeuvre. The phrase hangs heavy on my lips, associated as it is with
meals unwillingly partaken in railway hotel dining rooms 30 years ago,
experiences so gloom-laden that I have not dared return.
It is difficult to forget the smell of stale foods that weighed down the
curtains. The carpets with patterns that screamed. The occasional whisper
between diners that passed for conversation. And the food.
Hors d'oeuvre was probably the only alternative to glutinous Brown Windsor
Soup. There were poor quality sardines swimming in poor quality oil, denied
even a smattering of parsley to cover their misery. There were frozen peas,
diced carrots and potatoes in salad cream masquerading as Russian salad.
There were cold baked beans and hard-boiled eggs with rubbery whites and
black-rimmed yolks that stuck in the throat like golf balls.
Thank goodness for change. First, the spread of the trattoria with its
lighter and fresher tasting antipasti forced British hors d'oeuvre trolleys
to improve their standards. And now that the fashion for lighter eating is
firmly established, hors d'oeuvre, antipasti, mezze, zakuski, call them what
you will, have become a star turn.
A sparkling selection of small and appetising dishes is rightly prized, not
only for serving in its traditional role as a first course, but also as
lunch in its own right. What could be nicer for lunch in the garden when
summer weather plays fair?
A few choice meats and fish are usual. Classics include fat salt anchovies,
ventresca tuna and cured herrings. Also excellent are garlic fried squid,
mussels lightly steamed and dressed with fresh herb vinaigrette, and brown
shrimps or cold water prawns served in their pink armour with wedges of
lemon or lime or home-made mayonnaise or aioli.
I tend to wave the flag for meats such as Scottish smoked venison and
Cumbrian or west country air-dried ham instead of salami and saucisson.
Dairy produce may be welcomed by those who eat neither meat nor fish. For
example: crottins or other small goats cheeses preserved in oil, sliced
paper hoop thin and scattered with nasturtium petals. Cubes of salty
ewes-milk fetta tossed with fresh chopped thyme, oregano and toasted
coriander seed. Slices of buffalo mozzarella sandwiched between basil leaves
and slipped toast-rack-fashion into slits made in large tomatoes cut nearly
but not quite through.
Pancake herb omelettes (one-egg omelettes, cooled, rolled up like a
cigarette and snipped across into ribbons) are also good, as are hard-boiled
eggs that are not indigestibly hard. (For yolks that are creamy rather than
bullet-like, just cover the eggs with cold water, bring slowly to the boil
and boil for six minutes only, then plunge in cold water to arrest cooking.)
But the main part of the spread - indeed sometimes the whole of it - should
consist of vegetable offerings.
Currently a la mode, and utterly effortless for the cook, are such things as
artichoke hearts, wild and cultivated mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, grilled
baby onions and other bulbs preserved in oil. Quality varies enormously from
brand to brand. Most of the best I have tasted come from southern Italy and
are bottled in virgin olive oil.
My own preference lies with raw vegetables and freshly cooked salads because
they tend to be cleaner tasting. For the freshest impact, the trick is to
serve cooked salads before they are completely cold after cooking. Never
should they be chilled. Present favourites of mine include:
Barely wilted spinach anointed with oil in which mustard seeds have been
warmed until they popped. Baby courgettes halved lengthways, lightly
steamed, patted dry and spread with parsley and coriander pesto. Baby leeks
steamed and dressed with vinaigrette a l'oeuf. Steamed cauliflower sprigs
tossed with olive oil, lemon juice, chopped capers, olives, mint and green
coriander.
Cucumbers are better, I think, seasoned with sugar rather than salt. Dress
the slices with vinegar, but no oil, coarsely ground black pepper, chopped
dill or herb fennel and starry-eyed blue borage flowers.
Roasted red peppers call for oil but no vinegar, a little sea salt and a
soupcon of finely chopped garlic.
Small cultivated mushrooms (marrons for preference) are delicious raw if
sliced and tossed twice over, first with a little salt and lemon juice, then
with a few tablespoons of sizzling hot olive oil aromatised with bay leaves
and toasted and crushed cumin.
Boiled French beans welcome a squeeze of lemon if aioli is on the menu, or a
few spoonfuls of very finely chopped tomato flavoured with a sliver of
garlic and a few crushed fennel seeds.
Raw wedges of crisp Florentine fennel need no adornment. Slices of avocado
benefit from a dressing of chopped chillies, green coriander and lime.
Good bread is always needed to mop up fragrant juices and to provide starchy
contrast. A mealy dish of pulses is also to be recommended. Lentils with
lovage and bacon makes a splendidly savoury choice: cook 5oz of little green
lentils and a small chopped onion in  3/4 pt water with the juice and zest
of half a lemon, adding salt only when the lentils are tender.
Dress with garlicky vinaigrette using two parts oil to one of lemon and mix
in 2 tablespoons of chopped tender young lovage leaves and 2oz grilled
streaky bacon cut into snippets.
If no lovage is to hand, add a pinch of curry powder to the cooking pot and
finish the dish with chopped celery leaves.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The French Connection): The trouble with the
French . . . - France's top wine writer complains about his countrymen / As
France prepares for its summer invasion of Britons, Weekend FT writers have

'Wine is one of the great strengths of France. The name Margaux or Lafite is
much better known around the world than, say, Balladur, but the French seem
to take no pride in their wines. Britain has much better media coverage of
the subject.
'The quality of a new vintage is a very important cultural and economic fact
to France but, contrary to any other subject, reporters never ask an
independent outsider about it. They ask the Ministry of Agriculture]'
The exasperated 'independent outsider' delivering this diatribe is Michel
Bettane, widely hailed as France's top, if under-utilised, wine writer. A
jolly ovoid, vintage 1952, self-taught and passionately devoted to wine
quality, he gave up teaching classics three years ago to devote himself to
the French monthly magazine Revue du Vin de France (RVF) of which he is not
editor but its trump card.
Although France is the world's leading wine producer, RVF is France's only
consumer publication devoted to wine. Britain has at least three (Decanter,
WINE and The Vine) while Wine Spectator, The Wine Advocate, Wine Enthusiast,
Appellation and the Quarterly Revue of Wine are just some of the US
counterparts.
The approaches and objectives of these three countries' wine writers could
hardly be more different. For Bettane, it is as important to inform and
guide France's vine growers as the wine consumers among RVF's 30,000
readers. His particular hobby horses are the need to limit yields, the evils
of relying on a single clone of each vine variety, and the virtues of
ecologically sensitive viticulture.
Accordingly, he spends at least three months each year in vineyards and
cellars counselling vignerons. His reference points for each vintage include
Michel Delon, Alain Vauthier and Michel Rolland in Bordeaux and Lafon,
Leflaive, Leroy and Accad in Burgundy.
Famed for both his palate and his memory, he never takes a note in situ.
'It's just a matter of politesse: you're a guest; a grower gives you what he
thinks is his best wine. How can people do it? What's more important is to
listen to the wine and to the grower.'
His policy is to criticise by omission rather than to publish a poor review.
'It is very important to say the truth to the growers, but not necessarily
to the readers.' When asked how he retains his objectivity, he interprets
the question as referring to his personal tasting technique rather than any
suggestion of partiality.
American wine writers, on the other hand, will do anything to maintain their
distance from producers. The preferred research method of America's
influential Robert Parker, for example, is to assemble and compare hundreds
of sample bottles on neutral territory. Comments and points out of 100 based
on his palate, rather than any contact with individual producers, are then
printed in ruthless detail.
While most American wine writers concentrate on nosing out the finest,
rarest and often most expensive wines, the British approach is more
democratic, but can be considerably less inspiring. 'Go there, buy that,'
succinctly summarises the average British wine article. British wine
journalism is still informed by the notion that the writer's job is to
demystify this curious foreign beast called wine and swell the ranks of wine
drinkers. The chief beneficiaries are the supermarkets, and those selling
wines at under Pounds 4 a bottle.
In France, Bettane sees his job as halting the decline of wine consumption
and educating a new generation of consumers.
While Britain's consumerist wine writers list retail stockists, their US
counterparts have to limit themselves to importers, so complex is the US
distribution system. Bettane and his ilk simply give the address of the
producer, however. 'In France we don't have wine merchants, and those few
cavistes that exist have no knowledge at all of the international wine
market.'
As well as travelling to the US, and possibly Italy or Germany once a year,
Bettane reads the British and American wine press avidly. He treasures his
relationship with 'Bob' (wine guru Robert Parker) and, like him, Bettane was
born in Maryland, even though they differ on the subject of wine scores out
of 100. 'They are very, very dangerous. More and more the wine trade simply
reacts to these points rather than knowing what they like and want to sell.
'I have resisted publishing points in RVF. We use a much more general star
system. In France we judge in a more cultural, civilised way. To understand
Pinot Noir, for example, you must understand the culture of Pinot Noir
before the technical knowledge.
'No Frenchman knows more about California or Italian wines than me but it's
difficult to write about them because there's no market for them in France -
although more French people are becoming interested in non-French wines,
especially Italian wines because of the cuisine.
'I think California produces some superb wines, but Australians? I just
cannot understand them. Even someone as sympathetic as James Halliday
(Australia's top wine writer and a wine producer) seems to be from another
planet. Acids, tannins, balance, we taste completely differently. With Davis
(the academic centre of California wine), I understand them - and I know
they're wrong. With Australians, I can't even understand them.'
For the moment, however, Bettane has quite enough problems to sort out at
home. 'We think that more than 60, perhaps 80, per cent of all French
appellation controlee wines are below the necessary level of quality,
especially in Burgundy and Champagne. That's why vins de pays producers
deserve success; because they work so much harder.
'Perhaps the best value appellations in general are in south west France -
Madiran, Jurancon, Bergerac - and the Languedoc. They are modern wines with
the complexity of French tradition rather than the simplicity of the New
World. 'And,' here he gives his trademark mischievous smile, 'they're so
much less boring than Bordeaux.'

Just what should you eat with champagne

The large and ancient province of Champagne was one of the jewels in the
French crown. In spite of so many vicissitudes of fortune it has hung in
there, bearing the brunt of the action. Battles and wars have been fought
over its chalky soils. You would be hard-pressed to find a city, town or
village which remains unscathed.
Mention Champagne today and it is wine rather than war which springs to
mind. Ask about the food and the locals will explain that there has never
been a gastronomic tradition worthy of the name.
Press them further and out will spill a shortlist of rather earthy things:
the potee or stew which was served to pickers at the end of the vintage;
pigs' ears, trotters and andouillettes, so prized by the area's peasant
farmers; in the less vinous country to the east, bread and dripping; little
pies and pates and even that great pigeon pie on which French kings gorged
themselves after coronations in Rheims; river fish, some muddy, some not:
trout, pike, perch and eel; a special race of sheep which grazed on the
chalk slopes of the Mountain of Rheims and which had white flesh as a
result.
In Britain a similar list would be the object of pride. In Champagne it is
dismissed as 'nothing much'.
Since the champagne houses started receiving favoured customers in the
region, much of this has changed. The business of entertaining visitors has
spawned its own style of cooking, as like to the original as chalk to
cheese.
The great houses needed restaurants of an elegance worthy of their top
cuvees and dishes which would not spoil the delicate taste of the wines. Any
restaurateur who could provide both could be guaranteed of the patronage of
the champagne firms. A second cuisine champenoise was born. It is the only
one the casual visitor is likely to experience today.
Champagne wine is a delicate balancing act between three grape varieties:
the maligned Pinot Meunier, the more robust and fruity Pinot Noir and the
floral, and occasionally ethereal Chardonnay.
Some champagnes depend wholly or principally on one variety and make wines
which are, for the most part, less complex. Then there are the still wines
of the region: red Pinot Noirs from Bouzy, Ambonnay or Cumieres; white,
Coteaux Champenois; or oddities such as the earthy rose des Riceys.
The variety of styles gives the restaurateur a wide range of flavours to
play with. Certain dishes go better with one champagne than they do with
another. By common consent some dishes do not go with champagne at all:
chocolate, oranges and salad.
To this list, Jean-Pierre Lallement, of L'Assiette Champenoise (tel: 26 04
15 56), would add bell peppers, onions, mint and rosemary. Garlic is highly
risky. On the other hand Lallement is not shocked by the idea of tripe with
a Pinot Noir- based 'blanc des noirs'.
Anyone who wants to play safe will serve you lobster, scallops or Dublin Bay
prawns. None of these will rock the boat. The conventional wisdom is to
serve them with a Chardonnay-dominated cuvee, or even with a pure Chardonnay
Cremant from the Cote des Blancs. The only time I found this did not work
was in a champagne house where the chefs, from an Epernay restaurant, had
laced the lobster with onions and garlic and assassinated the wine.
Chardonnay-based wines would seem to suit the ultra-fashionable John Dory
too - although any wine of character will tend to overpower it.
Traditionally, salmon was thought to pine for champagne: Grimod de La
Reyniere gives a recipe for a salmon sweated in two bottles of the stuff:
'This fish is something of a drunkard; what's more it will only drink the
best.'
I wonder what Grimod would make of modern farmed salmon; a fish so oily that
it is half way to a herring or a mackerel. In the restaurant Florence in
Rheims (26 47 12 70) I have seen champagnes knocked sideways by both
sardines and red mullet.
The chef at Florence did, however, manage to come up with a papeton of
pigeon stuffed with its own liver and little nicois olives which went
remarkably well with an all-Pinot Noir rose. On the other hand, an attempt
to match a gutsy champagne with lamb wrapped in bacon (white-fleshed or
otherwise) proved a failure. I remain unconvinced by any attempt to marry
champagne to red meat or game.
Champagne's cheeses are all peripheral to the province: Chaource, Langres,
Boursault, Brie and Maroilles. The Champenois have a particular affection
for the latter which ripens in the autumn and is brought down from the north
by the pickers. It is a strong cheese; not for nothing is one sort dubbed le
suppositoire du diable while a version from Lille is called le puant, or the
stinker.
Strange as it may seem, the stinker went well with an old (1975) vintage
champagne at the excellent Grand Cerf at Montchenot (26 97 60 07) and old
vintages of this sort also combine well with foie gras.
Providing your pudding is not too sweet, champagne, especially rose
champagne, can provide an effective foil. Buttery pastry seems to cry out
for it. On the other hand it is best to go easy on sweet, fruit sauces. All
over France it is common practice to open a bottle of champagne with dessert
when you are dining in style.
Outside the region itself, there is clearly less demand for meals
accompanied by different champagnes. Even in Epernay I found the head of one
champagne house who was clearly not going to go to war for this sort of
gastronomic marriage: I asked him when he liked to drink champagne and he
replied: 'Every evening, before dinner.' The rest was diplomatic silence.
Anyone wishing to learn to cook with and around champagne at one of the
regions better hotel-restaurants might be interested in the Auberge Saint
Vincent, in Ambonnay, which runs a three-night cookery break at just Pounds
183 per person. For the price you get accommodation, dinners and breakfasts,
cooking sessions (you eat you own work), a visit to a champagne house and
ferry crossings for car and passengers. Inquiries to Inntravel: tel:

What makes someone with a future, a steady income and a secure job with
sociable working hours, give it all up to become a restaurateur?
As I still cannot explain why I did just that, I put the question to
Jean-Marie Pujade, who has opened a second restaurant, this time in Paris.
Such was the level of background noise from his busy venture, barely six
months old, that I had to call him back three times.
Thirteen years ago, Pujade was an architect in his native Perpignan,
geographically in south-west France but culturally, spiritually and
gastronomically part of Catalonia, the region that encompasses north east
Spain and France's Roussillon, and which looks to Barcelona as its capital.
He was, however, growing increasingly disenchanted with his architectural
commissions and, in a sharp change of direction, became a nightclub owner.
There, food in the form of tapas and other small dishes was served,
nominally to soak up the alcohol. But, like me, Pujade began to enjoy
serving food to the paying public. In my case, memories of Jewish family
cooking were rekindled: in Pujade's it was the Catalan cooking of his
grandmother.
In September 1986, one of Perpignan's oldest restaurants, La Casa Sansa,
which opened in the early 1890s, was for sale. In spite of a distinguished
history - I was told about a local tax inspector who had eaten lunch there
every day of his working life for 40 years - it was in need of Pujade's
architectural skills. A deep, gloomy beige on the walls and unflattering
ceiling lights were not going to appeal to the clientele of the 1980s.
Working 15 hours a day, Pujade transformed the place into a Catalan
brasserie.
Today, the dining room is much lighter, the walls covered in an eclectic
mixture of prints, photographs and posters which, naturally, incorporate
Picasso and Dali, and around the open bar is a collection of model wooden
ships. Pujade has solved the problem of communication between the restaurant
and kitchen by simply carving a hole in the wall, through which orders,
dishes and chefs move easily. The service is fast and friendly, supervised
by an elegantly dressed woman, who appeared completely in control.
While there can be no doubting the courage involved in Pujade's mid-life
career change, his timing has been impeccable. So many of the basics of
Catalan cooking - garlic, olive oil, vegetables, fish and non-fatty grilled
meats, such as chicken and rabbit, - are currently fashionable. La Casa
Sansa's menu incorporates them all.
We began our meal with thick, grilled asparagus served with a very garlicky
aioli. Calcots, a large, local, spring onion, also grilled, was accompanied
by a slightly watery romesco sauce. This was followed by quickly sauteed
fresh, young squid and escalivade, a simple but filling dish of roasted
aubergines, peppers, onions and tomatoes, drenched with olive oil.
Then on to a plethora of fresh fish with an appetising white wine from
Bernard Vaquer. A plate of thick gambas prawns, was served grilled
accompanied by Rivesaltes, a local fortified wine. A parillade de poissons
included monkfish, cod and bream. A rather evil-looking, but
delicious-tasting, cassolette de la mer was thickened and enriched with
almonds. Finally, and fittingly, we were brought creme catalane, a cross
between creme caramel and creme brulee, strong coffee and a bill of less
than Pounds 20 per person.
Sensible pricing is another of Pujade's skills. Behind us a table of six sat
down to the FFr48 (Pounds 5.60) two-course menu du jour. They began with a
thick vegetable soup and then did battle with a large plate of costellou, a
Catalan dish that incorporates various cuts of pork. (The menu du jour in
Paris is FFr78, but menus and wine lists are the same in both restaurants).
If I was unable to find an exact answer as to what had lured Pujade into the
restaurant business I would not let him return to his customers without
telling me why he had made the successful 900km leap from Perpignan to
Paris.
He replied, with typical Catalan pride: 'Firstly, because Paris is the
world's capital of good taste - after Barcelona, of course. As to its
success, Parisians love the food but coming to my restaurant here brings
back for many of them happy memories of holidays in Catalonia.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Fashion: A look that's fine and dandy - Me and My Wardrob /
John Morgan discusses clothes with a smart Italian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN

<TEXT>
'I think I shall ask Kohji Tatsuno to design me a suit in the style of Der
Rosenkavalier,' says Manfredi della Gheradesca with a seriousness of tone
that other men might reserve for talking about an investment in index-linked
gilts.
He is describing his costume for Minuetto, a fund-raising Venetian masked
ball that della Gheradesca is organising at The Royal Academy in June.
Sandwiched between Royal Ascot and Wimbledon, it will, he hopes, be one of
the great parties of the summer.
Count Manfredi della Gheradesca is one of the more social of the insatiably
sociable army of smart Italian ex-pats, who find Italy too parochial and New
York too frenetic, and base themselves in cosmopolitan but cosy London. He
is also, in a community for which narcissism is the official religion, one
of its snappiest dressers. 'You only have to look at 15th century frescoes,
to see we Italians have always been very concerned about clothes,' he muses,
assuming a passable resemblance to a bearded Renaissance saint.
An unabashed dandy, della Gheradesca, has inherited more than a title from
his forbears. 'My great-grandfather sent his shirts from Tuscany to London
to be washed and starched and then there was a great uncle who was a
neckwear junkie and left 1,870 ties in his will.' Many of these form the
basis of young della Gheradesca's collection of accessories, which includes
300 ties, 80 Swatch watches, 50 waistcoats and 150 pairs of antique
spectacles.
However, for all his affectations, it would be a mistake to dismiss della
Gheradesca as a mere modern day Macaroni.
After studying at Florence University, Hunter College and receiving an MA
from New York University of Fine Art, della Gheradesca worked as a European
private art dealer and gallery manager in Manhattan. Now, as well as raising
money for The Royal Academy from a younger generation of patrons, he works
as an art-advisor for Citybank Private Bank.
'I act as a private curator buying, insuring, restoring art for a few
high-powered international collectors,' explains della Gheradesca, who never
thought he would 'end up in a financial institution'.
Quite. But is he not rather an exotic figure in the sober world of finance?
Is there not a tension between dressing with the probity of the banker and
the air of the aesthete? 'Working in the private banking arm, I deal with
very high net worth individuals, who tend to be very worldly people, that
accept more easily my wearing a Mickey Mouse tie, than those working in
commercial banking might. Although I have to conform to a certain extent, my
clients are looking for more than the bland banker. In this way the clothes
I wear are very much part of the language of my business,' he says.
And what a feast of sartorial semiotics they are. Ranging from Balinese
sarongs to fur hats fit for a Russian dictator, they kit him out for every
fashion eventuality whether it be: 'roller blading in Miami or meeting
corporate collectors in Geneva'.
His suits have been made-to-measure for the past 14 years at the family
tailor in Florence. 'Until recently ready-made suits were a very negative
issue in Italy,' says della Gheradesca darkly. He tends to supply the tailor
with fabrics he has acquired elsewhere.
'I sometimes like to buy unusual cloths that although appearing slightly
'poor taste', will nevertheless work when made-up. It's part of my own
personal challenge of not wearing a uniform.'
He favours the looser Italian cut and is currently enamoured of a 1940s
silhouette. He feels the 'English military milk bottle-style' and 'too short
trouser look favoured by men of obviously Wasp origins', are not for him.
He prefers single-breasted styles. 'l don't like double-breasted - all that
fabric, buttons and pockets overlapping on the stomach. Also, I am very
picky about details. It annoys me particularly if the breast pockets are
badly-placed, cuff buttons are too close to the edge of a sleeve and a
waistcoat is cut too small.' He also has several blazers: 'Quite the most
useful and versatile item in a man's wardrobe.'
Shirts are custom-made in Italy. He tends to choose plain colours but, as
with his suits, enjoys stretching the boundaries of good taste.
'I like to pick up some dubious taste fabric and have it cut it into a very
formal shirt and then wear it with a very serious suit. I hate dressing to
perfection. In my opinion, one element of bad taste in an outfit such as a
fun watch, silly cuff links and amusing tie, can be playful and amusing.
However, you have to learn to play the game - dominate the beast - otherwise
you just end up with unadulterated vulgarity.'
However, it is the waistcoat that forms the mainstay of il stile della
Gheradesca. 'It is a much more satisfying accessory than a tie: there is
only so much you can do with a narrow strip of silk, but a waistcoat offers
endless possibilities,' he enthuses. He began his love affair with the
garment by wearing relatively subdued sporting styles from WH Gidden as a
'sweater substitute against the British climate', but soon graduated to a
feathery confection from Favourbrook made entirely from pheasant plumage.
'I quite launched a fashion in Italy, when I wore it for boar hunting.' Now
he wears a waistcoat on every possible occasion. The choice includes a
lavishly embroidered 18th century example bought at Sotheby's, a funky one
made from US college flags, an amusing numero from Italy constructed from a
patchwork of ceramic tiles and several ethnic ones.
Della Gheradesca lavishes as much attention on his casual clothes as his
more formal outfits. 'I learned about casual dressing in America, where the
compelling need to dress down has resulted in the best casual clothes in the
world.'
In addition to endless sweat pants, denim shirts and hounds-tooth jackets
beloved of a certain class of Italian, he has 20 pairs of jeans. 'I adore
wearing jeans because they are the only garments that change as you wear
them. By the time you have thrown them away, if ever, they have undergone a
complete metamorphosis.'
He is also intrigued by the fashionable 'rich man's, poor man's look' and
adores buying downbeat utility clothes that are made in luxury fabrics.
'The secret to stylish dressing is not to show you are trying too hard,'
says della Gheradesca. And does he have this quality? 'I think I give myself
away in small ways.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A fragile touch of glass -
Heather Farmbrough on a conservatory builder that has survived in a cold
climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the two years he has been running a company producing bespoke
conservatories in London, Patrick Byrne has learnt a number of lessons.
He has had to curb a natural tendency to over-design and spend too much on
the best materials. 'The things which are interesting to design are not
often very cost-effective,' he says ruefully.
Byrne is a 24-year-old architectural technician from Dublin, although his
long flowing red locks and beard lend him the appearance of a Celtic poet.
After leaving college, he worked as a site agent and on the production team
of a conservatory company. In 1991, he met Henry Cope-Harrison, an architect
who was designing conservatories and found that they both thought most of
the conservatories on the market were overpriced and under-specified. In
June 1992, they set up Cope Conservatories as partners.
'As we were coming into the market in a deep recession we had to offer
something different,' recalls Byrne. 'Our idea was to be an upmarket builder
offering a comprehensive design and build service. We wanted to be a design
driven company, operating at the top end of the market, but from a low-cost,
affordable base. We recognised that there was a demand for unusual
conservatories which other people could not build.'
They wanted to build unusual, hand-crafted conservatories, each designed
specifically for the client, rather than standard pre-manufactured 'drop-on'
conservatories. They identified their potential market as the more affluent
parts of west and south west London, where people often wanted to use wasted
space such as side alleys.
They found a small office in Chiswick where the landlord agreed to waive the
rent until they could pay him back. As employees were initially
sub-contracted, start-up costs were low, apart from Pounds 3,800 to buy and
refit a Mercedes van and Pounds 1,500 to print 5,000 colour postcards which
were distributed around south-west London.
Although the response to the cards was low, they generated enough inquiries
to lead to the first contracts. 'We won jobs because we could solve
difficult problems and get on with people's kids - not necessarily because
we were the cheapest. We made a conscious decision not to wear suits when we
went to see clients because it made us about as inviting as West End
nightclub bouncers.'
But costs were too high. The awkward nature of many of the spaces in which
they were building meant that each job was technically demanding and the
highly individual, often complex nature of the conservatory roof designs
meant that they often took longer to build than expected. Finishing touches
often took as long as building the main structure.
Neither of them, however, was willing to compromise artistic or technical
standards. For example, they used substantial mahogany rafters, whereas
their competitors made do with narrow strips of aluminium or timber. At the
end of the first year, turnover was Pounds 104,000 and they had sold plenty
of work. Profits, however, were non-existent.
As Byrne says: 'We were so hungry for work, we took on contracts at
break-even price in the hope that if we performed it would lead to more
referrals. We were selling BMWs at Ford prices.' They were still relying on
cash flow to fund the business rather than investing capital in expansion.
They wanted to produce a brochure and put ads in the glossy home furnishing
magazines, but could not afford it.
Byrne was exhausted, having worked 16 hours a day, seven days a week. He
felt he was spending too much time on site chasing problems and responding
to clients' questions and problems, rather than doing essential
administration and thinking about the business.
In the last few months, Byrne feels he has turned the corner. Since
December, he has employed a full-time foreman and joiner who had previously
worked for him as subcontractors. This has made his life considerably easier
and cut his working week as well as boosting the two employees' motivation.
The company has been reorganised so that it is now Byrne's, reflecting his
greater practical involvement, although Cope-Harrison still does all the
design and marketing work.
In February, Byrne negotiated with the Midland Bank a Pounds 15,000
government loan which will be spent on marketing - a small brochure, more
cards and site boards. He intends to buy a second Mercedes truck and
eventually to open a joinery workshop which would be owned exclusively by
Cope, keeping costs down and eliminating his reliance on suppliers. The
first advertisement appeared in March.
His objective is to take turnover nearer to Pounds 500,000 which should be
feasible given the stream of new business. But the challenge is also to make
a decent living from the business, rather than having to plough everything
back. He has always enjoyed the challenge of being in charge, and his sense
of humour has helped him through the more difficult moments. As he says: 'If
you cannot see the funny side of this business, you are lost.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Negotiating the soft way -
Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiating is a task we do every day. What do you offer children to make
them behave? What extra service can you offer to win the multi-million pound
contract for your company? Negotiating is a way of life, but few of us have
had the formal training to hone our skills.
Without training and planning the outcome depends as much on the respective
personalities of the negotiators as it does on the items under discussion.
There is a way around this in two computer programs I have seen recently.
The Art of Negotiating runs under MS-Dos and has been available for several
years in the US. It is based on Gerard Nierenberg's book of the same name.
Nierenberg suggested that the only successful deal is the one where
everybody wins. Accompanying the software is his second book, The Complete
Negotiator.
The program is easy to use. It takes you through personality profiling of
yourself and the opposing negotiator. This is followed by trying to express
your requirements from your opponent's point of view. The more aware you are
of the opponent's position the more you can develop a creative and effective
solution.
Negotiator Pro is a more recent program. It runs under Windows. It is a lot
more detailed than The Art of Negotiation. There are three main parts to the
program; again the personality profiling based on Jung's four principles
(intro- vert / extrovert / neurotic / stable), the plan, and the glossary.
The plan comprises a choice of 10 or 35 questions depending on how deeply
you want to analyse the situation. You can diagnose the opportunities and
obstacles. The glossary is extensive. It has the equivalent information of a
reasonable-sized book but is more accessible: it is in the form of Windows
help screens. These include some excellent profiles of negotiating styles
tied to nationality. Though they can be little more than cursory, they do
help when dealing with people of different cultural backgrounds.
The program is an import from the US. I was interested in what it said about
the English. Under 'Cultural mannerisms and body language' it said: 'The
English have refined body language and expressions that indicate if they are
ill-disposed to a position. This includes a slight cocking of the head with
a narrowing of the eyes. According to Luigi Barzini in The Europeans, the
English are supremely imperturbable. They are convinced of their superiority
and that of their nation. They believe excitability is a sign of mental
instability.'
There are also a number of sample files to help you get started. I began
with the one on negotiating a deal on a new car, and continued with the
sample of getting a better position in the company.
Negotiator Pro provides a catalyst for you to focus your thinking. It brings
the issues together and prevents issues getting lost. You can create your
own database of personality profiles and past plans.
The traditional market for these programs is the sales and purchasing
departments of large companies, lawyers and barristers - but they can be
used by anyone.
Which is the better software? The Art of Negotiating is more focused; it
makes you more aware of the strategies likely to be used by the opposition.
Negotiator Pro, on the other hand, allows you to develop your plan more
fully.
The Art of Negotiating software is Pounds 125, plus VAT
Negotiator Pro is Pounds 265, plus VAT.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gifts from income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RAYMOND MOODY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My 80-year-old widowed mother has an estate which will be liable to
inheritance tax, which we are seeking to reduce. Advantage is already being
taken of the annual gifts allowance but we would welcome clarification of
the gifts from income arrangements.
She has a building society account to which interest has been accruing for
at least 18 months untouched. What is the situation if this was paid monthly
into an account held by my sister and myself (we are her beneficiaries). For
tax purposes, would these monthly payments be treated as income for my
sister and myself?
To take advantage of the gifts out of income exemption, the amount being
gifted must be made regularly out of income and must not result in a drop in
the donor's standard of living.
I understand your mother has enough income after tax to meet her normal
needs without touching the interest you mention. Therefore, it would be
possible for the interest to be credited to her account and then immediately
transferred into an account for yourself and your sister.
The income would still be taxable upon your mother but I assume that she is
a basic-rate taxpayer. Thus, the interest is paid after deduction of
basic-rate tax so that no more is payable. The regular payments from the
building society account to the account for yourself and your sister would
be gifts out of income and you would not have to pay further tax. (Reply by
Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward).

FT  14 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: 'No mystery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RAYMOND MOODY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the first question and answer in your Briefcase column last
week (May 7/8). If no one has heard of the Rule of Three, then it reinforces
my conviction that the common stock of general knowledge can no longer be
counted upon.
There is no mystery about the Rule of Three. It has a sufficiently
established place in the language to figure in the Oxford English
Dictionary, Vol. Q-R, p882. It is defined as 'a method of finding a fourth
number from three given numbers, of which the first is in the same
proportion to the second as the third is to the unknown fourth' - with eight
supporting quotations from 1594 to 1891.
So much for the Rule of Three. The genuine mystery is how the bank concerned
managed to use this simple rule to turn Pounds 9,000 into Pounds 30,000
unless the phrase was invoked as token of a probverbially arcane procedure.
Are we back in Kipling's world of the 'gods of the copybook headings'?

<TEXT>
Next week, the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog,
will publish advice to people about the issues they should raise with sales
agents when discussing the possibility of transferring a lump sum out of a
former employer's pension scheme into a private plan, writes Alison Smith.
The move is part of SIB's efforts to raise the standards of selling pension
transfers following a pilot study late last year. This suggested a
widespread failure among sales agents to meet regulatory requirements and
raised public concern about the mis-selling of pensions.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: You can take it with you - Your
pension / In the second of three articles, Eric Short discusses changing
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question: I am being made redundant after 10 years with my company. What
happens about my pension benefits in the company scheme?
A. The benefits available on leaving are set out in the scheme booklet; a
copy would have been given to you when you joined. You have a choice of:
1. Leaving them in the scheme.
2. Taking a transfer value and transferring to your new company scheme.
3. Taking a transfer value and investing in a personal pension or buy-out
contract from a life company.
Q. What benefits do I get if I leave them in the company scheme?
A. You get a deferred pension payable from the normal retirement date of the
scheme. The value is calculated on how long you worked for the company and
your salary at the time of leaving.
If your scheme provides a pension at 65 of 1/60th of earnings for each year
of service, and your salary at leaving was Pounds 18,000, your deferred
pension payable from age-65 would be 10/60ths of Pounds 18,000  - that is,
Pounds 3,000 payable from age-65.
Q. Would this pension be increased to offset inflation?
A. Yes. By law, the scheme must revalue this pension each year up to
retirement by the increase in the retail price index, subject to a maximum
of 5 per cent a year. Some schemes, particularly those in the public
service, revalue without any maximum. Once the pension becomes payable, it
is treated like any other pension as set out in the scheme rules, with
guaranteed increases as well as any discretionary rises to offset inflation.
Q. Are there any other benefits from the company scheme?
A. Yes. You can take a cash sum and a reduced pension. There would be a
pension payable to your spouse - usually half the full pension. You would
also be able to take the pension early if you retired before the normal age.
You would also be entitled to a pension if you fell ill and were unable to
continue working.
Q. What is a transfer value?
A. The transfer value is the cash equivalent of your deferred benefits in
the company scheme at the time of calculation. It represents the value of
the assets the scheme needs to hold in order to pay your pension or other
benefits when they become due.
Q. How is this cash equivalent calculated?
A. It is done by the actuary to the scheme, in conjunction with the
trustees. The actuary estimates what the pension payments and other benefits
will be and how long they will be made. He also consults with the trustees
on the likely increases in those payments. Then, the actuary discounts those
payments at a rate of interest related to the expected investment returns on
the fund.
Q. How does the actuary know what the pension payments will be, how long I
and my spouse will live to receive those payments, and what the future
investment return on the fund will be?
A. The actuary is trained to assess the most likely values for all these
parameters. Besides which, the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of
Actuaries, the professional actuarial bodies in the UK, have laid down
guidelines for calculating transfer values. Nevertheless, there is
considerable scope for individual actuaries to use their professional
judgment in calculating transfer values. As such, there is considerable
variation in calculated transfer values for the same deferred pension
because actuaries have different views on investment returns, mortality and
pension increases.
Q. How do I find out the amount of my transfer value?
A. You simply ask your pension department for a quotation. If there are mass
redundancies, it might take a while to receive it.
A point to remember is that transfer values will vary in amount, down as
well as up, as investment conditions change. The quotation should give a
date up to which the quotation is valid.
Q. If I take the transfer value, what do I do with it?
A. What you cannot do is take the cash. You have to tell the trustees where
you want it invested; then, they will do the transaction on your behalf.
You can invest the transfer value in a protected rights personal pension or
a Section 32 buy-out from a life company. The choice between the two
contracts is meaningful only for very large transfer values.
For the vast majority of transfers, you would invest in a personal pension.
Q. How does a protected rights personal pension function?
A. A personal pension operates on what is known as the money purchase
principle. This means that:
1. The life company takes the amount of the transfer value, deducts its
charges, and invests the balance in a fund(s) of your choice.
2. The fund accumulates in value until the time when you take the benefits.
3. You take these by using the accumulated cash to buy an annuity.
Q. How much of the transfer value will the life company take in charges?
A. Initially, around 5-6 per cent. Then, there will be an annual charge on
the fund. This might, or might not, be specified.
Q. In which funds can I invest the personal pension?
A. You have a wide choice of funds - UK and overseas equities, gilts and
fixed-interest, property, cash - and you can divide the value between the
funds. Alternatively, you can leave it to the life company by investing in
the managed fund, or, if it is a traditional life company, in the
with-profits fund.
Q. When can I take the benefits and in what form?
A. Your transfer value is divided into two parts: the protected rights and
the excess. The benefits on the protected rights element, representing the
Serps contracted-out element, have to be taken at state pension age. The
accumulated fund is used to buy an annuity on a uni-sex, uni-status basis,
increasing by 3 per cent a year.
Benefits on the excess element can be taken, wholly or in part, at any time
between your 50th and 75th birthday (both dates inclusive). Up to 25 per
cent of the combined value (protected rights and excess) can be taken in
tax-free cash, provided it can be taken from the accumulated value of the
excess. The remaining value of the excess has to be used to buy an annuity
of your choice.
Q. How do I decide whether to leave the benefits in the company scheme or
transfer to a personal pension?
A. Company schemes provide guaranteed benefits in terms of your salary at
the time of leaving, with a degree of protection against inflation both up
to and after retirement. If the scheme has a record of protecting benefits
fully against inflation, as with the public sector schemes and those in
nationalised industries (present and previous), then you should not usually
transfer.
The personal pension provides the chance to have your own pension
arrangement, manage your own investment, and take part of the benefits at a
time of your choosing. But things can go wrong, particularly with the
investment, and there are the charges deducted by the life company.
Q. Is there any means of comparing benefits?
A. The life company will produce a transfer value analysis which indicates
the overall investment return needed for the personal pension to match the
company scheme benefits. You have to decide if your choice of funds, and the
life company's investment performance, can better that return. But the
analysis is produced by the life company actuary and is subject to as much
uncertainty as the transfer value calculation.
Q. What questions should I ask the salesman?
A. First, ask why he is recommending a transfer and get the reasons in
writing. Be sure they are sound and feasible. Second, make certain you know
why the salesman thinks the life company can achieve the required investment
return.
If you are still comparatively young, the pension provided from the company
scheme or the personal pension will be a minor part of your total pension.
You can afford to take the risk in getting a higher return from a personal
pension while securing the greater part of your overall pension from other,
more stable sources.
If you are older, though, this pension will form a much larger part of your
overall income in retirement. So be wary of taking chances with it unless
you are prepared to accept the consequences.
Q. Do I have to decide now whether to transfer?
No. You do not have to make a decision at the time of leaving employment.
So, you can leave the benefits in the company scheme and transfer into a
personal pension later.
You have a legal right to transfer at any time up to one year before the
scheme's retirement age. Many schemes will allow transfers right up to
retirement.
But do not transfer simply because you feel bitter against your old employer
and everything connected with your previous employment. Consider
transferring on financial grounds only.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: A problem of pressure - Joanna
Slaughter sums up her series on fee-based financial advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Norton, the chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, has
likened the fees versus commission debate to the M25 London orbital
motorway. He says: 'You go round and round in circles, not getting
anywhere.'
Certainly, views seem to be entrenched. The fee-based independent advisers
who have been profiled in the past 15 weeks run very different financial
planning firms. But, in general, they are united in believing that consumers
can get genuinely unbiased advice only when an adviser is under no financial
pressure to sell commission-laden insurance and investment products.
Many of the fee-based advisers interviewed identified commissions as causing
much of the malaise within the financial services industry.
They feel they are in the industry vanguard, not least because the new
commission disclosure rules laid down by the Securities and Investments
Board - the industry's main regulatory organisation - look set to accelerate
the move towards fee-based advice.
'Our time has come,' claims Tony Shepherd, a fee-based IFA from Kent.
'Commission disclosure will act as a catalyst. I see the independent sector
diminishing and the more sophisticated end of the IFA market becoming
fee-based.'
Like other IFAs, though, Shepherd stresses that fee-based firms must do more
than sell financial products if they are to justify their charges.
Another is Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services. 'Our only function
is to provide clients with added value,' he says.
'We are no different from an accountant or a solicitor. And it can't be all
smoke and mirrors. Our businesses will fail if the client does not perceive
that we are adding something.'
Many IFAs feel added value goes hand in hand with professional
qualifications. They argue that the public will not accept IFAs as members
of a profession until the industry sets and enforces higher standards.
Indeed, David Harris, managing director of Chantrey Financial Services,
requires his advisers to acquire qualifications as part of their service
contracts.
Commission-based advisers tend to defend their position by claiming there is
widespread consumer resistance to paying fees for financial advice. Some
have pointed out that many of the fee-based advisers interviewed in the FT
series run comparatively modest businesses; this reinforces their view that
the audience for fee-based advice has a narrow base.
They argue, too, that as fee-based advice can cost up to Pounds 200 an hour,
it is often beyond the financial reach of many people. Few fee-based
advisers would deny this, but none appears yet to have solved the problem of
bringing impartial advice, at an affordable price, to small savers and
investors.
The tax regime also buttresses the status quo of commissions. They are
exempt from value added tax but professional fees are not. Thus, it could be
in the interest of clients for the fee-based adviser to take commissions,
even if these are offset against fees later.
Andrew Swallow, a fee-based IFA in Ipswich, says: 'Going to a fee-based
financial adviser might be best, but there are occasions when the client
should persuade him to take some commissions.'
Most fee-based advisers think it inevitable that the industry will become
polarised, with the better-off serviced by fee-based advisers while those
with low incomes and modest assets are left largely to the care of
bancassurers - those who sell insurance-related products through banks and
building societies.
Nevertheless, many claim that IFAs who rely on commission may under-estimate
the public appetite for impartial fee-based advice. They cite the Institute
of Financial Planning, which publishes a registry of its members and is
trying at present to cope with a backlog of 300 inquiries from the public.
Other sources of help for those seeking a fee-based IFA include Money
Management magazine, which can provide a list of advisers in different areas
of the UK who conduct at least part of their business on a fee basis; and
the Association of Solicitor Investment Managers, which has a directory of
members who undertake investment management and other financial services.

<TEXT>
It is rash to assume that a fee-based adviser is automatically a good
adviser, writes Joanna Slaughter. Indeed, people should be very careful
before placing their affairs in the hands of any IFA. The following
questions could help:
1. What is the background of those running this firm? What are their
qualifications to advise me about money?
2. Can you supply the names of anyone to whom I can apply for a reference
about you?
3. How much do you charge? Are fees agreed in advance? Are fees time-based?
Will you charge me for the initial interview? How will I be billed? What
happens about any commission payments?
4. Can I see an example of a financial planning report that has been
prepared for an existing client?
5. How can I judge the investment performance you have achieved for clients?
If there are no relevant performance statistics, can I see a current client
port-folio?
6. How will you keep in touch with me? What information will I get from you
during the year? What happens if my financial circumstances change?
7. Will all your advice be confirmed in writing?
8. Do you provide a complete management of assets? What other services do
you offer? Will you liaise with my accountant and solicitor?
9. Do you handle cash? If so, what safeguards do I have that it is secure?
Do you have indemnity insurance?
10. How quickly can we terminate our relationship if it does not work out?

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Don't lose out on holiday - Bethan
Hutton outlines the points to watch when buying travel insurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Why was it, one experienced travel insurer mused the other day, that when a
claim was submitted for missing luggage, it always turned out that the
suitcase was full of Calvin Klein and Janet Reger designer underwear rather
than the plain Marks and Spencer smalls you might expect to find?
And was it not strange, he continued, that so many people had their hi-tech
cameras, gold Rolex watches and remaining travellers cheques stolen on the
last day of their holiday, did not have time to report the theft to police,
and then could not find the original receipts?
Fraud is an issue pre-occupying the insurance industry. Many companies
suspect - rightly or wrongly - that a hard core of people view submitting an
insurance claim as a normal part of returning from holiday, along with
sending off the snaps to be processed and displaying the latest souvenir on
the mantelpiece. This could be pushing up premiums for honest customers.
While it is difficult for insurers to prove that someone's expensive camera
is not in the hands of a thief, they can have their doubts - and,
increasingly, such a claim is likely to be turned down unless the claimant
can provide police certificates and original receipts. This can catch
genuine claimants unawares. So, if you do have something stolen on holiday,
make sure you get as much evidence for it on the spot as possible.
New technology is also helping to stamp out fraud. Within the next year or
so, insurers will be able to check dubious cases against a database to find
out if the same person has had a run of 'bad luck' for the past few summer
holidays.
Travel insurance does not cover you for carelessness. One of the most common
claims is for possessions stolen from beach bags while the owner was
swimming.
These days, such claims often are rejected due to 'lack of reasonable care'
 -a clause you are almost certain to find if you study the small print
carefully.
The best advice is to travel light, and dress simply, leaving all valuable
items such as jewellery and watches at home or in the hotel safe. But the
insurance ombudsman has ruled against companies applying this rule too
strictly, on the basis that you cannot be expected to go everywhere
empty-handed.
Cover for personal possessions accounts for a substantial proportion of the
cost of insurance premiums. Yet, many people may be paying twice over for
items which are covered already.
Most comprehensive household contents policies already provide a certain
amount of cover for possessions taken away from the home; usually, that can
be extended further for less than a travel insurer would charge.
This is particularly true for large, expensive items such as camcorders.
Travel insurance policies tend to have a single item limit of around Pounds
300, which rules out all but the most basic camcorder, but household
insurers normally are quite happy to cover big-ticket items.
Bradford &amp; Bingley building society has acknowledged this with its range of
travel insurance policies; these offer a 20 per cent discount if you opt out
of baggage cover because your household insurance already covers it.
Frizzell divides its policy into sections, so you are not obliged to take
the baggage and cash cover. Other insurers may soon follow.
Most travel insurance continues to be sold through travel agents, who tack
it on as an extra when you book your holiday. New rules mean that tour
operators can oblige you to take out insurance. It does not have to be
theirs, but they can insist that any alternative offers at least equivalent
cover.
Often, though, tour operators' own insurance is poor value. More than half
the premium can disappear in commission, and the maximum cover for
possessions or cancellation can be lower than independent policies.
You should, if you have time, shop around before you book the holiday. And
do not think of just the usual sources. Brokers, banks and building
societies all can sell you something - but have you thought of checking what
your private health insurer has to offer?
Gold card-holders should also check what level of cover they get for their
annual fee. Some cards, such as Barclays, have fully comprehensive annual
insurance but others provide only a few elements - travel accident,
cancellation and delay only, for example, without the crucial medical cover.
Also worth considering is annual travel insurance. Halifax is the latest on
the market, with Lloyds Bank planning to launch its version next month.
Policies can cover individuals, couples or families. For anyone who goes
abroad more than once a year, they are likely to be better value than
single-trip cover, as well as being more convenient.
They can even be cheaper for just one holiday. Take a family of two adults
and two children spending two weeks in America with Lloyds. Single-trip
cover would cost Pounds 155.60 but the new annual policy would cost Pounds
126.25 for the same family and cover it for any number of other trips as
well.
The table gives an indication of the general range of prices, but, of
course, details of cover vary, so assiduous reading of the small print is
still a good idea. If, for instance, you are going on an expensive
inter-continental trip, check that the policy covers the full cost of
cancellation - limits can be as low as Pounds 1,000 on budget policies.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: So you want a 10% return - Michael
Dyson explains how
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mail-shot headline offered '10.03% paid annually, free of basic rate of
tax, until the year 2000'. Such a promise, together with 'Backing Assets of
a Triple A-rated bank' sounded the perfect answer for investors wanting high
income from a low-risk investment.
Sadly, this insurance 'bond' (as the marketing men insist on calling their
products) is linked to the performance of the FT-SE 100 index for
determining how much capital is repaid in the year 2000. If the FT-SE 100
growth is 0 per cent a year or negative, investors will lose 75 per cent of
their original investment (a loss of almost 15 per cent even if you add back
the income received). In order to receive full repayment of your capital,
the FT-SE 100 growth must be 4.99 to 9.99 per cent a year.
So, is it unrealistic to expect 10 per cent a year and reasonably safe
capital? The answer is that it is remarkably easy, and within the reach of
most private investors.
The plan in the following example can be created through any broker or share
shop, and should return 10 per cent a year in addition to a final repayment
of around 95 per cent of starting capital.
A greater loss could arise, but is unlikely unless markets are about 30 per
lower than present levels when you want your income. The only caveats are
that you need to have part of your annual capital gains tax allowance (now
Pounds 5,800) available each year and take care with bed and breakfasting.
Suppose you have Pounds 15,000 to invest. You buy six separate zero dividend
preference (ZDP) shares with wind-up dates on consecutive anniversaries (or
as close as possible). These shares are issued by split capital investment
trusts which have pre-determined wind-up dates on which all the assets are
sold and the shareholders repaid. The ZDP investors receive no dividends
from the trust but normally have a first charge over the assets up to a
pre-determined repayment price, substantially higher than the issue price.
So, a capital gain is virtually certain for anyone holding to redemption.
The point of the plan is to buy shares with staggered redemption dates which
can be redeemed in turn to produce your 'income'.
Present tax legislation means that because there are no dividends, there is
no income tax liability, although the CGT liability becomes payable on
redemption or disposal. Both your annual 'income' and your final return of
capital will produce taxable gains, albeit reduced by indexation. Larger
holdings will benefit from some prudent bed and breakfasts on the main
holding.
The number of shares bought should be the amount required to create an
annual repayment for the desired 'income' - in this example, Pounds 1,500.
One of the investments - the one which is redeemed last - should be large
enough to repay 10 per cent plus as much of the original capital as
possible. (In our example, you get 97 per cent of your starting capital back
but should allow around 2 per cent for expenses).
And that is all there is to it.
For the purpose of this article, we chose the six shares that best match the
described insurance product, but the take-over theory is extremely flexible
and can offer many alternative arrangements - such as escalating income,
income holidays or a different time scale. In addition, all or part of the
plan may be sold before maturity, subject to market conditions).

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The strange story of Japan's unit
trusts - John Cuthbert analyses the reasons for a market phenomenon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CUTHBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something extraordinary has happened in the Japan unit trust sector over the
past five years. Since 1989, the sector has - on the face of it -
outperformed the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) index regardless of whether the
Japanese market rose or fell (see top chart). No fewer than 60 of 62 Japan
trusts beat the TSE over the period.
How has this happened? There are three reasons.
First, Japan funds have done better since 1989 for the simple reason that
they did less well previously.
Between 1986 and end-1989, Japan unit trust managers avoided the
highly-valued fashionable plays - so beloved by the locals - that lifted the
TSE to a new high. When the crash hit the Japanese market at the end of
1989, the highly-valued high-flyers that had driven up the TSE pre-crash
became the laggards which then dragged it down.
Avoiding these types of stocks had led to underperformance for Japan funds
in a bull phase. Now, it meant outperformance in a bear market. Over the 30
months the crash lasted, the average Japan fund fell 45.6 per cent against a
fall in the TSE of 58.6 per cent.
Second, a lot of Japan funds have taken considerable advantage of the high
returns from the burgeoning over-the-counter (OTC) market in small
capitalisation stocks.
Japanese investors usually ignore these. But in a market where the average
earnings of large cap stocks have fallen four years in a row, it is
surprising that the positive earnings of small cap stocks have moved more to
centre stage.
The fact that small cap exposure of Japan funds has risen dramatically, and
fund returns with it - the average discrete total return of the eight Japan
small company trusts with five-year records to February 28 1994 (79.27 per
cent) is almost twice that of the 48 growth funds (40.9 per cent) over the
same period - says much about why a performance comparison of the Japan
sector with the TSE, an essentially large cap index, can be misleading.
Third, and most important, is that any reading of the past five years of
performance history is dominated by the effects of the 1989-92 crash. . Yet,
it is quite clear from our top chart that the past five years have covered
two quite different periods of performance - one of sustained loss, the
other of sustained gain. Decoupling these provides a very different picture
of performance altogether.
The bottom chart shows the sector's performance relative to the TSE from the
beginning of the period of gain at the end of June 1992. This time round,
the sector has underperformed the TSE, rather than the reverse.
This finding has two important implications. First, it warns investors to be
on their guard. It is all too easy for most established Japan funds to puff
up their five-year performance by using a cumulative performance chart
relative to the TSE, as we did at the start of this article.
Normally, this would be acceptable. But when virtually the whole sector has
beaten the TSE - something which is not normal - then it becomes a highly
devalued meter of performance assessment. Then again, our reading of
Japanese investment history suggests that placing equal emphasis upon loss
management, as well as upon total return, is of special importance in
judging the performance of Japan unit trusts. Moreover, having two periods
of markedly different conditions - one of loss and one of gain - provides us
with a robust means of testing if Japan fund managers have all-weather
managerial abilities.
Look at Table A. Here, we have taken the upper quartile of the sector on a
five-year, risk-adjusted return basis and then split it into its individual
investment orientations - small cap, growth and technology/special
situations - to allow better performance comparisons.
Column 1 of this table shows the negative total return, or crash loss.
Column 2 shows the percentile rank of each fund's crash loss (1 is the
highest and 100 the smallest).
Column 3 then shows the percentile rank of each fund's total return - this
time, a gain - from the end of the crash period to the end of February,
1994. The final column, percentile change, illustrates the degree to which a
manager has been better at managing growth or loss relative to the rest of
the sector.
The conclusion based on this table is quite different to that derived from a
comparison with the TSE. Far from making the whole sector look good, this
approach finds only four funds - Dunedin Japan Smaller Companies, Perpetual
Japanese Growth, Gartmore Japan and Provident Mutual Japan - which have
displayed top-quartile performance in both periods of loss and gain.
Furthermore, the overall performances of many funds are dominated by an
outstanding outturn in only one field. In simple terms, most managers tend
to be better at managing one thing rather than another.
Two further funds deserve recognition. Although their total returns in the
gain period have been fourth and sixth decile respectively, Schroder Japan
Small Companies and Stewart Ivory Japan are among the very best when the
returns are risk-adjusted (see table B). This is no surprise; they are two
of the top four loss return funds and have displayed high consistency
relative to the TSE.
Finding the best-performing Japan funds is full of pitfalls. At first look,
investors appear spoilt for choice. But wholesale outperformance of the
market index is a sign that something is wrong.
In any one sector, expect to find only a handful of funds that deserve your
attentions.

KEY: The table compares total return performances for the top quartile
of risk-adjusted return funds over two distinct periods - one of
sustained gain, and one of sustained loss. The percentile* rank of each
fund's loss and gain return are shown in columns three and four
respectively from the left. The percentile rank expresses each fund's
position in its sector as a proportion of 100 where the top fund is 1
and the bottom is 100. This makes it easier to see quartile (units of
25) and decile (units of 10) positions. The percentile rank of NM Japan
Smaller Companies crash loss of 26, for instance, says that it is in
the top 26 per cent, namely, just outside the top quartile (25 per
cent) or third decile. Changes in percentile rank for the loss and gain
returns reflect the relative strength of each manager's loss and growth
management performance; that is relative to the sector also. Total
returns: HSW. All calculations: JP Cuthbert.

KEY: Years are Feb 28 to Feb 28. Total return is the sum of period to
period figures, thus removing cumulative effect. Therefore, the sum of
the five-year figures does not equal the five-year total. For the one
year, it is the sum of 12 months offer-to-offer, net income re-invested;
for five years (total), it is 60 month-on-month periods of
offer-to-offer, net income re-invested. Source: HSW. The Benchmark
column is a measure of a fund's consistency relative to the stated
index. Two indices have been chosen to reflect the different investment
orientations of funds. A negative figure in this column means
underperformance. The figure in bold in the total row is the benchmark
ratio - each fund's total return divided by the index's return. Risk is
total risk or volatility as measured by the standard deviation of
monthly returns. Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard
deviation divided by the standard deviation of the 62 funds (the sector)
that qualify for this survey (8.23). Risk description refers to risk
relative to the sector figure of 8.23. Risk/return is the division of
each fund's average monthly return by the standard deviation of those
monthly returns. The higher the risk/return figure, the better the
performance. All calculations: JP Cuthbert.  * Capital return only, no
income re-invested.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The true costs of investing - Where
your money goes . . . unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is taking the lead in forcing financial companies to disclose
their true costs. High charges nibble away your profits and they are not
always easy to spot unaided.
Low charges will never make up for a bad investment performance, but high
charges can seriously damage even a good investment performance. Our new
series shows you how to check out the costs before you have tied up your
money. We explain:
What all the different costs are.
What the standard charges are for different types of investment.
Where to find the figures you need. And we provide a cost check-list for
your own use.
We will be covering all the major types of investment: unit trusts,
investment trusts, personal equity plans, shares, life insurance and
pensions.
The series begins this week with unit trusts. Next week, we cover investment
trusts.
                         *      *      *
Unit trusts can be a cheap way to buy investment expertise and spread risk
across a range of shares, especially where small sums of money are
concerned. Investing directly in shares can be expensive, not least because
of high minimum dealing costs. But unit trusts should cost less than direct
share investment because of the economies of scale which fund managers have.
The basic charges
When the money is not working for you, here is where it goes. The annual
management charge is the easiest to spot. It can be as low as 0.5 per cent
(for some indexed funds and bond funds) or a more typical 1 to 1.5 per cent
 -and, occasionally, more than 1.5 per cent.
With a 1.5 per cent charge, Pounds 15 will be deducted for every Pounds
1,000 of the value of your units once a year. In practice, a lower charge
could be deducted more often - for example, half the annual charge twice a
year, or one-12th every month.
The initial charge is more complicated. It is, typically, 5 to 6 per cent of
the money you put into the trust. On an investment of Pounds 1,000,
therefore, the charge would be Pounds 50 to Pounds 60.
Around three percentage points (ie, Pounds 30 of that Pounds 50 or Pounds
60) might be used to pay commission to the intermediaries who sell the
trust. For this reason, the initial charge is the one cost you might be able
to reduce.
If you buy units through a commission-based adviser, you can try to
negotiate a cut in the commission he takes - which would leave more money to
buy units. Similarly, you might be able to negotiate a reduction if you buy
direct from the management company. The more you have to invest, the more
chance of success in negotiating a reduction.
The bid/offer spread is a better way of measuring the initial costs of
investing than the quoted initial charge. You buy units at the offer price
and sell them at the bid price. The difference between the two is the
spread, which can vary greatly from one type of trust to the other.
The spread includes the initial charge. But while that might be 5 per cent,
the spread can be higher - perhaps nearer 6 per cent, or more. This is
because, on top of the initial charge, the fund manager adds the dealing
costs which he incurs when buying and selling shares, including the spread
on the underlying shares. And the unit trust spread can get slightly wider
or narrower, depending on market conditions.
There is another complication. Bid/offer spreads are allowed to move within
a broader range of, for example, 8 per cent: in other words, the maximum
permitted offer price could be 8 per cent higher than the minimum permitted
bid price. So, the buying price could be at the top of the overall 8 per
cent range, with the selling price 6 per cent lower; or the selling price
could be at the bottom of the overall range of 8 per cent, with the buying
price 6 per cent higher.
Fund managers will move to the lower end of the range if lots of investors
are selling, but go higher if there are lots of buyers.
New charging structures
Unit trusts are restricted in how they can charge investors. But the rules
are under review, and it is possible that a single pricing structure could
be introduced soon. So-called single pricing might not save investors any
money, but it could make it easier to spot the charges.
Meanwhile, some management companies have found ways round the unit trust
rules by experimenting with Pep charges. The main innovation, first brought
in by Fidelity, is to reduce the initial charge to around 2 per cent but to
add an exit charge if you cash in early. Fidelity charges 3 per cent in year
one, reducing to 0 per cent in year four - so loyalty is rewarded.
How to find the charges
You should be able to find details of charges in sales leaflets. Sometimes,
though, they may be buried right at the back of a leaflet among the small
print.
Bid/offer spreads also are more likely to be found there. It is probably
wise to ask an adviser or the management company what the usual spread has
been. Find out, also, the extent to which the spread has moved within the
broader permissible range.
The prices' pages in the Financial Times give bid and offer prices as well
as cancellation prices. These are the lowest bid price allowed taking
account of the trust's assets.
If cancellation and bid prices are the same, the spread is at the bottom end
of the broader range. Sellers will be getting the lowest possible cash-in
price for their units, but buyers will get relatively cheap units.
The effect of charges
Take two funds, Gartmore British Growth and Gartmore UK Equity Income, in
which Pounds 10,000 was invested five years ago. The annual charge is 1.5
per cent each. Assuming all dividends have been re-invested, the value when
we did our test was:
Five years zero charges: British Growth Pounds 24,270;UK Equity Income
Pounds 18,862.
Annual charges, but no bid/offer spread (offer to offer basis): British
Growth Pounds 22,590; UK Equity Income Pounds 17,330.
Actual returns (offer to bid basis): British Growth Pounds 21,100; UK Equity
Income Pounds 16,200.
The managers of these funds would need to increase the value of investments
by around 6.5 per cent for the investors simply to get back the money they
invest.
How long it would take to reach that stand-still point depends very much on
how fast markets are rising.
Do costs matter?
Some people argue that costs are irrelevant. What counts is performance.
Choose fund managers who put more money consistently into the hands of their
unit-holders. It does not matter that they may also be making more for
themselves along the way.
In practice, though, charges cannot be ignored completely. The higher the
charges, the greater the skill a manager needs to turn in a decent profit.
And if you end up holding the same fund for five to 10 years or more,
initial charges may have less impact on the overall return than the annual
charge.
Certainly, if you choose an income fund because you want income (and do not
want to re-invest dividends), think twice before choosing one with a high
annual charge.
Consider, too, that even if a fund rises in value, investors get the same
amount of money in their hands whether 3 per cent is taken off at the
beginning or the end.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: 3i takes off - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of 3i, the UK's largest venture capital supplier, as an
investment trust is now firmly on the launch pad, writes Richard Gourlay.
The group said a quarter of the shares it is selling in the planned summer
flotation are likely to be made available for private investors. The high
street banks and the Bank of England, which own 3i, are likely to sell only
about a third of the equity for about Pounds 500m.
Details are still scarce ahead of the publication of a pathfinder prospectus
later this month and the public offer by the end of June. But the price is
likely to be based on a discount to the net asset value due to be published
with annual results later this month.
The flotation will be not only the largest but one of the most interesting
new issues available to private investors this year. 3i will provide one of
the few ways for individuals to invest in a relatively liquid way in a
well-diversified portfolio of unlisted companies. The group provides equity,
debt and mezzanine finance to unquoted companies seeking expansion capital,
funds for management buy-outs and buy-ins, and start-ups.
Earlier this year, 3i also started managing and investing funds provided by
other financial institutions. This will increasingly provide 3i with fees,
raising its return on assets.
                            *      *      *
Investors are being offered another slice of London property. But the
unusual feature of the intermediaries' offer for shares in CLS Holdings is
that those interested can buy in at 15 per cent below the estimated value of
the company, writes Simon Davies.
CLS is a property investment concern with a 10-year track record. Run by the
two Mortstedt brothers, who switched from Swedish to British properties
early in the 1980s, it made an astute call on the market in 1989 and was
able to gear up investment at lower prices last year.
The company is offering 45.04m new shares at 111p, representing 46 per cent
of the company, at a value of Pounds 50m. But a maximum of half of these
shares are on offer through intermediaries. The shares offer a notional
yield of 5.5 per cent at the issue price.
Most of the company's properties are within the M25 and are forecast to
provide net rental income of Pounds 25m in the present year. Pre-tax profits
should reach Pounds 8m.
The issue is sponsored by UBS and Apax partners and applications must be in
by noon on May 23. Trading should start on May 27.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Timing it right - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac, the construction giant, announced final results at the end of April.
The figures were dragged down by a larger than expected FRS3 loss. Following
the disposal of several businesses, though, the remaining core has been
performing well.
Sir Anthony Bamford is a non-executive director who has been notable for his
strong sense of timing in the past. Prior to the disposal, he bought stock
at 70p. His most recent purchase of 250,000 shares at 171p takes his holding
to more than 1m. James Dickie, the Scottish engineering firm, has seen its
share price rise steadily over the past few years. The prospects for the
group are still very good as gearing is brought down. The sale by Joseph
Grimmond, the chief executive, of such a large amount of stock has a special
explanation. The group felt it lacked institutional shareholders and was
keen to benefit from the support that they can bring. Accordingly, Grimmond
sold what amounted to 7.8 per cent of the stock to M&amp;G Group.
Trinity Holdings makes components for fire engines and rubbish trucks. It
announced good final results at the end of April and the share price has
been outperforming the market. Three directors have sold stock recently. The
largest sale, by chairman Geoffrey Hollyhead, was made for domestic reasons.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Bass brew goes flat - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The results season for brewers gets into full swing this week, with full
year figures from Whitbread on Monday, Allied-Lyons on Tuesday, and interims
from Bass on Wednesday. A common theme is likely to be that brewing and
old-fashioned basic pubs are still doing badly, while pubs relying more on
food and leisure are thriving.
The worst figures from the trio are, therefore, likely to come from Bass,
the UK's biggest brewer and also an enormous pub operator. Against Pounds
229m last year, pre-tax profits this time could be flat or even slightly
down.
Whitbread is expected to do better, with pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds
232m against Pounds 220m before exceptionals last time. Again, profits from
beer and tenanted pubs should be down, but Whitbread is particularly strong
on more up-market, restaurant-type outlets.
Allied's figures will take a little interpreting since this will be the
first full year to show the effects of its brewing joint venture with
Carlsberg. The market will be alert for any suggestions that Allied is
closer to extricating itself from the venture which, it has hinted already,
does not fit its overall strategy.
The actual pre-tax figure is not a matter of debate since it was forecast at
Pounds 630m at the time of Allied's deal with Domecq in March. This compares
with Pounds 542m ' again before exceptionals ' the year before.
Shareholders will be interested to find out how much the US Peabody coal
dispute has cost Hanson, which announces interims on Tuesday; estimates
hover around Pounds 80m. The conglomerate's profits figure - stripping out
the strike costs - should be between Pounds 580m and Pounds 675m pre-tax, up
from Pounds 507m. But it is thought the quarterly dividend will be held at
2.85p.
National Power, the UK's largest generator, is expected to increase pre-tax
profits by at least 14 per cent from 1992-93's Pounds 580m when it announces
its results on Wednesday. Dividend expectations are around 12.2p, against
10.6p.
The City will be looking for indications as to how the company is
progressing with the potential sale of three to four gigawatts of generating
plant following a deal with the industry regulator in February. There are no
indications of an early disposal.
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits for British Telecommunications of
around Pounds 2.7bn when chairman Sir Iain Vallance announces its full-year
results on Thursday. That represents a 40 per cent increase on last year
(Pounds 1.9bn). But taking account of last year's exceptional items, the
increase comes down to a more modest 2 per cent. Strong competition from
Mercury and the cable companies has restricted growth. Earnings per share
are expected to be around 29p, against 19.8p last year before exceptionals.
Burton, the UK fashion retail group which includes such names as Debenhams,
Top Man and Top Shop, Burtons and Principles, is expected on Thursday to
report an increase in reported pre-tax profits, after exceptional items,
from Pounds 30m to about Pounds 35m - but a fall in underlying profits. As
last year's figure was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 11.9m to cover
the costs of the move towards greater part-time working, pre-tax profits
will actually have fallen.
First-quarter results from British Gas, due on Thursday, are expected to
reflect the profits' warning issued by Richard Giordano, chairman, at the
annual general meeting last month. He warned that profits were 'likely to be
at a similar level' to the first quarter last year, when earnings were
Pounds 650m. Analysts expect that a continuing loss of market share in the
mainly commercial segment above 2,500 therms to independent gas marketers
will offset any benefits that would normally be expected after a
particularly cold winter.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Small - but growing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese investment trust sector is small but has been expanding rapidly
this year. A new smaller companies trust, Fidelity Japanese Values, pulled
in Pounds 105m while a conversion share issue by the long-established
Fleming Japanese fund raised Pounds 162m in February.
Now, another existing smaller companies fund, Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon,
is trying to raise new capital and Schroders is launching a new general
fund, Schroder Japan Growth.
New issues are popular now because existing trusts have mostly been trading
at premiums to net asset value. This means you pay more for the shares than
their assets are worth, as well as paying dealing charges.
If you buy a new issue, you pay only the issue expenses, which rarely amount
to more than 4 per cent. So, if an existing trust is at more than a 4 per
cent premium, a new issue looks cheap.
There are good arguments against buying investment trust shares at a
premium. Premiums result from surges in demand and are, generally,
short-lived phenomena.
If you buy a trust at a 10 per cent premium, it might have dropped to a more
normal 5 per cent discount a few months later. Even if the fund's underlying
asset performance is good, this still means your profits are eroded by about
15 per cent.
Recent research by broker Credit Lyonnais Laing found that Japanese trusts
bought at a premium underperformed the market consistently. The firm picked
two trusts and tracked them over a year, following any period when they were
at a premium. It found the share prices underperformed by an average of 18.1
per cent and 9.9 per cent over the 12 months.
What, then, do you do if you think Japan looks a good bet but (a) are not
keen on new issues and (b) the investment trust run by the manager you like
is carrying a hefty premium? The answer is to check whether the manager also
has a Japanese unit trust under his wing. Most do.
Schroder, for instance, has several Japanese unit trusts with a good track
record. The connection between trusts is not always obvious: the Save &amp;
Prosper unit trust is run by the same group as the Fleming Japanese
investment trust.
When investment trusts are at a reasonable discount, you would generally do
better to buy them than a unit trust; when investment trust shares rise much
above asset value, the reverse is probably true. Unfortunately, because of
initial charges and dealing costs, frequent arbitrage between the two is
expensive for most private investors.
Nigel Sidebottom, an investment trust specialist with broker Gerrard Vivien
Gray, also warns that it is not always easy to tell when a trust is at a
large premium - there is more to it, he says, than the basic discount or
premium to net asset value published in the FT every day.
Most Japanese investment trusts also issue warrants which, at some future
point, can make a substantial call on the assets of the trust, so diluting
the entitlement of ordinary shareholders.
Sidebottom suspects that the market does not price this future dilution
fully into the ordinary shares. To get a full share of the trust's capital
growth, you would have to buy a combination of warrants and ordinary shares.
When the premium for the package is recalculated, it can be far higher than
the printed figure would suggest - an ostensible 3 or 4 per cent premium can
turn out to be nearer 16 per cent, which is too expensive by most measures.
Thus, Sidebottom is very careful in his choice of Japanese trusts, looking
at new issues in a particularly favourable light as well as considering the
alternative of unit trusts.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Foreigners keep the whip hand in
Tokyo - Neil Kerr looks at the continuing conflict between bulls and
sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL KERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tug of war in the Tokyo stock market continues. On the one hand are the
international funds, for the most part very bullish, which have invested
Dollars 40bn net so far this year (against Dollars 30bn in the whole of
1993). On the other are sceptical domestic investors, whether individual,
corporate or institutional. On balance, they are sellers of shares.
The conflict shows no signs of an early resolution. So far this year, the
market's rise of 10 per cent (18 per cent in sterling terms) represents a
handsome outperformance of all major world markets. The foreigners still
have the whip hand.
Just how long their nerve would hold if the yen/dollar exchange rate were to
fall below 100 for any length of time is the big question. That is because
the bulls' main assumption centres on an economic recovery after almost
three years of accelerating downturn (last year's rise of a minuscule 0.1
per cent in gross domestic product was the worst performance since 1974).
The key to recovery is domestic consumption. Rising real incomes are
expected to support increased consumer spending and residential investment,
while public investment remains exceptionally strong as a result of the
government's previous pump-priming measures. Consequently, consensus
estimates of economic growth are edging up, to around 1 per cent this year
and 2 per cent-plus next.
These bets would be in jeopardy if the yen - which, by most fundamental
measures, is already at least 20 per cent over-valued against the dollar -
were to be forced even higher. The depressed export sector would be crushed
further and the still-fragile recovery in domestic consumption might be
unable to withstand this latest in a series of deflationary shocks.
The optimists, however, see this currency threat as transitory. The yen's 13
per cent rise this year has been essentially political, prompted by the
trade dispute with the US over Japan's enormous current account surplus
(Dollars 131bn in 1993). But this surplus is expected to decline sharply
because of the yen's total 25 per cent appreciation since the beginning of
1993.
What is more, despite the instability of the Japanese government, the bulls
take more or less for granted that an agreement will be reached with the US
eventually. This will involve the much-discussed radical deregulation of the
domestic Japanese market (involving greater access for American goods and
services) and continued measures to stimulate the Japanese economy.
Such a programme is in the evident interests of both parties. The
alternative - a trade war which, among other things, would threaten a
collapse of the US bond market as Japanese capital was repatriated - is
almost unimaginable.
On this sanguine reading, Japanese-American accord should accelerate the
forces already working for a more realistic valuation of the yen. Not only
is Japan's current account surplus past its peak, but the present sharp
upward moves in US interest rates will stem the capital outflows from New
York which have so undermined the dollar in recent months.
The fact that the US administration is now alert to the perils of its
undervalued currency (and is prepared to put its money where its mouth is)
further confirms the bulls of the Tokyo market in their economic optimism.
If you accept the key assumption that the Japanese economy is in the early
stages of a sustained recovery, then rationalisations of Tokyo's present
stock market valuations demand only a modest suspension of disbelief. After
the 60 per cent or so decline in corporate earnings over the past three
distressed years, the historic 1993/94 p/e multiple for the Tokyo market is
around 85. The dividend yield is a shade under 1 per cent.
Even by Tokyo's traditionally exalted standards, these are very full
valuations, whether in an absolute sense or measured against 10-year bond
yields of 4 per cent (after their rise during the international bond
shake-out) and three-month interest rates of 2 1/4 per cent. Only on a
price/cash flow basis, which allows for such factors as unusually large
depreciation charges, does the Japanese ratio of 10 look attractive on an
international basis.
Yet, the effect of even tentative economic recovery on corporate profits -
now an historically low proportion of national income - could be remarkable.
This is because of the uniquely high operational gearing of Japanese
companies.
Owing to very high fixed and semi-fixed costs, such as wages, even small
improvements in sales will have a magnified impact on profits. Such a
stimulus to sales could come not just from underlying economic recovery but
also from greater monetary relaxation by the Bank of Japan. With an annual
inflation rate of under 1 per cent the case for further reductions in
short-term interest rates is compelling.
Pauline Pong, who runs M&amp;G's flagship Japan fund, is typical of those
portfolio managers who see Tokyo as an outstanding recovery play. In her
view, the potential for strong corporate earnings growth over the next few
years is substantial and 'likely to have been under-estimated by many
analysts'.
Such sentiments cut little ice with most local investors. Their caution
continues to be shaped by the continuing psychological fall-out from the
collapse of the late 1980s' 'bubble economy', and its accompanying
devastation of the financial system.
Domestic confidence is unlikely to return to the stock market until the
economic recovery has acquired tangible shape. The beguiling sales pitch so
popular in the West - which focuses on the fact that the level of the Tokyo
market is still barely half its 1989 peak - still finds few local buyers.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: Robbing Peter to pay Peter - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City stockbrokers are too often mealy-mouthed. So, it is a pleasure to see
Credit Lyonnais Laing's investment trust team biting the hand that feeds it.
'Many investment trusts are over-priced at the moment. Buy the equivalent
unit trust,' is the gist of its message*. The argument is compelling.
Traditionally, most investment trust shares have sold at substantially less
than their underlying asset value - unlike units in unit trusts where the
price is pegged to the asset value. But a long bull market and heavy
marketing have cut the typical investment trust discount from around a
quarter in the mid-1980s to under 5 per cent in February and around 8 per
cent now. In a few cases, shares have actually sold at a premium to the
underlying assets (for example, the Japanese trusts discussed on page III).
The near elimination of the discount has had two consequences. First, trust
shares have risen faster than the stock market, making it simple to sell the
concept of investment trusts to the public. Second, it has been easier to
launch new investment trusts on to the stock market. (While other trust
shares were still selling at big discounts, any new issue promptly
plummetted.)
In theory, trust managers should be exempt from the normal commercial
pressures on new issue promoters. But it is easier to pull in money for a
fund operating in a fashionable area of the stock market. Hence Laing's
second criticism: managers launch funds in markets and sectors which have
the best of their growth behind them and are now over priced.
Like its rival, NatWest, Laing believes that substantial investment trust
discounts will return, sooner or later. So, shares in most trusts are likely
to do worse than the underlying stock market; and those which are still
selling at a premium to asset value, or operating in over-priced sectors,
are likely to do worst.
We would add one point to Laing's charge sheet, however. Even if the
discount itself returns only in a small way, many of the newer trusts now
have a small time bomb ticking away: warrants.
Free warrants - the right to buy shares in the trust at a pre-set price for
a certain period of time - have been one of the main baits used to encourage
investors to buy new trust issues. The warrants acquire intrinsic value only
when the share price rises above the subscription price. But they tend to be
priced quite highly by the stock market, even when new, in the hope that
they will in due course acquire intrinsic value.
So, even if the shares of a new investment trust droop below the issue
price, the managers can point to the market price of the warrants and argue
that the 'package' is holding its value. What they do not point out, though,
is that the investor is being bribed with his own money - or, to be more
precise, the future proceeds of his existing investments.
Assume the trust's investment portfolio and its own shares do well. This
makes it certain that warrant-holders will eventually take up their right to
buy shares cheaply. So, the net asset value of the investor's existing
shares at that time will fall because of these new claims on the underlying
assets.
In effect, the discount which used to eat into share prices at the beginning
of the trust's life has now been replaced by a levy later on. And if, in the
intervening period, substantial discounts to asset value have again become
the norm throughout the trust sector, there will be a second bite on the
value of his shares.
Do these Cassandra-like musings mean that all holders of investment trusts
should immediately sell the lot? Laing argues that anyone with trusts
trading close to, or above, asset value should switch. This could be costly
for private investors, quite apart from any gains tax implications. But we
do endorse the broker's warnings against buying into shares which are
trading near asset value, particularly those of fashionable new issues.
How suitable that this week was the centenary of the birth of Benjamin
Graham, the father of investment analysis. His sceptical comments on new
issues have been quoted here before. Here he is on warrants:
'We consider the recent development of stock-option warrants as a near
fraud, an existing menace and a potential disaster. They have created huge
aggregate dollar 'values' out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence
except to the extent that they mislead speculators and investors. They
should be prohibited by law, or at least strictly limited to a minor part of
the total capitalisation of a company.
'. . . Why, then, are these subscription warrants created as part of the
original capital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial
matters. They don't realise that common stock is worth less with warrants
outstanding than otherwise.'**
Happy birthday, Ben.
Seven weeks ago, this column commended the attractions of fixed-rate
mortgages at 7.5 to 8 per cent. This week, we note that equivalent mortgages
cost 9.25 per cent. How satisfactory.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: How essential is Sainsbury? - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sainsbury, according to its advertisement campaign, is 'essential for the
essentials'. But after months of gloom surrounding the grocery market,
investors may be wondering whether its shares are still an essential
holding.
Its detailed but complex results statement on Wednesday made the answer to
that question little clearer.
The halving of reported pre-tax profits from Pounds 732.8m to Pounds 368.8m
was misleading, as much of it was accounted for by accounting changes. A
one-off write-down on property values knocked Pounds 341.5m off the bottom
line, and a new, recurring depreciation charge on buildings a further Pounds
38.7m - after Sainsbury bowed to pressure from investors to take a more
realistic attitude to property values and depreciation.
A reorganisation of head office and distribution functions, involving 650
job losses, cost another Pounds 28m.
Without the charges, pre-tax profits would have risen to Pounds 777m
(although that includes a Pounds 7m profit on property sales), which beat
Sainsbury's downbeat prediction in January of only a 'small' rise.
Nevertheless, the increase lagged well behind the double-digit percentage
increases Sainsbury had turned in every year for the previous decade.
The problem was not with Sainsbury's other retail businesses - Homebase, the
DIY chain, Shaw's, the US supermarket group, and the Savacentre
hypermarkets.
The slow-down was in the core supermarket chain - which still accounts for
almost 80 per cent of group sales and more than 80 per cent of its operating
profits. The supermarkets' operating profits rose only 2.3 per cent in spite
of a 7.1 per cent sales increase.
That was the result of several factors. One was that food price inflation
averaged a 25-year low of 1.5 per cent. Inflation is, in many ways, the
retailer's friend, as it means the value of stock rises between the time it
is bought and re-sold to customers, boosting the profit margin.
The main factor was the intense price competition that forced Sainsbury to
cut prices on 300 own-label lines in its so-called 'essentials' campaign.
The competition was sparked by the growth of a new breed of cut-price
discount chains and moves to lower pricing by rivals such as Asda and
Gateway; and, some would suggest, the growing surplus of floorspace in the
grocery market. The campaign knocked 0.4 percentage points off Sainsbury's
gross margin - which had been rising steadily.
The crucial question is whether margins will continue to fall. David
Sainsbury, chairman, insisted they had stabilised.
He said the industry had gone through a one-off repositioning on margins,
akin to that in 1977, when there was a similar upsurge in discounter
activity and Tesco launched a price-cutting operation.
Others disagree. Graeme Bowler, chief executive of the UK's largest food
discounter Kwik Save, warned the day before Sainsbury's results that intense
pressures on price were here to stay.
Whether or not margins continue to decline, the food market will be tough,
and growth opportunities for Sainsbury's core superstore chain limited.
The group is, however, conducting the most wide-ranging review of its
superstore operations for many years, and says likely cost savings are
Pounds 65m a year.
There may be other reasons to hold on to the shares. Sainsbury is shifting
the focus of expansion on to its other businesses. Moreover, the company
said on Wednesday it would look at other opportunities in the US.
If it does not make a further acquisition there, then with capital spending
expected to fall slightly, Sainsbury's highly cash-generative nature may
create scope for increasing the dividend. In a difficult market, Sainsbury
is further down the road in terms of diversification and efficiency than its
biggest rivals, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway.
As to whether Sainsbury's shares are worth buying, on a price/earnings ratio
which is a 12 per cent discount to the market they are becoming attractive.
Any further weakness, and they might once again start to look essential.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: Focus stays on interest rate outlook - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British politics may have been changed utterly by the sudden death of John
Smith, Opposition leader, but the City's attention has remained firmly
focused on interest rates.
The FTSE 100 surged by 38.5 points on Tuesday, as traders got wind of the
Bundesbank's intention to cut Germany's leading interest rates to their
lowest level for five years.
London followed other European equity markets up, in spite of a stiff
warning on the same day from the Bank of England that it would not hesitate
to raise UK interest rates if expectations of higher inflation led to an
increase in the pace of wage and price rises.
The Bank has some grounds for concern. Average earnings growth rose to 3.5
per cent in February from 3 per cent in November, and may have been higher
in March.
The chart shows that employees' inflation expectations remain above the 4
per cent level, in spite of the sharp fall in headline inflation, the key
indicator for pay negotiators.
The stockbroker Hoare Govett says: 'The labour market is tightening only
slowly, but job prospects and security should improve as economic recovery
continues, encouraging more inflation-plus pay deals.'
No-one expects an increase in UK interest rates in the short-term, and there
may even still be scope for another small cut. However, most analysts
believe we are now at the bottom of the interest rate cycle, and the next
movement will be up - even if it does not come this year.
Much more likely is a small increase in US interest rates, to support the
dollar and prevent America's rapid economic growth translating into higher
inflation.
This possibility continues to transfix the London market, which attracts
institutional buying when the FTSE 100 dips towards the 3,100 level, but has
been unable to break through a ceiling of 3,150 for more than a month.
After Tuesday's rise, the market drifted on Wednesday and Thursday.
Yesterday it closed down 18.6 at 3,119.2 as traders again focused on
expectations of a rise in US interest rates next week.
The uneven nature of the UK recovery was demonstrated by an unexpected drop
in the manufacturing output figure for March, after two months of strong
growth. However, the combined figures for the first three months recorded
the largest rise in output for five years.
The week's main corporate results were also generally upbeat. J. Sainsbury,
the UK's largest grocery retailer, announced an increase in underlying
profits, and a stabilisation of its profit margins, in spite of fierce price
battles in food retailing.
Kwik Save, the biggest discount grocery retailer, was less sanguine. Despite
increasing its interim profits, the group said trading was being damaged by
last month's tax increases. It estimated that grocery prices were now 3.5
per cent lower than last year, owing partly to intense price competition.
Big insurers such as General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance
all confirmed the steady recovery in profits in a sector which was dogged by
losses between 1990 and 1992. In spite of an improvement in their
underwriting performance, all suffered from a decline in the value of their
investments in both bonds and equities during the first quarter.
The recovery by the banks also continued apace, as demonstrated by the Royal
Bank of Scotland's achievement of doubling its interim pre-tax profits and
tripling its earnings.
Shareholders who fear that the banks may only rebuild their books in order
to start throwing the money away again in another wave of bad loans may be
encouraged by the Royal Bank's success with Direct Line, its insurance
subsidiary which sells to the public by telephone.
Direct Line is already the UK's leading motor insurer and has nearly doubled
its share of the household insurance market since last year. The Royal Bank
said it had injected a further Pounds 35m of capital into the continued
expansion of the business, which nearly tripled pre-tax profits to to Pounds
40m.
This success poses a threat to the profitability of more traditional
insurers and buildings societies, who have long enjoyed high commission
rates in the home insurance market.
Not that the Royal is hostile to building societies: indeed the bank
confirmed it had been interested in acquiring the Cheltenham and Gloucester,
for which Lloyds has bid Pounds 1.8bn. George Mathewson, chief executive,
said he would still like to buy a medium-sized society with a 'recognisable
name' in the high street, as part of the bank's strategy of diversifying its
interests, and making earnings less volatile.
The brewers' reporting season got off to an unhappy start when the head of
Vaux Group, one of the largest regional brewers, attacked the government
over the 'scandal' of bootleg imports of beer from mainland Europe.
The Sunderland-based group claimed that cross-Channel shipments were now
running at more than 2m barrels a year, equivalent to four times the
production of Vaux itself, which last year sold beer worth more than Pounds
100m.
Brewers have been lobbying the government to reduce the duty on beer to
bring it closer to French levels. But there seems little chance of the
treasury accepting the initial drop in revenue which such a move would
entail.
Grand Metropolitan, the international drinks and food group, gave the market
a jolt on Thursday when it revealed that de-stocking in the US drinks market
was likely to cost it Pounds 40m this year. Apparently the recovery of the
US economy encouraged GrandMet's IDV drinks subsidiary to stock up last
autumn in the hope of increased sales. In fact, the market fell.

Five-year fixed rate mortgages have increased steeply this year. The chart
shows Halifax's since its first issue in October 1991. Its cheapest
five-year fix of 7.20 per cent in January this year was less than its
standard variable rate of 7.64 per cent and a real bargain compared to its
latest five-year 9.25 per cent fix issued this week. Cheaper five-year fixed

FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: Jittery traders hang on the Fed's next move - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is relief for the beleaguered US financial markets just around the corner?
Few on Wall Street are willing to make such a firm prediction.
But if this week's positive inflation data is followed next week by a
well-timed policy tightening from the Federal Reserve, a floor for US stock
and bond prices could be established that provides the foundation for a
calmer, if somewhat less exciting, summer's trading.
The April inflation numbers may turn out to be the key. On Thursday, Wall
Street's analysts were expecting to hear that the producer price index had
risen 0.2 per last month. Instead, they were told that the PPI fell in April
by 0.1 per cent.
Even excluding the unpredictable food and energy components, so-called
'core' producer prices rose by only 0.1 per cent, a figure that was also
below expectations.
Then, yesterday, analysts were looking for a rise of 0.3 per cent in the
April consumer price index. They were surprised to find that the CPI
advanced by only 0.1 per cent last month, while core consumer prices also
rose by less than forecast.
Taken together, the April inflation data could barely have been more
encouraging for stock and bond investors worried that the inflationary fires
were being fanned by the strengthening economy.
Understandably, the markets reacted positively at first to the inflation
news, with the benchmark 30-year bond rallying 1.5 points on Thursday
morning - a move which lowered the yield on the issue to under 7.5 per cent
and provided a firm boost to share prices. But the warm glow faded quickly
and, by yesterday morning, both stocks and bonds were flat in spite of the
promising CPI release.
Markets failed to build on Thursday's gains because, once the inflation data
was out of the way, investors turned their thoughts quickly to monetary
policy and what the Fed's policy-making open market committee (FOMC) might
decide at its next meeting on Tuesday.
Wall Street knows what it would like the FOMC to do: put up interest rates
one more time as a precautionary move against inflation. The federal funds'
rate - the interest level at which banks lend money to each other overnight
 -is now 3.75 per cent but the markets would like the Fed to raise it to at
least 4 per cent, perhaps even 4.25.
At the same time, it would be well received if the Fed also decided to raise
the more important discount rate - the rate at which it lends money to the
banks. During the recent round of monetary policy tightenings, the discount
rate has remained at 3 per cent, but Wall Street now would like to see it at
3.5.
If (and it is not that big an 'if' judging by all the comments and whispers
coming out of the Fed lately), interest rates are raised on Tuesday or soon
after, then the bond market - mindful of the recent encouraging PPI and CPI
figures - might finally be persuaded to drop its inflation obsession, and
the apparently inexorable climb in long-term interest rates could be halted
at 7.5 per cent. After a suitable period of consolidation, long-term bond
yields might then start slowly coming down again.
Lower bond yields would help to restore the stock market's confidence, and a
floor for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has fallen 9 per cent
since the Fed started raising rates in February, could be established at
around 3,600. Investors would then start to believe that the Fed had
completed its round of tightenings and that the 'correction' in financial
markets was over.
There is one flaw in this rosy picture, however - the possibility that the
Fed will raise rates next week, but not by enough to appease the bond
market.
A quarter of a percentage point increase in the federal funds and the
discount rates would not be enough to satisfy bond market investors; and if
the Fed chooses to leave the discount rate alone, it could be a potential
disaster, with prices tumbling and long rates soaring as investors express
their doubts about the central bank's anti-inflation resolve.
The possibility that the Fed will raise rates by only 25 basis points is a
real one because, until the Bundesbank cut German interest rates on
Wednesday, almost everyone believed US rates would have to go up by 50 basis
points to slow down the economy and support a very weak dollar. But, in
terms of helping the dollar, the German rate cut might have done the Fed's
work for it.
If US policy-makers feel that an increase of 25 basis points is all that is
needed to keep the lid on domestic inflationary pressures, there could be
more trouble, not relief, around the corner for Wall Street.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The heights of fear - 'I knew one slip would result in
certain death': Arnie Wilson was seduced into skiing down a remote and
treacherous slope in the Alps. But he found himself exploring his own
reserves of courage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was afraid. Stranded like a disorientated mountain goat on the edge of a
snowy chasm, I looked down on the most magnificent of the Alps. Even Mont
Blanc seemed to be below me. But I was too frightened to enjoy the
spectacle. Opposite, spring avalanches thundered at regular intervals off
the sun-baked shoulders and flanks of the mighty Meije and its glacier. In a
strangely detached way, I knew that one slip on this traverse would result
in certain death.
I have skied in dangerous places before, but this was new. Below me - I
could not resist looking down - was an impossibly steep gulley which fell
away almost vertically to who knows where. I pictured myself tumbling
hopelessly, down and down, bouncing off one cliff after another until I
reached a frozen grave thousands of feet below Le Rateau, next to La Meije.
La Meije (13,061 ft or nearly 4,000m), with its vast glacial terrain, was
the last main peak to be climbed in Europe. Even Edward Whymper, the first
conqueror of the Matterhorn, failed to climb La Meije, which rears up in
fearsome splendour above the climbing village of La Grave and the
spectacular Col du Lautaret.
La Grave, in France, is no ordinary ski resort. It is 7,000 vertical feet
(2,130m) of ungroomed, steep and spectacular terrain whose upper reaches are
crossed by ice walls and crevasses, some of them more than 200 metres deep.
I had come here as part of the FT round the world ski expedition, a madcap
journey on which my companion, Lucy Dicker, and I are attempting to ski
every day of 1994.
A guide at La Grave is highly desirable. But perhaps not a guide who seduces
you into exploring your own threshold of fear; perhaps not a guide such as
Olivier Laborie, who takes the stronger skiers among clients of Ski Peak, a
Surrey-based tour operator, on off-piste adventures. Few, if any of them,
would relish the situation in which I found myself.
It would be a quick death. I wondered what sort of sound I should make. A
scream would be undignified. Silence would be better.
I had studied the descent earlier in the day when Laborie had mentioned,
more than once, with a glint in his eye, that the Pan de Rideau (Side of the
Curtain) was a 'special run' which I would enjoy skiing with him.
But was I good enough to ski it, I asked him? Would it be curtains for me if
I fell. 'You'll be OK,' he said. 'You have a good mind.'
By that, it turned out, he meant I did not panic.
'There is only one place where you must not fall.' Whenever a mountain guide
says this to me, a frisson of fear chills my spine.
Yet I know from many guided off-piste adventures in the mountains that
sometimes a short, risky and heart-stopping section of terrain is the
'entrance fee' you must pay for the most sublime and exciting skiing. I had
skied with Laborie before, a year earlier. So he knew I could not resist a
challenge.
But this was more than a challenge. This was coming face to face with the
inner demons which haunt all skiers who mix skiing with mountaineering. And
this time there were just the two of us: the supremely fit, confident young
mountain guide, with everything from pulleys and tackle (for crevasse
rescues) to ice axe, pitons and karabiners in his rucksack, and the
50-year-old, overweight, over-ambitious recreational skier suddenly beyond
the limit of his competence.
From below, I had seen a huge hole punched high in the rock face beside a
vast and steep snowfield. Olivier had assured me: 'We will try to ski in the
shade where the snow will be fantastic.' The terrifying traverse on which I
now stood was above two or three precipitous couloirs which merged into a
sheer gulley hundreds of feet below.
To get to the Pan de Rideau (not that I will ever go again) you must climb
in deep snow for perhaps half an hour from the Glacier du Vallon to the Col
des Trifides. From here you look down, past a column of rock that juts out
like a giant finger from the col, at what seems to be every peak in the
Alps. Then you see the route Olivier wants you to take.
Sweat from the heat of the climb was followed by cold sweat. Just as a leap
of two or three feet seems easy when you are only a foot from the ground,
the traverse from the Col des Trifides would, elsewhere, be merely awkward.
'I don't like the look of this Olivier,' I said. 'You don't have to do it,'
he replied. 'But it will be all right. I don't want to die either.' Somehow
I could not refuse.
To reach the curtain, you must side-step gingerly down for five feet before
reaching the traverse. Then progress is a matter of beating down the snow
with your skis and making a platform before edging forward. Every now and
then your eyes are drawn to the cliffs below. I was half way along the
traverse and becoming more and more apprehensive when Olivier looked at me,
concerned, and asked: 'Would you like me to rope you?'
He had roped me - and the rest of the group - last year when we were
descending the first part of the Viol couloir above the French resort of
Alpe d'Huez, where a fall could be fatal. Indeed, the wealthy client of a
prominent local guide fell to his death there a few weeks ago.
The two of us were now teetering on the brink while he struggled to get the
rope round my girth without either of us falling. Then he half skied and
half climbed to the largest rock he could find and after instructing me to
'stay there' (I had no wish to move) began to drive in a piton. (It was an
old Simond piton worth approximately 15 French francs and manufactured in
the rather more famous climbing town of Chamonix, I discovered later.)
After a few minutes, I began to wish I was on the move again. Anything was
better than standing motionless on the edge of the abyss. As Olivier
hammered, the sound was so clear that I thought it must carry all the way to
Lucy, who - armed with our video camera - was awaiting our descent in the
shelter of a huge rock on the glacier floor more than 1,000ft below. Knowing
she was watching our drama unfold made the whole thing even more unnerving.
Having secured the rope through a karabiner, which he attached to the piton,
Olivier skied back to a point where the traverse disappeared into unknown
territory around the corner. 'There's one thing you can do]' he shouted,
almost as an afterthought. 'Double the rope up and push it through the
piton. Retrieve the karabiner and then take the loop you have pushed through
and you can lower yourself back to the traverse.'
This was madness. What did I know of karabiners - snap-links used to connect
ropes to pitons, which are metal spikes hammered into rocks? These were the
impediments of climbers, not skiers. They were completely alien and
frightening to me. They spoke of people who actually enjoy being suspended
over vertiginous drops. Anyway, why did he want his wretched karabiner back?
Surely it was not the expense of buying a new one? Might he want to use it
again to keep me from falling?
I would have happily bought him half a dozen karabiners instead of having to
climb - still on my skis - three feet up to the rock to retrieve it before
lowering myself back to the fearful perch I had just left.
The rope would not go through the piton.
I was reminded of the horror story I had read in The White Spider, a history
of the ascents of the North face of the Eiger in which the sole survivor of
a disastrous attempt on the summit had survived a freezing night hanging on
to the mountain, before climbing down to the frozen corpse of his nearest
colleague to make use of his rope - only to discover with his dying breath
that when he knotted the extra rope to his, the knot would not pass through
the karabiner.
I tried again, and this time I managed to force the rope through. Totally
inexperienced in climbing, I was now in slightly more control of my destiny.
If I had fallen without my rope being threaded through the piton, Olivier
was confident that he could have held me, and I believed him. But at least
for the moment I would be spared the anguish of swinging across the slope
like a pendulum before he rescued me.
I retrieved the karabiner and then inched - no, centimetred - my way back to
the traverse, and shuffled forward, slightly more confident now that I was
closing the gap. At last I was round the corner, to be confronted with what
we had really come for: the snowfield. It was steeper than anything I had
imagined or ever skied. Olivier said later that the slope was 'almost 50
degrees, but not quite'.
There was only one more psychological obstacle (or so I thought) to be
overcome. At the bottom of the snowfield, 150 metres below, were more rocks.
I wanted to traverse to a point where - if I fell - there were no hard
objects to ski into. In spite of the steepness, traversing here was much
easier. The snow was deeper, and there were no yawning couloirs to swallow
you up.
'Don't worry,' said Olivier. 'Here you can fall without danger.'
The slope was so steep that when I made my first turn, my shoulder and
backside pushed through the snow. 'You must face down the slope the whole
time,' said Oliver. I thought I had been. Every time I turned, he waited
directly below me. 'I will catch you if you fall,' he said.
'Be careful at the bottom. There is huge crevasse - a rimee,' (a crevasse
that forms between the end of a glacier and the rock face immediately below
it). 'I thought you said I could fall here without being in danger,' I said,
alarmed again. 'Ah' said Olivier. 'If you fall here you will be travelling
so fast you will slide right across the crevasse instead of falling into
it]'
                        *      *      *
At last we were out of danger. I was going to live. In front of us were
thousands of feet of supreme powder. The sun was shining as brightly as
ever. Even though the climb, the fear and the snowfield had exhausted me so
much that I hardly had the strength to enjoy the vast fields of powder, it
was wonderful to have emerged unscathed.
And Olivier was right. From now on the skiing was ecstatic. I tumbled three
or four times in the deep, sparkling powder.
Both Olivier and I shouted in the direction of the rock where we had
arranged to meet Lucy. Our voices echoed emptily among the moraines and
seracs.
Fearing the worst as the sun had begun to go down, Lucy had found her way -
without a guide - down to the first stage of the gondola lift to raise the
alarm, then - carrying her skis - walked the difficult, boulder-strewn and
boggy terrain back to La Grave.
There, the manager of the telepherique, armed with strong binoculars, had
spotted Olivier and me making our way back through green fields carpeted
with crocuses. From half a mile away, I waved at Lucy and she waved back. We
were pleased to see each other.
Over a beer in the Castillan Hotel bar, I asked Olivier how often he took
clients down the Pan de Rideau. 'You were the first,' he said. 'I like to
push clients beyond their normal limits.'
Meanwhile, high above the Glacier du Vallon, a cheap French piton hammered
into a rock is the only evidence of my most troubled hour on earth - a
rather hellish gateway to some heavenly skiing.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The Long View: Forever in your debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is inflation really dead? Even in Brazil they are trying to bury it, with
the confirmation this week that the new 'real' will be introduced in July.
Yet, this is the seventh attempt in eight years to stabilise the Brazilian
currency, plagued recently by inflation topping 2,500 per cent.
True, there is a neighbouring precedent given that Argentina, once a victim
of hyper-inflation, cut its rate to 7 per cent in 1993. The trick has been
achieved through such measures as a peg to the dollar and opening the
economy to cheap imports. The trouble is, this has led to a big balance of
payments deficit, so the true test will come when this trade gap cannot be
financed.
For every currency saved, another seems to head for the abyss. Turkish
inflation, for instance, has soared above 100 per cent as the economy slumps
and government finances totter. Last year, Turkey was the star of the
emerging markets but, in 1994, the London-listed Turkey Trust (down nearly
50 per cent) is living up to its name.
Our perceptions of low inflation arise from experience in the mature western
economies, not from the rest of the world where currencies continue to be
debauched as regularly as ever. Eastern Europe is a disaster area for
believers in sound money. In the Group of Seven countries, however, average
inflation has fallen to 2.3 per cent.
In the UK, where the Bank of England published its quarterly Inflation
Report this week, the retail price index also shows a year-on-year increase
of 2.3 per cent, up from a freak low point of 1.2 per cent last year. But
the Bank's RPIY measure of 'core' inflation, which excludes distorting
influences such as mortgage interest rates and indirect taxes, is still
trending downwards and stands at 1.9 per cent on the latest calculation (for
March).
Why such a low level? Even in the least inflationary years of the 1980s,
between 1982 and 1987, prices were rising at 4.7 per cent on average. But
the labour market was hammered in the early 1990s and international price
competition on traded goods is intense, stimulated by ever-increasing third
world participation.
The global economy, meanwhile, has been at its weakest since the 1930s.
Growth in the OECD member states was only 1.2 per cent in 1993, and was
probably negative outside the US. The credit-based binges of the 1980s have
collapsed, to be replaced by the threat of debt deflation, a condition in
which monetary contraction leads to actual falls in prices (although only
Japan is still threatened seriously by such a plight).
Serious economic depression has, however, been held off by central banks -
in the US and Japan, in particular - which have propped up their banks.
Depositors have not lost their money. Confidence has been sustained in
financial institutions - but only at the cost of huge public sector
deficits. US government debt has been rising but the position is worse in
Europe where, according to the OECD, net public sector indebtedness has
risen from 27 per cent of GDP in 1980 to 43 per cent in 1990 and is likely
to reach 61 per cent in 1995, bolstered by figures of 117 per cent for Italy
and 132 per cent for Belgium.
When economies are depressed, these public sector deficits can offset
smoothly the surpluses arising in the private sector. Low, short-term
interest rates will not generate excessive credit growth, because borrowers
are too cautious, but will encourage investors to seek higher levels of
income from long-term bonds. This week, the Bundesbank actually said that
one of its motives in cutting short-term D-Mark interest rates was to reduce
the excessive growth of its targeted measure of money supply, M3, by
diverting savers into bonds and other longer-term assets not defined as
money.
So far, the central banks still appear to be winning in their efforts to
stave off financial and economic retrenchment and create a path to recovery
with low inflation. Continental Europe, for instance, seems to be heading
towards an economic upturn this year. But have the underlying problems been
cured, or just postponed?
Certainly, the US Federal Reserve is having awful problems in shifting from
low to 'neutral' interest rates. The delicate bull market in bonds has been
torpedoed, leading to a sharp rise in long-term interest rates. In the
absence of the brutal impact of a deposit-destroying economic adjustment, we
find that US consumption and Japanese production are both too high, with
huge and destabilising payments imbalances. So, the dollar has been
wobbling.
Moreover, as the private sectors of the leading economies revive (as has
happened in the US), the public sectors must step back rapidly and eliminate
their demands on the capital markets. Otherwise, bond interest rates will
soar to still more unacceptable levels.
In the short run, there is no genuine scare over inflation - even in the US,
which is furthest along the recovery track, this week's latest producer and
consumer price figures were benign. During the bond market scares of recent
months, the gold price has moved only sideways, scarcely suggesting an
inflation panic. Some commodity prices have been rising, but mostly on the
back of the huge pools of speculative money which are now punting on
anything that moves.
For the longer term, though, the inflationary danger obviously remains.
Although the cost of bailing out the private sector last year seemed quite
low, in 1994 it has jumped. Right now, it costs the UK government more than
5 per cent in real terms to fund its deficit through gilt-edged sales, on
the basis of the Bank of England's projection of 3 per cent inflation two
years out.
That is an unacceptably high cost, and governments such as that of the UK
are eventually going to find it very tempting to inflate away the burden.
Perhaps, after all, we should save some of those Brazilian reals for a rainy
day.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Japanese withhold vital Eurotunnel cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, is on the brink of another
financial crisis this weekend because its Japanese bank creditors have
contributed little of vital new financing with only one working day before
Monday evening's deadline for Pounds 700m of loans to be raised.
Because of the gravity of the situation, Mr Pen Kent, a Bank of England
director, is intervening to try to persuade the banks to contribute their
share of the funds.
The Bank is talking both to the banks directly and to Japan's central bank.
'We are not going to let this vital transport project go down for the want
of a couple of yen,' a UK government official said.
European bankers said they were considering whether to ask Mr John Major,
the prime minister, to write to his Japanese counterpart, Mr Tsutomu Hata.
A senior Whitehall official said: 'The government is ready for a bit of arm
twisting with the Japanese banks.'
The tunnel operator needs to raise Pounds 700m in new senior bank debt from
its syndicate of 200 banks prior to launching a rights issue to raise a
similar amount. However, it has received commitments for just Pounds 500m,
largely because of the absence of contributions from Japanese banks.
The new funds are needed largely because of the delayed start to services
through the tunnel which means that the company will receive less revenue in
the next couple of years than was originally hoped.
In order for the financing to go ahead, a 90 per cent majority of banks also
has to agree to change bank covenants, since the company is currently in
breach of its borrowing agreements. It currently has 80 per cent of votes in
favour and needs positive responses from 'just a dozen more banks', a banker
said.
However, the fund-raising exercise cannot succeed without theparticipation
of the Japanese banks because to date they have contributed 23 per cent of
the existing Pounds 6.8bn commercial bank facilities, far more than banks
from any other country.
Their ability to make new loans is constrained by the erosion of their
capital caused by the prolonged Japanese recession.
Eurotunnel's directors will be made aware of the loan shortfall at a board
meeting tomorrow.
A banker said: 'There is no chance of all the money being received by Monday
evening.' He added that Eurotunnel would face some very difficult choices if
the bank finance has not been raised by the end of the week.
'Directors could try and make do with less than the full Pounds 700m. But
that would not be easy.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK rejects French compromise

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and France yesterday held high-level talks in an attempt to defuse
the crisis over access to Orly airport, write Paul Betts in London and John
Ridding in Paris. But British Airways and Air UK insisted they would launch
services to Orly on Monday in defiance of a ban by the French government.
France is understood to have offered a compromise by suggesting it was
prepared to open Orly to UK carriers at the end of June. However, Britain
insisted that UK carriers had 'the right' to fly to Orly on Monday, after
the European Commission's ruling last month ordering France to open the
Orly-London route immediately.
UK officials said Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, and Mr
Bernard Bosson, his French counterpart, were expected to hold telephone
talks last night in an effort to resolve the dispute.
BA group managing director Robert Ayling said last night that if the airline
was not allowed into Orly it would consider going to the French courts to
seek compensation from the French government.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Schroders close to takeover of US affiliate in Dollars 150m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders, the UK merchant bank, is close to taking control of Wertheim
Schroder, its US affiliate, in a deal approaching Dollars 150m (Pounds
102.7m).
The takeover will give Schroders the biggest wholly-owned Wall Street
investment banking business of any British merchant bank, leapfrogging SG
Warburg, its main rival.
Senior Schroders executives said execution of the deal was being delayed
pending the formal settlement of a Dollars 375m suit against Wertheim by the
Ames department store group. Agreement in principle has been reached for
Wertheim to pay an estimated Dollars 19m to Ames to settle the proceedings,
but the terms are subject to court approval.
'As soon as the case is settled, the takeover of Wertheim will take place,'
a banker said. He added that Schroders would pay up to Dollars 150m for the
50 per cent of Wertheim's voting shares and 57.5 per cent of the preferred
shares it did not already own. It bought half of Wertheim in 1986.
Wertheim's managing partners hold the other 50 per cent of the voting
shares, while Bank of Boston, Massachusetts Mutual Life and Mitsubishi Trust
Bank each have small non-voting stakes equivalent to 4.9 per cent of the
total equity.
A senior Schroders director said: 'The deal will enable us to compete with
the big boys in the US by controlling a US bank with a proven track record.'
But another Schroders executive said that there were risks because the
merchant bank was so different from Wertheim. The US firm is a securities
trader, while Schroders has concentrated on investment management and giving
advice to companies.
Schroders' corporate clients also tend to be the biggest UK and European
companies, whereas Wertheim specialises in medium-sized US businesses.
The biggest source of tension, however, is likely to be remuneration, a
banker said. 'The top guys at Wertheim earn over Dollars 1m, far more than
Schroders' executives,' he said.
The banker said he expected Schroders to reorganise the senior management of
Wertheim soon after the takeover.
Schroders has delayed the acquisition to avoid liability for damages from
the Ames dispute. Ames accused Wertheim of breach of fiduciary duty,
professional malpractice, unjust enrichment and other improper conduct
relating to its work as adviser in Ames' Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the
discount store division of Zayre Corporation in 1988.
It alleged that it paid too much for the discount stores and that the highly
leveraged takeover was largely responsible for financial difficulties which
led Ames to seek Chapter 11 protection from its creditors in 1990. Ames has
now emerged from Chapter 11 protection.
The suit also alleged that Mr James Harmon, Wertheim's chairman who also
headed the Ames board between January 1988 and June 1990, breached his
fiduciary duty during the deal.

FT  14 MAY 94 / BA braced for test flight of wills: Jenny Luesby on the
airline's plan to defy a landing ban at Orly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crunch may come shortly after 7am on Monday, 29,000 feet above the
English Channel.
The captain of British Airways flight 332, bound from London's Heathrow
airport to Orly airport, south of Paris, will request permission to proceed
into French air space.
A refusal would be unprecedented, providing the flight plan has been
accepted. The airline has already logged a flight plan for BA332 for Monday.
It has done so every day since March 27, but the flight plan has never been
used.
So far, BA has always cancelled the flight. Not because it wants to, or does
not have the right to fly, but because the French have been barring British
flights to Orly in defiance of a European Commission ruling last month.
BA says, however, that on Monday it will not cancel the flight. The 247-seat
Boeing 767 is fully booked. Passengers include a member of the European
parliament, a French television crew, BA's group managing director and a
pack of journalists.
The pilot knows that BA has a landing slot booked at Orly. It has check-in
desks, a handling agent and a parking space. By 5am he will also know how
French air traffic control and Orly airport have reacted to the flight plan.
The only grounds for rejecting a flight plan are if the paperwork is not in
order, if there is a security problem, if the airport is closed or if the
airspace is full.
The burden of proof will be on France to justify a refused flight plan. But
it would bring Monday's test of wills to a swift close: no flight plan, no
flight. Will the French be willing to flout European law? The pilot can only
ask, and wait.
If he gets clearance, the aircraft will take off - at 6.50am if it is on
time. The flight should be uneventful until the aircraft reaches the English
Channel where the captain will switch frequencies, announce his presence to
French air traffic control and be acknowledged.
But any minute could bring an order to divert to another airport. If it
comes, he will argue the case. He has the landing slot. He will push for
precise details of the obstacle standing between flight BA332 and Orly
airport. The law is on his side. And he wants to go to Orly.
He will be an experienced BA pilot, part of senior management, a fluent
French speaker. And he will fight the diversion.
Heathrow-Orly is a short hop - 322 miles and a scheduled flight time of 65
minutes. The captain will have more than adequate fuel. He can circle. He
can argue. He can make a nuisance. And he can make a point.
He will not jeopardise the safety of his passengers. French air traffic
control will be obliged to keep him in safe airspace while the negotiations
go on.
In the end, he may win. With his landing gear on Orly's runway, he will have
opened up a route that his airline wants. And if, eventually, he has to land
instead at Charles de Gaulle airport, he will at least have forced the
French to show their hand.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: The Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Telegraph's first-quarter results provide strong evidence that the UK
advertising recovery is gathering pace. Advertising revenue was up 18 per
cent on the same period last year and is now near the peak it reached in
1989. Moreover, the Telegraph expects advertising to continue rising as the
general economic recovery becomes more established. There is clearly scope
for growth in display and recruitment advertising which are still a long way
below the 1989 level.
Other evidence confirms the Telegraph story of an insipid recovery in 1993
being followed by a much stronger 1994. United Newspapers painted a similar
picture at its annual general meeting this week, while News Corporation last
week said revenues at its UK newspapers had risen 11 per cent.
The pattern of the advertising recovery has similarities with recoveries
from previous recessions. But there is one important difference this time
round; during the latest recession, newspapers added to their pagination.
The result was that advertising rates fell faster than revenues. The
Telegraph's financial advertising rates in its first quarter increased only
in line with inflation, though revenues grew strongly. This suggests the
capacity to carry advertising built up during the recession will continue to
moderate increases in rates for some time even though volumes may boom.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be wrong to read too much into gilts' rally after yesterday's
auction announcement. That was more of a technical squeeze than a welcome
for the first convertible issue since the early 1980s. The revival is bound
to be controversial, suggesting a degree of pressure on the Bank of England.
After a surfeit of short-dated issues, it cannot easily come back for more.
Yet the long end of the market remains too fragile to absorb a large
conventional issue with ease.
For those with short memories, the convertible works likes this. The Bank
issues a five-year gilt which can be converted at specific intervals into
long gilts at fixed yields below those currently prevailing in the market.
The new gilt might attract institutions that are worried about committing
themselves to long gilts now but are also afraid of missing the boat if bond
markets do recover sharply once US rates have stopped rising. The capital
risk in buying five-year paper is small and they have a chance of acquiring
long-term paper at what may turn out to be attractive rates later.
But this all looks too clever by half. In return for allowing the
institutions to protect themselves in this way the Bank will get its
five-year money cheaply, but maybe not cheaply enough. Holders will only
convert if by doing so they can obtain a yield higher than generally
available at the time. At that point the borrowing will become expensive for
the Bank. If it really believes yields are too high, it would be better off
waiting until they fall before borrowing long. It would look better off
still if it had had the foresight to raise 25-year money when yields reached
their floor of 6.4 per cent in late December.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's first-quarter figures contained a number of small
disappointments. Volume growth has not accelerated from the 1.5 per cent
rate seen at the end of last year. Economic turmoil in Brazil has dented
profits. Interest costs were higher than expected, partly because preference
shares have been refinanced with debt. The interest charge probably has
further to rise as Unilever starts to pay more on its dollar debt and
receives less on some Pounds 1bn in deposits held in Europe, mostly in
D-Marks and Dutch guilders. Profits forecasts have thus been trimmed.
But these factors do not fully explain yesterday's 5 per cent fall in the
shares. More worrying is the fact that prices across Unilever's vast range
of consumer goods are still falling in real terms. True, the price war in US
detergents which erupted last summer distorts the overall picture. Year on
year comparisons should look more favourable from the third quarter. With
Unilever now launching its new range of fabric detergents in Europe, though,
there could be further pricing pressure to come.
Detergent margins are generally lower in Europe than in the US, so there may
be less scope for an all-out price war, yet the slanging match with Procter
&amp; Gamble points to a robust competitive response. Despite Unilever's best
efforts to defend margins by cutting costs, the threat of instability in
another of its main markets will cast a shadow over the shares for some time
yet.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Unenterprising defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gap in Enterprise's attack is matched by a gap in Lasmo's defence. There
is little point in putting the two oil exploration companies together, but
little point in keeping them apart either. Certainly, Lasmo's desperately
thin defence document, out yesterday, failed to make the case for retaining
its independence. Although Lasmo has improved its finances and management
over the past year, there is no room for complacency on either score.
Moreover, Lasmo chief executive Mr Joe Darby was hard pressed to identify
any special characteristic of the group that would be destroyed if
Enterprise won the battle.
The bid therefore looks like being decided purely on the money. On this
score, Enterprise's offer is weak. The all-paper offer, originally estimated
to be worth 150p, has dropped with Enterprise's share price. Lasmo
shareholders are also wary of being offered special low-dividend shares and
speculative warrants - a mixture Lasmo chairman Mr Rudolph Agnew has dubbed
'second-class paper'. It is all very well for Enterprise to argue that the
reduced dividends are no worse than what Lasmo shareholders would have
received anyway. But investors naturally want a better deal, not just one
that is no worse.
The snag is that Enterprise cannot afford to come up with cash from its own
resources. That would endanger dividends to existing shareholders, which are
at best barely covered as things stand. Underwriting a cash alternative is
the obvious option. A dollop of cash would certainly make the offer more
palatable but Enterprise's owners will be concerned if it has to pay through
the nose for the underwriting.

Mexican shares ended a dull session slightly higher as investors mulled over
Thursday night's debate between the country's three main presidential
candidates.
The 37-share IPC index ended up 4.47 points at 2,240.17 after trading in a
narrow eight-point range. Advancing shares led declines 42-23 in moderate
trade of 77m shares.
The debate between the candidates in August's election was the first ever
televised but it appeared to have little effect on trading.
'There's just no news and the market's flat,' a trader said. 'There was a
lot of speculation before the debate but there hasn't been any reaction
today.'
Baring Securities in New York said that it was advising investors to buy
Mexican stocks more aggressively on expectations of real earnings per share
growth of 12 per cent for a sample of companies in 1994, followed by 19 per
cent in 1995.

FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data fails to lift
US equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
More good news on inflation failed to provide stocks with much of a lift
yesterday, even though the data lifted bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up only 6.84 at 3,659.68,
having spent the entire day no more than a few points either side of opening
values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's also ended little changed,
up 0.41 at 444.16, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished down
0.78 at 432.57 and the Nasdaq composite down 2.69 at 716.92. Trading volume
was 253m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 1,068 to 1,068.
For the second day, there was some surprisingly good news on inflation.
After Thursday's unexpected 0.1 per cent decline in the April producer price
index, yesterday's news of a 0.1 per cent increase in April's consumer price
index also confounded analysts, who had forecast an increase of 0.3 per cent
in the CPI.
Taken together, the data was the best indication yet that inflation is not a
major threat to financial markets. Yet, apart from a brief surge of buying
at the opening and again mid-morning, stocks did not gain much benefit from
the figures.
This was mostly because bond prices failed to make much headway, as
fixed-income investors turned their attention to next Tuesday's meeting of
the Federal Reserve's policy- making open market committee. The FOMC is
expected to sanction a rate increase at the meeting, and investors are
nervous about how another tightening will be received by the markets.
Although bond prices began to recover later in the day, stock failed to
derive much strength from the Treasury market. In late trading, the
benchmark 30-year bond was up more than half a point, and the yield was down
to 7.481 per cent, yet blue-chip stocks struggled to stay in positive
territory. Secondary indices fared even less well, with the Nasdaq composite
under particular pressure because of weakness in technology stocks.
Among individual issues, Time Warner climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 5/8
amid renewed speculation that the entertainment group faces a possible bid
from its major shareholder, Seagram. Yesterday's story was that Mr Barry
Diller, head of the QVC home shopping channel, had accumulated Time Warner
shares with the intention of backing Seagram.
Philip Morris was another notable gainer, rising Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 52
1/8 on hopes that the company will split its tobacco and food interests.
Sprint firmed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 36 5/8 on reports that it is discussing
an alliance with Electronic Data Systems which will combine Sprint's
telecommunications know-how with EDS' data-processing power to compete in
the multi-media business. EDS shares edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars
33.
On the Nasdaq market, concern about slow growth in the computer networking
products business hit technology stocks hard. Cisco tumbled Dollars 5 3/4 to
Dollars 23 1/4 , Wellfleet fell Dollars 8 to Dollars 63 1/2 , and 3 Com
dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 55.
Canada
Toronto stock prices closed modestly higher in relatively light trading, to
end a jittery week on a high note. According to preliminary figures, the
TSE-300 index rose 12.83 points, or 0.31 per cent, to close at 4,175.35.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 411 to 327.
Preliminary volume was 57.039m shares, up from Thursday's 52.933m shares,
and trading value rose to CDollars 532.7m from CDollars 509.4m.
Nine of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes closed higher, led by mining, up 2.1 per
cent as base-metal prices surged. Inco jumped 1 to 33 3/8 on higher nickel
prices.
Mitel Corp lost  3/8 to 5 after the company said its fourth-quarter earnings
fell to CDollars 4.8m.
Oshawa Group reported first-quarter net income up to CDollars 8.9m. Oshawa
Group A shares gained  1/4 to 20.

FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Ericsson leads Stockholm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An upsurge in Ericsson stocks and an appetite for commodity-based cyclicals
featured in Nordic bourses yesterday.
In Stockholm, the telecommunications major rose SKr30, or 9 per cent, to
SKr366.
Mr Michael Thompson of James Capel said that the broker had put out a buy
recommendation on Ericsson at the end of last week, after the stock had
underperformed the market by 35 per cent since last October.
Ericsson was the main influence yesterday as the Affarsvarlden General index
rose 30.10, or 2 per cent, to 1,535.20, although Volvo B rose SKr16 to a new
record close of SKr748, and Trelleborg put on SKr5 at SKr120 on the climb in
metal prices.
Stockholm's turnover was a strong SKr3.3bn. Other bourses were entertaining,
but less active. Firmer North Sea oil prices helped Oslo rise 1.6 per cent,
the all-share index closing 10.17 firmer at 649.69.
Norsk Hydro, which plans to invest about NKr8bn a year from 1994 to 1996,
closed NKr5.5 better at NKr253.5.
Helsinki rose 1.5 per cent with forestry and metals stocks in the van.

FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Metallgesellschaft up 17% on
UBS note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses liked the US CPI data and investors, particularly, seemed to go for
commodity-based cyclicals, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT turned in respectable gains, mostly in insurers, automotive and
engineering and metals stocks, although trade was quiet after Thursday's
holiday.
The Dax index rose 15.12 to 2,258.75 on the session, up 1 per cent on the
week, and held its ground in the post bourse to close at an Ibis-indicated
2,257.33. Turnover fell to DM6.9bn from Wednesday's DM8.6bn.
The stock of the day was Metallgesellschaft, the disaster stock of late 1993
and early 1994 after its exposure to oil-trading losses through a US
subsidiary. It leapt DM42, or 17 per cent, to DM285, up 27 per cent on the
week.
The automotive, engineering and research team at UBS put out a strong
recommendation on the stock this week, seeing a lot of potential in the
company after its restructuring under the new management board chairman, Mr
Kajo Neukirchen, who was successful with similar exercises at the engineer,
KHD, and the ball-bearing maker, Kugelfischer.
Elsewhere there were respectable gains for Thyssen, up DM6.80 to DM302.30 on
its mobile telephone prospects, and for Veba, another DM6.50 higher at
DM543.50 on Tuesday's good first quarter results, and on its oil interests
at a time of rising commodity prices.
PARIS took comfort from the US data and the CAC-40 index immediately reacted
with a strong, but unsustainable, rise. Having touched a session high of
2,206.24, the market slipped back to close the day up 10.26 at 2,187.00, a
rise of 1.3 per cent on the week.
Hoare Govett yesterday recommended upgrading the French market to 'fully
weighted' on four counts: improved economic fundamentals; support from
falling bond yields 'as the domestic bond market has been sold more heavily
than others in Europe, with little apparent domestic justification'; better
then expected first quarter company results; and a likely easing of the
'liquidity crunch' over the summer since no further privatisations are
scheduled until the autumn.
LVMH, up FFr8 at FFr903, benefited from a rise in first quarter turnover
from Christian Dior, up FFr1.10 at FFr447.90.
AMSTERDAM was pulled both ways, with two of the most heavily capitalised
issues moving in opposite directions.
Royal Dutch, which has been performing strongly since its recent first
quarter results exceeded analysts' expectations, gained Fl 2.20 to Fl
207.90, a week's advance of 2 per cent.
For UBS, the oil group's results indicated that cost reductions were coming
through, that sales were showing above average growth and that chemicals
were starting to turn round. James Capel remained more cautious and
maintained its hold recommendation.
But there was disappointment for Unilever, off Fl 5.50 at Fl 195.50, but up
from a session low of Fl 193.80, as investors reacted with disappointment to
yesterday's first quarter results. Analysts particularly noted the group's
lacklustre showing in the US and were worried about the so-called
'detergents war' with Procter &amp; Gamble.
The AEX index finished off 0.99 at 411.58, unchanged over the week. Other
notable gains were seen from KLM which was moved by a feeling that benefits
from its alliance with Northwest of the US might soon come through, and the
shares, which earlier saw a year's high of Fl 56.70, ended up Fl 1.40 at Fl
56.10.
MILAN turned its attention to Fiat, following the vehicle group's first
quarter results which came after the close on Thursday.
The Comit index rose 5.83 to 808.85, up 1 per cent on the week.
Analysts were not surprised by Fiat's 1993 losses - the biggest in its
history - which had already been discounted. Of more interest was the fact
that the first quarter of 1994 showed a gain of L30bn, compared with a 1993
loss of L222bn. The shares improved L90 to L7,225, 2.7 per cent better on
the week.
ZURICH recovered more ground after strength in the banking and insurance
sectors, the SMI index rising 47.8 to 2,680.8, 1.5 per cent higher on a
volatile week.
Receding interest rate worries left CS Holding, the most active stock of the
day, up SFr19 at SFr603. Among insurers, Zurich bearers rose SFr55 to
SFr1,310, and Winterthur put on SFr27 at SFr672 after good earnings growth
in this week's progress reports.
MADRID found it difficult to cope with Wall Street's apparent reaction to
good US data, but late institutional buying rescued the market, and the
general index ended 1.87 higher at 329.03, 3.4 per cent higher on the week.
Turnover was a solid Pta50bn.
ATHENS hit a 1994 low for the second consecutive session, the general index
closing 16.58 lower at 934.19, 4.8 per cent lower on the week, with foreign
investors worried by pressure on the drachma.

FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Yen's easing against
dollar encourages Nikkei index
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's easing against the dollar encouraged buying by overseas investors,
but selling by domestic institutions eroded the gains and the Nikkei index
closed marginally higher after moving in a narrow range, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose 46.51 to 20,270.75 after a low of 20,221.04 and a high
of 20,360.37. The Topix index of all first section stocks, however, fell
1.36 to 1,643.20.
Volume totaled 400m shares against 290.7m. The day's activity rose on
trading related to the monthly options settlement yesterday.
The Nikkei 300 lost 0.33 to 300.75. Losers led gainers by 499 to 489, with
184 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.93 to 1,345.69.
Rumours that the Bank of Japan was buying dollars against the yen prompted
some dollar purchases by investors. The yen eased moderately against the
dollar, encouraging buying of export-oriented high-technology issues.
Hitachi and NEC both hit new highs for the year on active buying. Hitachi
rose Y13 to Y995 and NEC gained Y10 to Y1,180. Other electronics stocks were
similarly firm, with Fujitsu up Y20 to Y1,050 and Sony rising Y40 to Y5,880.
Hopes of a rising market share in the US supported Mazda Motor, which gained
Y12 to Y585, and Hino Motors which rose Y49 to Y915.
Some banks were lower on profit taking. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to
Y3,290 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y30 to Y1,980.
Retailers rose on prospects of a boost in private consumption because of an
income tax cut scheduled next month. Ito-Yokado rose Y220 to Y5,640 and
Jusco gained Y60 to Y2,340.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 73.25 to 22,446.74.
Roundup
Thursday's decline in the US producer price index, indicating better
inflationary and interest rate expectations, was welcomed in the Pacific
Basin.
HONG KONG detected new buy orders and fresh short covering from Europe in
the late afternoon as the Hang Seng index rose 255.86, or 2.9 per cent to
9,134.72, 6 per cent higher on the week in turnover up from HKDollars 4.62bn
to HKDollars 5.02bn.
Properties were the main target, the sub-index gaining 4.6 per cent. Cheung
Kong, the most active stock, advanced HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 37.75,
followed by Sun Hung Kai, up HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 49. Henderson Land,
described as oversold recently, climbed HKDollars 3.00, or 8 per cent, to
HKDollars 40.50.
SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index closed up 28.6 at 2,070.0, 3.3 per cent better
on the week, lifted by bullish trade in the futures market and renewed
confidence in bonds. Rising commodity prices also encouraged buying.
Turnover was ADollars 527.7m. Among leading resource stocks, BHP leapt 54
cents to ADollars 17.58 while CRA and Western Mining both rose 20 cents, to
ADollars 17.80 and ADollars 7.70 respectively.
The oil sector closed nearly 4 per cent stronger on a six-month high in
world oil prices. Woodside Petroleum gained 29 cents at ADollars 4.75,
Santos jumped 19 at ADollars 4.30 and Ampolex rose 9 at ADollars 4.35.
SINGAPORE saw demand for blue chips as the Straits Times Industrial index
rose 35.71 to 2,286.12, 1.4 per cent up on the week, in volume of 100.5m
shares.
BANGKOK rose 2.15 per cent on the day, while its week's gain was 1.5 per
cent. The SET index put on 26.45 to 1,259.17 in turnover of Bt4.7bn.
The banking sector was strong with Thai Farmers Bank up Bt4 at Bt110 after
reporting a jump of 34.7 per cent in net profit to Bt2.1bn for the first
quarter. Bangkok Bank gained Bt2 to Bt163.
TAIPEI's weighted index rose 57.57 to 6,061.95, 1.8 per cent better on the
week, as buying of paper and pulp stocks intensified just before the close.
The sector led on continued expectations for an industry recovery and higher
product prices.
China Petrochemical rose by the daily 7 per cent limit on optimism over its
offer of 298m shares this month.
WELLINGTON gained on blue chip buying, Telecom on results and Fletcher on
the extension of a good run. The NZSE-40 index closed 12.19 higher at
2,105.19, 2.8 per cent up on the week.
BOMBAY was lifted by speculative buying in low volume on expectations of
concessions for brokers in the Reserve Bank of India's credit policy to be
released today. The BSE 30 share index closed 27.40 higher at 3,808.50, up
2.5 per cent on the week.
COLOMBO remained short of foreign interest, but domestic buying took the
all-share index up 11.70 to 1,006.07, for a week's decline of 3.7 per cent.
SEOUL failed to maintain its strength, as consolidation started in reaction
to seven straight gains. The composite stock index shed 2.00 to 950.45,
still 2.4 per cent higher on the week.

FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil easier ahead of key congress
vote

Brazil
Sao Paulo eased from the day's highs to stand down 3.3 per cent by
mid-morning as prices continued to test support and resistance levels.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares was down 538 at 15,840.
Chart analysts noted that the index had a support level between 15,800 and
16,000 and resistance barriers between 16,800 and 17,300. 'With the lack of
important economic and political news, trading has become more
technically-driven over the last few days,' one chart analyst said.
Investors were continuing to wait for congress to vote on a presidential
decree creating the country's single price index. Reports said that the
vote, which had been originally scheduled for May 11, was now postponed
until next Tuesday.
Analysts said that the approval of the decree was a major element in the
government's plan to move forward with its anti-inflation package.
Among active issues Telebras was down 4.6 per cent at Cr45.90 and Petrobras
was down 4.3 per cent at Cr110.
On Thursday the market had risen nearly 6 per cent.
Mexico
Baring Securities in New York said that it was advising investors to start
buying the Mexican stock market more aggressively on expectations for
improved economic growth in the second half of 1994, Reuter reports. Barings
said that it expected real earnings per share growth of 12 per cent for a
sample of companies in 1994, followed by 19 per cent in 1995.

FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg's industrial shares rose to new highs as the mood of investors
remained positive following the week's political developments.
The industrial index added 73 to 6,710, for a gain on the week - shortened
by two separate closures for holidays - of 3 per cent.
The overall rose 77 to 5,533, while the gold index added 15 to 1,893.
Dealers said that most of the buying interest continued to come from local
investors with foreign institutions remaining absent.
One dealer noted that foreign investors appeared to be waiting to see what
policies the new government of President Nelson Mandela would adopt before
commiting themselves.
SA Breweries gained R2.50 to R104.00 after posting a 14 per cent rise in
earnings in the year ending March 31.
The steady performance of the bullion price at new upper levels underpinned
gold shares, but no major buying was seen until gold moved beyond Dollars
383 an ounce.
Among gold stocks Kloof rose 25 cents to R44.75 as a delegation of striking
mineworkers met management in an effort to bring to an end a strike by the
majority of the work force.
Elsewhere De Beers rose R3.35 to R110.75 and Anglos R5.50 to R235.
The mining house, Johnnies, jumped R5 to R95, Gencor rose 35 cents to
R10.10, and Rangold 50 cents to R7.50. Among other movers Argus added R1.50
to R40, Pick n Pay Stores made 60 cents to R14.85, Toyota gained R1 to R30,
and Sun International was up R1 at R48.

FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Big programme trade unsettles equity
market - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK share prices fell sharply in late trading, ignoring a solid opening on
Wall Street and in US Treasury bonds after encouraging US inflation numbers
for April.
Dealers, at first perplexed by the sudden slide in the UK market, said that
most of the pressure came from the futures market where one marketmaking
firm unloaded the future before unwinding a substantial programme trade
involving both FT-SE 100 and mid cap stocks.
At the close of a busy trading session, the FT-SE 100 index closed 18.6
lower at 3,119.2, having been in positive territory at the start of the day.
The FT-SE Mid 250 index was also badly hit, closing 20.6 off at 3,721.8.
Gilt-edged stocks, on the other hand, were in good form throughout the
session, opening around  1/4 higher and moving ahead strongly to show gains
in the region of  3/4 before settling around a half-point higher on balance.
The Bank of England said its next auction, on May 25, would involve the sale
of a short-dated convertible. Details of the auction are expected next week.
The equity market began the day in good heart, with marketmakers marking
share prices higher in response to the strong performance by US bonds and
Wall Street overnight and following the highly encouraging economic data on
producer prices and the restated retail sales numbers for March.
But the early strength of the market was gradually eroded by the effects of
a disappointing first quarter performance by Unilever, one of the UK's
leading companies, and the emergence of end-account profit-taking.
The FT-SE 100 rose to the day's best level, 3,141.9, up 4.1 early in the
session but then ran into small but persistent selling, triggered partly by
the disappointing Unilever figures but also by selling ahead of the US
inflation numbers.
US Treasury bonds and the Dow Jones index moved ahead strongly, driving
European bond and equity markets with them following the lower than expected
inflation figures for April, before stalling.
The big downwards pressure in London was exerted in mid-afternoon, when a
big seller of the FT-SE future drove the index sharply lower and prompted a
similar retreat in the cash market.
At its worst the FT-SE 100 was down 21.6 at 3,116.2, before a late rally.
Most marketmakers were unperturbed by the late slide in the market. 'It was
looking tired and only needed a small push to go sharply lower,' said one
senior trader.
Others, however, remained extremely cautious, pointing out that although the
FT-SE 100 had closed well above the 3,100 level there was no real confidence
in the market that international bonds had seen the worst of the recent
turbulence.
Turnover in the market yesterday was 671.7m shares, surprisingly high given
that it was the last session of the three-week account.
The two oil sectors of the market gave another strong performance as crude
oil prices moved towards the Dollars 17 a barrel mark. The majors attracted
fresh support from the US while the Lasmo defence document, responding to
the all-paper offer from Enterprise Oil, saw another big turnover in Lasmo
shares.
Over the week the FT-SE 100 index has risen 17.2 while the Mid Cap has
fallen 49.2. Dealers said the outperformance of the leading stocks was a
reflection of sharply increased institutional activity.

FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness speculation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There were contradictory stories in Guinness, with turnover reaching 5.5m
shares, and the share price shading 2 to 496p. Some traders suggested that
the drinks group was delivering a bearish message of tough trading
conditions to institutional shareholders ahead of its agm on Thursday.
However, others in the market were predicting a different outcome, pointing
to the expected recovery in the Spanish beer market, as well as better news
on spirits sales.
There was also speculation that LVMH, Guinness's French partner, may be
about to unload the 4 per cent of Guinness shares it has agreed to sell as
part of the two groups' recent restructuring agreement - although the
deadline to do this is not until June 1995.
A stronger US dollar and a rise in the price of Brent crude lifted oil
stocks. BP was helped further by an upbeat presentation to analysts and rose
2 to 406p. Enterprise gained 2 to 431p as the market studied the defence
document responding to its hostile bid for Lasmo. Lasmo was very heavily
traded, closing 2 off at 154p with volume reaching 16m.
Newspaper stocks were boosted by a well-received trading statement from the
Telegraph and the annual meeting at Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
which both cited the upturn in advertising. Telegraph shares gained 9 to
620p and thinly-traded Daily Mail Trust improved 37 to 1465p in the
ordinaries. However profit-taking saw Pearson ease back 5 to 673p.
Mining group RTZ gained 10 to 858p on the continued rise in the price of
copper and other base metals on world markets.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome jumped 7 to 586p in response to a positive
medical journal report. An article in The Lancet, the UK medical industry
journal, said a treatment associated with the company reduced the death rate
and recurrence rate for patients with a form of cancer.
Participation in a big sell programme said to have been carried out by US
investment bank Goldman Sachs and a couple of badly handled sell orders hit
Lloyds Bank which fell 10 to 567p.
Rolls-Royce gave up 7 to 182p, after trade of 5.1m, on fears that sales of
spare parts were below expectations. Further selling came from SG Warburg
which advised investors to switch out of Rolls and into British Aerospace.
BAe eased 7 to 503p on light profit-taking after its strong run earlier this
week, which followed a two-day visit by analysts to the group's defence
operations. Sentiment was also boosted by speculation that BAe had won a
lucrative order to re-fit the Tornado fighter aircraft.
Instrumentation and project engineering company Whessoe tumbled 35 after
reporting a fall in interim profits and saying it is unlikely there will be
an improvement in its performance in the short term.
News that the recovery in west European car demand was faltering hit several
automotive-related stocks. These included dealers T Cowie, which shed 8 to
300p and Lex Service, down 11 at 502p.
There was good volume in Cable and Wireless as dealers reported a large line
of stock in the market. Turnover was just short of 7m, with the shares
sliding 5 to 455p.
Bredero Properties retreated 4 1/2 to 10 1/2 p after announcing an agreed
takeover by Slough Estates, up 8 at 248p. Slough, which offered 10p a share,
already owns 49.5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of Bredero.

FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever was the biggest casualty in the
FT-SE 100 list yesterday after unveiling disappointing first quarter
results. Underlying pre-tax profits below the lowest market predictions saw
the shares slump and remain under pressure all day as analysts slashed
full-year forecasts. The shares closed 57 off at 1023p with turnover a busy
3.7m.
Flat trading in the company's key markets was compounded by tough conditions
in the US detergents market. The results were accompanied by a cautious
trading statement which further depressed sentiment. Mr Carl Short at
Strauss Turnbull, a long-term Unilever bull, moved the stock off his
short-term buy list. But he added: 'Although the news flow from the company
could be dull for a while, it's important to remember that the first quarter
results are a poor guide to long-term trends.'
At Smith New Court, Mr Tim Potter said that some of the worrying trends seen
at the end of last year were continuing. 'Even if there is recovery in its
major markets, trading conditions will remain intensively difficult because
consumers are value-driven. We remain bearish.' He shaved his full-year
forecast back to Pounds 2.35bn, with Strauss pulling back to a similar
level.

FT  14 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: New gain on Portals bid news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sudden surge in the share price of Portals, the specialist paper group,
prompted the company to announce that it had received a bid approach. The
statement threw a spotlight on De La Rue, bank note printer, Arjo Wiggins
Appleton, the paper producer, and the Dutch group KNP BT, as potential
suitors.
Portals, which controls 50 per cent of the world market for bank note paper,
first saw its shares rise sharply on Tuesday. The gain was apparently on the
back of rumours that the company would secure a contract linked to the
redesign of the US dollar. Yesterday, the shares jumped a further 99 to
765p. Market sources said concern over the earlier share price rise had
prompted a Stock Exchange inquiry. The Exchange would only say it
'automatically looks at any unusual share price movements'.
Arjo refused to comment on the speculation, although company sources were
said to have denied the rumour. De La Rue, which has a cash pile estimated
at around Pounds 200m, was refusing to be drawn.
Shares in Arjo slipped 1 1/2 to 297p. De La Rue fell 7 to 878p after hitting
a low of 872p. Analysts said Portals had a break-up value of 800p a share,
but could attract around 950p, which would translate to an offer of about
Pounds 615m.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar softer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar finished slightly softer on the foreign exchanges yesterday as
weaker than expected inflation figures introduced some doubt about the
outlook for US monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith.
The market has factored in an imminent tightening from the Federal Reserve,
but a spate of weaker than expected economic data has brought into question
the extent by which rates are likely to rise.
The US currency finished in London at DM1.6671 against the dollar from
DM1.6708. Against the yen it closed at Y104.755 from Y104.505.
The Greek drachma was under attack following the announcement of legislation
to free all capital transfers in July. Anticipating a possible devaluation,
the market drove the drachma down by more than one drachma to close at
Dr148.10 against the D-Mark.
The D-Mark was little changed in Europe, with trading quiet as many dealers
stayed away from their desks following the Ascension day holiday on
Thursday.
The Bank of Spain cuts its key money rate to 7.50 per cent from 7.75 per
cent, and the Bank of Ireland cut its short-term facility rate to 6.25 per
cent from 6.5 per cent.
Sterling traded very narrowly with the sterling index unchanged at 80.1
throughout the day. It closed at DM2.5012 from DM2.5052 against the D-Mark.
Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.5004 from Dollars 1.4994.
US consumer inflation for April rose by only 0.1 per cent, compared with
forecasts of a 0.3 per cent gain. This led some analysts to revise down
their estimates of what constitutes the 'neutral' monetary policy stance the
Fed is seeking.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO bank, said he could not
see the federal funds rate - currently 3.75 per cent - rising above 4.5 per
cent in the next few months.
But Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said
the signal from the bond market 'is that the Fed is going to have to catch
up with inflation expectations.' With the US economy growing at close to
twice its potential growth rate, Mr Hannah said a 2.5 to 3 per cent real
short rate was probably appropriate - meaning Fed funds at about 5.5 to 6
per cent.
The market took Spain's rate cut to be politically motivated, given that the
government is under considerable pressure over various corruption scandals,
and recent inflation data is unexceptional. Also, the cut was made against
the background of a currency that has been fairly weak recently. The peseta
finished in London at Pta82.65 against the D-Mark from Pta82.48.
The Irish punt showed little reaction to the 25 basis point cut in the
short-term facility rate to 6.25 per cent. It finished at IPounds 0.409
against the D-Mark from IPounds 0.410.
Sterling futures had another good day with the December contract finishing
nine basis points firmer at 94.02. Nearly 22,000 lots were traded. Euromark
volumes were low and there was little movement.
The Bank of England did not operate in the UK money markets after revising
its forecast from a Pounds 250m shortage, to a flat position.
In Germany, call money was firm at 5.45/5.55 per cent, compared to the repo
rate of 5.35 per cent.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper and coffee stir up
a froth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Froth and frenzy returned to the commodity markets yesterday as US
investment funds piled in with more buying orders. Their efforts helped
boost copper's price on the London Metal Exchange to its highest level for
14 months, nickel was at a 15-month peak and aluminium reached a 22-month
high. At the same time, coffee prices soared to a fresh five-year peak.
The rush in the metal markets started after the LME reported its copper
stocks had dropped, by 21,700 tonnes to 424,700 tonnes, the lowest for a
year and 31 per cent below the 16-year peak in February.
Copper for delivery in three months jumped another Dollars 60.50 a tonne by
the close yesterday to Dollars 2,179 to end the week Dollars 151.50 ahead.
The red metal also moved into backwardation, when a premium is charged for
immediate delivery. On the New York Commodity Exchange by midday copper had
burst through the psychologically-important Dollars 1 a lb (Dollars 2,204 a
tonne) level to Dollars 1.40.
Mr Viktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, part of the Deutsche Bank Group,
suggested the copper price rise was to some extent supported by market
fundamentals. Demand was high in the US, recovering in Europe and doing well
in Asia. LME stocks were probably down to a level where all freely-available
metal had gone.
In recent years, banks and other financial institutions have made a modest
profit by buying LME stock and negotiating with warehouses special, low,
rents for storing it for up to three years. Mr Bielski suggested a great
deal of the remaining copper in LME warehouses was tied up by this type of
deal. He also suggested that copper might go to Dollars 1.05 a lb (Dollars
2,314 a tonne) in the present rally but 'Dollars 1.10 would unlock the metal
held under financing agreements.'
The investment funds' computer-driven operations also put nickel in their
sites yesterday, sending the price through various chart resistance points
and driving the LME three-month price up by Dollars 432.50 a tonne to
Dollars 6,367.50, up Dollars 590 a tonne or nearly 10 per cent over the
week.
The funds also brought aluminium to the party for the first time in this
rally. Three-month aluminium closed at Dollars 1,353 a tonne, up Dollars
24.50. Aluminium was ahead only by Dollars 20.50 a tonne over the week.
The sky appeared to be the limit for the coffee market this week. The London
market has been spurred by strong New York buying where the price for
arabica coffee futures broke through 100 cents a lb.
The International Coffee Organisation composite coffee price reached 104
cents per lb which led the members of the Association of Coffee Producing
Countries to say they could begin to release 4m bags held as part of their
retention scheme. Brazil sanctioned on Thursday the sale of some of its
stocks held as part of the scheme. But even so, supplies are likely to
remain tight.
Coffee stayed on the boil yesterday. Traders said there was little fresh
news but there was heavy fund buying. New York again set the tone, helping
to push the July futures price on the London Commodity Exchange up another
Dollars 100 a tonne to Dollars 1,990. Second-month prices subsided later as
traders took profits and settled back to Dollars 1,956, up Dollars 66.
Cocoa futures rose this week in the wake of coffee, but traders said the
rise was driven mostly by speculative activity. Yesterday, buying dried up
once July peaked at Pounds 972 a tonne. Prices tumbled later to close
unchanged at Pounds 955.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sprint stock rises on talk of
EDS link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sprint, the US telecommunications group, rose yesterday amid
reports that it had been in discussions with Electronic Data Systems, a
subsidiary of General Motors, about an alliance to compete in the multimedia
information industry.
The companies declined to comment but Wall Street analysts said such a deal
could have advantages for both companies and send competitive ripples
through the US telecommunications sector.
Sprint share closed Dollars  1/2 higher on the day at Dollars 36 5/8 while
General Motors E shares - which represent a call on EDS's dividend stream -
rose Dollars   1/8 to Dollars 33.
Sprint is the third largest long-distance US telecommunications group with
large operations in cellular telephony and local telephone services. It is
the only large North American communications company which has interests in
all three areas, though other groups are tending in this direction as
regulatory and commercial pressures allow them.
EDS is the world's leading computing services company and operates its own
global, digital communications network on behalf of corporate clients.
EDS is known to have held talks on possible alliances with many of the
world's leading telephone companies - including British Telecom - over the
past few years.
Analysts said that Sprint, with its well-known brand name and fast-growing
cellular service, could give EDS a central role in US multimedia services.
Speculation about the future of EDS has risen sharply over the past few days
following an agreement over pension plan contributions between GM and a
government regulatory agency. The agreement freed EDS from liability for GM
pension contributions if EDS left the group, giving GM the freedom to sell
all of the unit or a stake in it.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alumax to build Dollars 75m
parts plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alumax, the third-largest US aluminium producer, is to build a Dollars 75m
plant on an 82-acre site at Jackson, Tennessee, to produce car parts using
its proprietary semi-solid metal forming, or SSF, technology.
The move underlines the aluminium industry's belief that it expects
increased demand from the automotive industry.
SSF is claimed to be the first new metal forming process for decades. The
Alumax technology, covered by more than 60 patents, involves
specially-processed aluminium billets forged into high-quality components
with one stroke. Alumax says the components have virtually all the detail of
the finished part and need little, if any, further processing.
Chrysler and Ford in the US have been testing engine and air conditioning
components made by the process for two years.
Mr Alan Born, Alumax chairman, said the new plant, to be completed in two
years would eventually employ 500 people.
Mr Bond Evans, president, said at Alumax's annual meeting that the aluminium
industry had seen the bottom of the economic cycle and the worst of the
problems associated with the break-up of the Soviet Union.

International Service Systems, the industrial cleaning group, yesterday

The group said that an issue at the present time could not be carried out at
a price level satisfactory to ISS. The Danish group last year acquired
National Cleaning Company, a US group with 20,000 employees and an annual
turnover of about Dollars 500m, which means that 40 per cent of ISS's
turnover takes place in North America.
The acquisition cost ISS DKr585m (Dollars 87.3m) and was financed by bank
loans with possible equity financing. An issue of 3m shares was planned in
the US, and the group had hoped to raise about DKr620m with the issue priced
at about DKr225 per share.
ISS B shares fell by DKr8 to DKr231 in Copenhagen yesterday. ISS's turnover
in 1993 was about DKr13.30bn. National Cleaning Company was included for the
final seven months of the year. Net profits increased to DKr461m from
DKr265m.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Oppenheimer leads Russia team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of De Beers, will head a team to
meet Russian officials in Moscow next week. It comes as the South African
group's Dollars 5bn diamond marketing contract with Russia appears to be
under strain.
Among the Russian negotiators will be Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of
Komdragmet, the Russian diamond and precious stones committee, who is
demanding that Russia keep 25 per cent of its rough diamond trade rather
than the 5 per cent agreed under the terms of the contract with De Beers.
Mr Leonid Gurevich, deputy chairman of Komdragmet, told Diamantaire, a
subscription-only newsletter published by the CRU International consultancy
group, that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, had
authorised a government committee to meet Mr Oppenheimer, making this the
highest level of official negotiations for De Beers in Russia since it
concluded its five-year contract in 1990.
De Beers controls at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut)
diamonds and Russia supplies about 25 per cent of the diamonds De Beers
sells. Mr Mark Cockle, editor of Diamantaire, said the sudden decision of Mr
Oppenheimer to leave for Moscow 'underlines the predicament facing De Beers
over what strategy to adopt with Russia'. He said Komdragmet officials had
shown a preference for dealing directly with members of the Oppenheimer
family rather than with Mr Gary Ralfe, managing director of De Beers central
selling organisation.
Mr Ralfe recently criticised Russia for selling diamonds in breach of the
contract.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: ITD in Dollars 1.6bn Bangkok
float

<TEXT>
Italian Thai Development (ITD), Thailand's biggest construction and civil
engineering company, is to be floated on the stock exchange in Bangkok later
this year in a deal which could value the company at Dollars 1.6bn, brokers
and ITD executives say.
The construction company, which dominates the Thai market for large
infrastructure projects, is part of the ITD group founded in 1958 by the
late Mr Giorgio Berlingieri and Mr Chaijudh Karnasuta. The group is
controlled by the Karnasuta family.
They are planning to sell 10 per cent of the construction company, or 25m
shares, in the initial public offering in the next couple of months, to
raise about Bt4bn (Dollars 157m), although the exact price of the shares has
yet to be finalised. Jardine Fleming Thanakom and Goldman Sachs are co-lead
managers, and 30 per cent of the issue will be set aside for foreign
investors.
Company executives say the listing gives ITD the chance to raise capital
more cheaply than by bank borrowing.
'In the old days the government was our main customer, but that's slowly
changing,' said Mr William Zentgraf, managing director of Italthai Holding.
'More and more of the work is coming in private concessions and to do these
you need capital.'
He noted that Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, one of ITD's listed
competitors, had recently raised Dollars 80m for 10 years at 1.75 per cent
through a Euroconvertible debenture - a far cheaper way of borrowing money
than anything available to an unlisted company. 'As soon as you're on the
stock exchange, all of these other doors open up for you,' said Mr Zentgraf.
Among other projects, the company is installing new provincial telephone
lines as part of a 1m line concession won by Thai Telephone and
Telecommunication, and it has a 14 per cent stake in TT&amp;T.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney hopes to seal debt
shake-up next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, hopes next week to call an
extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to approve the terms of
its FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) emergency financial restructuring package.
The meeting, which is expected to be held in a month's time, will mark the
start of the final stage of completing the complex rescue deal. Euro
Disney's shareholders will be asked to endorse proposals to stage a FFr6bn
rights issue, which forms the core of the restructuring package.
If all goes well the details of the rights issue will be announced a few
days after the meeting.
The issue is scheduled for completion in mid-July, enabling Euro Disney to
complete its restructuring before the French summer holiday in August.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, has promised to take up its full entitlement of the rights issue. A
number of the banks in Euro Disney's 61-strong loan syndicates have agreed
to underwrite the remaining 51 per cent of the shares.
Euro Disney last week took the tactical step of extending to shareholders an
offer of warrants to buy shares at FFr40.00 for 10 years. The offer was
initially available only to Walt Disney and the banks. The extension was
interpreted by analysts as an attempt to placate the ordinary shareholders.
However, the group announced it was reducing the par value of its shares to
FFr5.00 from FFr10.00. This sparked speculation that the rights issue would
be deeply discounted, raising the risk that ordinary shareholders (many of
whom have incurred heavy losses on their Euro Disney shares) would face
heavy dilution because of the issue.
Euro Disney, which is advised by S G Warburg in London, had hoped to hold
the EGM at an earlier date and to complete the rights issue by the end of
June. However, persuading all its banks to agree to the restructuring took
longer than expected.
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, joint leaders of the
syndicates, have for months been in negotiations with the other lenders.
Some of the smaller banks have taken an unexpectedly tough stance causing a
delay in the completion of the deal.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Rescue plan lifts
Metallgesellschaft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft shares jumped nearly 15 per cent yesterday after the
German metals, mining and industrial conglomerate which came to the verge of
bankruptcy last January, published details of its planned restructuring
programme in its employees' newspaper.
The detailed account of the cost-cutting measures planned by Mr Kajo
Neukirchen, chief executive, coincided with a strong buy-note from a
London-based securities house recommending that investors purchase
Metallgesellschaft shares.
The shares rose DM36 to DM280 yesterday, following a DM17 rise on Wednesday,
with the result that the shares have risen by 25 per cent this week.
Metallgesellschaft said in its internal newspaper it was aiming to increase
liquidity and implement cost-savings totalling DM4bn (Dollars 2.3bn).
The planned reduction of the workforce by 7,500 people from 43,000 at the
end of last year would reduce personnel costs by DM550m, Metallgesellschaft
said.
A reduction of inventory levels would save a further DM500m.
Metallgesellschaft said it planned to save additional, large amounts of cash
by reducing investment levels and cutting borrowings.
Analysts said these figures were in line with their estimates and suggested
the main impetus for the share price movement came from the buy-note
released by UBS earlier this week. In this, Mr Peter Dupont argued that
Metallgesellschaft's shares - hitherto avoided by international investors in
the light of the scale of the group's problems - were oversold.
Drawing parallels with the share price performance of other near-bankrupt
German companies when entering a recovery phase, the UBS analyst argued that
in the case of Metallgesellschaft 'a major recovery story is about to unfold
based on aggressive cost-cutting, a strengthening industrial economy and
firmer metal and oil prices'.
Metallgesellschaft came to the brink of collapse after a US subsidiary ran
up DM2.3bn losses trading in oil derivatives. It survived after banks
provided a DM3.4bn rescue package. At current share prices, the group has a
market capitalisation of about DM4bn.
Analysts at other institutions cautioned yesterday that Metallgesellschaft's
shares remained a highly speculative investment, in spite of the surge in
price this week. The group lost DM1.88bn last year and is likely to lose a
further DM1.24bn in the current financial year to the end of September.

FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Austrian privatisation terms set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation next week of 51 per cent of VA-Techonologie, Austria's largest
engineering group, is expected to raise Sch6.9bn (Dollars 585m), almost
Sch2bn more than anticipated when the company's privatisation was announced
last November.
Following strong interest from international institutional investors in
Europe and the US, the 7.65m shares on offer have been priced at Sch900 per
share - at the upper end of initial valuations. This would value the company
at Sch13.5bn. 'Demand has been consistently strong across all markets,' the
company said.
VA-Tech's privatisation - the largest Austrian flotation - is part of a
government programme to cut the state's role in industry which it hopes will
raise about Sch20bn over the next 18 months.
The company is owned 75 per cent by OIAG, the Austrian state holding company
for the nationalised industries, and it has a 25 per cent cross shareholding
with VA-Stahl, the steel group which is being restructured to prepare it for
privatisation by 1996.
The flotation on the Vienna stock exchange is set to start on Monday and run
all of next week, but it is expected to close early due to high demand.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: The Telegraph turns in Pounds 16m but
circulation slips below 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of the Daily Telegraph last month sunk below the symbolic 1m mark for
the first time in many years.
The official circulation figures for April for the daily, whose readers have
a higher age profile than those of most other national titles, missed the
mark by a whisker.
The average for the month was 998,921 copies, although this represented a
decline of only 0.17 per cent in a market down by 0.43 per cent.
'The FT did 10 times worse than us with a 1.69 per cent drop to 298,971,'
said Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of the Telegraph Group.
For good measure he added that The Guardian had dropped below 400,000 to
397,177, although the 30p Times put on 1.63 per cent to 478,419.
The mixed circulation news came as the Telegraph announced pre-tax profits
of Pounds 16m for the first quarter of 1994, against Pounds 19.1m for the
comparable period - although that figure was boosted by a Pounds 6.5m profit
on the sale of the group's investment in Trinity International.
Advertising revenue was up by about 18 per cent, and the company said that
the initial recovery from recession was continuing. Advertising revenues
were approaching levels last seen in 1989.
'The business is as sound as a bell,' said Mr Cooke, who added that
circulation of the Daily Telegraph would soon be back up above 1m again.
Turnover increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 68.8m, and operating profit at
Pounds 12.1m was up by more than 16 per cent.
Earnings per share, excluding profit on sale of investments, rose from 5.9p
to 8.4p.
For the six months to March average sales of the Daily Telegraph fell 1.65
per cent to 1,016,468, although sales of the Sunday Telegraph increased by
more than 6 per cent to 617,505 in the same period.
Further evidence of a recovery in the newspaper advertising market came
yesterday from Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the
Financial Times.
At its annual meeting the group reported a 'significant recovery' in
advertising revenues.
Lord Blakenham, chairman, said the first four months was never much of a
guide to the full year 'but advertising revenue was higher in the first four
months, led by the Financial Times'.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pearson thought to have pulled out of
library deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media and entertainment group, is believed to have pulled out
of a deal to buy the ITC programme library - an acquisition that would have
been worth about Dollars 175m (Pounds 120m).
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, was favourite to buy the
library which contains many of the programmes made by Lord Grade, such as
The Prisoner and films such as On Golden Pond.
ITC, with more than 10,000 hours of programmes and films, is owned by Morgan
Private Equity, in turn a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings.
The apparent failure of the deal comes in the same week that Pearson
announced a 'global strategic alliance' with the BBC to launch jointly
satellite television channels in Europe and the rest of the world.
The purchase of such a library would have fitted in well with Pearson's
stated strategy of expanding in the media and entertainment sectors and
concentrating on the acquisition of intellectual property rights.
It has already acquired a significant programme library through the purchase
of Thames, now the largest independent production company in the UK. Pearson
could not be contacted last night to comment on the ITC deal.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Speciality Shops flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speciality Shops has become the fourth property company to launch a
flotation within a week.
The specialist in-town shopping centre company is raising Pounds 10.6m from
a placing which values it at Pounds 28.7m.
Speciality Shops is also issuing shares to PosTel Properties, the property
arm of the UK's largest pension fund manager, in exchange for the Pounds
12.5m purchase of the Jackson shopping centre in Bishop's Stortford, Herts.
The deal will give PosTel a 28 per cent stake in the company. It is in line
with the pension fund's policy of increasing flexibility on properties held
jointly for the Post Office and BT pension schemes.
This would enable it to separate holdings if the Post Office scheme is
restructured.
Speciality Shops was formed in 1986 with the backing of a number of
substantial institutions. It has focused on investing in, and managing,
small to medium-sized shopping centres.
The company is placing 9.23m shares at 130p a share, of which 490,274 are
being sold by existing institutional shareholders. The company will have
gearing of 63 per cent after flotation.
Its properties have been valued at Pounds 31.3m, or 141.4p a share, putting
the shares at an 8 per cent discount to assets. After the latest
acquisition, it will own five shopping centres, aside from its small trading
portfolio.
The issue is sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and trading is expected to
comment on May 20.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Slough bids for balance of Bredero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough Estates has launched a bid for the remaining 50.5 per cent of its
associate, Bredero Properties, the developer which was all but sunk by its
ambitious Centre West project in Hammersmith, London.
The bid values Bredero at Pounds 3.7m, reflecting the company's precarious
financial situation after it breached its banking covenants.
Bredero's shares fell 4 1/2 p to 10 1/2 p on news of the 10p a share offer,
which is recommended by the independent board.
Like recently-collapsed Rosehaugh and Speyhawk, Bredero was hit hard by
rising interest rates and falling property values at a time when it was
proceeding with a highly geared property development programme. The company
survived through a string of property disposals, and the ring fencing of one
of its mainassets, Phase 1 of Centre West. It now has little left.
At its 1993 year-end, Bredero had a negative net asset value attributable to
its ordinary shareholders of Pounds 3.44m, compared with an asset value of
Pounds 100m in December 1989.
Yesterday, it announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 194,000 (Pounds 77m) for
the year to end-December after taking in a Pounds 908,000 exceptional profit
from the write-back of previous provisions.
Bredero's only significant remaining assets are a 50 per cent stake in a
retail development in Buchanan Street, Glasgow, and the site for Centre West
Phase 2 in Hammersmith.
It has no firm income stream, following its recent sales of stakes in the
Ashley Centre and Paisley Centre, which helped reduce bank debt from Pounds
53m to Pounds 8m.
Slough bought into Bredero in December 1986, paying Pounds 14.6m for a 49.5
per cent stake. At the time, it launched a takeover offer at 145p a share.
Even after a substantial rights issue, its stake now carries a value of only
Pounds 1.8m.
Slough Estates claims it is taking a long-term view of the properties, while
protecting its investment - which includes a Pounds 10m preference
shareholding.
Mr Alan Chisholm, Bredero managing director, said the company had been
negotiating alternative offers and refinancing, but these had fallen
through.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff offers farewell Pounds 1.2m
pay-out
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pittencrieff, the natural resources and communications company, is offering
share-holders a farewell Pounds 1.2m pay-out, as the delayed demerger of the
two divisions got under way again yesterday.
Shareholders will receive a 4p second interim dividend before the demerger
takes effect at the end of June.
Mr Terry Heneaghan, Pittencrieff chief executive, said the company had been
unable to pay a final due to the demerger.
'We thought shareholders deserved the dividend and we had the resources to
pay it,' he said.
Pittencrieff also announced that it had scrapped plans to list the
communications company in the UK through an introduction.
Mr Heneaghan said the complications of meeting the requirements of the US
and UK regulatory bodies would have meant a further delay of up to four

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Unilever disappoints with Pounds 449m in
opening quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's shares fell 57p to Pounds 10.23p yesterday in response to
first-quarter figures showing tough trading in both the US and Europe.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 449m to end-March, up 2 per cent from last year's
Pounds 440m, were at the low end of expectations. US operating profits were
halved at Pounds 10m, on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 1.3bn, giving
operating margins of just 0.7 per cent.
Unilever said the fall in US profits was entirely due to the price war in
liquid detergents, which began last summer and was already doing damage in
last year's second half. US sales of personal products were sharply up on
last year, and food and chemicals had also done well.
European operating profits were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 303m, on sales
up 1 per cent at Pounds 3.64bn. However, profits were helped by undisclosed
proceeds from Falcon, a Swedish drinks business sold in the period.
Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said trading conditions in Europe remained
difficult, though speciality chemicals were 'encouraging'.
In the rest of the world, operating profits were Pounds 167m (Pounds 159m),
on sales of Pounds 1.75bn (Pounds 1.6bn). Performance had been good in
south-east Asia and Latin America, Sir Michael said, but Brazil had been
'difficult'.
Group turnover was up 4 per cent at Pounds 6.69bn. Group operating profit
was also up 4 per cent at Pounds 480m. There was a sharp rise in net
interest charges from Pounds 31m to Pounds 55m, due partly to the redemption
of preference shares and partly to higher interest rates. This was partly
offset by a Pounds 13m exceptional profit on property sales in Europe.
After tax of Pounds 138m (Pounds 133m) and minorities of Pounds 12m (Pounds
14m), net profit was up 2 per cent at Pounds 299m, calculated at constant
exchange rates. At current rates profits were fractionally lower, as were
earnings per share at 15.74p (15.8p).
During the period, Unilever maintained an active programme of 12
acquisitions and 10 disposals, at a net cost of Pounds 520m. Net debt rose
Pounds 400m to Pounds 2.2bn, with gearing rising to 30 per cent. This was
due to the cost of refinancing preference capital as well as to the
acquisition programme, the company said.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Portals shares jump 99p on bid approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Portals, the security and specialist paper maker, jumped yesterday
after the group revealed it had received an approach, 'which may or may not
lead to an offer being made for the company'.
The shares closed 99p higher at 765p, having traded as high as 795p earlier
in the day. The shares has risen earlier in the week amid market rumours of
a possible bid.
Yesterday Portals declined to elaborate on its announcement which,
nevertheless, triggered speculation about the identity of the potential
bidder and the value of the shares in any bid battle.
Analysts suggested the group, which also includes environmental protection
and control products operations, could have a break-up value of about 800p
per share. However, they also suggested that a bidder might have to pay 950p
to Pounds 10 to win board backing for an agreed takeover.
Among companies suggested by analysts as possible bidders were domestic
competitors like Arjo Wiggins Appleton and customers such as De La Rue, the
banknote printer, seeking to integrate their operations.
Both Arjo Wiggins and De La Rue declined to comment on the speculation
although Mr Les Cullen, De La Rue's finance director, acknowledged that
Portals was a company 'we know very well'.
However, some analysts pointed out that an acquisition by a printer could
also have serious disadvantages - not least because it would almost
certainly result in the loss of Portals' contracts with rivals.

PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance broker, reported a

with a profit of Pounds 2.07m last time.
The outcome, which was struck after providing some Pounds 1m for

Pounds 8.39m to Pounds 7.05m.
Losses per share came out at 0.5p (6.4p earnings), and the interim dividend
is cut from 1.5p to 0.5p.
The shares closed 11p lower at 62p.
Lord Pearson, chairman, said there were clear signs that capacity was
returning to the market and, with profit growth now weighted increasingly
towards the second half, he expected a healthy second six months.

Two companies under his control, Chelsea Village and Chelsea Football Club,

recent appointment of Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross as liquidator to
CFAC, the former Chelsea Football and Athletic Company, was invalidly made.
The statement said that 90 per cent of CFAC's debts had already been paid

Chelsea is seeking to appoint a liquidator 'who will finalise the affairs of
CFAC in the most cost-effective manner and in the best interests of all the

The remaining 75 per cent will be owned by Security Capital Realty, a
company chaired by Mr William Sanders, who is a shareholder in Property
Trust of America, and Security Capital Industrial Trust.
Security Capital Atlantic plans to float on the New York Stock Exchange as a
real estate investment trust. The flotation would be, at the earliest, at
the end of the year, said Mr Elliott Bernerd, Chelsfield chairman.
The minimum value of Laing Properties' holding in Security Capital Atlantic
has been underwritten through put options that can be exercised over the
next two years.
Cash received will be used to repay existing bank borrowings of Laing
Properties, including Dollars 85m currently guaranteed by Chelsfield and
P&amp;O.
Mr Bernerd said that the transaction was consistent with Chelsfield's stated
intention in its prospectus last December to float its residential
properties in a real estate investment trust. Volatile market conditions
caused the plan to be revised.
Mr Bernerd said that the decision to sell to Security Capital Atlantic was
'a better solution' than the original plan because it gave Laing the option
to convert the entire portfolio into cash.
He said he was also pleased with the amount of cash immediately raised from
and the pricing of the portfolio, which had clawed back the provisions made
following its acquisition in 1991. 'In the round we are back where we
started from,' he said.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House in talks over Ritz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House is believed to be in discussions which could result in
Mandarin Oriental, the Hong Kong-based hotel group, managing the Ritz in
London.
Trafalgar House had been hoping to sell the Ritz, but took it off the market
last year when it did not receive what it considered adequate offers.
Trafalgar House and Mandarin Oriental have the same chairman, Mr Simon
Keswick. Jardine Matheson, which controls Mandarin Oriental, is also
Trafalgar's largest shareholder.
Trafalgar House is thought to have concluded that in the absence of a buyer
for the Ritz, the hotel would benefit from Mandarin Oriental's management
and from being part of a larger international hotel marketing network.
Both companies declined to comment.

FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo rejects 'second class' bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent exploration and production company, yesterday
unveiled its formal defence against the Pounds 1.5bn all-paper bid launched
last month by fellow explorer Enterprise Oil.
Mr Rudolph Agnew, chairman, called on shareholders to reject the bid,
describing it as 'an extraordinarily complicated and second class offer'.
The all-paper offer is for 27 Enterprise A shares and 12 warrants for every
80 Lasmo shares. The unusual equity structure has been criticised by some
institutional investors, who are believed to be keen for a cash offer.
Mr Agnew yesterday said he would 'not ask shareholders to reject a fully
valued bid', adding that his only duty was to 'get every penny he can for
shareholders'.
Enterprise Oil is believed to be considering a range of options for
introducing a cash element. These are thought to include a mechanism for
shareholders to receive cash for the warrant portion of the offer.
Enterprise is believed to have looked at the possibility of securing a group
of specialised investors to under-write the warrants, which would allow it
to provide a cash sweetener to Lasmo shareholders.
The company has repeatedly said it would prefer not to offer cash. However,
Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said yesterday that 'there is
absolutely no technical reason why . . . one should not underwrite the
warrants'.
But he refused to say whether Enterprise was seriously considering such a
move. 'It is not a strategy we are considering over and above any others,'
he said.
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said Enterprise would retain
flexibility but, 'we are committed to the offer we have made'. Lasmo's
defence document emphasised management changes within the company and
highlighted its shift in strategic direction which should reduce the
company's vulnerability to low oil prices.
It dismissed Enterprise's charges that Lasmo did not have the financial
strength to take advantage of all its development opportunities.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said that after completing its current Pounds
219m rights issue Lasmo will be able to spend Pounds 800m on exploration,
assessment and development projects over the next three years, as well as
maintain a Pounds 200m 'cushion' to respond to unforeseen developments.
Enterprise, however, said the figures failed to include the Pounds 450m in
debt that Lasmo needs to repay over the next three years, and charged that
Lasmo was 'still on the edge of the financial risk curve, with no capacity
to take a knock'.
Mr Hearne compared the document to 'an elaborate selling brochure'. He
agreed that Lasmo's assets were attractive, but said a combined company
would have the financial strength to exploit them fully.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Real disabled issues in danger of
being lost in political storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Reverend MICHAEL SHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Nicholas Scott debacle ('Labour clamours for minister's
resignation', May 11) puts us all in danger of throwing out the baby with
the bathwater. Not for the first time, the real issues surrounding disabled
people appear to have been lost as the political storm gathers momentum.
Disabled people and their practical, day-to-day needs appear to have been
pushed back into the shadows.
Back to basics is not a fashionable concept. However, getting down to the
nitty-gritty of ensuring that disabled people emerge from the civil rights
wilderness in which they find themselves is something virtually everyone can
begin to tackle: from seeing the person, not just the wheelchair, through to
providing sensible and accessible housing, wheelchair-friendly public
buildings and streets, decent public transport and appropriate work
opportunities.
The law must be changed. But in the absence of sound political thinking and
sensible legislation, let us see some positive actions from the planners,
architects and employers who really can make the difference.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Facts fall victim to the butcher's knife: Quentin Peel and
Alison Maitland examine the dispute over British beef exports to Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sign pasted up over the meat counter in the Stussgen supermarket in a
Bonn suburb this week said it all.
'Buying meat is a matter of trust,' it declared. 'We sell only German
quality beef.'
To any German consumer, the message is clear: it means there is no British
beef on the counter. For in the minds of most German consumers in recent
weeks, the words British beef have become synonymous with a fear of human
infection with 'mad cow disease' - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The Bonn butcher was relaxed enough: 'I've been getting questions from my
customers all right, wanting to know where the beef was from. But since we
have had the sign up, I think they have been reassured. They know we only
sell fresh local meat.'
Yet statistics for all beef sales in Germany in recent weeks suggest
otherwise. The German wholesale meat traders' association claimed yesterday
there had been 'a dramatic slump in sales'. The butchers' federation in
Frankfurt said the decline was at least 5 per cent in the past few weeks,
since Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, first suggested that a
selective ban on British beef imports was needed to protect the public
against the threat of BSE.
The row threatens to blow up into a serious confrontation, not just between
Britain and Germany, but also between Germany and the rest of the European
Union. The European Commission has until now accepted that Britain has done
enough to control BSE, and prevent any danger of its spreading to other
member states. It is considering tougher enforcement, but nothing so drastic
as an import ban. Yet that is what Germany is threatening to enact
unilaterally if there is no compromise agreed by agriculture ministers by
May 30.
The battle over BSE looks like becoming a classic reconfirmation of national
prejudices in Britain and Germany: the former complaining of German
fanaticism and high-handedness, the latter of sloppy British standards in
vital areas of public health and environmental awareness.
Yet the experts on both sides are far more divided than the battle-lines
suggest. In Germany, the farmers' union has sharply criticised Mr Seehofer
for threatening to go it alone in his battle with Brussels. They fear that
the backlash will hit far more important interests - like their campaign for
more money from Brussels for German farmers who have been forced to
slaughter some 800,000 pigs because of swine fever in the past six months.
There is also a widespread recognition that German consumers are notoriously
prone to overreaction in anything concerning food health - an overreaction
compounded when politicians get involved.
On the other hand, in Britain there are a number of scientists who would
support the German health minister in his contention that as long as there
is the slightest possibility that BSE might cause human infection, the
strictest possible controls should be enforced.
In spite of the BSE scare, total British beef exports rose 51 per cent last
year to Pounds 407m, which the British Meat and Livestock Commission
attributes to successful marketing and the devaluation of sterling. Some
Pounds 355m of that went to the EU, with France by far the largest importer
 -to the tune of Pounds 189m - and Germany the smallest, taking only 900
tonnes, worth Pounds 2.6m.
The British government says the German debate has not only hit beef exports
 -they totalled 2,000 tonnes to Germany in 1992 - but lamb and pork sales as
well. But the real British concern is the domestic beef market, which earned
British farmers Pounds 1.85bn last year.
German observers are quick to point out the irony of the situation. 'I am
amazed that even while there are thousands of animals still being
slaughtered in the UK because of BSE, the British consumer does not appear
to be concerned,' said Mr Richard Brucker, head of the livestock section in
the German farmers' union (DBV). 'Yet here in Germany, where we really don't
have the problem at all, the consumers are all up in arms. It's quite
contradictory.'
The BSE scare in Germany is only the latest in a string of food health
scares.
One of the most startling was the thread worm crisis which threatened to
devastate the German fish market in 1987: a single television programme
suggesting that fresh fish contained live worms when they got to the
fishmonger's slab caused a dramatic slump in consumption. Per capita, the
level dropped from 13.2 kg in 1986 to 11.8 kg in 1987, as panic spread
through the fish-buying public.
'There was an hysterical outcry to begin with,' said Mr Matthias Keller,
chief executive of the Hamburg-based fishing industry association. 'But the
consumers listened to reason in the end.' That was not until the European
Commission, the German government, and the industry had launched a big and
costly public relations exercise.
Another good example of Germany's special sensitivity was over the fall-out
from Chernobyl. Watercress growing along the German bank of the river Rhine
was torn up and destroyed. The same plant on the French bank was cheerfully
harvested and sold - some of it to Germany.
BSE looks to be another case where Germany is determined to be stricter than
all its neighbouring states. Mr Brucker blames politicians in general, and
Mr Seehofer in particular.
'He has set himself up as the great consumer's protector,' he said. 'But he
is risking his neck in this confrontation with the Brussels Commission.'
If Mr Seehofer is under attack on his home front, Mrs Gillian Shephard and
the British Agriculture Ministry are also open to criticism.
Dr Stephen Dealler, a microbiologist at York District Hospital who has
researched BSE, says the Germans are right to want to take action to protect
their consumers.
'If you sit and wait, you're taking a risk of unknown proportions,' he said.
'The Germans are saying 'We're not going to take this risk, it's too high.'
They're right.'
Scientific tests on other animal species and his own calculations, based on
agriculture ministry and other scientific data, suggested the risk that BSE
could cross the 'species barrier' from cows to humans was high, he said.
Cattle become infected when very young but the incubation period is four to
seven years, he said. The risk of infection grows as the incubation period
advances. 'For every cow we're slaughtering with the disease, we're eating
five to six others while they're incubating it but showing no signs of it,'
he added.
Now it is up to the EU agriculture ministers to find a compromise. They will
be hard put to do so. For the real difference between Britain and Germany is
not about scientific evidence. It is about different public perceptions of
what constitutes a food danger to health. It is a question of culture, not
of fact.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Showdown over French skies: John Ridding and Paul Betts say
the clash between British airlines and the Paris government tests Europe's
policy of deregulating air travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Gray, managing director of Air UK, is exasperated: 'I can't
believe in this day and age it will come to pistols at dawn.'
But as his airline, along with British Airways and BA's French affiliate
TAT, prepares to defy the French government and launch services on Monday
between London and Orly Airport in Paris, a showdown seems hard to avoid.
'It is an absolute test case,' says one airline executive. 'If the French
are allowed to win, the European Commission's plans for airline deregulation
mean little', he adds, as UK and French government officials were yesterday
attempting to resolve the dispute.
The row has erupted since Wednesday when Mr Bernard Bosson, the French
transport minister, declared that UK carriers could not start flying to Orly
on Monday despite last month's ruling by the Commission that the French
government must open the airport to competition immediately.
The dispute goes to the heart of European efforts during the past three
years to liberalise air transport and create a deregulated single European
aviation market. Apart from provoking fresh strains between two of the
European Union's biggest partners, it has brought to the fore the wide gulf
in approach to airline deregulation adopted by different EU countries.
It has highlighted the split between the liberal camp - countries such as
the UK, the Netherlands and increasingly Germany - and the more
interventionist member states led by France and including Italy, Spain,
Greece, Portugal and Belgium. The latter group opposes US-style free-for-all
airline competition and is pressing for a controlled process of
deregulation.
The immediate issue in what is being described as 'the Battle for Orly' is
access to French domestic routes and France's readiness to liberalise its
airline market in line with Europe's 'open skies' policies. The stakes are
high, and tempers have become frayed. The UK government has placed its 'full
backing' behind the UK carriers.
Mr Bosson claims the French government remains committed to opening Orly to
more competition, but he said UK flights could not start until a number of
problems have been resolved. These include the implementation of measures to
ease congestion at Orly and improved access to London's Heathrow airport for
French airlines. The French transport ministry believes these problems can
be resolved 'within a matter of weeks', and says it does not understand the
'strong-arm tactics' being employed by the British carriers.
The demand that services to Orly be delayed, however, has prompted a strong
reaction. 'The French authorities have no right to prevent us from flying to
Orly,' says Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government affairs. He argues that
Air France already has open access to Heathrow and operates more flights to
the London airport from the other Paris airport of Charles de Gaulle than BA
itself.
The high emotions reflect the importance of the issue. For UK airlines,
flights from London to Orly would provide a strong foothold into the
lucrative domestic French market. Orly, in southern Paris, also provides
better connections to internal French flights than does Charles de Gaulle.
'Flying to Orly would strengthen our competitive position against the
Channel tunnel,' Mr Holmes says. 'We believe that Orly will prove more
popular than Charles de Gaulle,' adds Mr Gray, whose Air UK airline wants to
serve Orly from London's Stansted airport.
For UK carriers the Orly dispute is also a broader test case for the
liberalisation of the French airline market. In addition to its ruling on
Orly, the Commission ordered France to open the Orly-Marseilles and
Orly-Toulouse routes to competition within six months. These are among the
busiest routes in Europe and are currently operated as a monopoly by the
French domestic carrier Air Inter, part of the Air France group. From 1997,
according to the Commission, all routes within France and other EU member
countries must be liberalised.
This all adds up to a dilemma for the French government, which is faced with
conflicting pressures. The Commission has linked approval of a FFr20bn
capital injection for Air France to progress in opening up the domestic
French air transport market to competition. The capital increase, to take
place over three years, is the centre piece of a rescue plan for Air France,
which last year incurred losses of FFr8.5bn.
The French state airline's capital increase proposal has already antagonised
Air France's big European airline competitors - not only BA but also
Lufthansa of Germany - which are campaigning in Brussels against the
continuing use of state subsidies to bail out loss-making national flag
carriers.
'The artificial maintenance of state-funded airlines continues to provide
the biggest obstacle to the development of a truly free, deregulated
market,' says Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways, the
second largest UK scheduled carrier which also plans to start services from
Heathrow to Orly later this year.
Many French consumers also favour deregulation. 'Of course I want more
competition,' says the director of a French company. 'When I travel to
Britain there is usually a choice of airlines.'
But these incentives to deregulate the French market are countered by other
factors. Unions at Air Inter oppose liberalisation. 'We will not be the
sacrifice for Commission approval of Air France's rescue package,' says an
official of the Confederation Generale du Travail, one of the airline's
largest unions. The unions have called a strike on Tuesday to demand that
competition be introduced only in 'progressive steps'. Air Inter is also
reluctant to lose its monopoly on some of its most profitable routes having
lost FFr257m last year.
The dilemma is clearly felt by Mr Bosson. 'I am accused of being an
ultra-liberal by the unions and an ultra-protectionist by Brussels,' he
complained last month.
But there is a deeper resistance to the process of deregulation in France
inherited from the country's dirigiste economic tradition. 'The EU is not
simply a zone of free trade, having for its only value the laws of the
market,' Mr Bosson said in response to the so-called 'wise men's' report on
airline deregulation published last year. The report called for full
liberalisation of European routes by 1997. 'The EU must also include a
social vision, the values of regional development and public service, which
are ignored by considerations of profitability,' he argued.
The result of these conflicting interests has been an attempt to play for
time and fight for every step in the battle for deregulation. In addition to
the delays announced on Wednesday, Paris is appealing to the European Court
of Justice about the procedures used in the decision to liberalise the
Toulouse and Marseilles routes.
However, the need to secure the FFr20bn capital increase for Air France is
likely to be the priority. 'After the strikes of last October which forced
the climbdown by the Balladur government, Air France has become a powerful
political symbol,' said one airline consultant in Paris. 'They cannot afford
a refusal of the capital increase.'
To assist the process of liberalisation, opposition from Air Inter may be
reduced by a reorganisation of its relationship with Air France, a prospect
that was raised by Mr Bosson in an address to the National Assembly on
Wednesday. The reorganisation seems designed to satisfy Air Inter's
long-standing demands for a more autonomous management from its parent.
Placating Air Inter will, however, take time. And with BA and Air UK
planning to touch down in Orly on Monday, time is something that the French
authorities do not have. As one UK airline executive put it: 'The French
government has pushed itself in a corner; the moment of truth is due to
arrive on the 6.50 flight from London.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basic research vital to aeronautics'
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor KEITH HAYWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Emma Tucker's article, 'The drift towards managed trade' in
your Exporter supplement (May 5). The Department of Trade and Industry has
certainly given its backing to the National Technology Acquisition Plan for
the British aerospace industry. What it, or rather the government, has not
done is provide adequate funding for basic aeronautical research.
Over the last three years, the annual budget allocation under the DTI's
civil aeronautics research programme has fallen by nearly Pounds 3m.
Admittedly, plans for the next two years show a slight rise to about Pounds
22.7m a year, but this includes substantial payments to the European
Transonic Windtunnel project. Even so, in the view of those who compiled the
National Technology Acquisition Plan, Pounds 22m will be inadequate to
sustain the UK aerospace technology base into the next century.
Money invested in basic research is not a question of trying to pick
individual 'winners'; it is an investment in an entire industry.
Aeronautical R&amp;D at this level will also have an impact on other
high-technology industries. But even if the benefits were exclusive to the
aerospace sector, they would underpin an export potential well into the next
century.
Ministers proudly point to the current performance of British aerospace
companies, but without investment over the long haul, this could be the last
flash of flame before the match goes out.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Old versus new: Robert Graham on relations between Italy's
president and prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If looks tell all, the glum face of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro this week
said a lot about his relations with Italy's new government headed by media
magnate turned politician Silvio Berlusconi.
The president, usually courteous to the point of unctuousness, could have
smiled when he swore in Mr Berlusconi as Italy's 53rd post-war premier. But
the atmosphere between the two men was icy.
Mr Berlusconi did his best to ignore the stand-off by beaming with pride as
his mandate was formally confirmed. As a result the occasion appeared like a
pupil collecting top prize from a stern head-master who still doubted
whether the prize was deserved.
Subsequently both sides have gone to great lengths to create the impression
they get along famously. 'My relations with the president are very cordial
(cordialissimi),' Mr Berlusconi insisted.
Yet suspicious journalists immediately saw the superlative as so glowing as
to be barbed. Surely, they asked in their columns yesterday, this was a
classic instance of a person meaning the opposite of what was said?
This is an unpropitious start for an inexperienced government (23 of the 25
strong cabinet are ministerial novices) and a prime minister who is an
unknown quantity as a politician having only resigned executive duties at
his Fininvest media empire in January. The impression of two leaders not
seeing eye to eye was fuelled by the disclosure of the contents of a letter
President Scalfaro sent to Mr Berlusconi.
Dispatched on Monday while Mr Berlusconi was in the throes of forming his
cabinet list, President Scalfaro curtly reminded him of his
responsibilities. Behind the formal language the president in effect warned
Mr Berlusconi that Italians needed reassurances about the nature of the
government given that it was going to contain the federalist Northern League
and neo-fascists who draw their roots from Mussolini's corporatist state.
The move was unprecedented for an Italian head of state and pushed his role
as guarantor of the constitution, to the limits. In private the president
had also stressed the need for Mr Berlusconi to avoid a conflict of interest
with his business empire. The president was instrumental in blocking the
tycoon's lawyer, Mr Cesare Previti, from occupying the justice ministry.
Relations between the 75 year-old head of state and Mr Berlusconi do not
pose the same problems as the Mitterrand/Balladur 'cohabitation' in France
as the Italian presidency has no executive functions. But a good working
relationship between the two is important for the stability of the
government.
If relations deteriorate, Mr Berlusconi will be under pressure from his
allies in the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance to force President Scalfaro's resignation. Both parties have
lobbies who say he should be removed because he represents the Italy they
are battling to change in the new 'second republic'.
The Italian president has heavily circumscribed powers under the post-War
constitution drawn up with the aim of avoiding too much power in any one
person's hands. The head of state is not directly elected but chosen by
parliament for a seven year term. He can dissolve parliament and nominate
the prime minister.
But parliament can only be dissolved if it agrees - that is when a
government falls or has obviously exhausted its mandate. The power to chose
the prime minister depends on the will of the electorate as expressed
through the ballot box. The president's authority therefore depends upon his
political feel and the extent to which his integrity allows him to exercise
moral suasion in private or via public opinion.
President Scalfaro, a former Christian Democrat interior minister and one of
the country's longest serving parliamentarians, was elected in 1992 as a
compromise candidate. He was chosen in a deal between the then dominant
Christian Democrats and the Socialists. Other candidates were rendered
ineligible by corruption scandals.
In difficult circumstances, President Scalfaro has presided with dignity and
had considerable influence over the tumultuous transition of the past two
years. He played a major part in nominating Mr Giuliano Amato as Socialist
premier in 1992 and then turning to the non-political Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi, former central Bank governor, as the parliamentary coalition backing
the government began to collapse in 1993. He can also take credit for
encouraging electoral reform that led to the appearance of Mr Berlusconi's
Forza Italia.
However, in the transition process Mr Scalfaro has been tainted by
accusations from top former members of the intelligence services, now on
trial for alleged corruption. They claim that as interior minister he knew
about the abuse of secret funds. Even if no more than scurrilous defamation,
the accusations identify President Scalfaro with a political system Italy
has voted to change.
There is thus a danger that any conflict between the presidency and the
Berlusconi government will develop into a battle between the old and the
new. Such a confrontation may only be avoided if more extreme elements in
the League and the MSI decide to focus political energies on other
priorities - such as creating jobs and deregulating an over-regulated
economy.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your headline 'Students spurn accountancy jobs' (May 6) reflects
neither the content of the story nor the reality of the intake into the
accountancy profession.
While it is correct that the total intake has fallen, reflecting lower
demand among accountancy firms during the recession, a recent survey by
Graduate Appointments showed accountancy as the most popular choice of
careers among graduates.
The high calibre of those seeking training contracts is reflected by the
record 74 per cent of graduate entrants last year with first and upper
second degrees, and the increase from 467 to 491 in those from Oxbridge.
For this year, the figure has increased again - to 78 per cent - while firms
report continuing high interest for top graduates for places this September.
It was the supply of places available, not student demand, which had fallen.
The institute's finances are not threatened as you suggest because the high
quality of graduates going through training is ensuring that the numbers
qualifying and subsequently joining the institute are keeping the total
membership on a rising trend.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report that Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said
that the CrossRail project is not dead ('CrossRail rejection leaves BR plans
in disarray', May 11) is to be welcomed. If the government is going to bring
the project forward in another way, it must do so with the same urgency and
resolve which has given us the Channel tunnel.
While London will suffer if this much needed project is dropped, for it to
be held in abeyance with continuing uncertainty will prolong blight for the
occupiers and owners of property across central London, extending from
beyond Paddington in the west to Liverpool Street in the east.
Decisive action must now be taken either to bring the scheme forwards in
another way or, if this is not to be done, to remove the blight which has
now affected this part of London for almost three years, by removing the
safeguarding of the route. Alternatively, the government should change the
compensation code to enable residents and businesses to receive compensation
for their true losses.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Men in the News: Brothers in a bun fight - Garry and Galen
Weston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like latter-day Roman emperors, two brothers run the halves of a sprawling
food business which has brought their family considerable wealth - estimated
to run into billions of pounds, but largely owned by charitable foundations.
Garry Weston, 67, tall and somewhat shambling, resembles a wise, old family
doctor, complete with ill-trimmed moustache and understanding manner. Galen
Weston, 53, is also silver haired and tall, but he is dapper, a friend of
princes, and a renowned polo player.
As Garry says in his quiet, understated fashion: 'Our personalities are
rather different. He has done his thing, I've done mine.'
This week, Garry announced plans to reorganise the shareholdings owned by
his family and a charity in Associated British Foods for tax-planning
purposes. While some observers saw this as a loosening of the family's grip
on the business, Garry says he is determined that the dynasty will retain
control.
The Westons' is a remarkable saga. Cockney William Weston, born in 1820,
emigrated to Toronto, where his son George was born in 1865. After founding
a baking business he died young, leaving his son Willard Garfield, known as
Garfield, born in 1898, to take over.
Garfield, who lived until 1978, fathered nine children, three of them boys,
and set out, he said, 'to build a business that would never know
completion'. 'Growth forever' could have been his motto.
He moved to the UK and went on an acquisition spree. In 1935 he took his
Allied Bakeries company public, later changing its name to ABF. As his
health began to fail, he called on two of his sons to take over the
business. In 1967 he asked Garry, who had set up an Australian subsidiary,
to run ABF, the 'eastern' empire, covering the UK and Europe, South Africa,
Australia and New Zealand.
Some years later, Galen, who had been running the Irish business and married
an Irish model, was persuaded to go 'home' to head the North American
empire.
Since then, the paths of the two brothers have seldom crossed, even though
each is on the other's board. Garry is currently angry about an article in
this month's issue of the magazine Vanity Fair. It contains 'a lot of free
chat about my father I don't agree with at all', he says. His irritation is
directed at Galen, who was interviewed for the story and whose Florida beach
resort is the focus of attention.
The article suggests that Garfield groomed his sons to take over the
business. 'A piece of stupidity,' says Garry. 'Apart from the opportunity of
a good education, I received no training at all. At 23, I was given the
opportunity to take charge of a small company making a not very well-known
brand, Ryvita. I taught myself to run the business.'
He is clearly proud of turning the crispbread into a household name and also
of inventing and naming Wagon Wheel chocolate biscuits.
Garry thinks he has inherited some of his father's 'ideals and most of his
motivation. Apart from that I am not temperamentally like him. I've not got
the charisma he had.' Galen is like their father 'in some ways', says Garry.
'He acts more like an owner than a manager. He is restless like my father.'
Garry says he is more like his elder brother, Grainger, who left the
business years ago and became a Texas rancher.
When he was summoned home from Australia to chair ABF, the Sunblest bread
and Twining teas group, Garry found a business with a rambling structure,
low profits and more than 180 people reporting directly to his father, who
by then spent only half his time in the UK.
Garry pulled the business into shape, selling subsidiaries at a premium, and
eventually buying British Sugar for Pounds 880m in 1991. The ABF group,
worth Pounds 91m when he became chairman, is now valued at Pounds 2.6bn.
When Galen took over the North American company he found a similar mess.
According to Vanity Fair, he performed a 'textbook turnaround' of a business
in a state of near bankruptcy and 'whipped that chaotic collection of more
than 200 companies and subsidiaries into a sensible, streamlined
organisation'.
Garry is less generous. 'He has recruited some very good executives and
leaves them in charge. That leaves him a lot of time for his social life,'
he says. Garry, something of a loner, puts family first.
The North American company, George Weston, controls the Loblaw supermarket
chain and has interests in cyclical industries such as paper. It is
majority-owned by Galen and another charity and, according to Garry, has
performed badly for the past three years. 'The company's shape is very much
like it was 20 years ago. There has not been a sell-off or a British Sugar,'
he adds.
While the two emperors run their separate domains, they face a common
problem: the succession. Garry has six children, three of each sex. The sons
 -Guy, George and Garth - all work in ABF, the youngest as a management
trainee where, says Garry, 'there are a lot of opportunities for bright
young men and my sons will have to compete with them'. Two of his daughters
work for Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store also owned by the
family.
Will the next chairman of AB Foods be a Weston? 'That's a long way off, I
hope,' says Garry, and adds: 'There are a lot of able people in the
company.' Whoever chairs the business, though, he expects the family to
retain its shareholding.
As for Galen's half of the empire, it is too early to say whether his son or
daughter, both born in 1972 and still in full-time education, will follow
him into the business. But even if they do, the division between the two
sides of the family can only grow wider.

FT  14 MAY 94 / An opportunity to end adversity: Shirley Williams says the
European elections will be a vital step in redefining UK politics after John
Smith's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRLEY WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party sometimes seems to be dogged by misfortune.
In 1963, on the edge of a breakthrough into government after 13 years in the
desert, Labour lost its great leader Hugh Gaitskell. In 1974 the second
Wilson government took office just after the huge increase in oil prices;
Labour then went out of office just as oil was beginning to bring in
millions of pounds of additional revenue from the North Sea, a God-given
bonus now largely dissipated.
Now, at the moment it is once again poised to return to office, it has lost
another remarkable leader, one who built on the foundation Neil Kinnock
laid: aiming to recreate Labour as a potential party of government.
For there is an antibody at work in the body politic, a suspicion of the
Labour party that is based not just on memories of the 1979 winter of
discontent, but on perception of Labour as interventionist, obsolete, and
union-dominated. The perception is not altogether fair. But it is
extraordinarily persistent.
John Smith's qualities, of prudence, common sense, seriousness, experience
and integrity, over and above his remarkable gifts as a parliamentarian,
went a long way to reassure people that Labour had put its wild ways behind
it.
It was the need to show that the party had changed fundamentally that led
John Smith to risk so much on getting a form of one member, one vote through
the 1993 Labour Party Conference. A cautious politician, he understood that
more was at stake from not attempting the reform than from failing to win
it.
But John Smith's legacy is not just to his party. It is to his country also.
At a time when the government and the Conservative party are in
near-terminal disarray on Europe, he provided an example of steady
commitment to Britain's European future. He was never a fanatic; but he
understood, through all the ups and downs of Britain's stormy relationship
with the European Community, that there was no other way to go, that
Britain's economic future depended upon our membership. From his vote for
entry in 1971 against a three-line whip, a very brave act for an aspiring
and ambitious young politician, John Smith never wavered.
He was a devolutionist, a man who understood that harnessing the energies of
the countries and regions of Britain would stimulate enterprise and
innovation, that Westminster and Whitehall needed to be open to new ideas
from beyond their own tight and incestuous circle. His roots deep in
Scotland, and in the Labour culture of Strathclyde, fed that strong sense of
regional autonomy.
The former Labour leader saw how local government is being eroded by the
authoritarianism of central government, and he deplored it. He could,
however, never bring himself to support proportional representation for
local elections, even though that would almost certainly have ended the
domination of certain local councils by the 'loony left' - or, for that
matter, the loony right.
John Smith was a man who believed in the ethos of public service. Nothing
exemplified that better than the concluding words of his last speech, the
day before he died. His sense of public service ran much deeper than words
in speeches. Again, at a time when the tradition of public service and of
civic integrity seems to have been relegated to history, abandoned even by
some of those charged with upholding it as the evidence to the Scott inquiry
shows, John Smith's example deserves to be honoured and followed.
The genuine response of grief at his death seems to demonstrate a hunger for
more substantial and more constructive politics, for an end to the media
frenzy over sexual and financial scandals, and to the political behaviour
that feeds it.
In choosing his successor, the Labour party will make a fateful choice. It
will choose its political strategy up to and beyond the next general
election. It will close or open doors to co-operation with other parties in
areas where Labour cannot command a majority.
John Smith believed the Labour party could win a majority at a general
election; or, at least, he behaved as if he believed that. Yet the local
government results on May 5 cast further doubt on the validity of that
belief. While an apparent triumph for Labour, the truth of the matter is
that the only winners were the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish
Nationalists.
As The Economist pointed out this week, in England it was not Labour that
picked up disillusioned Tory voters, a further 5 per cent drop on the
Conservative party's already low share of the vote in 1990. It was the
Liberal Democrats. And it was in the Tory heartlands that the largest
proportion of previous Tory voters defected to the Liberal Democrats.
Whatever the opinion polls show, Labour finds it difficult to get above a 40
per cent share of the real vote. It has not done so at a general election
even once since 1979. Furthermore, its position is slowly eroding, not so
much because of marginal losses as a result of boundary changes, but because
demography and industrial organisation work against it. Ours is an ageing
society; it is also one in which the manufacturing industry and the public
services on which trades unionism depended are losing jobs to an
individualistic and fragmented private service sector.
In consequence, Britain is becoming a three-party country, four in Scotland;
or more accurately, a country in which two parties contend in particular
constituencies and regions, but not the same two parties. It is the Liberal
Democrats who are now the main opposition party in the south and west,
Labour in the north and in London, though even that is beginning to change.
Given that neither national opposition party may win an overall majority,
and given too the need for an effective and convincing challenge to a
government that has run out of time, ideas and morale, how should we
proceed?
Some advocate an electoral pact, but any such pact would be passionately
opposed by many in both of the main opposition parties. Nor is it clear that
party headquarters could make their local parties adhere to any such pact.
Many dissillusioned Tories would find such a pact reason for not voting at
all.
What is needed instead is to build habits of co-operation, to move Britain
away from the politics of confrontation to at least some element of
consensus on the country's most important goals.
In the effort to save local government as an important and valuable part of
the body politic, that is already happening. Up and down the country,
especially in the shire counties, Liberal Democrats and Labour, sometimes
Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, and even in a few places Labour and
Conservative, are working together. On local government reorganisation, a
very large part of the Conservative party finds itself closer to the other
parties than to its own government. In a recent debate on the Local
Government Commission in the House of Lords, only the ministers, one
backbench Conservative peer and three Labour peers spoke up for official
policy. Every other Conservative, Independent, Liberal Democrat and
cross-bench peer spoke on the other side.
The most important issue of all for the country's future is the role we will
play in the European Union. The shape of that Union will be profoundly
affected by the two enlargements now envisaged, for Austria and the
Scandinavians, and beyond that for the Visegrad group of central and east
European countries. It will also be affected by the Inter-Governmental
Conference of 1996 which will determine the institutional changes needed to
cope with those enlargements.
Britain has a significant interest in the outcome of the IGC, but the truth
of the matter is that little constructive input is likely from a deeply
riven government. One senior German official said to me at a conference
earlier this week: 'From London, we get nothing.'
Yet Britain has much to contribute to the IGC. Among politicians of all
parties who believe in Britain's continued membership of the Union, there is
a concern to build a stronger democratic base, to involve national
parliaments more closely, to make subsidiarity meaningful, and to open up
the deliberations of the Council of Ministers so that governments cannot
evade responsibility for their decisions. Indeed, the attack on 'the
faceless bureaucrats of Brussels' is often a diversion from the
unaccountable actions of ministers, including our own.
The European elections are likely to produce for the first time a group of
Liberal Democrat MEPs, and probably a number of additional Labour members.
On these MEPs, and on re-elected MEPs, some of whom have made a
distinguished contribution to the European Parliament, will fall the
responsibility to consult, discuss and formulate, together with their
parties at home, proposals for the IGC.
These will not be official proposals, but constructive ideas from British
opposition parties - and indeed from European-minded Conservative MEPs - are
likely to be heard by other governments in the Union, and perhaps even by
our own. Britain's contribution must not be allowed to go by default.
The issues now at the heart of British politics are too important to be left
to a weak and discredited government. John Smith cared about issues in
politics that mattered. His successor will, if he or she is wise, be able to
do something about them.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Leading Article: European recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in western Europe is well under way. The UK is in the van,
after eight quarters of growth, and output is at last back at pre-recession
levels. But others are catching up. This week's surprise reduction in the
German discount rate, to 4.5 per cent, leaves room for more cuts in money
market rates of interest. While continental rates may have further to fall,
UK interest rates may well have reached the bottom of their cycle.
By 1995, economic growth in Germany, France and Italy may also have
overtaken that in the UK, as the European Commission predicted this week.
This is by no means bad news for the UK. Higher taxes will reduce domestic
consumer demand. Largely for this reason, the Commission forecasts that UK
economic growth will slow from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in
1995. The UK will have to rely on demand abroad, for which a strong
continental recovery will be essential.
Unfortunately, that recovery is not very strong. In France, for example,
gross domestic product has grown slowly since its trough in the first
quarter of 1993 and is still 1.6 per cent below its peak in the first
quarter of 1992. After falling by 0.8 per cent in 1993, it is forecast by
the government to grow only 1.4 per cent this year. But recent evidence
suggests it may do somewhat better than that. Manufacturing output has risen
in each of the last four months. The number of non-farm employees rose in
the first three months of 1994, this being the first quarterly rise since
1990.
There was a slight rise in the annual rate of inflation, to 1.7 per cent, in
April. But it remains very low, while monetary policy is still restrictive,
because the Bank of France continues to align its monetary policy closely on
that of Germany. This has meant lowering its intervention rate in line with
reductions in Germany's repurchase (or 'repo' rate), even though economic
conditions in France warrant more rapid reductions.
Clear trend
Although the continental recovery may not be strong, the trend is clear. The
same is true of interest rates. In the US - and the UK - these are on their
way upwards, or at least on the turn, while continental rates are still
falling. The latter are likely to go below those in the UK quite soon.
The latest cuts in interest rates should accelerate the continental
recovery, though slowly, since monetary policy affects demand after a
substantial delay. Its effect can be felt more quickly via the exchange
rate. But this will not be important for Germany, which does a high
proportion of its trade with countries that tie their exchange rates to the
D-Mark.
The US economic recovery, now in its fourth year, is further ahead than the
British, which is why interest rates have already been increased, to head
off inflation. The Federal funds rate now stands at 3 3/4 per cent. A
further rise seems imminent, despite an unexpected decline in producer
prices in April. If German monetary policy is loosened further, the
Bundesbank's discount rate could fall below the US Federal funds rate later
this year. This relative movement in national interest rates should also
help correct the US dollar's current weakness, although this will depend on
other factors, including the longer-term credibility of US monetary policy.
Improved prospects
The Bundesbank's latest reduction in lending rates is bound to improve the
prospects for recovery throughout Europe. Many of its neighbours, notably
France, desperately need this assistance. There is a question, however,
about whether the move was justified by domestic German monetary conditions.
It is not often that the Bundesbank's anti-inflation credibility is brought
into question. But it is cutting rates deeply, despite continued rapid
growth in the broad money supply (M3), which grew at an annualised
seasonally adjusted rate of 15.4 per cent between the last quarter of 1993
and March. This is hugely above its 1994 target range of 4 to 6 per cent.
The Bundesbank argues that the cut was justified by the domestic outlook for
inflation, currently 3.1 per cent in west Germany. It also argues that the
change should help reduce monetary growth, by encouraging investors to move
funds from bank deposits into long-term funds. These arguments may well be
right, but they also conflict with its traditional monetarism.
Whether the Bundesbank is mistaken will not be known for some years. The
immediate prospect for European economies is now fairly bright. They look
set to enjoy a period of growth with relatively low inflation. This is, of
course, good news.
But unemployment remains disturbingly high. In the UK, even after two years
of recovery, there are still 2.72m people out of work, 9.7 per cent of the
workforce. In France the rate is higher still, as is true for Germany as a
whole, though not west Germany. Renewed growth is welcome. It must not be
used as an excuse for taking Europe's structural economic problems off the
agenda.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Sinn Fein spells out its queries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a breakthrough in the UK-Irish peace initiative rose yesterday
after Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, responded to calls to spell out
which parts of the Downing Street declaration it wants clarified.
The Irish government forwarded to London a list of questions drawn up by
Sinn Fein focusing on the declaration's treatment of self-determination, the
so-called unionist 'veto' and Britain's long-term intentions in the
province.
The move constitutes a potentially significant climbdown by Sinn Fein, which
had previously insisted on face-to-face meetings with government officials
to discuss its reservations.
London is expected to reply to the questions next week.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said last night in a
statement that the government would publish Sinn Fein's text together with
its own 'comments'. This would take place 'within a matter of days once we
have had an opportunity to give them proper consideration'.
It will raise hopes that republican leaders may be edging closer to
declaring an end to their 25-year armed campaign, paving the way for Sinn
Fein to enter the political talks process.
London has emphasised repeatedly that Sinn Fein's demand for clarification
had never been made specific since to do so would 'attract ridicule and
scorn'.
But Sir Patrick hinted last month to a US congressional committee that he
would consider responding to specific queries.
Unionists reacted cautiously to yesterday's development.
Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said Sir Patrick should
send the questions back 'with the envelope unopened'. Dublin had 'persuaded
the Provos to do this to keep the British on the hook'.
Sinn Fein's move came after Sir Patrick had used a speech in Dublin to try
to inject fresh urgency into the search for a lasting political settlement,
saying an early end to direct rule in Ulster was needed.
In a carefully balanced address, the Northern Ireland secretary said there
was a clear role for 'new structures' to develop the relationship between
the two parts of the island 'purposefully and profitably'.
This meant certain assumptions would have to be made on the shape of
democratic institutions in Northern Ireland but there was no need for these
to impinge on sovereignty.
He said London and Dublin were looking for a 'new and more broadly based'
Anglo-Irish Agreement to replace the document agreed in 1985 that gave
Dublin a say in Ulster affairs for the first time.
Reaching a new agreement would mean 'all of us being prepared to embrace new
ideas, new institutional structures and imaginative approaches to
constitutional and human rights issues'.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Cleaner killed by IRA bomb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A police station cleaner was killed and his wife and two young children
injured yesterday when their car was blown up by an IRA bomb.
John Anthony, 38, died and his three-year-old daughter was hurled from the
car in Lurgan, County Armagh.
Mr Anthony's nine-year-old son, suffering from cuts and bruises, ran for
help to his grandparents' house nearby.
Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the killing
showed the government there was no point talking to republicans.

FT  14 MAY 94 / 17th-century king loses case against City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King James I was yesterday defeated by the Corporation of London.
At issue was the ownership of Smithfield Market, and the corporation's
battle for the site was won after meticulous examination of medieval
documents.
In 1613, King James I disputed the corporation's claim to ownership of the
market, which stands on what is now prime land for developers, adjoining St
Bartholomew's Hospital in the City of London.
The Court of Appeal judges had to review some ageing documents. The first
royal charter granting Smithfield to the City was signed by Henry VI in
1444. It was regranted to the City by Henry VII in a charter of 1505.
According to the corporation, the crown showed no ambitions on the site,
which the City, had owned 'since time immemorial', until James I claimed
ownership.
This dispute led to a compromise under James's successor, Charles I. The
precise meaning of that charter, granted in 1638, which was meant to clarify
the position, has been at issue.
According to the City: 'The crown's claim was that that charter established
the crown's ownership and the corporation's right to certain uses of the
land.' But the City claimed that the compromise upheld the corporation's
ownership of the freehold.
Yesterday's ruling against James I upheld a 1992 High Court judgment that
the City owns the freehold, although it is restricted to using the land
either for a meat market or for open space.
The Crown Estates commissioners, which brought the case on behalf of the
crown, were required to pay legal costs for the City, which are estimated at
about Pounds 50,000.
As a result the City retains its hold on the public gardens immediately to
the south of the market, plus a segment of the market itself whose ownership
was also under dispute.
The crown did not apply for leave to appeal to the House of Lords yesterday,
but the Crown Estates said this option had not been ruled out. Solicitors
are reading the judgment 'in detail' and an announcement is likely on
Monday. The City claimed there were insufficient grounds to appeal.
Speculation over the future of the market has rekindled the dispute in the
past few decades. Proposals to move it to a different site were mooted in
the 1970s.
More recently, some market traders have claimed they cannot pay the rents
the City will charge to fund refurbishment to conform to European Union
hygiene regulations.
The City said: 'The majority of the land will continue as a public space, so
in practical terms it makes no difference, but it's reassuring to have this
dispute settled after 381 years.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Record number to stand for Euro-elections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A record total of 552 candidates will stand in the UK constituencies for the
European parliament.
The Greens and the three main parties are to fight all the constituencies in
Great Britain. However, candidates of the Natural Law party, which
represents followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, are standing in every UK
constituency - making the party the first to fight every seat, either for
Europe or Westminster. The Tories have just one candidate in Northern
Ireland where three MEPs are elected by proportional representation.
Boundary changes have created six more UK seats and left only 17 of the
present seats in England and Wales unchanged. The eight in Scotland and
three in Northern Ireland are unaffected.
The Scottish National party is fighting all the Scottish seats and Plaid
Cymru all five in Wales. The Liberal party, which includes those who chose
not to join the Liberal Democrats, has 17 candidates. Well-known names
nominated include former health minister Mrs Edwina Currie at Bedfordshire
and Milton Keynes.
Ms Pauline Green, who leads Labour's European parliament group, is fighting
for her marginal London North seat on unchanged boundaries. But Tory leader
Sir Christopher Prout has been favoured by alterations leaving him with an
apparently safer Herefordshire and Shropshire seat.
The election is on June 9, but counting will not start until the night of
June 12 when polling ends in all European Union countries.

FT  14 MAY 94 / More curbs on tobacco adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New restrictions on tobacco advertising were announced yesterday by the
government as a backbench bill to ban all tobacco advertising failed to
complete its passage through the Commons.
The restrictions, which form part of a five-year voluntary agreement between
the government and tobacco manufacturers, will mean larger health warnings,
fewer posters and the removal of all permanent shopfront advertising for
tobacco products by the end of 1996.
The bill, which had been proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother
Valley, was opposed by the government and yesterday ran out of time at the
report stage after Conservative MPs tabled amendments.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said the new voluntary rules would
mean an end to the use of humour likely to appeal to the young, and the
removal of poster advertising from within a 200m radius of school entrances.
The Tobacco Manufacturers Association said yesterday it had agreed 'with the
utmost reluctance' to the new restrictions. It said it was 'dismayed and
disappointed' by the 'attack on the industry's marketing freedoms'.
The Advertising Association, the umbrella group which has been co-ordinating
opposition to the bill, said it was relieved that a complete ban did not get
through. It was 'extremely disappointed', however, that further restrictions
had been placed on advertising in spite of there being 'no evidence of a
link between advertising and total market consumption' of tobacco products.
Action on Smoking and Health, the anti-smoking campaign group, claimed a
'moral victory' and said it would back amendments to other bills, 'in the
same way that the seat-belts legislation was introduced', to bring in a ban
on tobacco advertising.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Cabinet reshuffle may be postponed: Scottish Tories told of
EU's importance; Speakers call for end to disunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Conservatives said yesterday that Mr John Major may now postpone his
planned cabinet reshuffle as the government re-assesses its political
strategy after the death of John Smith.
The suggestion came amid hardening opinion on the Tory back benches that the
pending Labour leadership struggle has removed any immediate threat to Mr
Major's leadership after next month's European elections.
Some cabinet ministers also suggested that the risk of an autumn challenge
had also evaporated, but critics insisted Mr Major's future beyond the
summer depended on the government retaining its grip.
There was speculation also that if Labour chose Mr Tony Blair, the shadow
home secretary, as its new leader, the prime minister could come under
renewed pressure. Mr Blair is regarded by the Conservatives as potentially
the most dangerous of the opposition leadership contenders.
Colleagues suggested that there would now be no purpose in Mr Major
reshuffling his cabinet immediately after the June 9 European poll.
Instead the prime minister would be likely to wait until the second half of
July - or perhaps until September - so that he could assess the impact of
Labour's leadership decision.
The transformation in the outlook created by Mr Smith's death also brought
renewed talk that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
might be persuaded to take on the role of Conservative party chairman.
Mr Heseltine, who suffered a minor heart attack last year, pronounced
himself yesterday '100 per cent fit'. But Mr Heseltine's own leadership
ambitions have been dented by the manner of Mr Smith's death. One suggestion
is that Mr Heseltine might share the chairmanship with Lord Archer.
Speaking in Inverness at the Scottish Conservative conference, Mr Heseltine
gave strong backing to Mr Major. He told activists that the Tories were 'the
one party that will take the courageous and difficult decisions'. He added:
'The prime minister has proved time and time again that he is willing to do
that, and I am certain that his party will back him and his government
through thick and thin.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Not a single safe Tory seat, warn the Euro-election polls:
The rocky road to Strasbourg is compounded by poor voter turnout and
first-past-the-post anomalies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Smith's death has thrown into turmoil all the parties' plans for the
first week of the European election campaign. But the battle will still turn
more on John Major's leadership than on any European issue. Between Thursday
June 9 and Sunday June 12 voters in the 12 countries of the European Union
will choose 567 MEPs to go to Strasbourg. Britain will have 87 MEPs.
The political composition of the European parliament depends to a remarkable
extent on British voters. Great Britain (though not Northern Ireland) alone
votes first-past-the-post instead of proportionally; the winner in votes
gets a disproportionate majority in seats.
In 1979 the Conservatives secured 62 seats to Labour's 17. In 1989 Labour
won 45 seats to the Tories' 32. If there had been proportional
representation the Conservatives' lead in 1979 would have been 22, not 45.
In 1989 the Labour lead would have been four not 13.
If, as some suggest, the Conservatives suffer a Canadian-style wipe-out next
month, the effect could give the left a net majority at Strasbourg 60 or 70
greater than it would have been if Britain had adopted proportional
representation.
If the Tories are embarrassed by the outcome they will be able to use as an
excuse low participation. Britain has been consistently bottom of the
turnout league. On average 33 per cent have voted, less that half the level
for Westminster and well below the norm in local council elections.
Voters can behave unexpectedly. In 1989 the Greens jumped from an
opinion-poll level of 3 per cent three months earlier to 15 per cent in the
ballot box, pushing the Liberal Democrats into fourth place in every
constituency except Cornwall. Six months later, their support had
evaporated.
This year the Liberal Democrats seem set to mop up much of the protest vote
 -and there is plenty of protest vote about. The local election figures and
the opinion polls suggest that there is not a single seat that is safe for
the Conservatives.
In a three-cornered race, 34 per cent of the vote is needed to win, even if
the other two contestants are evenly divided (which is most unlikely). North
Yorkshire seems to be the only seat north of Birmingham where there is a
serious chance of a Conservative victory, but even in the south there is no
safe seat. There are only three constituencies where a swing at the level of
the local elections last week would leave the Conservatives with 40 per cent
of the vote, and in each of these the Liberal Democrats are the stronger
challenger.
On the basis of local election results last week it was calculated that
Labour would get 56 seats, the Liberal Democrats 14 and the Conservatives
12. The ICM poll in The Guardian earlier this week suggested that the
Conservatives would get only 27 per cent of the vote in the European
election. Its findings could be projected to 57 seats for Labour, 15 for the
Conservatives and nine for the Liberal Democrats.
Some would say that both projections are too optimistic for the
Conservatives. With no council tax at stake their erstwhile supporters may
be tempted to a more vehement protest vote, or protest abstention, while the
Liberal Democrats may gain even more from tactical voting by Labour.
The fate of Mr Graham Mather, the Conservative candidate in Hampshire North
and Oxford, will turn on whether Labour voters in Oxford East realise that
their only hope of defeating the Conservatives lies in voting Liberal
Democrat. Similarly, Dr Caroline Jackson's survival as the Conservative MEP
for Wiltshire depends on whether Swindon voters stay loyal to Labour.
On the other hand, it can be argued, as the ICM poll suggests, that the
Liberal Democrats will get only 24 per cent in the European election. It may
be that their pavement politics cannot be so effective in a European
contest.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Hunt pledges jobless initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, told Scottish Tories yesterday that
the government is determined to tackle long-term unemployment.
Mr Hunt said the government planned to offer those unemployed for more than
a year the options of training schemes, work experience, further education
and subsidised jobs.
He said a pilot scheme called Workstart in north Norfolk, under which
employers received Pounds 60 a week to employ long-term jobless people, was
achieving success. 'The benefits system must never be allowed to subsidise
the black economy,' he said.
It was there to 'support those who, through no fault of their own, are
without work. I cannot accept or tolerate unemployment as a way of life.'
Mr Hunt was addressing the final day of the Scottish Conservative party
conference in Inverness. On Thursday the conference was suspended as a mark
of respect to John Smith and yesterday's session was subdued.
Speakers were forced to rewrite their speeches to exclude attacks on the
Labour party. They instead made jibes against the Scottish National party
and the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, did not attack any party
and spoke largely on economic issues.
Sir Michael Hirst, Scottish Conservative party chairman, warned dissident
MPs at Westminster that attacks on the government or the prime minister
caused severe damage to election campaigns.
'When MPs pop up on Westminster Green to have their moment of publicity
sticking the knife into the government or the prime minister, I only wish
they realised what damage they do to us,' he said.
'They ought to remember that disunited parties find themselves in the
electoral wilderness.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Liffe 'launches misconduct probe'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London International Financial Futures Exchange is believed to be
investigating a case of misconduct by one of its members.
Liffe had no comment on the matter but it is thought to involve an
independent trader who was carrying out business on behalf of JP Morgan, the
US investment bank. The bank also declined to comment.
Although banks are members of Liffe, they sometimes execute orders through
independent traders if they want anonymity.
Sources said the trader was reported to Liffe's market supervisory division
after he was seen 'acting inappropriately' in the Italian government bond
futures pit.
The trader was thought to be 'front-running' - executing his own order
before his client's and thereby taking advantage of the price movement
caused by the execution of a large order. However, JP Morgan's clients were
protected at all times, sources said.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Bank to auction convertible bond
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England plans to auction a short-dated UK government bond on May
25 that will be convertible into a long-dated gilt - the first time it has
issued such a convertible stock since 1987.
With a convertible gilt, investors have the option of converting the issue
into a specified alternative stock on set dates and at specified terms of
conversion. This gives investors the chance to participate in more than one
area of the gilt market.
The Bank will release details of the auction size and the maturity of the
stocks on Tuesday.
Gilt yields have risen steeply since the beginning of February as world bond
markets took fright at the prospect of rising inflation in the US and the
need to raise short-term US interest rates.
The Bank has been reluctant to issue long-dated gilts during this period,
stressing that yields are abnormally high given the UK inflation background.
However, bond analysts said that until the precise details of the
convertible gilt were announced, it was impossible to predict investor
demand for the auction stock.

FT  14 MAY 94 / National Savings receipts decrease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Savings' contribution to government coffers fell again last month,
Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes.
The contribution was a net Pounds 373m, with accrued interest accounting for
another Pounds 181m. March's receipts were Pounds 481m plus accrued interest
of Pounds 116m, which themselves were a fall on February's Pounds 617m plus
Pounds 158m.
Figures for April from building societies and unit trusts - National
Savings' keenest competitors - have not yet been released but societies have
been fighting a steady net outflow of funds since November.
The new-found fondness by private investors for equity investment against a
background of low interest rates helped sales of unit trusts to a record
month in March.
National Savings aimed to increase its intake and to assuage the fears of
the elderly, who are dependent on their savings for income, by launching the
Pensioners Bond, for those aged 65 and above, in January.
The bond pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five years. It
was the best-selling National Savings product in March and April. April's
contribution was Pounds 236m.
Premium Bonds were the next best-selling product last month at Pounds 176m.
Since February, sales have been boosted by the first Pounds 1m prize draw.
That took place last month.
Total gross sales of all National Savings products in April amounted to
Pounds 1.09bn with repayments of Pounds 721m.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Heseltine postpones de-regulation white paper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade secretary Michael Heseltine, pictured at the conference, last night
postponed the white paper on de-regulation from next Monday until after the
funeral of John Smith next Friday. The decision came in response to a plea
from Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary. Mr Heseltine said the decision
meant breaking the convention that policy statements must not be issued
within three weeks of an election. The European parliament elections are on
June 9.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Major seeks long-term judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night used the truce in British politics to appeal for
more time and ask that his government be judged over the full five-year term
of its mandate, which he intended to complete.
He also used it to try to heal differences in the Conservative party on the
European Union by arguing that Britain needed to be there to ensure that the
EU made the right decisions on its future.
In a warmly received speech to Scottish Conservatives - which was stripped
of party-political point-scoring because of the death of John Smith - the
prime minister urged politicians to abandon the negative approach to
politics.
'Sometimes I feel that there is too much knocking, too much carping, too
much sneering. Too much setting up of Aunt Sally against Aunt Sally,' he
said.
'Being negative can be an addictive drug . . . But like any drug it corrodes
and destroys the body in which it exists. And one body which it runs the
risk of corrupting is the body politic itself.'
He said the government was not yet halfway through the five-year mandate it
had won from more than 14m people 'and I intend to complete it. And then I
shall say: judge me on my whole term of office. All of it. You can't judge a
house when only the foundations are laid.'
The government wanted to complete the agenda that he set out last October at
the party conference in Blackpool - the priorities were to achieve a stable
economy, combat crime and raise standards in schools.
Mr Major said inflation had been brought down and keeping it down would
remain the cornerstone of economic policy. Crime was being tackled with new
legislation, and teacher training was the last part of the education reform
programme.
On Europe, Mr Major warned that 'unless it makes the right choices about
policy today - unless it adopts free-market policies and believes in them -
Europe won't be up there in the next century with the US, Japan and China'.
That was why Britain must play its full part. But he acknowledged that the
issue of Europe touched deep nerves in the British politics. A Gallup poll
in today's Daily Telegraph shows that 45.5 per cent of those questioned
would vote Labour in a general election, 25 per cent Liberal Democrat and
24.5 per cent Conservative. The figures are based on a sample of 1,155
electors interviewed between May 4 and May 9.

The government has given the go-ahead in principle to the National Grid
Company's Pounds 200m plan to install 50 miles of 400kv powerlines through
Cleveland and scenic North Yorkshire countryside.
The proposal triggered 7,000 objections and opposition from seven local

The plan will mean building more than 200 pylons, each about 140ft high.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Scottish bus group promise good behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fife Scottish Omnibuses, part of the Stagecoach bus group, has given
undertakings about its future good conduct after an Office of Fair Trading
investigation found it had tried to remove a competitor from the market.
The OFT found in March that Fife Scottish had acted in a predatory and
anti-competitive fashion against subsidised services operated by Moffat and
Williamson for Fife Regional Council.
Fife Scottish has given pledges not to increase fares by more than the rate
of inflation on the routes that were investigated and not to reduce the
frequency of services. It will also not introduce new services in
competition with those subsidised by its rivals.
Stagecoach's active acquisition policy has led to frequent OFT
investigations though it has been cleared in 16 of the 18 cases. It has,
however, been required to give undertakings after mergers with bus companies
in Lancaster and Sussex.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The man who might become Labour's JFK: Many in the party see
Tony Blair as the natural successor to John Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair was saying nothing yesterday about the leadership of the
Labour party. As the shock of Mr John Smith's death continued to reverberate
around the corridors of Westminster, callers to his office were told
politely but firmly that the shadow home secretary was in mourning. Neither
he nor those around him wanted to talk about the future at the moment.
His silence did not quell the speculation. The outcome of the forthcoming
leadership contest will be uncertain for some time yet. But all logic
dictates Mr Blair should and will stand.
Amid the genuine grief there is a strengthening perception in the party at
Westminster that the 41-year-old MP for Sedgefield is the natural successor
to Mr Smith. He is 14 years younger. He displays more of the impatience of
youth than the calculated caution which guided Mr Smith's leadership of his
party. But Mr Blair shares many of the qualities of Labour's lost leader.
Some comparisons are superficial. Mr Blair is English rather than Scottish,
but he was born and went to school in Edinburgh. He is middle-class. He is a
barrister. Real resemblances run deeper. Mr Blair, like Mr Smith, is a
politician at ease with himself. His family life provides an important
connection with the real world. His outlook rests on a bedrock of beliefs
which have never distinguished between social cohesion and opportunities for
the individual; between economic prosperity and social justice.
He has frequently been derided by some on the left of his party as a product
of the 'soundbite' politics of the 1980s, but - again like Mr Smith - he
sees no contradiction between passion and moderation.
His case is that Labour, as it did in 1945 and 1963, must lead the tide of
ideas if it is to return to government. Above all it must eschew the
comfortable politics of delusion which have kept it out of office for 15
years.
Mr Blair is determined that the Labour party must change. But he is equally
adamant that change does not mean abandonment of past principles. As he put
it in one of the many speeches and newspaper articles through which he has
sought to build a new ideological framework for Labour: 'Reform is not about
betraying principles but about rescuing them from the past.'
In other words you do not have to sign up to old-style collectivism, to
state ownership, or to punitive income tax rates to promote the fundamental
goal of the Labour party - offering opportunity to the broad mass of the
people.
Mr Blair's views are not unique. They are shared by his close ally and
friend Mr Gordon Brown. The shadow chancellor is also a formidable candidate
for the leadership.
But while Mr Brown has been bogged down in trench warfare with union leaders
in his attempts to construct a credible economic strategy, Mr Blair has
found the room in his present post to translate principles into policies.
His startling success in fashioning a surprisingly tough stance on crime
owes much to his more fundamental emphasis on partnership between the
individual and the community. Society as a whole has an obligation to
prevent and deter crime. But the individual cannot escape responsibility for
his or her actions. The soundbite - tough on crime, tough on the causes of
crime - is more than a clever slogan.
He adopted a similar approach in his dealings with the unions as shadow
employment secretary before the 1992 general election. To the fury of many
in the union movement - something which will count against him now - he
argued that Labour's commitment should be to the rights of individual
workers' rather than to the political muscle of the Trades Union Congress.
Voters like such sentiments - particularly when they are delivered by a
young, personable and articulate politician. It is hard to find anyone at
Westminster who does not believe that Mr Blair would be the leader most
likely to win back the support of the middle classes in southern England.
Mr Blair is confident in his convictions. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour
leader, regards him as one of the bravest politicians of his generation. He
is feared by his Conservative opponents. His opponents on the Labour left at
Westminster respect him as well as disagree with him.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, regards him as the toughest Labour
spokesman he has faced across the Commons despatch box. Privately, cabinet
colleagues admit that he is the choice they fear most as leader.
If Mr Blair wins the Labour leadership the Conservatives will deride him for
his youthful inexperience. But what will frighten them is that he might
emerge as the Jack Kennedy of British politics.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Leader balloting rules clarified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will elect its next leader by single transferable vote
after taking advice from its solicitors following the confusion which arose
over interpretation of rules passed by last year's annual conference.
Rule 2(c) states that a candidate must receive half of the votes cast in the
election in order to win. If this does not happen on the first ballot,
'further ballots shall be held on an elimination basis'.
This could have been interpreted as meaning the party would have to hold a
series of ballots and go back to the electorate involved each time.
The party's lawyers have recommended to the ruling National Executive
Committee that this can be interpreted to cover ballot voting with electors
giving preferences among more than two candidates.
The NEC is expected to decide when to hold the leadership election at a
meeting on May 25. The choice is between proceeding quickly, with the result
announced at a special one-day conference by the end of July, or waiting
until the party's annual conference in early October.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Two-tier county systems proposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission is proposing that a two-tier system of
counties and districts should continue in parts of three counties -
Hampshire, Kent and Leicestershire - in conflict with the government's
preference for all-purpose unitary authorities.
In Hampshire, the favoured option is to make Portsmouth and Southampton
unitary, while leaving the two-tier system intact for the rest of the
county. In Kent, mergers between Gravesham and Dartford, and between
Rochester and Gillingham, would create unitaries with the rest of the county
staying two-tier, while in Leicestershire, Rutland and Leicester city would
become unitary.
In the other counties covered - Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria,
Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Lancashire, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire -
unitary options are preferred, although there is a wide range of structures
in each.

Daewoo Motor, the Korean carmaker, plans to enter the west European car
market next year with the launch of its cars in the UK and Ireland.
The company, the third largest vehicle maker in Korea, is establishing a
wholly owned importer-distributor in the UK with the aim of setting up a
network of 75 to 100 dealers. They will be recruited this year, with the
franchise launched next spring.
The company hopes for a 1 per cent share of the UK new-car market by 1998,
implying sales of about 20,000 a year.
Mr Leslie Woodcock, formerly managing director of Suzuki GB Cars, has been
appointed managing director of Daewoo's UK car operations.
Daewoo Motor was formerly a joint venture with General Motors. Daewoo took
over full control in 1992.
It plans to launch versions of its Espero and LeMans/Racer family cars,
developed from the previous generation Vauxhall Cavalier and Astra models,
under co-operation with GM.

FT  14 MAY 94 / 450 jobs to be cut at GEC Alsthom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC Alsthom, the Franco-British power and transportation equipment group, is
cutting 450 UK jobs, Andrew Baxter writes. It says the restructuring is
designed to 'meet changing market conditions and combat strong international
competition'.
The cuts, in the company's power plants and traction businesses, are its
biggest since 1991 when it shed 900 jobs and closed its power equipment
plant at Larne, Northern Ireland.
The latest retrenchment, along with redeployment, will halve the company's
workforce at Trafford Park, Manchester, to 750. But there will be a net gain
of 130 jobs at Preston and 180 at Rugby.
GEC Alsthom Traction, which makes propulsion and power-supply systems for
railway rolling stock, is cutting 220 jobs at Manchester and 130 at Preston,
and moving 260 commercial, engineering and administrative workers from
Trafford Park to Preston.
Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom in the UK, said rationalisation of
propulsion unit production around one plant had been under discussion for
some time. The move partly reflected the imminent British Rail privatisation
and the resulting 'absolute shortage of orders'.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Thames Water in Malaysia row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thames Water has become embroiled in a political row in Malaysia, as the
country continues its ban on awarding government contracts to British
companies.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, has criticised the local
government in the north Malaysian state of Kelantan because he says its
leaders have awarded a water supply contract to Thames. Mr Anwar accused the
local authority of defying government policy.
The Kelantan government says it awarded the contract at the end of last
month.
The Malaysian government imposed its ban on British companies in February in
retaliation for critical comments about the Malaysian leadership that
appeared in the British press.
Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames, has denied that any such
contract has yet been awarded.
Mr Hoffman said that Thames had been 'working very hard' to win the water
distribution contract in Kelantan but a final decision had not yet been
made.
'We are up against a lot of international competition, but I would suspect
that we have got to the point where we are in the lead,' he said.
The reason for the confusion is not clear. Kelantan is the only state in the
Malaysian federation not controlled by the governing national front
coalition. In recent months the authorities in Kelantan and the federal
government in Kuala Lumpur have been involved in a number of bitter
arguments.
A number of British companies are believed to have lost multi-million pound
contracts as a result of the ban.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Engine maker incensed by overdraft reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emdair, a small company which has developed a potentially world-beating
lightweight diesel engine, is facing collapse because, it says, its bank has
reduced its over-draft.
The company, formed in 1984 from the former Weslake engine group, recently
completed the first trials of the diesel engine.
Mr Michael Daniel, Emdair's managing director, said the engine was being
developed as an alternative to conventional diesels in auxiliary power units
on tanks and other military equipment.
'We regard the engine as a major breakthrough in world diesel technology,'
Mr Daniel said.
Last month the company, based in Rye, East Sussex, received the final Pounds
45,000 instalment from Australian-based Collins Motor Corporation, on a
Pounds 50,000 order to supply the first engine.
The Pounds 45,000 was paid into Emdair's bank, the Croydon branch of
Clydesdale Bank. Mr Daniel said the bank promptly reduced the company's
overdraft limit from Pounds 125,000, which Emdair had been exceeding by
Pounds 5,000, to Pounds 85,000.
Mr Daniel was incensed at the decision. 'We wanted to use the Pounds 45,000
to pay the Inland Revenue and other creditors, and retain our facility at
Pounds 125,000 so that we could develop the company,' he said. The overdraft
has since risen to Pounds 100,000.
Mr Daniel said the company had an order book sufficient to maintain the
existing workforce of 19. But without the ability to buy critical raw
materials and specialised services its ability to continue trading was
threatened.
Mrs Jacqui Lait, Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye, has written to Lord
Nickson, Clydesdale's chairman, asking him to review the bank's position
urgently and help Emdair through its current difficulties. She has also
written to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, about the case.
Glasgow-based Clydesdale Bank said last night it could not comment because
of customer confidentiality.
Emdair, which also produces conventional light-aircraft engines, is 40 per
cent owned by Collins. The latest four-cylinder 1.7-litre diesel engine
evolved from a petrol engine developed by Emdair for the Australian company.
It is based on the so-called 'scotch yoke' principle that involves two
exactly opposed horizontal cylinders to balance the engine forces. The
system was first used on steam-driven water pumps.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Ministers to press for U-turn on CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers plan to send the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project for a cross-London
rail link back to the four-man private bill committee which recently voted
to reject it.
The government believes the only realistic way of reviving the project is to
persuade the committee to change its mind.
Officials have all but ruled out the only other options. They are to present
a 'hybrid' bill - one which involves both public and private interests - to
parliament or to use the Transport and Works Act of 1992.
The Department of Transport is already committed to one hybrid bill for the
high-speed rail link. It is unlikely to be awarded parliamentary time for a
second in November's Queen's Speech.
The use of the Transport and Works Act would involve the project's sponsors
requesting Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to lay an order
before parliament.
But because objections are then heard at a public inquiry or inquiries along
the route, Whitehall officials believe the process could take at least 10
years to complete.
Ministers have started lobbying two of the three MPs on the private bill
committee which rejected CrossRail, as the only realistic way of saving the
project. Only Mr Matthew Banks, Tory member for Southport, supported the
bill on the committee.
Government officials are pinning their hopes on persuading Mr John Marek,
Labour member for Wrexham, to change his mind. They have taken comfort from
the support for the measure given by Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's shadow
transport secretary.
Mr Dobson has urged the government to put a motion before the Commons
sending the bill back to the committee and instructing them to look at it
again.
Mr Ken Purchase, the other Labour MP to oppose the bill, is not expected to
reverse his vote. He is understood to be sceptical about the benefits of
private finance in public-sector projects such as CrossRail.
Mr Tony Marlow, the committee's Tory chairman, has said he thinks it
unlikely that the government would be successful in asking the committee to
reconsider its decision. This would require it to show that the committee
had not acted according to the proper procedures or that there had been a
significant change in the circumstances of the proposal.
The committee was influenced by the decline in travel demand in recent years
and by the development of other travel routes such as the Jubilee Line, he
said.
The CrossRail project would provide a six-mile east-west link under central
London. Commuters could reach their destinations without changing trains.

The government yesterday dismissed a suggestion from Sir Gordon Downey, the

In a strongly worded statement, the Treasury said that there was 'no value
in pursuing the possibility that the PIA might become a designated agency'.
Sir Gordon raised the prospect of putting the PIA on the same footing as the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, as a way of
reducing duplication and expense in the regulatory system.
Writing in The Independent newspaper yesterday, Sir Gordon argued that such
a move would also help to persuade smaller firms that the PIA would not
simply be a 'colonial outpost' of SIB.
Last September Sir Gordon was abruptly replaced as PIA chairman by Mr Joe
Palmer, former chief executive of Legal &amp; General and a director of SIB.
The Treasury said that it had no sympathy with turning the PIA into a
designated agency. This course would, it said, delay the introduction of
higher standards, create the risk of inconsistency of standards and reduce
practitioner input.
'It is certainly not clear how that would help to protect investors,' it
concluded.
Some of those in favour of the designated agency option have argued that it
might appeal to the government because it could be achieved without new
legislation.
However, if the PIA were to become a designated agency that had the power to
levy fines, then new legislation - which the government has set its face
against - would be needed.
Sir Gordon's suggestion and the response to it come against a background of
continuing discontent from some elements of the retail financial services
industry.
Two-thirds of life companies have now applied to join the PIA.
But with only about two months to go before it comes into operation, fewer
than half its total potential members - including independent financial
advisers and others - have so far applied to join.
The most likely event to spark further applications would be an announcement
by SIB confirming its inclination to recognise the PIA as protector of the
private investor.
Such a statement might enable some of the larger organisations which have
expressed unease about the PIA to support the new regulator, as it would be
seen as a stronger guarantee that the new regime would mean higher
standards.

<TEXT>
Litigation seeking compensation on the collapse of Astra Holdings, the
munitions company connected to the Iraqi supergun affair, is likely in the
next few weeks against its professional advisers.
Lawyers engaged by the partners at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who are the receivers
to Astra, are believed to be preparing potential legal actions against Stoy
Hayward, the auditors, and Paine Webber, its merchant bank.
Separately, the joint disciplinary scheme, the accountancy profession's
highest regulatory body, confirmed yester-day that it had begun an
investigation into Astra, which was subject to a critical Department of
Trade and Industry inspectors' report last year.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Bidders queue for sell-off of London buses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several dozen bidders, including a number from overseas, have made offers to
buy one or more of the 10 companies that run London's red buses, it emerged
yesterday.
With many of the bidders making offers for all 10 companies, the number of
individual bids runs into the hundreds.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, financial adviser to London Transport Buses, was
yesterday sifting through the indicative bids which were filed by the
Thursday noon deadline. It will draw up a shortlist of organisations that
will be asked to make a final bid by late August or early September.
The London bus companies, which have a combined turnover of more than Pounds
440m and pre-tax profits of about Pounds 20m, are due to be privatised by
the end of the year.
Bids have come in from all the large UK bus companies, the management teams
of London's 10 bus companies and bidders in South Africa, France and Sweden.
There have also been bids from 'a number of companies you would not
necessarily expect', BZW said.
Stagecoach, the quoted Perth-based company, said it had bid for all the
companies though it expected the popular ones to fetch high prices. Mr Derek
Scott, finance director, said he was not surprised at the high degree of
interest because of the worldwide image of London's red buses.
'Nobody has been put off by the government's decision to defer the
de-regulation of London's buses,' said Mr Clive Hodson, managing director of
London Transport Buses and the man in charge of privatisation. De-regulation
would increase competition on many bus routes.
The organisations may bid for as many bus companies as they like, but they
would not be allowed to acquire operations accounting for more than 25 per
cent of the market. This means they would be able to acquire at most three
of the smallest companies or two of the larger ones. They would also not be
permitted to acquire neighbouring bus companies.
Successful bidders will be expected to provide acceptable pension
arrangements for staff of the former bus companies, Mr Hodson said.
London represents the final stage in the privatisation of Britain's bus
services.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Voting rules for leadership fight to be clarified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party will elect its next leader by single transferable vote
after taking advice from its solicitors following the confusion which arose
over interpretation of rules passed by last year's annual conference.
Rule 2(c) states that a candidate must receive half of the votes cast in the
election in order to win. If this does not happen on the first ballot,
'further ballots shall be held on an elimination basis'.
This could have been interpreted as meaning the party would have to hold a
series of ballots and go back to the electorate involved each time.
The party's lawyers have recommended to the ruling National Executive
Committee that this can be interpreted to cover ballot voting with electors
giving preferences among more than two candidates under the STV - or
preferential voting - system.
The NEC is expected to decide on when to hold the leadership election when
it meets on 25 May.
The choice is between going ahead quickly, with the result announced at a
special one-day conference by the end of July, or waiting until the party's
annual conference in early October.
Voting will be in three sections, with each section accounting for a third
of the total vote - the 4.5m union members who pay a political levy; the
250,000 or so individual members of the party; and Labour MPs and MEPs.
Under Labour rules, the union members must not be 'members or supporters of
any other party or otherwise ineligible to be members of the Labour party'.
The party's rules make clear that voting will 'take place under the
procedures of each affiliated organisation' on the basis of 'one person one
vote'. Most unions are expected to use individual postal ballots of
levy-paying members.
They have to do this already by law when they hold ballots to secure the
approval of all their members for having political funds.
Unions must also hold postal ballots of their members for the election of
their leaders and executive committees as well as before organising
industrial disruption.
Union leaders will no longer, as in the past, wield block votes in the
election, but are likely to express their views and candidates can be
expected to campaign around the union conference circuit over the next few
weeks.
The big difference with any other previous election for Labour leader is
that the candidates will be able to appeal not just to small groups of
activists, or the paid-up party members but to millions of ordinary people
who do not belong to any political party - but pay the political levy to
their union.

FT  14 MAY 94 / The man who might be Labour's JFK: The party seems to be
turning to Tony Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair was saying nothing yesterday about the leadership of the
Labour party. As the shock of Mr John Smith's death continued to reverberate
around the corridors of Westminster, callers to his office were told
politely but firmly that the shadow home secretary was in mourning. Neither
he nor those around him wanted to talk about the future at the moment.
His silence did not quell the speculation. The outcome of the leadership
contest which will follow Mr Smith's death will be uncertain for some time
yet. But all logic dictates Mr Blair should and will stand.
Amid the genuine grief there is a strengthening perception in the party at
Westminster that the 41-year-old MP for Sedgefield is the natural successor
to Mr Smith. He is 14 years younger. He displays more of the impatience of
youth than the calculated caution which guided Mr Smith's leadership of his
party. But Mr Blair shares many of the qualities of Labour's lost leader.
Some comparisons are superficial. Mr Blair is English rather than Scottish,
but he was born and went to school in Edinburgh. He is middle-class. He is a
barrister. Real resemblances run deeper. Mr Blair, like Mr Smith, is a
politician at ease with himself. His family life provides an important
connection with the real world. His outlook rests on a bedrock of beliefs
which have never distinguished between social cohesion and opportunities for
the individual; between economic prosperity and social justice.
He has frequently been derided by some on the left of his party as a product
of the 'soundbite' politics of the 1980s, but - again like Mr Smith - he
sees no contradiction between passion and moderation.
His case is that Labour, as it did in 1945 and 1963, must lead the tide of
ideas if it is to return to government. Above all it must eschew the
comfortable politics of delusion which have kept it out of office for 15
years.
Mr Blair is determined that the Labour party must change. But he is equally
adamant that change does not mean abandonment of past principles. As he put
it in one of the many speeches and newspaper articles through which he has
sought to build a new ideological framework for Labour: 'Reform is not about
betraying principles but about rescuing them from the past.'
In other words you do not have to sign up to old-style collectivism, to
state ownership, or to punitive income tax rates to promote the fundamental
goal of the Labour party - offering opportunity to the broad mass of the
people.
Mr Blair's views are not unique. They are shared by his close ally and
friend Mr Gordon Brown. The shadow chancellor is also a formidable candidate
for the leadership.
But while Mr Brown has been bogged down in trench warfare with union leaders
in his attempts to construct a credible economic strategy, Mr Blair has
found the room in his present post to translate principles into policies.
His startling success in fashioning a surprisingly tough stance on crime
owes much to his more fundamental emphasis on partnership between the
individual and the community. Society as a whole has an obligation to
prevent and deter crime. But the individual cannot escape responsibility for
his or her actions. The soundbite - tough on crime, tough on the causes of
crime - is more than a clever slogan.
He adopted a similar approach in his dealings with the unions as shadow
employment secretary before the 1992 general election. To the fury of many
in the union movement - something which will count against him now - he
argued that Labour's commitment should be to the rights of individual
workers' rather than to the political muscle of the Trades Union Congress.
Voters like such sentiments - particularly when they are delivered by a
young, personable and articulate politician. It is hard to find anyone at
Westminster who does not believe that Mr Blair would be the leader most
likely to win back the support of the middle classes in southern England.
Mr Blair is confident in his convictions. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour
leader, regards him as one of the bravest politicians of his generation. He
is feared by his Conservative opponents. His opponents on the Labour left at
Westminster respect him as well as disagree with him.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, regards him as the toughest Labour
spokesman he has faced across the Commons despatch box. Privately, cabinet
colleagues admit that he is the choice they fear most as leader.
If Mr Blair wins the Labour leadership the Conservatives will deride him for
his youthful inexperience. But what will frighten them is that he might
emerge as the Jack Kennedy of British politics.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Arafat struggles to name cabinet: The PLO leader has a hard
task balancing rival elements of the Palestinian community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days after the Middle East peace deal was signed Mr Yassir Arafat is
still struggling to name the Palestinian national authority which will act
as a de facto cabinet for self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
In choosing the 24-member authority the chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation must carefully balance powerful families, different political
factions, Christians and Moslems, men and women, the old and the young.
Most difficult of all perhaps he has to bridge the deep gulf in attitudes
between the exiled PLO leadership and those Palestinians from the occupied
territories who have experienced 27 years of repressive Israeli occupation
and who are suspicious of the 'outsiders'.
Many Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe the outsiders have
become corrupt and distanced from the lives of ordinary Palestinians. They
also fear that the Tunis-based exiles have little enthusiasm for the
democratic ethos that has sprouted during the seven year intifada.
Palestinian experts say consensus building is a job Mr Arafat does best. For
a quarter of a century he has remained chairman of the PLO, surviving
military and political setbacks and often bloody internal challenges. But he
is clearly having great difficulty in naming the authority which should have
been in place last Wednesday.
PLO officials say several nominees like Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Jamal
Sourani - all members of the 18-strong PLO executive committee - have flatly
refused to join the authority. It was unclear last night whether Farouk
Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, would remain the PLO's
foreign minister. Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, an important Arafat adviser and head
of a small Palestinian faction based in Jericho, has not yet made up his
mind. Many 'insiders' have also been cautious about joining or have placed
conditions on their acceptance.
The reluctance of many PLO leaders to sit on the authority reflects
widespread criticism inside and outside the West Bank and Gaza of the
concessions Mr Arafat made in negotiating the peace accord. Many prefer to
keep their hands clean of self-rule and position themselves for a possible
future leadership challenge should Mr Arafat fail to deliver on the high
expectations of Palestinians.
The difficulties were demonstrated yesterday after Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior
PLO official, announced an 'official' list of 15 appointees. Mr Samir
Ghoshe, a PLO executive committee member, and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, former
Palestinian spokeswoman, were on the list but both denied they would accept
a post. Mrs Ashrawi said her plans to lead a watchdog on democracy, human
rights and corruption, remained.
A majority of the members will be 'insiders' from the West Bank and Gaza. At
least one woman and one Christian are on the authority. Several important
families are represented and Mr Arafat is carefully picking people from
different parts of the West Bank and Gaza to accommodate the strong feeling
of local community in the territories.
Mr Faisal Husseini, the head of the powerful Arab East Jerusalem Husseini
family, is on the list. Mr Husseini has said he wishes to have the portfolio
of Jerusalem - the issue which has been shelved in the peace accord but
which is the single most important issue to Palestinians.
To appeal to the marginalised Christian community Mr Arafat has named Mr
Elias Freij, the Mayor of Bethlehem who will be in charge of tourism  - the
sector Palestinians feel will develop quickly.
A particularly popular appointment is Mrs Intisar al-Wazir (Umm Jihad), the
wife of Abu Jihad, the PLO's former number two who was assassinated by
Israeli commandos in 1988. Abu Jihad, who was until his death in charge of
military operations, is perhaps the most popular figure in the territories.
Since his death Mrs al-Wazir has run the PLO's welfare fund for Palestinian
martyrs and their families and she will get the social welfare portfolio.
Among the outsiders named so far are Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Alaa), the PLO
official who negotiated the secret peace accord in Oslo and the Israeli-PLO
economic protocol and Mr Yasser Amr, a Jordan-based PLO Executive Committee
member. Mr Qurie is expected to be in charge of economics and relations with
donors and Mr Amr will probably have the education portfolio.
Those not yet named but expected to be on the authority include Mr Jawid-al
Ghossein, a London- based businessman who has been in charge of the
Palestine National Fund (PLO finance ministry), and Gen Nasser Yousef. Mr
Ghossein will have the finance and Gen Yousef the police portfolios.
Almost all those named to the authority are either from Mr Arafat's Fatah
faction of the PLO or are close to the Palestinian leader. Mr Arafat said
yesterday he hoped to go to Jericho next month.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Esso oil is to reappear in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Esso oil is to reappear in India after an absence of 18 years under a deal
reached yesterday by Exxon, the US oil company that owns the Esso brand, and
Hindustan Petroleum of India.
The two companies have signed a licensing and marketing agreement that will
allow Hindustan Petroleum to blend and market Esso lubricants and other
speciality products in India.
Exxon, which uses the Esso trademark for its products outside the US, pulled
out of India partially in 1974 and completely in 1976 because of the adverse
economic and political climate then prevailing.
Since then, the Indian government has taken steps to liberalise its markets.
Last year it approved investment plans by several western companies
including Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks company, which returned to the
country after an absence of 16 years.
Exxon previously owned a refinery and a lubricant manufaturing plant in
Bombay and was the market leader in aviation and marine fuels. When it left,
the facilities were bought by the Indian government and are now owned by
Hindustan Petroleum.
Under the new arrangement, Exxon will use its refinery in Singapore - its
largest in the Asia-Pacific area - to supply Hindustan Petroleum with the
basic ingredients for a range of lubricants. Hindustan Petroleum will blend
them to Exxon's specifications and sell them under the Esso name.
Exxon's presence in the Indian market will be relatively small compared to
its position before 1976. But it said the move was significant because it
would re-establish the Esso brand in India and provide a platform for
expansion.
Mr Kwa Chong Seng, chairman and managing director of Esso Singapore, said
market studies had shown that Indian consumers had a strong awareness of the
Esso brand name.

Danish retail sales volume in the first two months of the year rose by 5 per
cent compared with the same months in 1993, according to the official
Statistical Office. The statistics confirm a recovery of domestic demand
long predicted by the government.
New car registrations in April (they are not included in the retail index)
increased by 53 per cent from last year to 13,442 and for the first four
months new car sales increased by 63.3 per cent, the highest level since
1987. The Danish economy has endured seven years with an average GDP growth
rate of 1 per cent. The government, which has given a substantial boost,
through fiscal policy, to demand this year, predicts a real GDP growth rate
of 3 per cent, with private consumption increasing by 4.1 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain yesterday joined the latest round of European interest cuts, with the
central bank lowering its benchmark money rate by a quarter point to 7.50
per cent. It was the fifth reduction by the Bank of Spain since the start of
the year when the rate stood at 9 per cent. The move, which brings Spanish
interest rates to their lowest level since the mid-1970s, followed the
Bundesbank's rate reductions on Wednesday.
Less positive news came with a disappointingly high 0.4 per cent increase in
the consumer price index for April, the same as April last year. Accumulated
inflation so far this year at 1.8 per cent is already more than half the
government's 3.5 per cent target for the whole year. The rate over the last
12 months was 4.9 per cent. Underlying inflation to stand at 4.6 per cent
over the 12-month period.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Zambia seeks to cancel debt

Zambia hopes to cancel Dollars 900m of external debt owed to commercial
banks through a buy-back scheme financed by the World Bank and bilateral
donors, Mr Derek Musonda, director of loans and investment at the Zambian
Finance Ministry, said yesterday. Because Zambia's debt paper is traded at a
deep discount in the secondary markets, Mr Musonda said a Dollars 45m grant
put together by the donor community would purchase debt with a nominal value
of Dollars 900m (including Dollars 500m of arrears). 'Our intention is to
buy back our entire commercial bank debt stock totalling Dollars 1bn,' Mr
Musonda said. 'This will reduce our total foreign debt to Dollars 5.9bn.'
The buy-back will alleviate Zambia's debt-servicing burden, which currently
consumes 40 per cent of the country's export earnings. If the former
socialist country manages to stick to its structural adjustment programme,
Mr Musonda said Zambia hoped to ask the Paris Club of creditor nations to
write off much of the country's bilateral debts next year. Zambia owes the
Paris Club about half of the outstanding Dollars 5.9bn; the remainder is
owed to institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
which do not allow rescheduling or debt forgiveness.

Upward pressure on US inflation remains subdued, official figures indicated
yesterday. The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent last month, less than
expected. The annual rate of inflation fell to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per
cent in March. 'Core' consumer prices - which exclude the volatile food and
energy components - were also subdued, rising 0.2 per cent last month and by
2.8 per cent in the year to April.
The figures followed an encouraging report on wholesale price inflation
earlier this week. Producer prices fell 0.1 per cent last month, taking the
year-on-year decline to 0.4 per cent. Most economists, however, still expect
the Federal Reserve to signal another increase in short-term interest rates
next week following a meeting of its policy-making open market committee. A
rate increase is seen as necessary to slow the rate of domestic growth and
help stabilise the dollar in foreign exchange markets.

<TEXT>
Southern Yemeni leaders yesterday proposed an eight-point peace plan calling
for the immediate end of the 10-day-old civil war and the formation of a
national salvation government. The proposal came as northern forces appeared
to be gaining ground in their southwards drive to capture the strategic port
of Aden.
The southern Yemen Socialist party said its peace plan called for the rival
armies to return to the positions they held before the war. The south has
said before it favours dialogue to solve the conflict. But its statement is
the first since hostilities erupted that publicly offers detailed proposals
for ending the war. Some of the ideas echo earlier demands made by the YSP
in the months before the war started to resolve a long-running political
crisis between northern and southern leaders.
Yesterday's peace offer came after Northern Yemeni forces were reported to
have captured the town of Dhalea just 60 miles north of Aden. A defence
official from the north also claimed two brigades had reached little Aden,
an industrial area 6 miles southwest of Aden proper. People in Aden said the
city was quiet and there was no sign of fighting.
Earlier, a southern Yemeni military statement said its forces had shot down
three northern military aircraft and damaged a warship in a battle off Aden.
The war broke out on May 4 after months of feuding between President Ali
Abdullah Saleh, a conservative, and Vice President Ali Salem Baidh, a
socialist, over the balance of power between north and south in a unified
Yemen formed in 1990. Mr Saleh accuses Mr Baidh of ignoring his authority
and trying to secede from the north, where most of the south Arabian
peninsula state's 13m people live. Mr Baidh accuses Mr Saleh of an iron-fist
campaign to erase southern influence in government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has approved an innovative Dollars 117.8m loan to India to
support cataract surgery aimed at restoring sight to more than 8m people by
the year 2000.
The loan illustrates a shift in the bank's development strategy towards
projects likely to provide tangible benefits for poor and disadvantaged
people.
'This loan marks a watershed,' said Ms Maria Donoso Clark, manager of the
bank's cataract project. Apart from the international effort to eradicate
river blindness, a disease cause by parasites, this was the first project
supported by a multilateral agency specifically aimed at combatting
blindness.
Reducing blindness would provide economic as well as social benefits because
25 per cent of people afflicted by cataracts were aged 45-60 and still
productive. However, it was not a project likely to be financed by the
private sector, she said.
About a third of an estimated global blind population of 35m live in India.
About 13m Indians are blind in both eyes, mainly because of cataracts; a
further 10m are blind in one eye. Indians, especially women and members of
remote tribal populations, are thought to be especially prone to cataracts
as a result of malnutrition and excessive exposure to the sun.
The loan - provided by the International Development Association, the bank's
concessional arm - will meet 90 per cent of the cost of an Indian government
programme to restore sight by treating a backlog of cataract cases. The
project will involve recruiting and training about 360 surgeons and about
1,700 nurses and other support staff.
The project represents one of the largest collaborative ventures between the
Indian central and state governments and the voluntary and private sectors.
The bank credit will, for example, provide seed money to enable private
ophthalmic surgeons to establish practices in poor remote areas and urban
slums.

Australia's federal government yesterday defended its right to provide
additional military assistance to Cambodia, in its struggle with the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas, despite reports of displeasure from officials in Thailand.
Senator Gareth Evans, the foreign minister,
said it was legitimate for the elected Cambodian goverment to seek
assistance from the international community in order to maintain the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Senator Evans said that the request was being seriously considered. Any
decision would be taken after consultation with 'other interested countries,
including Thailand'. Australia did not view the security situation in
Cambodia as 'in any way alarming'. 'In terms of overall territory held, the
situation is not significantly different from when the latest cycle of
military acitivity commenced some three months ago.

<TEXT>
European Union environment ministers discussed the effect of tourism, one of
Europe's most profitable sectors, on the environment at an informal meeting
yesterday. 'There is a common view that we need to face environment
management as a whole in areas under tourist pressure,' said Greek deputy
minister for the environment Ms Elisavet Papazoi, who is presiding over the
two-day meeting.
Santorini, considered by many the most stunning of Greece's Cycladic
islands, served as a perfect backdrop for the talks, not only because of its
natural beauty but also the evident destruction that masses of travellers
have brought to its once quiet town. Ms Papazoi said the main square of
Fira, where the meeting will continue today, was a good example of bad
catering for tourism, with its profusion of neon lights, electrical wires
and traffic congestion. She said she planned to propose Santorini, which
also boasts a well preserved ruin of a city dating to 1450 BC, as the site
for an EU pilot programme for sustainable developments.

The rebel offensive in Rwanda appeared to have stalled yesterday, despite
heavy fighting in the countryside and new reports of ethnic massacres. UN
officials said 88 students were found hacked to death on Thursday at a
school in Gikongoro in south-west Rwanda, and seven people were killed with
machetes in front of the Red Cross building in Kigali.
The fighting between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis in Rwanda has
already claimed 100,000 to 200,000 lives in little more than a month, the UN
and aid groups say. Most of the victims have been civilians. The UN Security
Council plans to send up to 5,500 African troops to Rwanda to establish safe
havens for civilians and assist relief workers. But it was unclear whether
the troops would be allowed to use force, how they would be financed and
whether an arms embargo would be imposed on the warring parties.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Israel to consider Mideast common market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel would consider the establishment of a common market in the Middle
East in the next decade following infrastructure developments in the region,
Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said yesterday.
Mr Beilin, speaking to a group of UK financiers with interests in the
recently launched Israel Fund Plc, emphasised the benefits of co-ordinated
policies for energy, transport, telecommunications and water, but stressed
that regional co-operation in these areas was a prerequisite for further
integration.
'In the next five years in the Middle East, with Palestine, Egypt, Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon, we may see the building of a common infrastructure. If we
do, in the next 10 years or so we can look at the possibility of a common
market.' Mr Beilin said.
Linking electricity grids is one initiative, crucial for further
interdependence, which is under way.
Mr Beilin argued that connecting grids with Egypt and Jordan, and thereby
joining existing agreements with Turkey and Iraq, would save Israel Dollars
700m per year because of the high costs of the country's gas-fired
electricity. He also claims, however, that a regional agreement on
electricity could save all participants as much as Dollars 4bn each year.
Other developments advocated by Mr Beilin include an open skies policy
ending 'idiotic restrictions' on air travel which had forced Israel to 'live
for so many years like an island'. Such a liberalisation in the movement of
goods and people would, of course, have to be matched on the ground.
The minister pointed out that economic integration in the area would be of
benefit to all but easy for none. Vast differences in the numbers of skilled
workers in the labour markets, the levels of capital investment and national
product between countries would have to be addressed before any common
market could be established.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Africa's lenders and borrowers fall out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The African Development Bank's annual general meeting limped to a close
yesterday with two central issues unresolved: the replenishment of the
bank's soft loan fund and the adoption of stricter lending rules to stem a
haemorrhage of loan losses threatening the very survival of the bank.
African member countries, which own two-thirds of the bank, baulked at
proposals that would restrict AfDB loans, which carry market interest rates,
to a handful of solvent governments. They asked for more time to consider
new creditworthiness guidelines.
'Donor countries should not insist on pre-conditions that would
inadvertently deny any category of countries access to the resources of the
Bank Group,' Nigeria's central bank governor, Paul Ogwuma, told the meeting.
However, Mr Barrie Hudson, leader of the British delegation, said the
problem of arrears had arisen 'because of the inherent risk of lending on
terms that are too hard to countries with low per capita incomes and
comparative economic fragility.' The AfDB is owed Dollars 700m on a
disbursed loan portfolio of Dollars 8.4bn.
The deadlock on who should be allowed to borrow, and on what terms, led
donors countries to suspend negotiations on the replenishment of the African
Development Fund, which ran out of money last year.
Mr Hudson urged the AfDB to set an income threshold below which countries
could only qualify for concessionary funds. He said the UK would not provide
more resources for the African Development Fund until the AfDB acted to
improve the quality of its projects, its lending policies and the issue of
governance.
Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's Senegalese president,
implied that donor countries had antagonised African governors with their
'take it or leave it' mentality,
but he said he shared the concern of donor countries about the urgency to
clear arrears and improving the quality of the bank's loan portfolio.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Motors and Proton, the Japanese and Malaysian carmakers, have
received approval by the Vietnamese government to form a joint vehicle
manufacturing and sales venture in Vietnam.
The new company, Vina Star Motors, will be owned 25 per cent each by
Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Corporation, Proton and Vietranscimex, a
Vietnamese national company. Mitsubishi Motors is the first Japanese
carmaker to enter a joint venture in Vietnam.
The new company will be located in Ho Chi Minh City, and will have an
initial equity capital of Dollars 12m, which will be increased ater to
Dollars 16m.
Total investment in the project is expected to rise to Dollars 50m.
Vina Star will assemble the Mitsubishi Delica minibus with production
scheduled to start in March next year.
Output is planned to rise 5,000 units a year in the first stage and later to
12,000 a year.
Proton, in which Mitsubishi holds a minority stake, said that the joint
venture would eventually be expanded to include the assembly of Proton cars
in Vietnam.
Meanwhile, Reuter reports that Mitsubishi Motors has agreed with Mitsubishi
Corporation and Malaysian and Chinese concerns to make a feasibility study
of possible co-operation to develop the Chinese car industry.
The Chinese concerns are the state-owned China North Industrial Group, China
Aerospace Corp and Aviation Industries of China, the company said. A
Malaysian government investment institute and a Malaysian private bank were
also involved.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Singapore takes modern message to China: Tony Walker and
Andrew Gowers visit what Lee Kuan Yew hopes will be his lasting monument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore under the rule of Mr Lee Kwan Yew has drawn inspiration from
ancient Chinese traditions of diligence and filial obedience: now the island
state is in the process of giving back to modernising China some of the
lessons it has learned in its transformation from British colony to modern
regional centre of commerce and industry.
In marshy land about 80 kilometres west of Shanghai, near the scenic town of
Suzhou, work began this month on one of China's most ambitious projects - a
USDollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn) Singapore-Suzhou industrial park designed to
serve as a model for other such projects throughout the country.
This 'super-development' zone, in which Singaporean institutions will be
shareholders, will cover about 70 sq km, and in many respects will be a
giant replica of Jurong, Singapore's largest industrial estate. Jurong
houses some 2,000 companies and is regarded as one of the jewels in
Singapore's industrial crown.
Responsibility for guiding the project has been vested in Singapore-Suzhou
Township Development (SSTD), which was incorporated in Singapore last
September with authorised capital of Dollars 300m; SSTD is forming a joint
venture with a consortium of Suzhou companies and the Chinese government to
implement the project.
Mr Zhao Da Sheng of the Singapore-industrial park's preparatory committee
said, with the Chinese love of animal metaphors, that, while Shanghai might
be the head of China's economic dragon, Suzhou and surrounding areas were
the neck supporting the head.
Mr Zhao has a point, one that has not escaped the Singapore authorities who
have secured for themselves a substantial foothold in China's
fastest-growing region in the Yangtze river delta. Singaporean companies and
their international partners will certainly benefit from Singapore's
involvement in the project.
'We believe,' Mr Zhao said, 'that Singapore's leaders are very good
strategists.'
Mr Lee Kuan Yew has himself taken a close interest in the project and was a
co-signatory in Beijing in February this year of the
government-to-government agreement pledging official backing.
The Singaporean push into China is also a sign of strengthening bonds with
overseas Chinese communities. It is doubtful that China, with its
sensitivities about foreign concession areas dating from its pre-revolution
experience, would have countenanced such an industrial park managed by
'foreigners' if they were not overseas Chinese.
Japanese corporations, according to Mr Zhao, had asked if they could
participate in the establishment of the industrial park, but had been
politely told no.
China, for its part, makes no secret of the fact that it is seeking to
utilise Singaporean experience and know-how in its efforts to make best use
of foreign investment. No less a figure than Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's
senior leader, said in 1992 of Singapore that 'we should tap their
experience, and learn how to manage better than them'.
Managers of the new park have certainly set themselves an ambitious task in
their plans to transform paddy fields and a polluted lake into an estate
that would include both light-industry facilities, retail malls, a financial
district and residential complexes, not to mention at least one golf course.
About Dollars 100m has been set aside for infrastructure costs of developing
the first 2-sq-km stage of the project's Phase One of the three-phase
project. The organisers plan initially to build 90,000 sq m of standard
workshops and some 60,000 sq m of housing with shopping facilities.
Mr Zhao said the early response from international business had been
positive, and German companies in particular have been taking a close
interest in the project. Among attractions for German companies engaged in
the manufacture of vehicle components is that Volkswagen's main China
assembly works is nearby.
Interestingly, German companies had asked whether a section of the park
could be set aside exclusively for their use. Mr Zhao indicated that, 'if
the price was right', this proposal would be looked upon favourably.
Light industries likely to find a home in the park include
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, electronics and environment protection
equipment. Foreign retailers have also been told they are welcome, along
with foreign banks.
When the park is completed in 2006, its resident population is expected to
number 600,000, but Mr Zhao insists that residential and industrial
development will be balanced carefully.
'We don't want a situation like Shenzhen (the booming development zone
adjacent to Hong Kong) where the population jumped from 100,000 to one
million in a few years,' he said.
Among Singapore institutions involved in planning and implementation are the
Jurong Town Corporation, Housing and Development Board, Ministry of the
Environment, Public Works Department, Urban Redevelopment Authority and
Public Utilities Board.
The 70-sq-km zone will offer much the same tax-breaks as the Economic and
Technological Development Zones (ETDZ's) of China's coastal cities. These
include tax-holidays and other concessions such as a 40 per cent tax rebate
on profits reinvested within the township.
Leases on property will be more expensive than other development zones, but
lease periods will be long. For residential property, 70-year leases are
being offered; for industry, 50 years; for commerce, 40 years.
Singaporean participation among private-sector companies and government
institutions reads like a who's who of Singapore's business. Among those
involved include Keppel Corporation, the leader of the consortium, which is
a Dollars 7bn company involved in ship repair, property, engineering and
financial services.
Others include property companies like Singapore Land and City Developments,
and investment groups, among them Temasek Holdings, the Singapore
government's investment holding company, and National Trades Union Congress
Co-operatives, the investment arm of Singapore's largest labour
organisation.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew may not have returned physically to the land of his
ancestors, but he is doing his best to ensure that a monument to his memory
will survive long after he departs the scene.

<TEXT>
The Japanese government plans to take a first step toward restarting trade
talks with the US by sending a delegation of senior officials to Washington
next week. Mr Eijiro Hata, the new minister for international trade and
industry, yesterday confirmed that a delegation of vice ministers - the most
senior grade of civil servant - will go to Washington to discuss trade.
This follows a phone call by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister (unrelated
to Miti's Mr Hata) to US president Bill Clinton this week, in which they
agreed to resume negotiations. Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan,
followed this with a visit to Miti's Mr Hata and Mr Koji Kakizawa, the
foreign minister.
The Miti minister did not specify which departments - likely to be Miti and
the foreign ministry - would form the delegation or if they would have any
specific proposals to break the deadlock reached in February, when Mr
Clinton and former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa agreed to disagree over
US demands for targets for increased imports.
The new Japanese government yesterday showed some evidence of the fresh
pragmatism attributed to it by senior US officials, when Mr Kakizawa told
parliament that 'some kind of criteria' were needed to measure progress.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Impossible hurdle for foreign horses in Japan: Only a few
races are open to outsiders

Sumo, Japan's national sport, has its foreign champions, and most of the
country's soccer stars are imported. But in the world of horse-racing, the
foreign-bred steed is still shut out from most events.
Tomorrow, five foreign horses will run in the Yasuda Kinen race in Tokyo,
one of just a few races in Japan that are open to horses from abroad.
It will be closely watched, both for the money riding on the horses and for
the impact on the industry, which wants to keep the hurdles high for foreign
horses.
The bets are that one of the five will beat Japan's best for the Y94m
(Pounds 618,400) first prize, confirming horse breeders' worst fears that
opening more of the country's races to non-Japanese thoroughbreds will lead
to foreign domination of a home-grown industry.
In spite of pressure from abroad, only five of the more than 3,400 horse
races held in Japan each year are open to foreign horses. Even in those five
races, the number of foreign participants is strictly restricted; the five
running in the Yasuda Kinen will be competing against 10 or so locally bred
horses.
In the case of sumo, tradition provided a reason for some officials to put
obstacles in the path of foreign wrestlers. But Japanese opposition to
opening horse racing to foreign competition stems from economic vested
interests that have been used to defend other Japanese markets, such as
rice.
Not only are foreign horses highly competitive, they are about 30 per cent
cheaper to raise than Japanese horses. If more races are open to imports,
local horses will win fewer awards and their market value will fall,
damaging the breeding industry, according to the Japan Racing Association.
The Keio Hai spring race last month which was opened to foreign horses for
the first time this year, helped to fuel those fears. The four horses
participating from abroad easily filled the top four positions. 'Like
agricultural products, Japanese horses cannot compete with foreign ones in
terms of costs,' says Mr Keiji Matsuo, an official at the Japanese
thoroughbred breeder's association, which has 2,353 members.
At stake is a total of up to Y100bn in award money that goes to the top five
winners in Japanese horse races.
Horsebreeders are particularly concerned that Japan's commitment under the
Uruguay Round agreement to gradually lower its tariffs on imported horses
will hurt domestic breeders. The tariffs, of Y4m per horse, which have been
a big obstacle to foreign horses participating in Japanese races, are being
reduced by 15 per cent or about Y3.4m by the year 2000.
But Japan's horseracing industry is finding it difficult to beat the forces
for change. The JRA has launched an eight-year internationalisation
programme triggered not so much by foreign pressure as by strong interest
among Japanese horseracing fans to see more foreign horses running in
national races.
'There are some very high-grade horses running in Sunday's Yasuda Kinen and
I am expecting it to be a very exciting race,' says Mr Naoto Hashimoto, a
Tokyo businessman who is a keen horseracing fan. The race will feature a
thoroughbred owned by Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, two French horses, one from
the UK and one from Hong Kong.
Mr Hashimoto believes that competition from imported horses will help raise
the level of Japanese horseracing.
'Japanese horses have only competed among themselves, with other horses of
the same level,' he says. 'Competing with foreign horses at home will raise
the competitiveness of Japanese horses, which could help them to compete
more successfully overseas.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / Report to Miti urges delaying plutonium use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A government panel is to propose that Japan delays ambitious plans to
increase its use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel.
The suggestion, to be presented to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry next month for consideration as official policy, comes in response
to growing domestic and international concern over a surplus of plutonium, a
highly toxic fuel that can be used for nuclear weapons.
An interim report, by the advisory committee for energy, calls for
construction of a second plutonium powered fast-breeder reactor to be
delayed from the end of this decade to early next, according to details
leaked by officials. It suggests that plans for a second fuel reprocessing
plant - which extracts plutonium from spent fuel - should be suspended until
well beyond 2010.
Japan's first prototype fast-breeder, named Monju, based on the west coast,
began a self-sustaining reaction last month, using plutonium fuel produced
at reprocessing plants in Britain and France.
Its first reprocessing plant, at Rokkasho-mura in northern Japan is due to
start operations at the end of the decade. A second Japanese reprocessing
plant was due to open in 2010, but the panel says that a construction
schedule should not be decided until then, implying that it could not start
operating at least until 2020.
A decline in prices for uranium, the fuel used in conventional nuclear power
stations, has weakened the economic argument for plutonium fuelled fast
breeder reactors, said an official at the government's agency of national
resources and energy. However, this would only be a temporary delay in long
term plans to increase Japan's use of plutonium.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Asia urged to fight money laundering
</HEADLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Industrialised nations are urging Asian governments that supervise
fast-growing financial sectors to join the fight against money laundering,
according to members of a task force established by the Group of Seven
countries.
Mr John Gieve, president of the Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering (FATF) and under-secretary at the UK Treasury, announced
yesterday that Malaysia had agreed to host a conference on money-laundering
for the region's financial and legal officials in November, following a
seminar in Singapore last year.
'If money laundering is to be combatted effectively, action needs to be
taken at the widest possible international level, particularly in countries
which are becoming increasingly important as financial centres,' he said in
Bangkok.
'A major part of our work is therefore now concerned with the adoption of
anti-money laundering measures by non-member countries,' he said.
Money laundering and drugs are the subjects of heated debate in Thailand at
present.
This week the US announced that Mr Thanong Siripreechapong, a Thai
opposition member of parliament, had been charged with smuggling tonnes of
marijuana into the US. The Thai government says it is considering
introducing anti-laundering legislation to help curb the drugs trade.
Several Thai politicians are suspected of involvement in drug smuggling, and
the Golden Triangle where Thailand, Burma and Laos meet is notorious for
opium-growing and heroin production.
The 26-member FATF already includes representatives from regional financial
centres Japan, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong. FATF officials are hoping
to persuade other countries, including Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and
eventually China to introduce anti-laundering laws; typically such laws make
money-laundering a criminal offence, allow suspicious flows of money to be
traced through the banking system, and provide for the confiscation of
assets.
Mr Gieve and his colleagues said that even if commercial banks feared the
expense of implementing such legislation and had concerns about banking
privacy, experience in countries such as Switzerland showed that
anti-laundering rules were workable and enhanced the reputation of the
financial centres applying them.

wrongdoing, a UN spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Six British engineers had left Gorazde and were heading back to their base
in central Bosnia on Thursday when they were stopped by Bosnian Serb army
soldiers near Sokolac, 14 miles east of Sarajevo. The soldiers confiscated
their weapons and ammunition along with their personal belongings and
threatened them.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Europe's changing cities: Dreams of leaving Lisbon's slums -
The government and the city council have agreed a plan to rehouse all
shanty-dwellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sleeping dogs, dead rats and discarded syringes lie along the dirt paths
leading into a forlorn neighbourhood of shanty dwellings and slum houses,
sprawling across a Lisbon hillside in the shadow of a multi-storey shopping
centre.
Young men question outsiders before admitting them to the rows of crumbling
houses and dilapidated shacks made of planks, plastic sheeting and
corrugated iron. The only visitors they expect are the police or drug-takers
looking for supplies.
One long-standing resident, Mrs Maria Leonor, 32, lives here with her family
of seven in a one-room dwelling made by her husband, a street vendor, by
nailing rough pieces of timber to wooden struts. The city council gave them
the boards and nails after a fire destroyed their previous shanty home in
1985.
Mrs Leonor is out of work and has never learnt to read or write. She points
up stone steps strewn with rubbish to the tap where she fetches water. Three
men facing a nearby wall look round furtively as they inject themselves in
the forearms.
This is Casal Ventoso, acknowledged by Portuguese officials as one of the
worst slums in western Europe. Mrs Leonor's home is just one of 38,000
shanty dwellings in Portugal, housing an estimated 43,000 families. Most of
them share one ambition: 'I just want to move out into a home that is safe
for my children.'
Little has been done to alleviate the plight of shanty dwellers since
bairros de lata - 'tin-can quarters' - first appeared in Portugal almost a
century ago. But the centre-right government is now embarking on an
ambitious Es270bn (Pounds 1bn) programme to eradicate shanty towns and
rehouse their occupants before the end of the century.
'The shanties prick at the conscience of the whole nation,' says Mr Joaquim
Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and
telecommunications. 'No other country at the same level of development as
Portugal suffers from this shameful problem.'
Under the plan, the government will pay for the construction of new homes
and local authorities, most of which are controlled by the opposition
Socialist party, will administer them and subsidise rents according to the
occupiers' means. Most shanty dwellers pay no rent and low, if any, utility
bills.
Migration from the rural interior to Lisbon and Oporto produced many of the
existing bairros de lata in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the workers who
built Lisbon's April 25 suspension bridge, which opened in 1966, still live
in nearby shanty towns.
Others, like Pedreiro dos Hungaros to the west of Lisbon, are populated by
immigrants from Portugal's former African colonies, mainly the Cape Verde
islands. The atmosphere is more convivial here than in Casal Ventoso, but
conditions are just as bad.
Several factors foment the building of shanty towns. Portugal has no pool of
low-rent, state-owned housing. The private rent market was undermined by a
40-year rent freeze that discouraged owners from renting out properties and
is only now slowly being re-animated. And taxes amounting to more than half
the cost of a house help put buying a home beyond the reach of many low-wage
earners.
More than 5,000 shanty dwellings have been destroyed in Lisbon since a
coalition of Socialists and Communists won control of the city council in
1989. This month, the government and the council agreed on a Es72bn
programme to build 11,129 houses to rehouse all the families in the city
still in shanty towns.
Most will be moved into apartment buildings. And surveys among residents
dismiss as sentimental myth the opinion that they will miss the open-air
life, vegetable plots, chicken runs and community spirit of the bairros de
lata. 'We're not aware of a single person who would rather stay in a shanty
town than move into a flat,' says Mr Vasco Franco, the Lisbon city
councillor responsible for the rehousing programme.
But Mr Franco fears that the pressures that led to the growth of the shanty
towns will continue and possibly increase. Many construction workers will be
attracted to the capital by an extensive infrastructure programme, including
the building of a new bridge over the Tagus river, the Expo '98
international exhibition and the housing programme itself.
The city council demolishes every new shanty dwelling that appears,
currently at a rate of four of five a day. But other forms of cheap
accommodation are taking their place. 'There are small apartments in Lisbon
where up to 20 people sleep in rows of bunk beds, paying by the night,' says
Mr Franco. 'The only lasting solution to the problem is for the state to
invest in building a large pool of accessibly-priced homes.'

FT  14 MAY 94 / US World Cup planners await the barbarian hordes: As the
fences go up, Jurek Martin prepares for his past to be scrutinised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Cup is still a month off and the English are not coming, but
already the US, a nation not unfamiliar with violence, is battening down the
hatches against soccer mayhem.
A series of solemn announcements from the organising committee has given the
impression that the US fears the worst. Much ridiculed and probably widely
to be disobeyed, they include:
The erection of riot fences separating the crowd from the field of play at
several venues, including the RFK Stadium in Washington, home of the
American football Redskins.
Tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol before and during matches, with a
two-beer limit per customer, no vendors walking through the seats and no
sales after half-time.
Reporters must sign a waiver permitting background investigations by the FBI
and other law enforcement agencies, without which they will not get
necessary credentials. The intent, apparently, is to root out terrorists
with press passes, though the effect may be to reduce media coverage to even
lower visibility.
The domestic response has ranged between fury and amusement. Several
prominent US news organisations have mounted the high civil liberties horse
and said they will have no truck with the waiver (your FT correspondent, a
known professional agitator, signed the waiver confident that his tracks
were well covered).
The managers of RFK stadium said they would stick with their standard
alcohol sale policy, which is liberal. A Redskins game traditionally
features extended parking-lot 'tailgate' parties before kick-off, followed
by a mad scramble to beat the traffic jams afterwards.
Sporting violence is not unknown in the US, even in baseball, the cerebral
sport, but it is mostly confined to players and to fan celebrations which
get out of control after a team has won a championship. Comfortable all-seat
stadiums, with sometimes decent food and drink, tend not to stir crowd's
blood beyond a bit of yelling and Mexican waving.
Soccer's bad reputation, however, is not confined to stories from abroad. In
California, a schools league this year banned the traditional post-game
handshake between players because the ceremony often degenerated into the
trading of spitting, insults and fistfights.
Only the other day, the Washington Post reported that the coach and most of
a local suburban high school team had been suspended after getting into a
brawl with a visiting Russian side towards the end of a particularly
foul-filled match.
But the last word in ridicule on the riot fences was surely provided by the
Post's Tony Kornheiser: 'Why not a moat, stocked with piranhas?' he asked.
'Or heads up on spikes?'
Of course, he understood that the terrible foreigners due to play in DC were
different. With the Dutch 'it's the wooden shoes that cut off the
circulation to their brains. . . Van Gogh sliced off his ear at a soccer
game'. The Norwegians 'go berserk all the time in the summer' from 'hormonal
rush', having spent the rest of the year frozen.
The 'phlegmish' Belgians 'will probably sell us poisoned waffles'. When the
Saudis riot 'they claim it's a religious experience'. The Italians 'cruise
our streets indiscriminately, pinching women and weepily singing opera'. Now
the Mexicans have 'got money from Nafta, they'll get here and go crazy'.
The fence, Mr Kornheiser concluded, 'is a bad symbol and a bad idea. Dump
it.'

new drive

The foreign ministers of the US, Russia and five members of the European
Union yesterday called for a four-month ceasefire between the warring
parties in Bosnia and the resumption within two weeks of negotiations on a
political settlement.
Meeting in Geneva, the seven ministers put on an impressive show of unity
over Bosnia, though it is clear that important differences of emphasis
remain. In particular, the Europeans secured a reluctant endorsement from
the US that any peace settlement should be based on their formula allocating
51 per cent of Bosnian territory to the newly formed Bosnian-Croat
federation and 49 per cent to the Bosnian Serbs.
Earlier this week the Bosnian and Croat sides agreed in Vienna on a
US-brokered plan which would give their proposed federation 58 per cent of
Bosnia. However, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in
Geneva yesterday that the 51/49 per cent split was 'a desirable basis on
which to proceed'.
US officials said privately that the 58 per cent figure was based on the
'maximum possible formula', arrived at by adding all areas where Moslems and
Croats could form a majority of the population. The federation's borders
would have to be determined in negotiation with the Bosnian Serbs, they
noted.
Mr Christopher said he thought the warring parties would attend the
reconvened peace talks, to be held under the aegis of the five-nation
'contact group' (US, Russia, France, Britain and Germany). The Bosnian Serbs
have said the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Serbia must be a
precondition of resuming talks, a demand the ministers yesterday rejected as
'unacceptable'.
The ministers, from the 'contact group' countries plus Greece and Belgium,
said sanctions would be progressively eased only in response to the 'good
faith implementation' of a peace settlement.
The communique also calls for the ceasefire accord to include the separation
of forces, the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the 'interposition' of
Unprofor troops, a move which would require further reinforcement of UN
peacekeepers.
In Bosnia itself, fighting between Serb and Moslem forces was reported to be
escalating sharply in the north of the republic. Serb sources reported heavy
losses in clashes round the mouth of the Ozren pocket, a Serb mountain
stronghold.
It remains unclear whether yesterday's show of unity in Geneva can overcome
the escalating war of words over Bosnia between politicians in Moscow and
Washington.
The Russian parliament yesterday urged President Boris Yeltsin to lift the
arms embargo against Serbia unilaterally if any other country began sending
arms to Bosnia. This was an angry response to a US Senate resolution
supporting sales to the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo.
The state Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 270-1 for the
resolution, which also told the Russian government to seek a negotiated end
to all sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and
Montenegro.
A senior Bosnian military source acknowledged yesterday that the Moslem-led
government army received raw material for ammunition from Iran and anti-tank
rockets of unspecified origin, AP reports from Sarajevo.
The army source claimed hundreds of anti-tank rockets, allegedly of American
manufacture, reached the Croatian coast aboard a ship from Brazil.

The Turkish government was yesterday criticised by Kurdish MPs, after the
United Nations confirmed reports that several thousand Kurdish villagers had
crossed the border into Iraq, in the wake of a heavy government onslaught
against the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK).
Mr Selim Sadak, MP for Sirnak in Turkey's Kurdish heartland, writing to the
interior minister, Mr Nahit Mentese, demanded a government investigation of
allegations of bombing by Turkish military aircraft of Kurdish villages in
which he claimed at least 48 people were killed. The government said earlier
that a bomb had been dropped by accident.
The incident underscores the violent escalation in the fighting, with more
than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians killed in the past year.
The Turkish government has dismissed the situation as a PKK propaganda ploy.
Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman vehemently denied eyewitness
reports that villages were being deliberately targeted by security forces.
The PKK has increased attacks against targets in western Turkey in recent
months, including the killing of five off-duty Turkish army conscripts in
Istanbul.
The intensified conflict is causing concern in western capitals. The German
foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, last week said the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe should convene a conference on the problem.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Clinton names Breyer for Supreme Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night nominated Mr Stephen Breyer, the federal
appeals judge from Boston, to fill the seat on the US Supreme Court left
vacant by the retirement of Justice Harry Blackmun.
Judge Breyer needs confirmation by the US Senate but all evidence this week
was that opposition would be minimal and certainly less than promised for
the other two finalists on the president's short list - Mr Bruce Babbitt,
the interior secretary, and Judge Richard Arnold from Arkansas, a
distinguished jurist and old friend of the president who has some persistent
heath problems.
Mr Clinton made the announcement yesterday evening after a week of much
media-generated speculation. Judge Breyer was not present but will appear
with Mr Clinton at a more formal ceremony next week.
The judge, who is 55 and a graduate of Harvard University law school, was
himself a finalist last summer for the last vacancy on the nine-member court
eventually filled by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Mr Clinton is the first Democratic president to nominate a justice since
1967. Judge Breyer's judicial philosophy, like that of Justice Ginsburg, is
moderate-to-liberal. Mr Clinton said yesterday he was 'one of the
outstanding jurists of our age', with 'a remarkable ability to explain
complex subjects in simple terms'.
The likely practical effect of the two appointments is to kill any
conservatives' hope that the judicial revolution promised by President
Ronald Reagan would be carried through. The constitutional guarantee of a
woman's right to abortion provided by the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling now seems
safe.
But the immediate changes in the balance of the court may be small, since
the outgoing Justice Blackmun, appointed by President Richard Nixon in 1971,
had evolved over the years into the court's most liberal member. Based on
his judicial record, Judge Breyer will strengthen the bench's centre, now
occupied by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter and Ginsburg.
He has strong British connections. Not only did he attend Oxford University,
but he is the brother-in-law of Viscount Blakenham, chairman of Pearson,
parent company of the Financial Times.

<TEXT>
A team from the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to begin a two-week
visit to Venezuela on Monday, just asthe country's international monetary
reserves have fallen sharply and the government has restricted the sale of
foreign exchange to the public.
Mr Julio Sosa, Venezuela's minister of finance, said the government's liquid
reserves stood at more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) and it would be
'precipitate' to discuss a standby arrangement with the IMF now.
But Mr Miguel Rodriguez, minister of planning and president of Venezuela's
central bank from 1989 to 1993, this week recommended that the government
begin negotiating a standby arrangement with the fund immediately.
Mr Rodriguez, the main architect of the Perez government's free-market

exchange controls have been abolished in other parts of Latin America, he

The auctions, which were meant to reduce sales of foreign exchange,
immediately led to the development of a dual-rate system.

The Greek drachma came under strong pressure yesterday, losing ground
against the D-Mark following rumours that the government plans to lift
controls on short-term capital movement ahead of its July 1 deadline.
The market has been jittery for several days as reports emerged of
discussions between central bank and Economy Ministry officials in
preparation for lifting foreign exchange restrictions.
The drachma closed at DM148.10, down from Dr147.5 the previous day. Dealers
said it had cost the Bank of Greece some DM500m (Pounds 200m) to prop up the
drachma yesterday after the German currency reached record levels elsewhere
in Europe on Thursday, when Greek markets were closed for a public holiday.
Greece was granted an 18-month extension on lifting all foreign exchange
curbs in line with European Union rules. The main restriction still to be
removed is a ban on drachma lending for periods of less than three months.
The government is concerned about both speculative attacks against the
drachma in the run-up to July 1 and the possibility of a sudden capital
outflow as soon as restrictions are lifted.
It faces difficulties in financing a rising public deficit.

FT  14 MAY 94 / IMF team to begin visit to Venezuela

<TEXT>
A team from the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to begin a two-week
visit to Venezuela on Monday, just asthe country's international monetary
reserves have fallen sharply and the government has restricted the sale of
foreign exchange to the public.
Mr Julio Sosa, Venezuela's minister of finance, said the government's liquid
reserves stood at more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) and it would be
'precipitate' to discuss a standby arrangement with the IMF now. Mr Fernando
Egana, an aide to President Rafael Caldera, who took office in February,
said the IMF team's visit was a regularly scheduled one.
But Mr Miguel Rodriguez, minister of planning and president of Venezuela's
central bank under the government of President Carlos Andres Perez from 1989
to 1993, this week recommended that the government begin negotiating a
standby arrangement with the fund immediately.
Mr Rodriguez, the main architect of the Perez government's free-market
programme, criticised the central bank's recent decision to establish daily
auctions at which banks and exchange houses can buy limited volumes of US
dollars. Venezuela has returned to this 'abominable' practice, while
exchange controls have been abolished in other parts of Latin America, he
said.
The auctions, which replaced open sales of dollars to the public and were
meant to reduce sales of foreign exchange, immediately led to the
development of a dual-rate system. The differential between the central bank
rate and the parallel market rate reached as high as 20 per cent in recent
days.
Venezuela eliminated a multiple-rate exchange control system in 1989, the
same year it initiated an extended agreement with the IMF which expired in
1992. Breaking with recent practice, the central bank has not released
complete figures on its international reserve position for the previous
month. Gross reserves stood at Dollars 12.5bn at the end of 1993, but fell
by 14 per cent during the first quarter of this year.
Dollar sales by the central bank over the last several weeks are believed to
have been unusually high, but no official information has been made public
yet.

It faces difficulties in financing a rising public deficit. It currently has
to raise more than Dr150bn each month through issues of short-term Treasury
bills. Greece's public debt is the highest in the EU, at almost 140 per cent
of gross domestic product.
However, a senior Bank of Greece official said yesterday that the July
deadline was 'still in place, with neither delays nor an early lifting of
restrictions in sight'.
The interbank three-month rate briefly touched 26 per cent yesterday,
against 21.6 per cent on Wednesday.
The timing yesterday of the central bank's announcement that it was imposing
a 9 per cent reserve requirement on bank deposits held by public sector
enterprises, in accordance with EU rules, contributed to the overall
anxiety.
The Athens stock market was also affected; the index fell 1.74 per cent
yesterday.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Dreams of leaving Lisbon's slums: Government and council
plan to rehouse all shanty-dwellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sleeping dogs, dead rats and discarded syringes lie along the dirt paths
leading into a forlorn neighbourhood of shanty dwellings and slum houses,
sprawling across a Lisbon hillside in the shadow of a multi-storey shopping
centre, Peter Wise reports from Lisbon.
Young men question outsiders before admitting them to the rows of crumbling
houses and dilapidated shacks made of planks, plastic sheeting and
corrugated iron. The only visitors they expect are the police or drug-takers
looking for supplies.
One long-standing resident, Mrs Maria Leonor, 32, lives here with her family
of seven in a one-room dwelling made by her husband, a street vendor, by
nailing rough pieces of timber to wooden struts. The city council gave them
the boards and nails after a fire destroyed their previous shanty home in
1985.
Mrs Leonor is out of work and has never learnt to read or write. She points
up stone steps strewn with rubbish to the tap where she fetches water. Three
men facing a nearby wall look round furtively as they inject themselves in
the forearms.
This is Casal Ventoso, acknowledged by Portuguese officials as one of the
worst slums in western Europe. Mrs Leonor's home is just one of 38,000
shanty dwellings in Portugal, housing an estimated 43,000 families. Most of
them share one ambition: 'I just want to move out into a home that is safe
for my children,' she says.
Little has been done to alleviate the plight of shanty dwellers since
bairros de lata - 'tin-can quarters' - first appeared in Portugal almost a
century ago. But the centre-right government is now embarking on an
ambitious Es270bn (Pounds 1bn) programme to eradicate shanty towns and
rehouse their occupants before the end of the century.
'The shanties prick at the conscience of the whole nation,' says Mr Joaquim
Ferreira do Amaral, minister for public works, transport and
telecommunications. 'No other country at the same level of development as
Portugal suffers from this shameful problem.'
Under the plan, the government will pay for the construction of new homes
and local authorities, most of which are controlled by the opposition
Socialist party, will administer them and subsidise rents according to the
occupiers' means. Most shanty dwellers pay no rent and low, if any, utility
bills.
Migration from the rural interior to Lisbon and Oporto produced many of the
existing bairros de lata in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the workers who
built Lisbon's April 25 suspension bridge, which opened in 1966, still live
in nearby shanty towns.
Others, like Pedreiro dos Hungaros to the west of Lisbon, are populated by
immigrants from Portugal's former African colonies, mainly the Cape Verde
islands. The atmosphere is more convivial here than in Casal Ventoso, but
conditions are just as bad.
Several factors foment the building of shanty towns. Portugal has no pool of
low-rent, state-owned housing. The private rent market was undermined by a
40-year rent freeze that discouraged owners from renting out properties and
is only now slowly being re-animated. And taxes amounting to more than half
the cost of a house help put buying a home beyond the reach of many low-wage
earners.
More than 5,000 shanty dwellings have been destroyed in Lisbon since a
coalition of Socialists and Communists won control of the city council in
1989. This month, the government and the council agreed on a Es72bn
programme to build 11,129 houses to rehouse all the families in the city
still living in shanty towns.
Most will be moved into apartment buildings. And surveys among residents
dismiss as sentimental myth the opinion that they will miss the open-air
life, vegetable plots, chicken runs and community spirit of the bairros de
lata. 'We're not aware of a single person who would rather stay in a shanty
town than move into a flat,' says Mr Vasco Franco, the Lisbon city
councillor responsible for the rehousing programme.
But Mr Franco fears that the pressures that led to the growth of the shanty
towns will continue and possibly increase. Many construction workers will be
attracted to the capital by an extensive infrastructure programme, including
the building of a new bridge over the Tagus river, the Expo '98
international exhibition and the housing programme itself.
The city council demolishes every new shanty dwelling that appears,
currently at a rate of four of five a day. But other forms of cheap
accommodation are taking their place. 'There are small apartments in Lisbon
where up to 20 people sleep in rows of bunk beds, paying by the night,' says
Mr Franco. 'The only lasting solution to the problem is for the state to
invest in building a large pool of accessibly-priced homes.'

<TEXT>
The Turkish government was yesterday criticised by Kurdish MPs, after the
United Nations confirmed reports that several thousand Kurdish villagers had
crossed the border into Iraq, in the wake of a heavy government onslaught
against the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK).
Mr Selim Sadak, MP for Sirnak in Turkey's Kurdish heartland, writing to the
interior minister, Mr Nahit Mentese, demanded a government investigation of
allegations of bombing by Turkish military aircraft of Kurdish villages in
which he claimed at least 48 people were killed. The government said earlier
that a bomb had been dropped by accident.
The incident underscores the violent escalation in the fighting, with more
than 4,000 guerrillas, soldiers and civilians killed in the past year.
The UN, contacted in Baghdad yesterday, confirmed that around 800 families
were being given temporary shelter and food near the border town of Zakho,
complaining of harassment by Turkish troops.
The Turkish government has dismissed the situation as a PKK propaganda ploy.
Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman vehemently denied eyewitness
reports that villages were being deliberately targeted by security forces.
The PKK has increased attacks against targets in western Turkey in recent
months, including the killing of five off-duty Turkish army conscripts in
Istanbul. This, more than any other recent incident, has inflamed public
opinion against the Kurds.
The intensified conflict is causing concern in western capitals. The German
foreign minister, Mr Klaus Kinkel, in a German magazine last week, said the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should convene a
conference on the Kurdish problem. Scandinavian countries have more than
once called for CSCE monitors to go to the south-east. For the first time,
the US is calling on Turkey, its Nato ally, to find a political solution to
the problem of the 10m-strong Kurdish minority.
However, in the wake of recent escalations in the violence, Mrs Tansu
Ciller's government has hardened its view, abandoning the political
initiative to win over moderate Kurds by democratic reforms.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Mexican rivals debate on television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first televised presidential campaign debate in Mexican history was
watched by an estimated 30m viewers - and delivered a victory for the least
known of the three main candidates.
Yet, the mere fact that the leading contender, from the party which has
governed the country for 65 years, shared the podium in Thursday night's
debate with the opposition was considered a turning point for the country's
political system.
The candidates in the August election generally agreed on the issues
confronting Mexico. They discussed corruption, poverty, the discredited
legal system, the need for more democracy, and faster economic growth.
They exchanged insults, offered different solutions, but overall eschewed
radical policies and sought to identify themselves with the political
centre.
Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the centre-right National
Action party, emerged as the clear winner; Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the
governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) in second place; and Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of Democratic Revolution as the loser,
according to the telephone polls conducted for Multivision, a pay TV
station, Telemundo, a US Spanish language station, Reforma, an independent
newspaper, and for Economista, a financial daily.
Such polls have to be treated sceptically, in part because only the
relatively well-off, who are probably less inclined to back Mr Cardenas,
have telephones. But the low support for him coincided with the view of most
independent analysts that the PRD candidate failed to impress in his
hour-and-a-half before the cameras.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos's success may be the best outcome for the PRI. It
suggests that he can prevent the opposition vote coalescing around Mr
Cardenas and may even overtake him as the main opposition candidate. Mr
Cardenas came close to winning the 1988 presidential election, and his
attacks on the PRI and lack of democracy have damaged the party's legitimacy
at home and abroad. The PAN has generally co-operated with the PRI.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is a trial lawyer by profession, and proved the
most engaging and natural speaker, the most willing to depart from his
prepared text, and most effective at attacking the other candidates,
especially Mr Cardenas.
Mr Zedillo, was less adept in debate and at times appeared stiff and
self-conscious. But he offered a clear and coherent view of the policies he
would implement.
While Mr Cardenas sought to come across as moderate and reasonable, he was
perceived by many as being too critical, and as the least articulate of the
candidates.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Upward pressure on US inflation remains subdued, official figures indicated
yesterday.
The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent last month, less than expected.
The annual rate of inflation fell to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent in
March. 'Core' consumer prices - which exclude the volatile food and energy
components - were also subdued, rising 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.8
per cent in the year to April.
The figures followed an encouraging report on wholesale price inflation
earlier this week. Producer prices fell 0.1 per cent last month, taking the
year-on-year decline to 0.4 per cent.
Most economists, however, still expect the Federal Reserve to signal another
increase in short-term interest rates next week following a meeting of its
policy-making open market committee. A rate increase is seen as necessary to
slow the rate of domestic growth and help stabilise the dollar in foreign
exchange markets.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Italian privatisations to be priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new Italian government yesterday suggested priority would be given to
privatisation and reducing the state's dominant role, in a government
programme due to be delivered to parliament on Monday.
These objectives were outlined yesterday by Mr Gianni Letta, the chief of
staff of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who was sworn in as prime minister last
Wednesday, after a cabinet meeting that studied the broad programme.
The programme has been put together only during the past week and it remains
to be seen how many of the items from the election programmes of the three
main partners in the Freedom Alliance have been adopted.
However, the emphasis on privatisation and tax reform underlines the main
platform of both the populist Northern League and Mr Berlusconi's Forza
Italia movement. Another priority will be tax reform.
To stress the importance of tax reform, Mr Letta said the finance ministry
had been given three junior ministers instead of the usual two.
The cabinet meeting also approved 37 junior ministers. The list shows a
delicate balance between the need to placate the various parties in Mr
Berlusconi's alliance and the need to find technically competent people to
back up an inexperienced ministerial team.
The neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance has been awarded 12 junior ministries
on top of five ministerial portfolios. This represents the culmination of
the MSI's remarkable political advance after four decades of being regarded
as a pariah.
Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia is represented by 13 junior ministers,
including a pro-European Forza Italia senator and former journalist, Mr
Livio Caputo, who will be in direct charge of European policy.
The League, although having the most parliamentary seats, was awarded only
10 junior ministries. But this reflects Mr Berlusconi's view that the League
already has its prize, the interior ministry.

FT  14 MAY 94 / West to relaunch Bosnia peace plan: US, EU and Russia agree
new drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign ministers from the US, the European Union and Russia yesterday
overcame deep internal divisions over Bosnia and settled on a plan to
relaunch peace negotiations during a proposed four-month ceasefire.
The ministers also reaffirmed an existing plan giving Bosnia's Serbs 49 per
cent of the country with Moslems and Croats taking the rest. The parties to
the conflict currently reject this arrangement, although they initially
signalled acceptance.
The apparent agreement took place in the shadow of a clash over Bosnia
between the US and Russian legislatures over which side in the conflict
should be allowed to receive weapons shipments.
The Russian parliament yesterday urged President Boris Yeltsin to lift the
arms embargo against Serbia unilaterally if any other country began sending
arms to Bosnia. This was an angry response to a US Senate resolution
supporting sales to the Moslem leadership in Sarajevo.
The state Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 270-1 for the
resolution, which also told the Russian government to seek a negotiated end
to all sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and
Montenegro.
Sharp differences over how to make peace in Bosnia have left mediation
efforts in some disarray. The US has backed the Moslems in their reluctance
to sign an overall truce which would consolidate recent territorial gains by
the Serbs.
The Russians, and to some extent the west Europeans, want pressure on the
Moslem as well as the Serb side to accept a territorial compromise.
The Russian parliament's move, which does not bind the president but carries
moral weight, was in response to a vote on Thursday in the US Senate, which
called for a unilateral end to sanctions against the Moslem-led Bosnian
government.
The twin votes brought Washington and Moscow closer to open confrontation
over Bosnia, with emotion running high in both capitals. Supporters of the
Bosnian government in Washington say it has been unfairly deprived of the
chance to defend itself against a vastly better armed enemy.
Even within the EU, there has been a struggle to co-ordinate policy over
Bosnia. The establishment of a contact group in which the EU was represented
only by Britain, France and Germany caused intense irritation in Italy and
Greece, which now holds the EU's rotating presidency.
As a compromise, yesterday's meeting in Geneva was also attended by Greece
and Belgium, the current and previous holders of EU chair.

FT  14 MAY 94 / India invites private sector to invest Pounds 4.9bn in
telecoms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
India announced the end of the state's monopoly of telephone services
yesterday and invited private companies, including foreign groups, to invest
up to Rs230bn (Pounds 4.89bn) over the next three years.
The decision, the latest step in the country's economic liberalisation
programme, has been made on the eve of a visit to the US by Mr PV Narasimha
Rao, the prime minister, to promote trade and investment.
A highlight of the six-day visit will be a meeting with leaders of the US
telecommunications industry. Potential investors are likely to be attracted
by the prospect of entering one of the world's least developed
telecommunications markets, with only eight telephone lines per 1,000
people, compared with a global average of 100 lines.
However, the announcement yesterday left unclear the detailed terms under
which private investment will be permitted, and left considerable authority
in the hands of the government's telecommunications department, which will
be both a competitor in providing services and a regulator.
The policy statement sets out a target of increasing the number of lines to
be installed in the government's 1992-97 five-year plan from 7.5m to 10m.
India had just 5.3m lines in early 1992.
The government calculates it will need about Rs230bn on top of the Rs245bn
originally allocated for the five-year plan, and private companies are
invited to help close the investment gap. But there will be restrictions.
Companies entering the market will be required to operate in rural and urban
areas. They will have to agree tariffs and revenue-sharing arrangements with
the telecommunications department, which is entrusted with protecting
consumers' rights and ensuring fair competition. Mr Sukh Ram, the
telecommunications minister, who announced the decision, said the maximum
permissible level of foreign equity participation would be decided 'case by
case'.
The new policy has been settled after six months of political wrangling
between Mr Ram and Mr N. Vittal, chairman of the government's
Telecommunications Commission and the chief civil servant overseeing
telecommunications. Mr Vittal originally proposed radically overhauling the
industry, including turning the telecommunications department into a
corporation, prior to possible privatisation.
The result is seen as a compromise. But much will depend on officials'
attitudes. They have shown themselves slow to welcome private companies into
services such as mobile telephones. Entry has been limited by bureaucratic
delays, restrictive rules and legal disputes.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Labour set to speed up contest for leadership: Support grows
for Blair but Brown looks ready to stand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Support for Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, hardened
yesterday as the party appeared set to speed up the contest for a successor
to succeed Mr John Smith as leader.
As both major parties struggled to come to terms with Mr Smith's sudden
death on Thursday, it became clear that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, was also determined to stand.
But amid confusion about the timing and rules for an election, Labour MPs
said there would be strong pressure on the two men to avoid a divisive
struggle by agreeing on a single leadership candidate representing the
party's 'modernising' tendency.
Senior Conservatives said the changed political landscape may prompt Mr John
Major, the prime minister, to postpone his planned cabinet reshuffle to give
the government time to develop a strategy for combating Labour's new leader.
Cabinet ministers said there was virtually no risk of an autumn challenge to
Mr Major, but rightwing backbenchers said his future continued to depend on
strong leadership.
Some Labour MPs said the outcome of the party's leadership contest could
depend on Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary,
and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the leftwing acting leader.
Mr Prescott is minded to enter the race, but is considering a deal with Mr
Blair under which he would become deputy leader with responsibility for
running Labour's election campaigns.
Such a 'dream ticket' would team the telegenic Mr Blair, one of Labour's key
'modernisers,' with a deputy with strong links to the trade unions and the
party's traditionalists.
But it would be difficult to arrange unless Mrs Beckett agrees to stand down
as deputy leader before the party conference in late September.
The party's national executive committee will meet on May 25 to discuss the
timing and rules for the election, but is likely to put off a decision until
mid-June.
This would accord with the shadow cabinet's wish that leadership campaigning
should not start until after the European elections on June 9. The result
would probably be announced at a special conference in July.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's chairman, said the party would move 'sensibly
but quickly into resolving the leadership, and the opinion appears to be we
should try and do that by mid-July'.
Mr Blunkett urged candidates not to engage in open campaigning until the
race is officially declared open.
Voting could take up to five weeks because of the requirements of the one
member, one vote, electoral system - introduced last year at Mr Smith's
insistence. It gives a third of the votes to each of three groups: MPs and
MEPs, individual party members, and union supporters who pay the political
levy.
The introduction of individual voting will reduce the influence of leftwing
trade union leaders, and is likely to benefit moderate candidates such as Mr
Blair and Mr Brown. Most MPs regard Mr Blair as the clear favourite.
However, some warned that his greatest handicap might be the strong support
for his candidacy emerging in the media.
Some MPs said that either Mr Prescott or Mr Brown might be more acceptable
than Mr Blair to constituency activists. Mr Brown, who represents
Dunfermline East, may also win strong backing from the large group of
Scottish Labour MPs.
However, Mr Brown was thought likely to face opposition from Mr Prescott and
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, another potential
candidate with strong links to the traditionalist wing.
The bookmaker William Hill cut the odds on Mr Blair to 1-3 favourite. Odds
against Mr Brown are 5-2, Mr Prescott 10-1, Mrs Beckett and Mr Cook 16-1, Mr
Jack Cunningham 33-1, Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Peter Mandelson and Mr Jack Straw
50-1.
Labour announced last night Mr Smith's funeral will be at Cluny parish
church, Edinburgh, next Friday.

FT  14 MAY 94 / Palestinians celebrate a new era: Israelis withdraw from
Jericho after 27 years of occupation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERICHO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jubilant Palestinians hugged and kissed their new police force as it
triumphantly entered Jericho yesterday after Israeli soldiers lowered the
Star of David flag and formally quit the town after 27 years of occupation.
The Palestinian police, in green uniforms and berets, arrived showing the
victory sign and brandishing new AK-47 automatic rifles above their heads.
Under the Palestinian self-rule accord, Jericho will become the seat of the
new administration, which covers the area around the town and the Gaza
Strip.
In the main square, drivers honked their horns, cafe owners played loud
music and boys waved the Palestinian flag and pictures of Mr Yassir Arafat,
Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman.
Jericho's residents mixed euphoria with near disbelief that the Israelis had
really gone. Townspeople woke to find a vanguard of Palestinian policemen
standing on the roof of the central police station, evacuated by the
Israelis during the night.
'I nearly lost control of my car when I saw our Palestinian police there,'
said Mr Isaac Shawa, a storekeeper. 'I thought I was still dreaming but then
I realised it was true.
'I feel extremely happy. There is a real change on the ground and we can
start to sleep peacefully and start a new life with our freedom. For us,
Friday the 13th will always be a lucky day.'
Just outside the town, trucks loaded with uniforms, boots, filing cabinets
and furniture moved into Israel's former military camp. Brigadier Ismail
Jabr, commander of the Jericho police force, promised Palestinians that he
would govern them with democracy and law, and that from Jericho the PLO
would one day enter Jerusalem.
The 750-strong police force came from the Al-Aqsa brigade of the Palestine
Liberation Army, based in Iraq, and the Badr brigade from Jordan. One
officer said he had been in Basra, southern Iraq, during the Gulf War 'on
operations'. Mr Mohamed Mahmoud, another policeman, said he had fought in
Beirut in 1982, when the PLO was forced to withdraw from Lebanon, and in
Tripoli in 1983 when some PLO fighters staged a mutiny against Mr Arafat.
'We want to rekindle the hope of our people after so many years of
occupation,' he said, as he hugged relatives he had not seen for more than a
decade.
Policemen immediately started directing traffic and operating joint patrols
with Israeli police in separate vehicles, as agreed under the self-rule
accord.
In Gaza, Israeli troops finished pulling out of Palestinian areas in the
south of the Strip.
Up to 20,000 supporters of the extremist Islamic Hamas Movement marched
through Gaza City to welcome the Palestinian police but condemn the peace
accord. Demonstrators hurled stones at remaining Israeli positions and
troops opened fire wounding two. Israel says it will complete its pull out
from Gaza by next Wednesday.

FT  13 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Oil dealer's row with Chevron threatens Caspian
project:  Differences over the ownership and route of a pipeline from
Kazakhstan's vast Tengiz oilfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corrected (published 17th May 1994) appended to this article.
A conflict between the US oil company Chevron and Mr Johannes Deuss, the
Bermuda-based Dutch entrepreneur once known as king of the world's oil
traders, has become the biggest obstacle to construction of an oil pipeline
from the energy-rich Caspian Sea to the west, according to western oil
analysts.
Chevron plans to spend Dollars 20bn over 40 years developing Kazakhstan's
vast Tengiz oilfield, which could be producing 700,000 barrels a day at its
peak in 2010.
But problems over the export route for the pipeline and the composition of
the pipeline consortium threaten to undermine the largest western-led energy
project in the former Soviet Union.
The proposed pipeline consortium includes Russian and Kazakh state oil
companies, as well as Chevron and the Oman Oil company, 100 per cent owned
by the Oman government with a board made up of Mr Deuss and Oman officials,
mostly from the oil ministry.
It is Mr Deuss's insistence that Oman Oil have a 33 per cent share of the
pipeline consortium that has led to the latest impasse.
At issue is a proposal that Chevron would put up much of the capital for the
pipeline, which will cost about Dollars 1bn. It would also guarantee to ship
all Tengiz oil through the pipeline at an agreed rate. This would enable the
other three partners to arrange western financing for their share of the
capital costs.
Chevron, however, is reluctant to bear the burden of the capital financing
and to see such a large portion of the transportation revenues going to Oman
Oil. Analysts in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, say Chevron wants
'significantly more' than a 25 per cent stake, and wants it to come out of
the Oman Oil share.
The Kazakh authorities are reported to have set a deadline of June 1 for
settlement of the dispute.
Mr Deuss 'wants a huge equity stake in return for putting in no capital,'
said a western diplomat in Alma Ata. 'We don't know if Deuss has gotten
greedy, or if something else is going on.'
Last month the World Bank declined to take part in financing the pipeline, a
development which, according to an April 8 bank report, has put the
consortium 'in crisis'.
The conflict is not the only obstacle to getting the region's oil flowing.
Russia has demanded equity stakes in big oil and gas projects in former
Soviet republics, slowing down the completion of contracts.
Russia's Lukoil has won a 10 per cent share in Azerbaijan's big Azeri,
Chirag and Guneshli fields. Moscow also wants an equity share of the Tengiz
field, as well as of Kazakhstan's huge Karachaganak natural gas field, to
which British Gas and Agip, its Italian partner, have sole negotiating
rights.
The World Bank report concludes that Kazakhstan 'has little choice' but to
surrender the equity shares. 'Without Russian co-operation on pipelines,
Kazakhstan cannot attract the high levels of foreign investment needed to
develop its oil-gas sector,' the report says.
But the emergence of international dealmakers such as Mr Deuss in the
Caspian area, which could become one of the leading oil and gas producing
regions of the world, has complicated negotiations between governments and
international oil companies.
Mr Deuss, aged 52, once operated a Citroen dealership in the Dutch city of
Nijmegen. But in the early 1980s he began buying oil in the Soviet Union and
soon became one of the world's premier oil traders.
Mr Deuss has cultivated close relationships with the leaders of Oman,
Kazakhstan and Russia.
He won the friendship of Oman's leaders when it was still paying a marketing
premium to Saudi Arabia for handling its oil. In return, he was appointed
president of Oman Oil Company. 'Deuss showed them he could provide a better
return for a lower price,' said a western oil trader in Alma Ata.
In Kazakhstan Mr Deuss provided a timely loan exceeding Dollars 100m,
earning him the trust of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Thus, when the
Tengiz deal seemed likely to be delayed indefinitely, Mr Deuss was able to
get together Mr Nazarbayev and the other principals and get the deal signed
in April 1993.
Mr Nazarbayev has rewarded Mr Deuss handsomely. Oman Oil received rights to
two tracts on the Caspian's offshore northern shelf in a deal involving a
six-company western consortium including British Gas and British Petroleum.
Mr Deuss also has made a powerful friend in Russia's prime minister, Mr
Victor Chyrnomyrdin, the former energy minister.
The three Caspian Sea republics - Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan -
have studied various routes for transporting their energy to the west.
Russia is pushing them to follow the route of existing pipelines to its
Black Sea port of Novorossisk, a route that would allow Moscow to retain its
monopoly grip on the region's oil supplies.
Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan appear to be succumbing to the pressure. Their
favoured route now begins at Novorossisk, where the crude would be loaded on
to tankers. Turkish worries about supertankers passing through the Bosporus
Straits, site of a tanker collision in March, means that the oil might be
transferred to a second pipeline to the Mediterranean. It would either
traverse the Bosporus or Turkey's port of Samsun.
CORRECTION
Because of a computer transmission error the World Bank was incorrectly
given as the source of a report on a proposed Kazakh oil pipeline quoted in
an FT article about delays to the Tengiz oil project published on May 13.
The source was actually a report by Oxford Analytica.

<TEXT>
Novo Nordisk, the Danish healthcare and industrial enzymes group, reported a
fall in first-quarter net profits to DKr270m (Dollars 40.3m) from DKr304m in
the same period last year.
The group said the result was in line with expectations.
For the full year, the group maintained its forecast that profits would
increase relatively faster than the 11 per cent advance in 1993.
First-quarter sales were up by 14 per cent to DKr3.13bn from DKr2.75bn. The
increase was due partly to higher volume, with about 5 per cent due to
currency changes.
Sales by the healthcare group rose by 13 per cent to DKr2.06bn, including an
increase of 8 per cent in sales by the diabetics care division to DKr1.49bn.
Sales by the bio-industrial group, chiefly of industrial enzymes, increased
by 11 per cent to DKr901m.
The merger of two of the bio-industrial group's unit in the US would carry a
DKr80m non-recurring charge which would be booked in the second quarter, the
group said.
LKAB, the mining group, has completed the sale of a 13 per cent stake in
SSAB, Scandinavia's biggest steel group, for SKr1.3bn (Dollars 165m).
A total of 2.5m B shares and 1.625m A shares were placed with domestic and
international institutions.
The placing was led by BZW in conjunction with Handelsbanken Investment
Banking and Cazenove.

FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading food stocks were heavily traded as they received long-term support
from SG Warburg, which announced a Pounds 202m warrant issue, representing a
basket of shares in Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Argyll and William Morrison
Supermarkets.
The 20m warrants involved give investors the option to receive the cash
value of the shares at any time between now and November next year. They
provide a geared play into a sector which Warburg believes is 'severely
under-valued.'
Sainsbury, which Warburg sees as the pick of the four, added a half-penny at
389 1/2 p, while Argyll and Morrison picked up a penny each to 253p and 126p
but Tesco shed 2 to 233 1/2 p.
The progress report from Rank Organisation was given a cool response by the
market, where Rank shares, trading at 424p immediately the report was
announced, fell away to close 15 weaker at 403p after good turnover of 3.6m.
The slide in Rank shares was said to have been largely triggered by a BZW
profits downgrade. The broker chopped its current year profits forecast by
Pounds 10m to Pounds 322m pre-exceptional items. Mr Peter Hilliar, leisure
specialist at BZW, said the broker had shifted its stance on Rank from buy
to hold principally because of the stock's strong performance in recent
months.
There was more heavy activity in Lasmo shares following persistent stories
that a cash alternative to Enterprise Oil's all-paper offer is now imminent.
Any new bid will have to be pitched around the 160p level, dealers said.
Analysts insisted, however, that Enterprise would not take any action until
Lasmo's defence document is published. The document, which has to be made
public by Monday under the takeover code, is expected this morning. Lasmo
shares, helped by news of an oil discovery in Algeria, edged up 2 to 156p in
turnover of 10m.
Enterprise Oil, on the other hand, came under sustained selling pressure,
sliding to 425p before settling 11 off at 429p. Mercury Asset Management,
one of the UK's leading institutions, revealed it had sold a block of
206,000 shares, and there were hints of US selling of Enterprise after the
visit to US institutions by Mr Graham Hearn, Enterprise's chairman and chief
executive.
The gas discovery in Pakistan helped British Gas edge up 1 1/2 to 298 1/2 p
but had a much greater impact on Tullow Oil, which has a 15 per cent stake
in the find. Tullow rose 4 to 31 1/2 p on 6.1m shares dealt.
An SG Warburg Securities buy note helped to lift National Power by 14 to
430p and PowerGen by 5 to 464p.
A badly handled selling order unsettled Sun Alliance shares, which fell 12
to 321p on 3.6m traded.
Media conglomerate and Financial Times owner Pearson climbed 18 to 678p
ahead of the company's annual meeting today. Publisher Euromoney advanced
125p to 1825p, responding to a jump in half-year profits to Pounds 9m from
Pounds 5.9m. The company also announced that it is raising Pounds 20m
through a 1.2m-share placing.
Metal Bulletin moved forward 10 to 460p as it was announced that magazine
publisher Emap had increased its stake to 20.59 per cent. Emap receded 7 to
378p.
Defence and industrial giant British Aerospace broke through the 500p
barrier to close 11 ahead at 510p after a positive two-day analysts' visit
to the group's defence operations.
Mr Chris Avery at Paribas, who went on the tour, has put the stock on his
buy list and said: 'BAe's defence business shows near-term stability and
long-term potential despite declining world spending on equipment.' Volume
was 5.2m.
Negative whispers concerning Siebe's accounting policies resurfaced and hit
the shares, leaving them trailing 11 to 569p after trade of 3.8m. The group
reports figures next month.

FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: BT supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The significant underperformance of BT shares over the past six months was
highlighted by a number of broking houses, including Kleinwort Benson, which
removed BT from its sell list for the first time since early 1993. Further
support for the shares came as BZW reiterated its buy stance.
These investment notes saw BT shares bounce off their lowest level since
October 1992, to close a net 7 firmer at 368 1/2 . BT partly-paid stock
added a similar amount at 250 1/2 p.
BZW said the major trigger for BT's underperformance has been the sell-off
in US bonds and high yielding stocks. The investment bank said that, once
the full-year figures, due on May 19, are out of the way, it hopes that a
return to relative stability in the bond markets may allow a review of the
stock's fundamentals.
Kleinwort said BT's underperformance reflected investor concerns of
increasing competition, especially from cable operators.
BZW expects BT to achieve preliminary pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.76bn and a
dividend total of 16.8p, while Kleinwort is going for profits of Pounds
2.75bn and a dividend total of 16.7p.

FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet falls on Pounds 40m hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan stood out as the chief casualty
among leading stocks in London as the market reacted nervously to a shock
Pounds 40m charge included in trading figures announced yesterday.
The results were in line with most estimates but the group reported lower
stock levels at its IDV unit in the US.
However, most sector specialists remained enthusiastic on the group's
end-of-year figures, saying these would be helped by an unexpectedly low tax
charge and a boost in profits from the Burger King subsidiary. Ms Michelle
Proud of NatWest Securities summed up the general feeling: 'There was a lot
of good news but the bad news hit everyone for six.'
Analysts' forecasts were cut accordingly, although earnings per share
estimates were maintained and in some cases lifted slightly. Kleinwort
Benson moved to Pounds 959m for the current year from Pounds 979m but kept
its earnings estimate to 31.9p. SGST dropped by Pounds 40m to Pounds 950m
but raised the eps figure a penny to 3.2p. UBS held steady at Pounds 995m
and raised its earnings to 33.4p, while NatWest Securities moved to Pounds
940m and 32p of earnings.
GrandMet slid sharply to close 26 lower at 457p on exceptionally heavy
turnover of 11m. Dealers said there was heavy switching into Guinness, which
improved 5 to 498p.

FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp advance in US bonds helped to enliven an otherwise dull
derivatives sector in London, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,121. With no lead
to follow due to the Ascension Day closure of other European markets, the
contract languished over the next few hours, trading in a tight 13-point
range.
That situation changed over the lunchtime period with the release of US
sales and prices data which traders interpreted as reducing the chances of
an increase in US interest rates. The consequent rise in US treasuries and
the firm opening on Wall Street also boosted sentiment, and June moved
strongly ahead, pulling the underlying cash market higher.
The day's peak of 3,151 was seen in the last half an hour preceding the
official close and before a bout of profit-taking saw the contract come off
the top to finish at 3,151, up 18 from its previous close and around 10
points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume was
13,354 lots.
Traded options were quiet, a mere 23,163 contracts having been dealt by the
close. Among the index options, the FT-SE 100 option traded 9,089 lots and
the Euro FT-SE 1,019. Bid target Lasmo stood out among the stock options
with a day's total of 3,432 lots.

FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close to another volatile
trading session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ascension Day closure of nearly all continental European markets left
London to make the first response to two significant developments in the US
bond markets; their reaction to Wednesday's auction of Federal securities,
and to important economic data announced yesterday. UK stocks followed the
US lead closely. They fell initially on overnight weakness in New York bonds
and equities. But they rallied strongly in the afternoon when unexpected
falls in US producer prices and retail sales appeared to ease pressures for
a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy.
The Footsie maintained its recent record for volatility, dipping 25.2 before
recovering when it approached the 3,100 mark, and moving into positive
territory towards the close. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at
3,137.8 for a net gain of 7.3.
There was little response to the death of Mr John Smith, leader of the
opposition Labour party in the UK.
UK shares opened sharply lower in the wake of the setback overnight in both
US Federal bonds and the Dow Average which, in turn, reacted to the bond
auction in New York on Tuesday. With no effective guidance on bond prices
from elsewhere in Europe, London stocks followed early losses in UK
gilt-edged securities.
Attempts were made to rally following the announcement of a UK global trade
deficit of Pounds 730m for February, slightly better than expected. But this
had little effect and the Footsie was down to 3,105.3 before it steadied.
There was little recovery until, at the New York opening, the favourable US
economic statistics flashed across the trading screens. UK stocks quickly
extended their recovery and, with the Dow Average 26 points up in UK hours,
London closed very near the best of the day.
Analysts were impressed to see the market bounce convincingly again in the
Footsie 3,100 area. Some institutional interest was seen and the session
reaffirmed the underlying resilience of UK equities at current levels. The
volatility of the Footsie suggested that buyers were never far away.
Some argued that recent intervention to support the dollar, as well as
Wednesday's rate cuts in Europe, had 'opened the door' for the Federal
Reserve to tighten credit and markets would welcome such a move.
Mr Edmond Warner at Kleinwort Benson Securities said a 'substantial
increase' in the Federal Funds rate might spark the bond rally which remains
critical for the health of UK equities.
Second-line stocks followed the blue chips although at a slight distance.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 0.1 off at 3,742.4. Seaq volume of 722.5m
shares was restrained by the lack of business from other European financial
centres. Wednesday's 744.3m shares through the Seaq network was worth Pounds
1.4bn at retail level.
Company results provided some features but gave no guide to the market
overall. The trading statement from Royal Insurance reaffirmed the
improvement in insurance in the UK and also the effects of the storms and
bad weather in California.
Today, London is likely to be poised, together with other European markets,
for the US consumer price statistics, which will provide the latest test of
confidence in near term prospects for US interest rates.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow moves in line with bonds
for third day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
For the third consecutive day, US share prices moved in step with the bond
market yesterday, rising across the board after Treasury prices had rallied
on news of an unexpected decline in producer price inflation, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.80 up at 3,652.84 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.26 at 443.75, while the Nasdaq composite put
on 2.61 at 719.61. New York SE volume was 272.8m shares.
Every day so far this week, the stock market has taken its lead from bonds,
yesterday being no exception. After Wednesday's fall, equities rose from the
opening as investors were cheered by a big rally in the Treasury market.
The benchmark 30-year bond climbed by more than a point, lowering its yield
to under 7.5 per cent, after the government announced an unexpected 0.1 per
cent decline in the producer prices index during April. Analysts had been
expecting last month's PPI to register a rise of 0.2 per cent. Bond prices
were also buoyed by a 0.8 per cent fall in April retail sales.
Although share prices later followed bonds down from their early highs, the
drop in long-term interest rates and the good news on inflation ensured that
stocks remained firmly in positive territory throughout the day.
There was even some hope that the inflation figures would persuade the
Federal Reserve that when it next tightens monetary policy, it should raise
interest rates by only 25 basis points, and not by the 50 basis points that
most economists are forecasting.
Philip Morris jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 1/2 in volume of 5.5m shares
amid renewed speculation that it would soon split its tobacco and food
businesses.
Allied Signal advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 in busy trading after
the company said it had signed an agreement to purchase the Textron group's
Lycoming Turbine Engine division for Dollars 375m in cash and the assumption
of certain liabilities. The news lifted Textron Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 54
3/4 as traders forecast that the company would use some of the proceeds from
the sale to buy back stock.
Margaretten Financial rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 24 5/8 in volume of 3.2m
shares on news that the home mortgage banking company is to be acquired by
Chemical Banking for Dollars 330m in cash. Chemical firmed early on but
ended unchanged at Dollars 34 3/8 .
Gap Stores rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 1/4 on reporting a 53 per cent
first-quarter profits increase to Dollars 63.5m. Another retailer, Land's
End, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 44 1/8 on disappointing earnings.
Canada
Investors, rocked by the recent bond-driven rollercoaster ride, continued to
cling to the sidelines and Toronto closed mixed after light trading.
The TSE 300 index slipped 5.7 to 4,162.5 and falls led rises by 419 to 321
after volume of 52.9m shares valued at CDollars 509.4m. But eight of the 14
sub-indices finished higher, led by transportation, up 1.9 per cent. The
conglomerates group had the day's biggest fall, 2.0 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela continues to be a puzzle /
Assessing the outlook for the country's equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To most foreign investors, Venezuela remains a high-risk puzzle. The
economic policies of the administration of 78-year-old President Rafael
Caldera, who began a five-year term last February, offer a confusing
combination of government intervention and market init-iatives.
The outlook in 1994 is for a second straight year of negative economic
growth, and investors are not at all sure that the new government's economic
policies - aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit, attracting private
investment and generating regular economic growth with low inflation - will
work.
With high inflation (46 per cent last year) and a monetary unit that has
declined by 46 per cent, using the parallel market exchange rate, since
January 1993, equity investors have to watch movements on the Caracas stock
exchange carefully to make real short and medium-term gains.
Following an impressive rally in February, after Mr Caldera took office, the
stock exchange has been generally weak.
This year's peak came on February 21, when the index hit 29,798.33, up 36
per cent from the end of 1993, partly due to the entry of several investment
funds from overseas. Since then the market has fallen some 26 per cent.
These figures turn out to be even worse when one takes into account the
country's inflation rate of 12.7 per cent for the first four months of 1994.
Adjusted for currency depreciation, the index is down 37.5 per cent from its
February peak, and 20 per cent since the start of this year.
Equities fell sharply following the resignation of the president of the
central bank, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, on April 26.
Domestic and international investors reacted negatively to her departure -
while in office she had maintained real interest rates and protected
international reserves in spite of pressure from political and business
sectors to change.
In the period following Mrs Krivoy's resignation the bolivar lost 9.6 per
cent against the dollar in seven business days up to May 5 and, during the
same period, the stock index dropped by 4.4 per cent.
It is not yet clear if Mrs Krivoy's successor, Mr Antonio Casas, will be
able to resist pressure from the government to push down interest rates.
Nor is it clear how Venezuela's international monetary reserves will hold up
during a year of declining oil revenues. Reserves fell by Dollars 1.7bn (14
per cent) during the first quarter, and are estimated to have slipped some
Dollars 1bn in April.
In spite of all these problems there was some good news for the stock market
earlier this month when the government decided that its new tax on private
sector debit transactions at banks would not be applied in full force to the
stock exchange.
This 0.75 per cent tax which, in amended form, takes effect later this
month, would have raised trading costs considerably for both buyers and
sellers, since at least four cheques are involved in a normal transaction
and each one could have been taxed. However, after lobbying by the stock
exchange authorities, the government decided to apply the levy only to the
buyer's cheque.
Venezuela's external debt bonds have been hit hard this year, following on
from the failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank, last
January, which raised concern over the health of other banks, as well as the
increase in US interest rates.
But even though the government is facing a steep decline in oil export
revenues this year - and thus lower taxes from the petroleum sector - there
have been no indications so far that it will have trouble servicing its
external debt.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: April turnover falls 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourse activity in April failed to respond to a tentative recovery in most
European market indices, and turnover fell by 12 per cent on the month after
a 5.7 per cent rise in March.
This was partly due to the Easter holidays, says Mr James Cornish, European
market strategist at NatWest Securities, which produces the figures, but it
also reflected caution on the part of international investors.
Turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International, the London
screen-based dealing system which attracts a lot of international business,
declined to 15.8 per cent as a proportion of its counterpart in Continental
domestic equity markets, after 16.2 per cent in March and 16.1 per cent in
February.
There had to be an exception, and in April it was Italy, which saw turnover
up 31.8 per cent on the month, and by 49 per cent over the average of the
previous quarter. Mr Cornish notes that Italian share prices rose by another
10.6 per cent last month, in growing anticipation of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
success in forming a government.
'In contrast to Milan,' notes Mr Cornish, 'Seaq International turnover in
Italian shares fell by 4.3 per cent on the month, with the proportion of
London to domestically traded Italian shares falling to 12.8 per cent, from
17.4 per cent in March. This bears out our view that the Italian market is
now propelled mainly by domestic buying.'
Zurich was the underperformer in share price terms in April, with a domestic
index fall of 1.5 per cent. Turnover in Swiss shares dropped by 25.3 per
cent.
But this was topped by France. In Paris, share prices rose by an adequate
2.5 per cent as turnover fell by 33.6 per cent. By April, too, the Paris
market was becoming apprehensive about the weight of new issues that it was
intended to field.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong recovery in Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most bourses were closed for the Ascension day holiday.
MADRID recovered more ground, mainly in the afternoon when the influence of
the US PPI data was combined with expectations of a domestic interest rate
cut. The general index rose 5.68, or 1.8 per cent to 327.16, turnover rising
from Pta32bn to Pta33.6bn but accelerating towards the close.
Construction stocks starred. Huarte, up Pta55, or 3 per cent to Pta1,875,
was recommended by James Capel, which said that the company had the largest
order book in the sector; Uralita rose Pta110, or 7.7 per cent to Pta1,540.
Utililities climbed after Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico, up Pta80 at
Pta4,220, delivered a 55 per cent rise in first quarter net. Iberdrola rose
Pta31 to Pta977 and Sevillana by Pta29, or 4.4 per cent to Pta684.
MILAN fell back on options expiry, while the market's overall tone remained
cautious. Investors were awaiting further political developments, as well as
the release of Fiat's 1993 results and, more importantly, its forecasts for
1994.
The Comit index shed 7.05 to 803.02.
After the close the car group announced that first quarter results showed a
return to profit after a loss of L222bn in the same 1993 period. Its shares
closed up L125 at L7,135.
Generali, the insurance group, which also forecast better results for 1994,
gained L850 to L48,300.
DUBLIN ended at a new low for the year, affected, said Mr Adrian O'Carroll
of Dillon Read, by declines in Bank of Ireland and CRH, the building
materials group. The ISEQ index lost 9.41 to 1,792.74, but in below average
turnover.
TEL AVIV registered its ninth fall in succession as the Mishtanim index lost
3.00, or 1.4 per cent to 214.62.
ISTANBUL rose 3.8 per cent after a three-day fall, the composite index
ending 602.09 higher at 16,335.55. Brokers said that investors were still
cautious buyers of state-controlled companies as lira interest rates stayed
firm.
WARSAW recovered 2.6 per cent after rate cut news from the National Bank of
Poland, the Wig index closing 268.4 higher at 10,674.6.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Regional markets vary as
Nikkei remains firm
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average stayed above 20,000 yesterday, share prices moving
higher on late buying of laggard sectors by foreign investors, and on
technical purchases by arbitrageurs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index traded narrowly, gaining 74.11 at 20,224.24 after a low of
20,118.72, and high of 20,260.35 just before the close.
Volume came to 270m shares, against 344m, as most domestic players remained
inactive due to the prevailing uncertainty on the currency markets. 'Whether
the yen's easing is sustainable or not is uncertain,' said a trader.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.52 to 1,644.56 and the
Nikkei 300 put on 1.49 at 301.08. Gainers led losers by 629 to 370, with 185
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 1.67 at 1,344.15.
Traders said that with potential sellers above the 20,000 level, investors
had little incentive to buy stocks at current prices.
Real estate companies, regarded as laggards, were traded actively.
Mitsubishi Estate firmed Y10 to Y1,280 and Mitsui Fudosan Y30 to Y1,300.
Construction stocks were also firm, with Shimizu appreciating Y12 to Y954
and Kumagai Gumi Y17 to Y488.
Railroads, too, advanced on the laggard stocks theme, with Tobu Railway up
Y22 to Y686 and East Japan Railway ahead Y12,000 at Y500,000. Steels gained
on foreign buying: NKK, the day's most active issue, rose Y8 to Y266 and
Nippon Steel put on Y1 at Y353.
Profit-taking depressed some high-technology companies, which had rallied on
Wednesday. Fujitsu shed Y10 to Y1,030 and Sony Y50 to Y5,840.
Speculators looking for quick profits targeted Mazda Motor, which climbed
Y24 to Y573, and Brother Industries, Y13 stronger at Y690.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 45.93 at 22,373.49 in volume of 31.3m
shares.
Roundup
The region's markets showed wide variations in performance. Bombay and
Jakarta were closed for holidays.
HONG KONG fell slightly following the previous day's 4 per cent gain: the
Hang Seng index finished down 27.30 at 8,878.86.
'Sentiment remains cautious if not bearish,' said one trader. 'Many funds
would rather stay on the sidelines pending opportunities, while others have
turned to the futures, trying to make the most out of the choppy spot
market.'
Among the actives, HSBC dipped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 84 and Cheung
Kong lost 75 cents to HKDollars 36.50, but there was selective buying of
other blue chips and second line stocks.
Chinese Estates was the session's strongest performer, advancing HKDollars
1.00, or 15 per cent, to HKDollars 7.50. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 4.5bn
(HKDollars 5.2bn).
SINGAPORE fell back in light trading as investors took profits on selected
blue chips following gains over the previous two sessions. The Straits Times
industrial index slipped 10.81 to 2,250.41.
Natsteel dropped 44 cents to SDollars 4.36 in heavy turnover on expectations
that it would soon announce disappointing results. Shipbuiders came under
pressure after recent gains: Sembawang receded 20 cents to SDollars 13.00.
SEOUL maintained its momentum as the market rose for the seventh consecutive
session, the composite index firming 3.54 to 952.45. Turnover was
Won793.8bn. TAIPEI was pulled lower late in the session on profit-taking,
and the weighted index, which had earlier seen the 6,100 level, closed off
20.09 at 6,004.38. Turnover rose to TDollars 87.4bn from TDollars 61.9bn.
Construction and electronic issues went against the trend, with Tatung up
TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 61.50. Formosa Chemical Fibre lost TDollars 1.50
to TDollars 37.50.
MANILA was generally softer but for a gain in PLDT, which added 30 pesos at
1,890 pesos after a slight rise on Wall Street overnight.
The composite index eased 3.11 to 2,952.27. Turnover was 906.8m pesos.
Traders noted that many investors were refraining from buying in
anticipation of three IPOs later in the month.
KUALA LUMPUR eased as sentiment was affected by Bank Negara's announcement
that it was to raise the reserve requirements of banks and finance
companies. The composite index dipped 11.75 to 996.92. Tenaga weakened 40
cents to MDollars 13.30 on expectations that the power group would announce
poorer than expected results next week.
BANGKOK ended slightly lower after moving in a narrow 10-point range. The
SET index lost 3.04 at 1,232.72 in thin turnover of Bt3.8bn.
Investors focused on construction materials in the expectation that
first-quarter results, especially among cement manufacturers, would show an
improvement. The heavily weighted Bangkok Bank put on Bt1 at Bt161, limiting
the index's fall.
SYDNEY, which had lost ground in the afternoon, firmed shortly before the
close. The All Ordinaries index finished 6.8 ahead at 2,041.4. Turnover was
ADollars 527.8m.
Foster's Brewing fell 11 cents to ADollars 1.19 on brokers' downgrades,
while positive opinions helped BHP to a gain of 36 cents at ADollars 17.04.
WELLINGTON followed its own instincts. Strong buying was seen in the major
blue chips and the NZSE-40 capital index advanced 29.66 to 2,093.50. Air New
Zealand shares received a boost after announcing that second-half profits
were likely to exceed the first half's NZDollars 88.1m.
KARACHI strengthened on institutional buying. The KSE 100-share index rose
38.03, or 1.7 per cent, to 2,227.22.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Better day for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling rose on the foreign exchanges yesterday, helped by a better than
expected set of trade figures, writes Philip Gawith.
The sterling index finished in London at 80.1, up from 79.6 on Wednesday,
with the pound closing nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs higher at DM2.5052 from
DM2.4911. It also ended more than a cent firmer against the dollar, at
Dollars 1.4994 from Dollars 1.4886.
Traders had anticipated a quiet day, with most European markets closed for
the Ascension Day holiday, but there was a lot of business in sterling, the
dollar and the yen.
The dollar survived a weaker than expected set of economic figures, with the
market wary of selling against possible central bank intervention. It was
also helped by the revival in the US bond market.
In Europe, the D-Mark ended weaker against most currencies, closing in
London at L956.5 from L957.8 against the Italian lira.
The pound was the focus of early activity when a better than expected set of
February trade data gave the currency a boost. The headline figure of a
trade deficit of Pounds 731m was well below the median forecast of a Pounds
1.1bn deficit.
The key figure, however, said Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC,
was the fact that the revision to the 1993 UK global trade deficit was much
smaller than the market had feared. The deficit was revised up to Pounds
13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn, but this was a far cry from the Pounds 2bn to
Pounds 3bn upward revision expected by some.
These figures gave sterling its initial boost, and the later confirmation of
the Labour party leader's death gave the currency further momentum.
Mr David Barrett, trader at Natwest Markets, said one of the reasons
sterling had risen after the trade figures was that the market had been
short going into the figures, and short positions had been squeezed.
Stop-loss buying when it rose above DM2.50 had also helped.
Mr Parsons said there were three reasons why the market had seen Mr Smith's
death as being good for the pound. First, 'it takes the Tory party off the
front pages. That has to be good for the currency.' Second, the focus would
now swing to possible divisions in the Opposition.
Finally, his demise meant that a leadership challenge in the Tory party from
Mr Michael Heseltine, seen as the most potent challenger to Prime Minister
John Major, was now much less likely. Like Mr Smith, Mr Heseltine has also
previously had a heart attack.
Mr Stephen Yorke, political analyst at Chase Manhattan, raised the prospect
that if the Labour party moved quickly enough to appoint a new leader before
the June 9 European elections, the combination of a sympathy vote and a
honeymoon period could boost its vote significantly.
What this would mean for sterling is unclear. Recently there has been market
speculation that Mr Major's departure - a possibility, if the Tories do very
badly in the elections - would actually be welcomed by the market. On the
other hand, Mr Yorke notes: 'If international investors start pricing in a
Labour government, then sterling will certainly fall.'
The dollar received an initial fillip from the release of inflation, retail
sales and jobless data, all weaker than anticipated. These helped the US
bond market, and the dollar rallied on its coat-tails, continuing the
parallel trading of the two markets evident in recent weeks.
This helped to push the dollar to a high for the day of DM1.6740, but it
later fell back to close in London at DM1.6708, from DM1.6735 on Wednesday.
Against the yen, the dollar was little changed at Y104.505 from Y104.470. Mr
Barritt said there had been a lot of yen sales, particularly for D-Marks.
'There is a growing perception that the US administration does not want the
strong yen to continue,' he said.
In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6662 and Y104.22.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese prime minister, added his voice yesterday,
saying that 'the current rapid currency moves cannot be justified by
economic fundamentals'.
Although the figures were weaker than expected, Mr Parsons said: 'The market
is wary of selling dollars on the back of weak numbers. It is concerned that
if you try and take the dollar lower, it could be met by central bank
intervention.'
Mr Parsons judged that the central banks had done an 'exceptionally good job
of changing sentiment'. He would not go so far as to say the dollar's
troubles were over, but 'they have at least succeeded in making it a two-way
bet. The market is reluctant to open short dollar positions.'
In the futures market, the short sterling contracts continued their
recovery, with the December contract closing nine basis points firmer at
93.93. The December Euromark contract ended unchanged at 95.24, a recovery
of some 30 basis points over the past week from a low of 94.92.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 115m after forecasting a very small shortage of Pounds 150m. The
overnight rate moved in the 4 to 5 3/8 per cent range. The German money
market was closed.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver deficit at record and
still growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide fabrication demand for silver outpaced supply for the fourth
consecutive year in 1993, by a record 207.5m troy ounces, according to the
annual survey from the Silver Institute, the Washington-based international
association of miners, refiners, fabricators and manufacturers.
The deficit is forecast to widen this year to 248.4m ounces.
This suggests that stocks of silver readily available to the market, which
stood at 1.1bn ounces in 1990 could be down to 620m at the end of this year.
The survey points out that the 1.1bn of stock was built up from supply
surpluses between 1979 and 1990. Any other silver stocks are probably
relatively unavailable to the market at any price, given that they had not
been sold when prices rose ten fold, from USDollars 5 to Dollars 50 an ounce
in 1979 and 1980, nor when silver prices fell by more than 90 per cent in
the following 13 years.
According to the CPM precious metals consultancy group which compiled the
data for the survey, silver supply fell by 6.1 per cent last year, from
501.7m ounces to 471.2m, the lowest level since 1986. This was mainly
because of closures of copper, lead, and zinc mines where silver was
produced as a by product.
Fabrication demand, meanwhile, rose by 14.4 per cent, from 593.4m ounces in
1992 to 678.7m. Much of this growth came from a doubling of demand in India,
the second largest consumer, after the US, for silver jewellery and
decorative objects following the relaxation of import restrictions there in
January 1993, which lead to lower Indian market prices.
Worldwide fabrication demand is projected to rise this year by another 7.2
per cent to 727.8m ounces. Supply in 1994 is predicted to grow at a much
lower rate, by 1.7 per cent to 479.4m ounces.
The surge from India helped demand from silver jewellery and flatware
manufacturers to jump by 27.5 per cent last year to 221.6m ounces, so that
it overtook the use of silver in photographic film and papers, up by 1.3 per
cent to 195.9m ounces.
'This was the first time in more than 25 years that silver used for
jewellery and silverware was greater than silver demand in photography,'
said Mr Dennis Wheeler, president of the institute at an analysts' briefing
here. 'This is very significant and it reflects the increased demand for the
metal from growing economies such as India and Thailand.'
Mr Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM, picked up this theme when
discussing long term trends in the use of silver. There had been a sharp
increase in the share of the silver market represented by fabrication demand
in developing countries, primarily in India and Thailand.
Much of the jewellery formerly fabricated in Italy or the US was now made in
Thailand. Consequently, silver use in developing countries, which was no
more than 15 per cent of world demand between 1979 and 1989 was more than 30
per cent in 1994.
Silver use in coinage last year rose from 29.4m to 38.1m ounces, mainly
because the Mexican government began issuing again legal tender coins
containing silver. This absorbed 15m ounces. Demand could be lower in 1994.
The price of silver averaged USDollars 4.30 an ounce last year, up by 9.4
per cent (nine point four) from Dollars 3.93 in 1992. However, when adjusted
for inflation, the real price of silver remained at one of its lowest levels
since the 1940s.
Mr Christian said: 'In the first four months of 1994 demand has continued to
increase in most major market sectors. Indian demand and imports are rising
and should exceed last year's phenomenal levels. Demand is also reviving in
Japan and some European countries in which silver use, and economic growth
in general, has been rather stagnant until recently. Demand is increasing in
the US, Thailand and other big consuming nations'.

The Malayan Mining Employers' Association (MMEA), which groups Malaysia's
main tin mining and smelting companies, is considering disbanding because of
the dramatic decline in the country's tin industry.
The association says that though there has been a recent rise in tin prices
a sustained recovery has still not been achieved. Last week tin was trading
at around MDollars 14.25 (Dollars 5.36) a kilogram on the Kuala Lumpur
market. Malaysian tin producers say they need prices in the range of
MDollars 16 to MDollars 18 to cover costs.
Last September the Kuala Lumpur price dropped to a low of MDollars 10.78 a
kilogram.
Malaysia was once the world's largest tin producer with an annual output in
the 1960s of between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes; last year its production fell
by 28 per cent to 10,384 tonnes. In 1980 nearly 40,000 workers were employed
in the country's tin industry; according to the MMEA tin employment has
fallen to less than 2,300.
The Association of Tin Producing Countries, which groups many of the world's
big producers, is meeting in Kuala Lumpur this week to review the state of
the world industry. The MMEA is not optimistic about the short term
prospects. It says that other materials like glass, aluminium and plastic
are increasingly replacing tin in the packaging industry.
The MMEA says that the US Defence Logistics Agency has continued to dispose
of large amounts of tin on the world market. Oversupply problems have been
exacerbated, meanwhile, by increased production from relatively new
producers such as Peru, Portugal and Vietnam.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool offerings in the closing weeks of the Australian selling season are
normally low and this week auctions were held on only two instead of the
normal three days. Prices moved sharply ahead for finer merinos, and the
market indicator rose above the 600 cent mark which many feel provides the
prospect of economic production for most wool growers. The Wool
international market indicator was 603 cents at the close, compared with 587
a week before. Currency developments have tended to underline the rise in
wool costs in most wool using countries in the past week or so. Recognition
of a rising price trend for wool is obvious among those trading near to the
raw wool end of the trade, but manufacturers and retailers are proving more
difficult to convince that high prices must now be paid.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaican bauxite output up 3.5
per cent

<TEXT>
Jamaica's bauxite (aluminium ore) production grew was up 3.5 per cent in the
first quarter of this year compared with the corresponding period of last
year, to reach 2.85m tonnes, mainly because of an increase in output by one
of the island's largest refiners.
Production of alumina (aluminium oxide) in the quarter rose to 792,044
tonnes, 9.4 per cent up from a year earlier, the Jamaica Bauxite Institute
reported. Crude ore exports fell 9.1 per cent to 892,477 tonnes.
Jamaica is the world's third largest producer of bauxite, after Australia
and Guinea.
'The increase in raw ore production and in the output of alumina are mainly
the result of the expansion in capacity and production by Alumina Partners
of Jamaica,' said Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting managing director of the
bauxite institute. 'Other refiners have increased capacity and production
marginally.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop setbacks put Indian sugar
trade into reverse - Imports are now needed so that a presence can be
maintained in the export market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's sugar crop hopes are continuing to fade. Having already been lowered
to 10.5m tonnes from 11m, the production estimate for the 1993-94 season
(October-September) has recently been cut to not more than 9.8m tonnes.
Last year, the country produced 10.6m tonnes of sugar, down from the 1991-92
record of 13.4m.
A concerned federal government has allowed duty-free imports of white sugar
so that the domestic production shortfall does not lead to a runaway
inflation in sugar prices. According to industry officials, between the
Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim Corporation and the trade, nearly
500,000 tonnes of sugar have already been contracted for import. And import
contracts for another 300,000 tonnes are likely to be signed in the next few
weeks.
The imported sugar has started arriving at Indian ports and to facilitate
its distribution the government has told the trade that it will be exempted
from the 'stock-holding limit and turnover time applicable to sugar produced
within the country'.
Earlier the government allowed the import of raw sugar for processing and
re-export at a minimum value addition of 7.5 per cent. This was done in
response to the suggestion by the Indian Sugar Mills Association that India,
which reappeared as a sugar exporter in 1990-91 should maintain a presence
in the world market in spite of the production setback. The ISGIEC, the
industry's trading arm, has already imported 12,000 tonnes of raw sugar, and
the seller has the option to supply the same quantity by June 1994.
Meanwhile, ISMA has told the government that in view of the worsening
domestic supply situation the imported raw sugar should be allowed to be
marketed within the country after processing without attracting any levy.
And the government is expected to accept the proposal.
Hit by a severe drought, Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing state,
where crushing of cane is almost over, will end the season with production
of 2.7m tonnes, compared with last year's 3.36m.
The setback to production in Uttar Pradesh to 2.66m tonnes from 2.86m is
blamed on large-scale diversion of cane to production of gur and khandsari,
traditional sweeteners for the local peasant market. According to ISMA, 'a
good 500,000 tonnes of sugar has been lost in Uttar Pradesh because of the
cane diversion'.
The production loss in Bihar is because of damage caused to the standing
crop by floods and excessive rains. There will also be production shortfall
in the two north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana.
Gujarat, however, is expected to step up production to 970,000 tonnes from
751,000. Production will also be higher in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
The expected production of 9.8m tonnes will not meet domestic consumption,
which the government is seeking to restrict to about 12m tonnes through the
monthly sugar release mechanism. The total availability of sugar in the
current season will be, however, around 13.8m tonnes, including the carry
forward stocks of 3.2m tonnes and imports of 800,000 tonnes.
Though the Indian sugar season begins in October, production gains momentum
only from the end of November, so the new season should ideally start with
stocks equal to the sugar requirement for at least two and a half months.
This is not going to happen in 1994-95.
In the meantime, new cane plantation has started. According to industry
official plantings will be 20 to 25 per cent higher than last year's. But
the first crop forecast and the likely sugar production in the next season
will not be available till June by when the monsoon has set in.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa futures attract investment
fund buying - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London COCOA and COFFEE futures put in good performances in the afternoon.
The July robusta coffee contract had sunk to Dollars 1,852 a tonne in the
morning. But a reasonably steady New York gave London support and prices
advanced, the second month closing just Dollars 15 down on balance at
Dollars 1,890.
Cocoa was continuing to benefit from a resurgence in interest in commodities
generally, analysts said, attracting new investment fund buying. The July
position was pushed to a high of Pounds 959 a tonne before the market backed
off slightly to end Pounds 33 up at Pounds 954.
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices settled back late in the afternoon,
having earlier reached new highs for the current move, as yet another
technical reaction set in.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: PPI fall boosts US Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After rallying strongly following news of an unexpected decline in April
producer prices, US Treasury prices fell back to stand only moderately
higher yesterday
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  5/16 at 84 17/32 ,
yielding 7.564 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was up  3/32 at 98 27/32 , to yield 6.115 per cent.
The market had been expecting a small rise in the April producer prices
index, so when it was announced that the PPI had fallen 0.1 per cent last
month, buyers quickly moved into the market, which was primed for some sort
of rally after Wednesday's big auction-related losses.
With dealer short-covering providing additional strength, prices at the long
end of the maturity range rose by more than a point during the morning,
pushing the yield below 7.5 per cent.
Prices were also buoyed by a surprising 0.8 per cent decline in April retail
sales, although this was tempered by March retail sales being revised upward
from a 0.4 per cent gain to a 1.7 per cent gain.
The market, however, was unable to hold on to its early gains. Dealers
blamed the lack of a follow-through from retail buyers, and comments from Mr
Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, who hinted
that short-term interest rates would have to go considerably higher.
UK government bonds climbed during the course of the day, helped by
better-than-expected UK trade data and the rally in US bonds. The trade data
for February showed a reduced deficit.
'The monthly numbers are highly erratic, but the fall in imports, which had
been strong for five months, is reassuring,' said Mr Simon Briscoe,
economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, suggesting that the pace of recovery
in the UK could be easing.
Volume in the cash and futures markets was low. The Liffe gilt futures
contract, which closed at 103.22 on Wednesday, touched a low of 103.02 early
yesterday, climbed to a high of 104.12, and traded at 104.05 by late
afternoon.
The gilt market expects the Bank of England to announce its next gilt
auction today, although views are divided on which maturity it will choose.
The market has been starved of long-dated issues since late 1993, and the
yield spread for 25-year issues over 10-year gilts has narrowed from 20
basis points in mid-April to five basis points at present.
'The Bank is creating a severe distortion in the gilt market by not issuing
long-dated stock,' complained one international fund manager.
However, many dealers believe the Bank is unwilling to issue long-dated
stock as this could be seen as condoning the 'abnormally' high yields which
have resulted from the global bond market shake-out.
Spanish government bonds edged higher, taking their cue mainly from the US
in light trading.
Yesterday saw the release of Spanish unemployment and GDP data, providing
some evidence of economic recovery, according to Mr Steven Dulake, bond
analyst at PaineWebber.
The percentage of unemployed fell to 17.76 per cent in April from 17.92 per
cent in March, while GDP rose at a year-on-year rate of about 0.5 per cent
in the first quarter of 1994, the first such increase in five quarters.
Given the Bundesbank's half-point cut in German interest rates on Wednesday,
market participants are waiting to see whether the Bank of Spain follows
suit.
The French and German government bond markets were closed for a public
holiday yesterday.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Lisbon announces radical
reform of bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's bond market is to be radically reformed next month with a
comprehensive package of measures designed to increase liquidity, improve
efficiency and bring trading practices into line with other European capital
markets.
The government said yesterday the measures would create a wide range of new
instruments and make the market more attractive to foreign investors. The
package, which includes the effective abolition of withholding tax on
non-residents, takes effect on June 23.
Traders welcomed the reforms, which should provide a framework for market
development and a significant increase in liquidity. They are the
culmination of almost two years of reform following the liberalisation of
Portuguese capital movements in 1992.
'These reforms provide the instruments that international investors have
long been looking for in Portugal,' said Mr Rui Ferreira, director of
fixed-income security trading at Banco Finantia. 'We are now likely to see
foreign investment in the bond market move up from less than 5 per cent of
the total towards 30 per cent.'
The main reforms are:
The effective abolition of a 20 per cent withholding tax on non-resident
holders of government bonds by refunding investors within 24 hours.
Investors based in tax havens will not be exempt;
The creation of a screen-based over-the-counter market open to banks for
wholesale fixed-income security transactions of at least Es175m. The stock
market will continue to be limited to brokers and will tend to specialise in
retail transactions;
Non-residents will be free to issue bonds and commercial paper in the
Portuguese market after giving four days notice. Such issues are currently
subject to government approval;
A 9 per cent stamp duty and a 0.5 percent stock-market commission on
repurchase agreements will be abolished and replaced by an annual fee to be
paid for linkage to the screen-based reporting and clearing system;
The abolition of taxes and commissions is designed to foster the growth of a
repurchase market for Treasury bonds. The Bank of Portugal, the central
bank, is to use Treasury bond repos as a new instrument of monetary policy;
A regulatory framework for short selling and bond lending is to be
introduced. The main aim is create a 'grey market' to allow bidding at bond
auctions to begin earlier;
Coupons are to be traded on a gross basis and interest will accrue to the
financial settlement date. Coupons are currently traded on a net basis and
interest accrues to the physical settlement date;
A new payment versus delivery system is to be installed bringing Portugal in
line with the Euroclear system. The aim is to increase security and reduce
counterparty risk.
'These measures will place us much closer to the more advanced European bond
markets in terms of legislation, infrastructures and trading practices,'
said a government official. 'The reform will be further enhanced by the
creation of a futures and an options market before the end of the year.'
Market capitalisation of the Portuguese bond market was Es4.58bn at the end
of 1993, a rise of 35 per cent over the previous year. Daily turnover
averaged Es27.6bn in February, against Es7.3bn a year earlier.
Analysts said the market was benefiting from Portugal's sound economic
fundamentals and political stability. For example, the yield on five-year
government bonds yesterday was about 100 basis points higher than in Spain,
which is suffering the effects of a political crisis. But inflexible
legislation, high taxes and a lack of liquidity currently made Portugal
relatively unattractive to international investors.
'The withholding tax was a big deterrent to foreign investors,' said Mr
Jorge Silveira Botelha of brokers Midas Investimento. 'Now that we have a
date for its abolition, the liquidity of the market is certain to improve
and market-makers will become more aggressive. These reforms will help
Portugal compete more effectively with its main rivals, Spain and Italy.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Bombay SE could lift forward
trading ban

<TEXT>
A six-month row over forward trading between India's stockbrokers and the
Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog, could shortly
be settled.
Brokers on the Bombay Stock Exchange said yesterday that exchange officials
and Sebi executives were preparing rules for the re-introduction of forward
trading, which has been banned by the Sebi for the past two months.
The prospect of a restart of forward trading has prompted a sharp rally in
shares in recent days. The market has also been buoyed by renewed buying by
foreign fund managers, partly motivated by the withdrawal of the Dollars 1bn
Euro-issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the international telecommunications
carrier. Money earmarked for VSNL is now flowing into other shares.
The arguments over forward trading began last autumn when the Sebi launched
a strong attack on a long-established informal kind of forward trading, on
the grounds that it was not transparent and could easily be used for price
manipulation. After failing to secure the brokers' agreement on regulatory
rules, the Sebi banned forward trading altogether from March 12 and refused
to be moved by brokers' protests.
The ban contributed to a sharp fall in shares, exacerbated by the worldwide
turmoil in stocks caused by increases in US interest rates and by
profit-taking.
The Sebi and the Bombay Stock Exchange declined to disclose details of their
discussions.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Daewoo launches Dollars 75m three-year
FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ascension Day holiday in many parts of Europe brought activity in the
Eurobond market to a standstill yesterday, with the only issues coming from
Asian borrowers.
Daewoo, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, raised Dollars 75m
through an issue of three-year floating-rate notes.
Lead manager Korea First Investment said the notes appealed mainly to
investors in Asia. However, European investors were also interested since
the notes were registered with Euroclear.
Chia Hsin Cement Corp, the only Taiwanese cement company permitted to invest
in mainland China, launched a Dollars 65m offering of eight-year convertible
bonds. The proceeds will be used to finance Chia's expansion in China.
Joint lead manager Robert Fleming said the bonds were targeted at equity
investors in Asia and Europe since US demand for such instruments had waned
in recent months.
News from Nairobi that the annual meeting of the African Development Bank
(AfDB) had suspended proceedings while its governors discussed the bank's
arrears and soft loan arm put pressure on the AfDB's Eurobonds.
Dealers said the yield spread on the AfDB's recent issue of 10-year
Eurobonds had widened by five basis points to 45 basis points over 10-year
US Treasuries in the last week. The bonds were launched in March at a spread
of 28 basis points.
Revelations of mounting arrears, now more than Dollars 700m, and a critical
report of the bank by outside consultants have put a question mark over the
AfDB's triple-A rating.
Ms Helena Hessel, a director at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York, said she
would be reviewing the AfDB's rating in the next few months.
She noted the bank's problems were 'part of the package for a regional
development bank', and said that S&amp;P would only be concerned if the
criticism had a negative impact on shareholders.
'Should we see a real lack of support from shareholders and an increase in
the bank's gearing ratio then this would have to be reflected in the
rating,' Ms Hessel said.
However, she was encouraged by the bank's steps to strengthen its provisions
and sanctions policies.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bajaj Auto aims to maintain its
dominance - The Indian scooter maker is capitalising on economic
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few Indian industrialists have stayed as close to their business as Mr Rahul
Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto, the country's largest maker of scooters and
motorcycles.
While other business leaders have often allowed themselves to be swept up by
the social and political whirl of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta or Madras, Mr
Bajaj has lived next to his factory in Pune since 1965, an industrial city
three hours' drive from Bombay. Like his workers, he sent his three children
to the local school.
Born into a wealthy business family, brought up in Bombay and the holder of
an MBA from Harvard University, Mr Bajaj would have been forgiven for
deciding against life on the factory site. But he says he could not have
built Bajaj Auto into a world-class company any other way.
It is not an idle boast. Bajaj is one of the few large Indian companies
which competes successfully with the world's best. Among manufacturers of
two-wheelers, it ranks fourth, behind Honda, Suzuki and Kawasaki of Japan
and ahead of Piaggio of Italy, which belongs to Fiat.
Bajaj held its domination of the Indian market even though Piaggio and the
Japanese makers entered the country as long ago as the early 1980s. Most
recently its market share has been rising - to 49 per cent in the year to
March 1994.
With a market capitalisation equivalent to Dollars 1.4bn, Bajaj Auto is a
popular stock with foreign fund managers, who will have a further
opportunity to buy the shares when the company launches a Dollars 200m
Euro-equity issue later this year.
Bajaj is the biggest profit-earner in the Indian vehicle industry and posted
a 180 per cent increase in net returns to Rs1.45bn (Dollars 46.2m) on sales
which rose 27 per cent to Rs16.8bn.
Mr Bajaj says that the company is well-placed to take advantage of the
economic liberalisation which started three years ago. He argues it is
important for the government to create conditions under which some Indian
companies can become multinationals.
Mr Bajaj last year joined a meeting of leading businessmen called the Bombay
Club, which lobbied for industry-friendly economic policies but which was
accused of being protectionist. Mr Bajaj rejects the allegation, saying
government should support the entry of foreign investors but should also
encourage domestic companies. 'Some Indian companies must become
world-beaters,' he says.
Bajaj is free of the messy diversifications which encumber many leading
industrial groups. Under the 'licence raj', the system of industrial control
which is now being dismantled, socialist-inclined governments placed
ceilings on the investments any one company could make in an industry, in a
futile effort to curb large-scale private enterprise.
Groups chased growth by expanding into several industries at a time - often
with poor results. But Bajaj stayed with making motorcycles. 'We stuck to
our knitting,' says Mr Bajaj. 'and we always will.'
Bajaj, which started manufacturing two-wheelers in 1961 under licence from
Piaggio, made 900,000 last year and plans to produce around 1.8m vehicles by
the year 2000. Its models, including scooters, motorcycles and three-wheeled
auto-rickshaws, can be seen in almost every city and town in India.
They are cheap - costing Rs17,000 to Rs20,000 for the most popular models -
inexpensive to run and easy to repair. Mr Bajaj says: 'Indians are more
interested in economy than in performance.'
Cost control remains of paramount importance to Mr Bajaj. Price is the main
weapon in battle with Japanese makers, both in India and, increasingly,
abroad in developing countries. Exports, now less than 5 per cent of sales,
are planned to rise to 15 per cent, with big gains expected in China,
Vietnam and Mexico.
Mr Bajaj says the company he most admires is Honda. But he says Bajaj Auto
is now too big a rival for Honda or any other Japanese maker to consider a
partnership. Bajaj last year held talks with Piaggio over a joint venture in
India and worldwide collaboration with a possible exchange of equity. But
these failed, so Bajaj is on its own in two-wheelers.
The company's main aim in the next two years is to up-grade its models,
including introducing new engines which will conform with tough new
pollution laws which India is introducing in 1996.
The only diversification Mr Bajaj will consider is the production of other
kinds of vehicles. In 1987, he tried and failed to buy control of Ashok
Leyland, the lorry producer.
Recently he has revealed plans to manufacture cars. But he is not interested
in the modest moves made by other Indian groups to manufacture 10,000 or
20,000 vehicles a year in partnership with foreign collaborators. These cars
are aimed at the top end of the market. Mr Bajaj wants to produce cars for
the ordinary man - 50,000 to 100,000 cars a year in high-volume, low-cost
manufacturing. His model would compete with the Maruti 800, India's most
popular car which sells for less than Rs200,000.
Mr Bajaj has yet to set a timetable for his project or identify a foreign
partner.

John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which both Mr Kerry Packer's
Nine Network and Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher, have minority
stakes, yesterday announced a 19.8 per cent rise in operating profits to
ADollars 144.9m (USDollars 104.7m) for the nine months to end-March.
After-tax profits increased even more sharply, to ADollars 117.5m from
ADollars 47.4m. This was partly due to an ADollars 40.1m abnormal tax
benefit, but also to lower interest charges - down from ADollars 40.3m to
ADollars 27.3m.
Revenues increased by 8.7 per cent to ADollars 617.3m, while operating costs
rose by only 5.5 per cent to ADollars 455m.
The company said the improved results were 'mainly attributable to increased
advertising volumes, derived from improved trading conditions and modest
advertising rate and cover price increases'.
Classified advertising volumes for the Sydney Morning Herald rose by 8.8 per
cent, and for the Melbourne Age by 10.4 per cent. Display advertising
volumes were up by 12.4 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.
The company, which has been at the centre of a high-profile Senate inquiry
recently, added that trading results since end-March had 'continued to
reflect the improving economic conditions'. Profit projections for the year
to end-June were satisfactory. The Senate inquiry looking into foreign
ownership of the print media and, more specifically, the circumstances
surrounding the government's decision to let Mr Black raise his Fairfax
stake from 15 to 25 per cent, is to make an interim report early next month
and a final report by late September.
This essentially delays the final report, while a privileges committee
examines the Senate's powers to demand documents and whether the federal
court should play any role. The inquiry has sought certain Foreign
Investment Review Board documents relating to the various bids for Fairfax,
but members of FIRB have refused to hand these over.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bridge Oil rejects ADollars 294m
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bridge Oil, the Sydney-based oil and gas company, yesterday described as
'totally inadequate' a ADollars 294m (USDollars 211.5m) cash bid from Parker
&amp; Parsley, the Texan oil independent.
It recommended shareholders not to sell their holdings while directors
examined all options.
The board's rejection was widely expected, given that Mr Robert Strauss, the
company chairman, had earlier this month told shareholders that a proper
valuation of the company's US properties would imply a net asset backing for
the company of more than ADollars 1 a share.
Parker &amp; Parsley, which launched its offer on Wednesday, is bidding only 70
cents a share.
On the stock market, Bridge shares - which were already standing ahead of
the Parker &amp; Parsley offer price by Wednesday night - rose by a further 1
cent to 73 cents.
There has been speculation that Parker &amp; Parsley will be obliged to raise
its bid, or that other interested suitors may enter the fight.
In launching the bid, Parker &amp; Parsley said its stake amounted to 4.2 per
cent of its target's equity.
Bridge's exploration and production operations are split between Australia
and south-east Asia, and the US - with the Australian activities centred on
the Cooper, Surat and Carnavon Basins, and the US interests spanning five
states.
Expansion-minded US oil independents have shown growing interest in
Australian oil and gas producers.

Nampak, the South African paper and packaging group, increased after-tax
profit before abnormal items 10 per cent to R169.2m for the half-year to
March, compared with R154.1m for the same period a year ago.
Attributable income rose 15 per cent to R174.3m from R151.2m on the strength
of a one-off sale of some machinery. Turnover rose by only 3 per cent to
R2.38bn from R2.32bn, due to a decline in volumes and pressure on selling
prices.

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amcoal, the coal mining arm of South Africa's Anglo-American conglomerate,
benefited from increased demand from Eskom, the country's main electricity
supplier, which pushed attributable earnings before abnormal items up to
R255.7m (Dollars 71.6m) from R240.6m for the year ending March.
The earnings from Eskom helped offset a decline in export revenues resulting
from the weakness of the rand against the dollar. Overall sales increased by
3.9m tons to 45.5m tons, of which 31.3m tons went to the electricity
company, a rise of 3.1m tons.
Turnover at R1.92bn was slightly off last year's R1.94bn, largely as a
result of the lower cost of sales.
A dividend of 350 cents was declared.
Mr David Rankin, chairman, said that cost-containment for the year had been
excellent and average colliery working costs were down 0.4 per cent on last
year. He attributed the improvement to 'the more effective deployment of
labour and the benefits of more productive mining methods.'

<TEXT>
Citizen Watch, Japan's largest volume watchmaker, yesterday reported a sharp
drop in full-year taxable profits, due to declining sales and a prolonged
fall in capital investment.
Pre-tax profits fell by 36.8 per cent to Y10.6bn (Dollars 1.03bn) in the
year to March, easily wiping out the previous year's small rise, on turnover
down by 7.4 per cent to Y233.7bn.
Net profits fell by 36.5 per cent to Y6bn.
Citizen warned that the outlook for demand was sluggish, while price
competition and the yen's value were 'unpredictably difficult'.
The group strengthened plans to cut costs and streamline production over the
year and will continue to do so in 1994.
It expects sales this year to fall further, to Y215bn.
Watch sales, just under half total turnover, fell by 4.9 per cent to
Y113.6bn, on a 9.7 per cent rise in unit production to 204.8m watches,
implying a sharp contraction in margins.
Titanium watches and watches linked to J-League professional soccer did well
in Japan, but the yen's sharp rise produced poor export results.
Information equipment and parts, just under 30 per cent of sales, saw a 6.8
per cent fall in turnover to Y69.5bn.
Notebook computers and printers performed well after cost reductions and
product improvements, but sales of floppy disk drives declined.
Electronic equipment sales fell by 6 per cent to Y33.4bn, dragged down by
poor performances in liquid crystal displays and portable televisions.
Aggressive marketing for industrial machinery failed to stimulate demand,
with many industrial companies burdened with surplus production capacity. As
a result, that sector's sales fell by 23.7 per cent to Y13bn.
Citizen will maintain its dividend at Y9 per share, which is just over twice
covered by earnings of Y19.2 per share, down from earnings per share of
Y30.65 in the previous year.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pakistan restarts state
disposals - Success could spark sales of the top utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pakistan government's current offer to sell up to 15 state-owned
factories, part of a plan to sell up to 31 factories in the coming months,
is the first serious effort to put life back into the country's
privatisation programme, which came to a virtual halt early last year.
The government delayed the programme amid fears that investors would be put
off by the deadlock in government which ended only with fresh national
elections last October.
The businesses being offered now include four cement factories and another
eight factories which manufacture ghee, a blend of oils for cooking. If they
are sold, only 20 of the 118 factories selected for privatisation more than
three years ago would be left waiting to go on the block. The 67 sold so far
have realised almost Rs9bn (Dollars 308m).
Although some of Pakistan's foreign donors have urged Islamabad to opt for a
broad-based ownership through public flotations on the stock market, the
current batch of 31 factories are all designed to be sold in open auction to
either local or foreign investors.
Senior privatisation officials say that more than half of these factories
have been running at a loss, making it difficult for any public offer to
attract large numbers of investors. But if the government succeeds in
selling them, many officials responsible for running the privatisation
programme hope that the sale of some of the country's largest and most
lucrative utilities will get under way.
These utilities include Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) which
could be worth up to Dollars 9bn, and the thermal power generation units of
the largest power company, Water and Power Generation Authority, which could
be worth up to Dollars 5bn.
The government also wants to privatise Karachi Electricity Supply
Corporation, Pakistan's second largest power generation company, serving the
city of Karachi. Another two large gas companies, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
and Southern are also being prepared for sale.
However, many critics say that the privatisation programme, which is now in
its fourth year, has lost momentum through bureaucratic resistance to
change.
There have also been objections from some of Pakistan's four provincial
governments, which say they should receive a share of the money raised by
privatisations.
Yet more objections have come from the armed forces, who have objected to
the sale of the PTC on the grounds that transfer of the telephone company's
ownership into private hands would jeopardise the country's security
interests.
Those objections were resolved recently when the government agreed to spend
part of the money raised from the phone company to set up a new phone
network for the exclusive use of the armed services.
The government also wants to remove fears of nationalists who are worried
over the implications of transfer of ownership to foreign investors. 'We
have come to a point in the world where it has become one big global market
and the old nationalistic concerns cannot become a hindrance any more in
development of economies', says Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of the National
Privatisation Committee.
Other officials say that safeguards under consideration include the
appointment of new consumer protection authorities, which would monitor
issues such as tariffs to prevent any immediate price rises. Other proposals
include those of requiring new owners to appoint only Pakistani nationals as
chief executive officers in the case of selective utilities such as the PTC,
even if the ownership is transferred into foreign hands.
Despite such preparations, some businessmen are worried over the pace of the
programme. Some officials agree privately that the largest utilities could
take between three to five years for detailed assessment of their real
worth, and finalising terms of the sale, before they are offered.
'If the programme is slow . . . it would be quite easy for investors to look
elsewhere. After all, there are other countries which are giving good
incentives too,' warns leading Karachi businessman. chi.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: China to broaden B-share market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to increase listings of B shares denominated in dollars for
foreign investors in an effort to enliven its depressed stock markets,
China's top stock regulator said yesterday.
Mr Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC), told an international business seminar in Beijing that the B-share
market was too limited and steps were being taken to expand issues.
China was also considering allowing enterprises that had floated B shares to
issue American depositary receipts (ADRs) and convertible notes.
This move would be aimed at 'activating transactions' and 'raising more
capital'.
At the end of 1993, some 42 enterprises had issued B shares on China's two
fledgling stock markets. This had raised some Dollars 1.2bn for the
companies involved.
China's A- (domestic) and B-share markets have suffered steep declines since
their highs of early last year. Many local investors have deserted the
A-share market for bonds or futures. Foreign traders, after an initial burst
of enthusiasm, had until early this year found China-related stocks on the
Hong Kong market more appealing.
China stock regulators and market managers have been striving to boost the
markets, but have encountered little success largely because of a widespread
loss of confidence among investors who were unprepared for a prolonged
downturn.
Mr Liu indicated that China would press ahead with an increasingly ambitious
programme of overseas listings. 'Chinese enterprises have a tremendous
demand for capital . . . it is an important task to fully make use of the
Hong Kong and other markets to speed up economic development,' he said.
The Chinese official said overseas listings were at a 'testing stage'. Seven
Chinese companies among nine selected for listing had been floated on the
Hong Kong market.
Another 22 enterprises had been selected for listing abroad either in Hong
Kong or in New York.
Mr Liu did not provide a timetable for these listings, but some are expected
to go ahead this year.
Mr Liu said China favoured listing foreign companies on its own securities
markets, but a number of steps were required before this would be possible.
These included further refinement of China's laws and regulations, and full
convertibility of the Chinese yuan.
Lack of convertibility was a similar impediment to the unification of the A
and B-share markets.
'If foreign companies and investors cannot freely remit their renminbi
abroad, it is meaningless for them to issue stocks in China,' Mr Liu said.

Daiwa House, one of Japan's biggest housing construction companies,
yesterday posted pre-tax profits down 13.7 per cent to Y75bn (Dollars
721.2m) from Y87.1bn for the year to March.
The results, the first set to be published by a Japanese construction
company for the last financial year, significantly undershot analysts'
forecasts. The profits fall was in spite of recent strong growth in housing
starts.
The group declined to explain the profits shortfall, which was about 5 per
cent below expectations. However, Mr Takashi Hashimoto, construction analyst
at CS First Boston in Japan, said Daiwa House, normally viewed as a house
building company, was also exposed to the general construction market which
has been badly affected by Japan's longest and deepest post-war recession.
About 40 per cent of the group's turnover was in this sector, he explained.
'The downturn in general construction offset any benefits from the upturn in
housing starts,' he said. 'However, groups such as Sekisui House, National
House and Sumitomo Forestry are less exposed to general construction than
Daiwa House.'
The group's turnover rose 1 per cent to Y935bn from Y926bn. Post-tax profits
fell 9.6 per cent to Y40.5bn from Y44.8bn, or from the per-share equivalent
to Y84.63 from Y93.69.
The group said it would maintain its dividend of Y17 per share for the
current financial year.
Daiwa House predicted modest increases in profits and sales growth for the
current year. Pre-tax profits should reach Y85bn, and post-tax profits
Y45bn, equivalent to Y94.02 a share. Turnover should be Y1,000bn, it
forecast.
Mr Hashimoto warned the predictions were highly optimistic.
Daiwa's shares fell Y10 to Y1530 in a rising market yesterday. Sekisui
House's shares fell Y30 to Y1290.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits and telephone equipment
formerly owned by British Telecom, had a tough fourth quarter, Reuter
reports from Toronto.
Net profit for the three months to March 25 fell to CDollars 4.8m (USDollars
3.5m) or 3 cents a share, from CDollars 11.9m or 14 cents a year earlier.
Revenues for the period increased to CDollars 145.2m from CDollars 118.1m
previously.
Gross margins eased in the quarter due to non-recurring stock write-offs and
higher manufacturing costs as well as an unfavourable product mix in its
semiconductor business.
The performance for the full year improved, however, with net earnings
climbing to CDollars 20.7m, or 16 cents a share, from a profit of CDollars
2.6m, or a loss of 1 cent per share.
Sales for the year were CDollars 496.4m against CDollars 423.4m with gross
margins rising to 45 per cent from 44 per cent.
'Our efforts will continue in the area of cost control as we focus on R&amp;D
and market development in line with Mitel's strategy,' said president and
chief executive Mr John Millard.
Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales fell by
1.0 per cent in the year as a whole.
Mitel's order backlog was CDollars 86.6m at the end of fiscal 1994 against
CDollars 81.5m a year earlier.

<TEXT>
AlliedSignal, the US high-technology group, is to buy Lycoming Turbine
Engine, a manufacturer of engines for regional aircraft, from Textron for
Dollars 375m in cash.
The deal solidifies its position as a leading global manufacturer of small
turbine engines.
The purchase is the largest of several acquisitions by AlliedSignal since Mr
Lawrence Bossidy took over as chairman in 1991 and began a restructuring
which has greatly improved the group's financial and share-price
performance.
Mr Bossidy said the deal was a 'major step forward in the growth of our
aerospace business and furthers our strategy to increase the sales of our
core businesses and strengthen them with top quality acquisitions'.
AlliedSignal's aerospace division claims to be the largest producer of
engines for business jets and small regional aircraft. It had sales last
year of around Dollars 1.3bn.
Lycoming, with 1993 sales of around Dollars 620m, makes turbofan engines for
larger regional aircraft - the fastest growing part of the airline industry
 -as well as for helicopters, tanks and hovercraft. Its engines are used on
aircraft such as the British Aerospace BAe 146 regional aircraft and
Textron's Bell AH-1S Cobra helicopter. It has 2,900 employees and plants in
Connecticut, Texas, and Luton, England.
The acquisition will extend AlliedSignal's products into the 70- to 115-seat
regional aircraft market, and the company says it will make it the leading
global supplier in this sector, as well as engines for heavy helicopters,
tanks and light vessels.
Mr Daniel Burnham, president of AlliedSignal's aerospace division, said the
two businesses were complementary, with no product overlap, and that
significant cost-reductions would be possible through rationalisation of
duplicate operations. The new business would also have a broader research
and development base.
Lycoming suffered a 'significant' decline in both revenue and income last
year, according to Textron's annual report. It blamed lower US government
and commercial business. However, Mr Burnham said the company would
contribute immediately to AlliedSignal earnings and would not be dilutive.
Textron, which makes aircraft and automotive components, said the sale was
in line with its strategy of aggressively managing its systems and
components business.
Mr James Hardymon, chairman, said its focus would continue to be on
expansion of its commercial and industrial manufacturing operations. The
proceeds of the sale would go to general corporate purposes, including
debt-reduction, equity repurchases and new acquisitions.

First-quarter losses at Thomson Corporation, the Canadian publishing and
travel group, deepened to USDollars 63m, or 11 cents a share, against a loss
of USDollars 59m, or 10 cents, last time.
It blamed slack demand in the travel market during the winter. Newspapers,
however, remained profitable, with better advertising in North America.
The final loss was struck on revenues of USDollars 1.12bn against USDollars
1.07bn. Seasonal weakness in many operations usually bring losses in the
first quarter.
The group, which is one of biggest tour operators in the UK and includes
Britannia Airways, had an operating loss of USDollars 34m against a loss of
USDollars 29m.
The newspaper division, which encompasses 116 dailies and 43 weeklies in
North America and regional publications in the UK, posted an operating
profit of USDollars 32m against USDollars 30m. The Toronto Globe and Mail
showed a 5.2 per cent gain in advertising lineage. Thomson said national
advertising was improving across North America.
Textbooks and services to UK newspapers had an operating loss of USDollars
23m against a deficit of USDollars 19m.

Telmex

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government has sold its final stake in Telefonos de Mexico, the
national telephone utility, in a convertible offering worth up to Dollars
550m.
The offering brings to an end the privatisation of Telmex, the largest
public company sold by a developing country. The privatisation began at the
end of 1990 when the government sold a controlling 20.4 per cent stake for
Dollars 1.76bn. It continued with a series of big equity offerings in
international and domestic markets.
The most recent Bank of Mexico annual report indicated the government had
obtained Dollars 6.18bn from previous offerings of Telmex equity. The
convertible would bring the total sale to around Dollars 6.73bn.
The government sold peso bonds convertible into Telmex equity 90 days after
the issue. They can be redeemed by the government between the third and
fourth year. The peso interest rate is 11.25 per cent, and conversion price
is 15 per cent over the current share price of Telmex.
In spite of the volatility in Mexico's financial markets, the offering sold
relatively well, according to one participant. In part, this was because an
11.25 per cent peso interest rate is considered relatively generous, as is
the 15 per cent conversion premium.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the deputy finance minister, said the Dollars 550m
obtained from the convertible offering would be placed in the government's
special contingency fund. In the past, money from the contingency fund has
been used to retire public debt.
The additional resources now available to the government may help calm
investors nervous about the political and economic situation in the run-up
to the August election.

settlement

<TEXT>
Mr Oded Aboodi, a financial adviser to Time Warner, the US entertainment
company, has agreed to pay more than Dollars 900,000 to settle insider
trading complaints raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Aboodi, who did not admit or deny guilt, was one of the closest advisers
to Mr Steve Ross, the free-wheeling entrepreneur who died in December 1992
after building the company into the world's largest entertainment business.
The SEC said yesterday that, in May 1991, Mr Aboodi caused two family
partnerships to sell common stock in Time Warner while he held negative
inside information concerning a rights issue approved by management.
Time Warner's share price slumped following announcement of the rights
issue, which was unpopular with investors.
Mr Aboodi consented to an injunction against future security law violations
and an order to disgorge Dollars 413,700, as well as a civil penalty of the
same amount and interest of Dollars 103,677.
Time Warner yesterday declined to comment on the matter, but said Mr Aboodi
continued to advise the company.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Chemical Bank expands in
mortgages with Dollars 330m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chemical Banking is to acquire Margaretten Financial, a New Jersey-based
mortgage banking company, for Dollars 25 a share, or a total of Dollars 330m
in cash.
The acquisition of Margaretten is part of Chemical's strategy to build on
its nationwide consumer financial services business, and become a bigger
force in the business of originating home mortgages, and servicing existing
mortgages.
For banks in the mortgage industry, a servicing business can help offset the
negative impact on origination volume of rising interest rates, as well as
produce a steady stream of fee income.
After the acquisition is completed, probably by mid-summer, Chemical will be
the fourth-largest originator of mortgages in the US, with volume of about
Dollars 26.3bn, and the fourth-largest company servicing mortgage loans,
with volume of about Dollars 54.5bn.
Mr Felix Beck, chairman of Margaretten, said of the deal: 'We believe this
transaction provides our shareholders with the enhanced value we have been
seeking since our initial public offering in January 1992.'
The New Jersey company, which has 78 retail offices and 11 wholesale offices
in 25 states, was a subsidiary of the diversified financial services group
Primerica before going public in 1992 through a share issue.
That issue valued the company at just over Dollars 300m.
Last year, Margaretten reported revenues of Dollars 245m, but made only a
small profit. This was because a rise in the number of customers refinancing
their mortgages forced it to increase amortisation charges in order to write
down the value of some portfolios.
News of the deal was fairly well received on Wall Street. Shares in
Margaretten, which have fallen as low as Dollars 12 3/8 in the past year,
rose Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 24 5/8 , while Chemical stock rose in
morning trade before closing unchanged at Dollars 33 3/8 .

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Surge at Gap bucks US trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gap, the US casual-wear retailer, shrugged off the poor apparel sales
affecting other US stores to report a 53 per cent jump in net profits, from
Dollars 41.5m to Dollars 63.5m, for the first quarter to April.
The San Francisco-based company attributed the improvement mainly to better
margins, largely resulting from a switch to more feminine-looking clothes
for women in its main Gap stores.
The number of stores opened rose from 1,319 to 1,398 at the end of the
quarter. Of these, 848 were Gap, 179 Banana Republic, 324 GapKids and 47 Old
Navy Clothing Co or Gap Warehouse. Outside North America, it had 44 stores
in the UK and three in France.
Total sales rose 17 per cent to Dollars 752m, while sales at stores open a
year earlier rose 7 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 29 cents to 44
cents.
Gap said one factor behind the improvement in margins was the reduction in
promotional activity compared with last year's quarter. This meant more
goods had been sold at the full price, it said.
More significantly, the company had a good response to its shift away from
unisex, basic clothing such as T-shirts and jeans to more gender-specific
merchandise, particularly for women. The stores now stock more skirts,
dresses and embroidered tops.
Gap has also launched a retailing format called Old Navy Clothing Co for
shoppers who find the group's other stores too expensive. It will gradually
replace the Gap Warehouse chain.

First-quarter losses at Thomson Corporation, the Canadian publishing and

of USDollars 59m, or 10 cents, last time.
It blamed slack demand in the travel market during the winter. Newspapers,

The final loss was struck on revenues of USDollars 1.12bn against USDollars

year.
The group, which is one of biggest tour operators in the UK and includes
Britannia Airways, had an operating loss of USDollars 34m against a loss of
USDollars 29m.
The newspaper division, which encompasses 116 dailies and 43 weeklies in

profit of USDollars 32m against USDollars 30m.
The Toronto Globe and Mail posted a 5.2 per cent gain in advertising
lineage, and Thomson said national advertising was improving across North
America.
Textbooks and services to UK newspapers had an operating loss of USDollars
23m against a deficit of USDollars 19m.
Brascan, a key Edper-Bronfman holding company, reported a first-quarter net
profit of CDollars 15.2m (USDollars 12.5m), or 14 cents a share, against
CDollars 137m, or CDollars 1.38, a year earlier. The figures include a
CDollars 210m special gain on the sale of John Labatt shares. Excluding
special gains, the 1993 quarter loss was CDollars 73m.
Brascan said the gains came mostly from the resource units. Pulp and base
metals prices rose significantly.
The group plans expansion to offset last year's disposal of its main
holdings in MacMillan Bloedel and Labatt. It continues to control Noranda,
Canada's biggest resource group.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fiat passes payout after record
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the Italian industrial group, yesterday announced the biggest loss in
its 95-year history, and decided not to pay a dividend on ordinary shares
for the first time since 1947.
The worldwide economic downturn, in particular in Fiat's core automotive
market, drove the group into a net loss of L1,783bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in
1993, compared with a profit of L551bn in 1992.
However, the group pointed to signs of recovery in the first quarter of
1994, when it recorded a profit of L30bn, compared with a loss of L222bn in
the equivalent period.
Sales rose by 11 per cent to L14,750bn in the first three months of this
year, and the company has drawn hope from faint signs of an upturn in the
car market.
'The task which faces the group in all its elements will continue to be
extremely severe (in 1994),' Fiat said yesterday, although the group placed
hope in its technological strength and cost-cutting.
The Milan stock market had largely discounted the possibility of heavy
losses before yesterday's announcement, which was made after the close of
trading. Since the beginning of the year, Fiat's shares have been among the
best performers on the Milan market as investors have speculated on a
recovery and the early success of the group's new Punto range of small cars.
Fiat's shares closed at L7,068 yesterday, down 1.1 per cent on the day.
Fiat's operating losses reached L839bn last year, compared with a profit of
L237bn in 1992. The central operating division, Fiat Auto, lost L1,756bn,
having only just broken even the previous year. Losses deepened at Iveco,
the truck and industrial vehicle subsidiary, to L501bn, compared with a 1992
loss of L122bn.
The company said it would ask shareholders at their annual meeting in June
to approve a potential increase in the group's maximum nominal share capital
to L10,000bn from L5,000bn. The group stressed this did not mean it was
planning to raise more cash immediately, but explained that last year's
complex rights issue, which raised L5,000bn, took the company up to the
limit of its issued share capital.
The net loss of L1,783bn, recorded after taxes of L340bn and heavy interest
charges, was slightly better than many analysts had predicted, but it was
flattered by an extraordinary gain of L300bn on the sale of the company's 58
per cent stake in La Rinascente, the Italian retailer, last autumn. However,
Fiat pointed out that the divestment of La Rinascente had deprived the group
of profits and turnover and worsened its debt position.
Group turnover in 1993 was stable at L54,556bn compared with L54,640bn.
Fiat's net debt increased to L5,247bn on December 31, 1993 from L3,849bn at
the end of 1992.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers Squibb buys German
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the second largest US pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday joined dash for corporate deal-making in the drugs industry by
buying a 25 per cent stake in Azupharma, a German drugs manufacturer.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.
Azupharma specialises in the manufacture of generics, unbranded drugs that
have lost their patent protection. It is a subsidiary of German drugs
wholesaler Gehe which had sales in 1993 of DM10.2bn (Dollars 5.9bn).
'This investment is an important strategic move in the European healthcare
environment,' said Mr Joachim von Roy, Bristol-Myers Squibb's European
president.
'It represents the beginning of an alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Gehe. We are now well-positioned to develop a strong generic presence across
Europe.'
The generics market in Europe is 'expected to grow substantially over the
next five years', said Bristol-Myers Squibb, as a result of changes in
healthcare spending and patent expiries on several big selling prescription
drugs.
The deal is Bristol-Myers Squibb's first stake in a European generics
producer. The two companies began a business relationship March when
Bristol-Myers Squibb licensed a generic version of its biggest selling drug,
heart treatment Capoten, to Azupharma for the German market.
The move reverses a recent trend for German companies to buy into US
generics manufacturers. In February, Bayer, the German chemicals group, paid
Dollars 310m for a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a
privately-owned generics company based in Florham Park, New Jersey.
Acquiring generics companies serves two purposes for a drugs manufacturer.
It is an entry into a rapidly growing part of the healthcare sector and it
may help protect market share when patents expire.

<TEXT>
Economic recovery in Spain helped Repsol, the leading domestic energy group,
to lift its first-quarter after-tax profits by Pta26.2bn (Dollars 187m) to
Pta46.471bn.
This was an 11.6 per cent increase compared with the first three months of
1993.
Repsol, which is 41 per cent state-owned, said that increases of 1 per cent
and of 3 per cent in petrol and in diesel consumption respectively, together
with a depreciation of in the peseta and improved margins in its chemical
unit, had helped to offset the impact of lower crude prices and reduced fuel
demand during a mild winter.
The group, which lifted its 1993 net profit by 11.4 per cent to Pta80.1bn,
said that it would propose a dividend of Pta115 per share, a 10.6 per cent
increase on 1993, to shareholders at the annual meeting in June.
The first-quarter results - which were slightly ahead of forecasts - and the
increased payout will fuel market interest in a possible international
offering of Repsol shares later this year. The government, which is seeking
to reduce its public deficit, is considering offering up to 20 per cent of
its Repsol equity on the stock markets. Last year, the government raised
Pta110bn when it relinquished its majority ownership of the group with a 13
per cent placing of its Repsol equity that was aimed at institutions.
Repsol is also expected soon to announce the acquisition of Enagas, the
fully state-owned monopoly supplier of industrial gas, by Gas Natural, the
big domestic gas distributor in which Repsol has a 45 per cent stake.
Repsol, which had hoped to finalise the deal last month, is still smoothing
out the final details of the takeover.
The acquisition of Enagas will make Repsol the chief shareholder of one of
the biggest natural gas companies in Europe.

the same period last year.
The group said the result was in line with expectations.
For the full year, the group maintained its forecast that profits would
increase relatively faster than the 11 per cent advance in 1993.
First-quarter sales were up by 14 per cent to DKr3.13bn from DKr2.75bn.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers Squibb buys
generics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol-Myers Squibb, the second largest US pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday joined the drugs industry dash for corporate deal-making by buying
a 25 per cent stake in Azupharma, a German drugs manufacturer.
Azupharma specialises in the manufacture of generics, unbranded drugs that
have lost their patent protection. It is a subsidiary of German drugs
wholesaler Gehe which had sales in 1993 of DM10.2bn.
The value of the deal was not disclosed.
'This investment is an important strategic move in the European healthcare
environment,' said Mr Joachim von Roy, Bristol-Myers Squibb's European
president.
'It represents the beginning of an alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Gehe. We are now well-positioned to develop a strong generic presence across
Europe.'
The generics market in Europe is 'expected to grow substantially over the
next five years', said Bristol-Myers Squibb, as a result of changes in
healthcare spending and patent expiries on several big selling prescription
drugs.
The deal is Bristol-Myers Squibb's first stake in a European generics
producer. The two companies began a business relationship March when
Bristol-Myers Squibb licensed a generic version of its biggest selling drug,
heart treatment Capoten, to Azupharma for the German market.
The move reverses a recent trend for German companies to buy into US
generics manufacturers. In February, Bayer, the German chemicals group, paid
Dollars 310m for a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein Pharmaceutical, a
privately-owned generics company based in Florham Park, New Jersey.
That deal followed the Dollars 546m acquisition last November by German
chemicals giant Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley, a US generics and
over-the-counter drugs maker.
Acquiring generics companies serves two purposes for a drugs manufacturer:
it is an entry into a rapidly growing part of the healthcare sector and it
may help protect market share when patents expire.
Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing the expiry of patents on Capoten around the
world. The drug is an Ace-inhibitor, the newest type of heart drug which
faces strong competition from Merck, the biggest US drugs company, and the
UK's Zeneca, formerly part of ICI.
Capoten's global sales last year were worth Dollars 1.8bn, according to
stockbroker Lehman Brothers. This figure is likely to fall sharply after
patents expire in its biggest market, the US, next year.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hungarian bank plunges into
deficit after charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kereskedelmi Bank, Hungary's second largest commercial bank, plunged to a
Ft46bn (Dollars 450m) loss in 1993 after taking a heavy charge for bad
loans.
The state-owned bank reported an operating profit of Ft9.3bn for the year to
December but a Ft55.3bn provision for non-performing loans dragged the bank
down to a record deficit, equivalent to 1.4 per cent of national gross
domestic product.
The loss left Kereskedelmi with a capital deficit that required a Ft33.4bn
injection from the state last December just to bring the bank to a capital
adequacy of 0.02 per cent of risk-weighted assets of about Ft125bn.
Even a top-up of Ft5bn to be agreed at the annual meeting next Monday will
lift the capital adequacy ratio to only 4 per cent, still well below the 8
per cent level recommended by the Basle-based Bank for International
Settlements.
The bail-out, part of a Dollars 3bn government programme to shore up 10
leading banks, came after the World Bank, in an internal memo, warned that
Kereskedelmi Bank, Magyar Hitel Bank, the largest commercial bank, and
several others had negative capital and were 'technically insolvent'.
Kereskedelmi suffered, like other large Hungarian banks, from a wave of
failures among its corporate borrowers after Hungary put into effect
western-style bankruptcy legislation in 1992. Hungary's banks began last
year to calculate loans by international standards, revealing the poor
quality of their assets and requiring a large one-off increase in reserves.
However, Kereskedelmi is particularly exposed to an agricultural sector hit
by confusion over property rights and drought. Under Mr Geza Lenk, the
managing director, Kereskedelmi has been slower than counterparts such as
Budapest Bank in making provisions against default by clients. Kereskedelmi
Bank reported a 1992 loss of just Ft1bn.
The privatisation authorities last year named Hambros, the UK merchant bank,
to advise on the privatisation of Kereskedelmi Bank. But, after last year's
losses, management has delayed a move into the private sector for another
two years and advisers say Hambros's mandate is a 'sleeping contract'.
Kereskedelmi Bank is reported to be looking to dilute its stake in Ibusz
Bank, a small institution specialising in currency exchange and
hard-currency deposits.
Of the Hungarian state-owned banks, only Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank (MKB)
and Budapest Bank are moving quickly towards privatisation.
Bayerische Landesbank of Bavaria is taking a 25 per cent stake in MKB, a
foreign trade bank, which was advised by JP Morgan, the US investment bank.
In parallel, the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is acquiring a 17 per cent shareholding.
Management at Budapest Bank, advised by Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank, is also pushing hard for private investors.
Austria's Creditanstalt Bankverein has strong ties with Budapest Bank and a
focus on eastern Europe. Analysts identified it as the most likely bidder.
But it is understood that Creditanstalt's board has decided against a bid,
preferring to concentrate on development of its own Hungarian subsidiary.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ras seeks funds as profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Riunione Adriatica Sicurta, the Italian insurance company, is to seek
permission from its shareholders to raise funds for further expansion,
particularly outside Italy.
Ras, which is controlled by Allianz of Germany, yesterday announced a
recovery in net profits for 1993, in spite of an increased tax burden. The
company's net profit rose to L187bn (Dollars 110.5m) in 1993, compared with
L95bn in 1992, when Ras had to write down the value of its government bond
holdings.
Net group profits increased to L355bn from L117bn, and group premiums rose
to L8,465bn against L7,337bn.
The company is proposing an increase in the dividend this year to L340 from
L300 per ordinary share, and to L400 from L360 for savings share.
Shareholders, meeting on June 29, will be asked to give the board a
five-year mandate to increase the company's nominal share capital by up to
L1,000bn.
Mr Umberto Zanni, chairman, said the group was 'interested in overseas
(expansion), particularly in those countries where Ras has a strong
presence'. The company was well-placed to build on its holdings in Portugal,
Spain, Switzerland and Austria, he explained.
Ras said it would try to even out the disparity between the market
performance of its savings and ordinary shares, by offering savings
shareholders the right to convert one out of every 10 savings shares they
hold into an ordinary share.
If the plan is approved and acted on by all savings shareholders, Allianz's
holding will be diluted to just over 50 per cent from 52.74 per cent of the
ordinary shares.
Mr Zanni said he would step down as chairman at the June shareholder
meeting, although Allianz has asked him to remain as a director. He will be
replaced by Mr Angelo Marchio, one of three managing directors of the group.
The company pointed out that in 1992 it was forced to write down investments
by L221bn, cut to L38bn in 1993. But the tax burden increased last year to
L236bn from L49bn at parent company level.
Mr Zanni said 1994 was likely to be a challenging year, particularly because
of impending liberalisation of tariffs in compulsory motor insurance.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Olivetti poised for growth, says
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian computer group, is entering a new growth cycle, Mr
Carlo De Benedetti told shareholders yesterday.
Mr De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman, told the group's annual meeting that
revenues increased by 6 per cent in the first four months of 1994, and
orders by 11 per cent, compared with the equivalent period last year.
Shareholders approved the issue of up to 250m shares as part of a
convertible bond issue which will raise a maximum of L575bn (Dollars 3.4bn)
for expansion. The issue, aimed at international institutional investors, is
likely to be launched before the summer, through an international consortium
led by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank.
One of the main targets for funding will be the development of the GSM
cellular telephone network in Italy. Olivetti heads the international
Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium which in March won the licence to operate
the network.
'(Olivetti) is preparing to reap the benefits of a sweeping structural
reorganisation,' the group said yesterday. Last year, Olivetti lost L465bn,
compared with a loss of L650bn the previous year, but increased sales for
the first time since 1990 and cut net debt to L798bn from L960bn.
Developing the GSM network is expected to cost the Omnitel-Pronto Italia
consortium L3,000bn, of which Olivetti will provide roughly a third. This is
in line with its stake in the joint venture, which includes Bell Atlantic
and Pacific Telesis of the US, Mannesmann of Germany and Lehman Brothers.
Within the last month, Olivetti has also set up a Dollars 280m stand-by
credit facility with a group of international and Italian banks. Mr De
Benedetti said the combination of the capital-raising exercise and the
organisation of the stand-by credit confirmed 'the great confidence of the
international financial community in Olivetti'.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: New auditor for Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Computer Holdings, the Berkshire-based computer services company,
yesterday said it had asked KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditor, to resign over a
fee dispute.
The company will announce in the next few days the name of a replacement
'Big Six' firm of accountants which has agreed to carry out the audit for
considerably less than KPMG's proposed fee.
Mr Les McNeill, chief executive, said: 'We had a dispute over fees that
became rather prolonged. I felt we were being significantly disadvantaged
and it was time to part ways. We had a fiscal and a moral responsibility to
our shareholders.'
He said KPMG had originally agreed to an audit fee for the current financial
year and then added a further 30 per cent. The firm also wanted to charge an
additional Pounds 12,000 for the previous year's audit.
The increases brought the proposed audit bill to about Pounds 80,000.
KPMG's filing at Companies House states the reason for the resignation was:
'We have not been paid in full for agreed outstanding invoices nor have we
been able to agree to audit fee for the year ended March 31 1994.'
Mr McNeill said he believed the KPMG fee should have been lower, given the
substantial restructuring of the company in the last few months which should
have simplified the audit.
He stressed that he had no criticism of the firm's skills or
professionalism, but that 'right now this company watches cost, cost and
cost.'

Lower interest payable, down from Pounds 1.66m to Pounds 1.32m, lifted
pre-tax profits of Northern Leisure, the discotheque, ten-pin bowling and
amusement park concern, to Pounds 1.03m for the 26 weeks to February 27,
compared with Pounds 682,000 previously.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 11.7m. Earnings per share were 3.4p
against 2.4p and directors intend to recommend a final single dividend of at
least 1p. Thereafter it is intended that interim and final distributions
will be paid in May and November.
The group proposes to raise some Pounds 4.8m, net of expenses, by way of an
underwritten issue of Pounds 5.4m nominal of convertible debenture stock
1996-2001 at par, initially yielding 8.25 per cent.
The directors have agreed with a consortium, comprising Royal Bank of
Scotland, National Westminster Bank and Bank of Scotland to provide new loan
and overdraft facilities initially amounting to Pounds 21.8m.
These are conditional upon the issue of the debenture stock proceeding.
Directors stated that if all the conditions of both the facilities and issue
were not met by July 19, the new banking facilities would not come into
effect.

Rubicon Group has made one acquisition and two disposals.
It has conditionally agreed to buy Beeley Wood Holdings, a manufacturer of

with the sale of Chiltern Retail Systems, which makes moving belt check-out
systems, to Wagon Industrial Holdings for Pounds 4m.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury buoyed by interest cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shaftesbury, the property investment company, reported pre-tax profits
sharply higher at Pounds 1.28m for the six months to March 31, against
Pounds 344,000. The main factor was a Pounds 720,000 fall in net interest
charges to Pounds 1.4m.
Earnings per share benefited from a tax refund of Pounds 427,000, coming out
at 3.5p (1.2p). There is no interim dividend, but the capital reduction
during the period will enable a final payment to be recommended.
Sales of properties were lower at Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 1.97m) as turnover
fell to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 5.22m).

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome drug ready for approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinical trials on a drug being developed by Centocor, a US biotechnology
company, and the UK drugs company Wellcome have been successful, according
to research published today in the medical journal The Lancet.
The trials were phase III, the latest stage, and Wellcome will submit the
drug for approval in June in Germany, where research was carried out.
Further trials are likely to be conducted in the US before submission for
approval there, said Wellcome yesterday.
Stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimates the potential market for the drug,
Panorex, at up to Dollars 100m a year.
Panorex was used in 189 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, alongside
conventional surgery.
The researchers found that the drug extended life and postponed the return
of the disease.
Colorectal cancer has a high survival rate if caught early, but the death
rate increases rapidly if the diagnosis is late.
Wellcome owns almost 5 per cent of Centocor as the result of a deal last
November in which Wellcome paid Dollars 100m for the stake, some
technologies and in staged payments as research proceeded.
They can be made in a laboratory to attach themselves to specific parts of
the body such as cancer tumours and then activate the body's defence
mechanisms.
They have many uses, but as an anti-tumour agent they have had a patchy
success record.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ECC reveals demerger details - Camas
expected to be valued at between Pounds 230m and Pounds 260m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Details of the stock market launch of Britain's fifth largest aggregates
company, with sales last year of Pounds 365.2m and net assets of Pounds
224.4m, were announced yesterday by English China Clays, which is demerging
its building materials business.
Dealings in Camas - an acronym of Construction, Aggregates, Materials and
Services - are to start on June 1, if the demerger is approved by
shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on May 31.
They are being offered one Camas share for every ECC share currently held.
ADR holders will also receive Camas shares.
Mr Malcolm Brown of James Capel, the brokers, said yesterday he expected
Camas shares to open at 75p to 85p, valuing the company at between Pounds
230m and Pounds 260m.
The company initially had been looking for an opening value approaching
Pounds 300m, before the recent slide in construction and building material
share prices.
Camas last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11m (Pounds 6.4m), generating
notional earnings per share of 3.03p after allowing for a 16 per cent tax
charge due to beneficial deferred taxation arrangements.
A more normal tax charge of 27 per cent would have produced earnings of
2.6p.
Mr Alan Shearer, Camas chief executive, said a total dividend of at least
3.75p was planned this year.
Assuming an 80p opening price, this would put the shares on a yield of
nearly 6 per cent and an historic p/e of 30 on the higher tax charge.
At the end of December, Camas had net debt of Pounds 66.7m, representing
gearing of 29.7 per cent. Net debt is expected to have risen to Pounds 88m
when the demerger is completed.
Four fifths of total sales were achieved in Europe, mostly in the UK. The
company also operates in the US in Colorado, Minnesota and North Dakota.
Europe generated profits of Pounds 9.9m before central overheads,
representing 4.9 per cent of sales of Pounds 292m. This compared with
margins of 17 per cent in 1989, when the UK construction market was at its
peak.
US profits, however, have improved, helped by the construction of a large
new airport at Denver, rising to Pounds 8m, equivalent to 10.9 per cent of
sales of Pounds 73.2m. This compares with margins of 4.4 per cent, producing
profits of Pounds 1.1m in 1989.
Mr Shearer said markets on both sides of the Atlantic were recovering. The
company's prices in the UK had been increased by an average of between 5 and
7 per cent in March, while sales volume in the UK was expected to rise by 1
per cent this year.
The company, in addition to producing aggregates, manufactures concrete
products and is a leading asphalt contractor in the UK.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: French Connection mounts recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of French Connection Group rose 14p to 169p yesterday after the
USM-traded fashion clothing company mounted a strong profits recovery,
writes Graham Deller.
On turnover ahead 35 per cent to Pounds 63.9m, the pre-tax line for the 12
months to January 31 amounted to Pounds 5.14m, against losses last time,
restated for FRS 3, of Pounds 133,000.
Mr George Wardale, chairman, said: 'Our strong brands (French Connection and
Nicole Farhi) performed well in difficult markets which, along with a strict
control of costs, resulted in the return to profitability.'
The retail environment was 'still demanding', he added, although summer
collections had been well received and winter order books for both labels
were ahead of the previous year.
UK sales improved to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 29.97m) with good performances in
both wholesale and retail operations.
Turnover in the US jumped from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 20.7m - reflecting the
addition of two more stores in New York and significantly higher wholesale
business.
After tax at an effective rate of 31.5 per cent and minorities, earnings per
share emerged at 17.3p, against losses last time of 4.5p.
Directors said a dividend would be considered 'when the accumulated profit
and loss account returns to credit'.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: CLS for market with Pounds 110m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLS Holdings, the property company controlled by the Swedish Mortstedt
family, is offering new shares at a 15 per cent discount to net asset value,
reflecting growing competition and falling demand for property flotations.
The company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 110m when it floats
later this month, compared with its adjusted net asset value of Pounds 129m.
By comparison, the property sector is currently trading at around asset
value, having held a 20 per cent premium earlier this year.
CLS is competing with companies such as Argent and London Capital Holdings.
Other property flotations this year have not fared well.
CLS has responded to this. It is offering 45.04m new shares at 111p through
a placing and intermediaries offer representing 46 per cent of the enlarged
company.
The shares offer a notional yield of 5.5 per cent, which is extremely high
for the property sector.
CLS was set up by brothers Sten and Bengt Mortstedt in 1983, when the family
sold its property interests in Sweden and refocused on the UK. It sold close
to half its portfolio around the peak of the market in 1989, and has been
aggressively building it up since early 1993.
About 97 per cent of CLS's properties are within the M25 area, the exception
being a property in Dusseldorf.
CLS will have net debt of some Pounds 155m after the flotation, bringing
gearing back down to 120 per cent.
The offer, sponsored by UBS and Apax Partners, closes at 12am on May 23.
COMMENT
In a sector stacked with new contenders fighting for investor attention, CLS
has only one significant feature to make it stand out from the crowd: its
price. At a 14 per cent discount to the sector, and a yield of 5.5 per cent,
it seems cheap. The more complex issues like where does the company go from
here, and why should the Mortstedt's float it at this price, remain
unanswered. But the family are not selling a single share, and are taking
half their dividend in scrip for the next three years. With that level of
confidence from the backers, the shares look attractive.

<TEXT>
Rothmans International has given up its attempts to create an Asian holding
company to attack the Chinese and Japanese cigarette markets.
It said yesterday that there were no immediate prospects of presenting new
proposals for the creation of such a company to the boards of its separately
quoted subsidiaries in Malaysia and Singapore.
Its plan to merge these companies with its north-east Asia operation were
thrown out by the local shareholders in Rothmans (Malaysia).
The group said it was committed to the development of its north-east Asian
markets which would be financed from its own resources. A new management
team has been recently established in Hong Kong with responsibility for the
Asia region.

placing

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company, is to be listed on
the London and Dublin stock exchanges from next Thursday following a placing
of 3.3m shares at 250p per share.
The company is raising IPounds 6m (Pounds 5.86m), but according to Mr Jim
Flavin, chief executive: 'The primary objective of the flotation is to
obtain a listing. Raising capital is a very secondary matter.'
With 72.6m shares in issue after the placement DCC has a market
capitalisation of IPounds 182m.
Earlier this week DCC announced pre-tax profits up 49 per cent to IPounds
22.4m for the year to March 31.
The group is focused on five divisions. Including associated subsidiaries,
its energy division, comprising LPG and gas distribution and waste oil
recycling, contributed 39 per cent of profits last year, its food division
27 per cent. Two others, print and publishing and computer products
distribution, contributed a further 27 per cent.
Mr Flavin said the group's strategy was to manage risk through 'spread and
financial prudence. We are long-term in our thinking and believe that strong
businesses are built over the long haul'.
Mr Flavin founded DCC as a venture capital company in 1976 with capital of
IPounds 180,000. The focus shifted to an industrial holding company in 1990.
On last year's earnings per share of 19.56p the flotation gives an historic
p/e of 12.8. This compares with an historic p/e for industrials in the Irish
market of 17.8, and an overall market p/e of 15.1.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scudder trust to raise further Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark, the US fund management group, has so far raised
Pounds 50m with the launch of its first UK investment trust.
Scudder has been an investor in Latin America for some time, and already
manages 10 US funds specialising in the area.
However, as the group is not familiar in the UK retail market, the Scudder
Latin American Investment Trust has been marketed only to institutions.
Scudder is now offering another Pounds 10m each through a further placing
and intermediaries offer, closing on May 27.
The fund was the fourth Latin American trust to hit the London market this
year, following funds from Edinburgh Fund Managers, Morgan Grenfell, and
Templeton. Mr Dan Pierce, chairman of Scudder, said the result of the launch
was 'very gratifying in what have been difficult market conditions'.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Rank Org shares fall following lacklustre
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rank Organisation lost 15p to 403p yesterday after the leisure
company issued a trading statement described by one analyst as 'lacking
sparkle'.
The company said it has had a 'satisfactory first half so far, and there are
continuing indications that leisure spending in the US and UK is likely to
be at higher levels than in 1993'.
In spite of bad weather in the US, which contributed to a slight decline in
profits from its Hard Rock restaurant business, trading results up to the
middle of April were ahead of last year. The film and television division
had performed 'particularly well'.
But Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at brokers Smith New Court, said that
holiday bookings and the marginal increase in bingo turnover were 'a little
disappointing'.
Although holidays sold for the first half were up 12 per cent, bookings for
the second half were only 2 per cent ahead, in line with a slowdown in the
total holiday market.
Mr Jones held his full-year profit forecast at Pounds 335m but BZW trimmed
its prediction by Pounds 10m to Pounds 322.5m before exceptionals.
Mr Peter Hillier, BZW's analyst said: 'Once again the growth is coming from
Rank Xerox which has been an incredibly strong performer.'
In spite of difficult market conditions in Europe, Rank Xerox's results for
the first quarter to January were 'significantly' higher than last year. Its
underlying revenues increased by 6 per cent before adverse exchange rates
with UK sales up by over 10 per cent.
Rank's interim figures will include a Pounds 62m charge, representing the
group's share of the restructuring costs announced by Xerox in December, and
a Pounds 50m provision for the closure of its US video distribution
business.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Euromoney seeks Pounds 20m for purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euromoney Publications is raising Pounds 20m through a placing to pay for
two acquisitions, refinance another and provide finance for further
purchases.
The publisher and training and conference organiser also reported pre-tax
profits for the six months to March 31 up 52 per cent at Pounds 9.01m
(Pounds 5.94m). Turnover rose 85 per cent to Pounds 35.9m, which included
Pounds 423,000 from acquisitions.
The shares rose 125p to Pounds 18.25p.
The company, the ultimate holding company of which is Rothermere
Investments, is buying an indirect 30 per cent interest in Lingua Franca, a
programming training and consultancy company and 49 per cent of Adhesion et
Associes, a French business convention company.
It is also refinancing the acquisition of 80 per cent of Engel Publishing
Partners, bought in March for an initial Dollars 1.32m (Pounds 880,000) and
further payments to a maximum of Dollars 7.5m.
The issue price and number of shares will be fixed no later than May 18
after presentations have been made to possible investors.
Euromoney is paying Dollars 1m for the Lingua Franca stake, which will be
increased to 50 per cent at a cost of Dollars 700,000 next year. Mr Michael
Sobol, director of a Euromoney associate, is making the same investments as
Euromoney, which will hold a put and call option on the stake.
In the year to March 31 1994 Lingua Franca reported operating profits of
Dollars 515,000 on turnover of Dollars 4.38m.
The consideration for the holding in Adhesion will include an initial
FFr24.5m (Pounds 2.9m). Further profit-related payments to a maximum of
FFr130m will be made over the next three years taking the holding to 100 per
cent. However, directors estimate the total cost should be FFr63m.
For 1993 pre-tax profits were FFr6.5m.
Three companies, AIC, DC Gardner and Century House, made initial full
contributions of Pounds 1.98m to operating profits and Pounds 12.4m to
turnover at Euromoney. Excluding these, turnover rose 21 per cent with
operating profit up 36 per cent.
Earnings per share were 28p (19.5p) and the interim dividend is raised to
13p (10.5p).

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kenyan tea yield helps Finlay rise to
Pounds 13.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A higher yield from its Kenyan tea plantations helped James Finlay, the
overseas trading and financial services group, to lift profits by more than
36 per cent last year.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 13.8m on turnover of Pounds
184.4m, up from a previous Pounds 165.2m.
Mr Richard Capper, deputy chairman, said that the group's tea production in
Kenya last year was 22.3m kg following good weather conditions in the early
months of last year and improvements in husbandry.
This was a marked improvement on 1991 and 1992, when production amounted to
20m kg.
The increase was behind a rise in operating profits from plantations from
Pounds 8.78m to Pounds 11.3m.
The trading, manufacturing and merchanting activities trebled operating
profits from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 3.33m on the back of increased activity
in the tea trade.
Operating profits in the confectionery and beverage manufacturing division,
which makes Paynes Poppets and supplies all Sainsbury's own label tea and
coffee, were down slightly at Pounds 3.94m, compared with a previous Pounds
4.21m.
Mr Capper attributed the decline to the difficult UK market for
confectionery, and the costs of a TV advertising campaign for Poppets.
The merchant banking and international trade confirming division moved from
a loss of Pounds 436,000 to a profit of Pounds 447,000.
The oil and gas activities in North America fell into the red to the tune of
Pounds 2.55m, compared with a previous profit of Pounds 310,000, mainly as a
result of lower prices and increased depreciation charges.
The tax charge rose from 52.8 per cent to 62.2 per cent, reflecting the
losses in the US, for which there is no relief, and currency losses in
Kenya, where the tax rate is higher than the UK.
Earnings per share were up from 4.7p to 5p.
An unchanged second interim dividend of 2.15p maintains the total for the
year at 4.15p.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Tomkinsons shares fall 11% to 280p
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkinsons, the carpet manufacturer, saw its shares fall 11 per cent after
reporting pre-tax profits down from Pounds 430,000 to Pounds 332,000 in the
six months to April 2.
The shares fell 35p to 280p.
The company said that there had been considerable volatility in the carpets
market and concerns about increases in personal taxation had depressed
consumer sentiment.
The trading outlook remained difficult, the company added, and the full year
trading was expected to be below that of last year.
Turnover was Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 10.4m). Earnings per share were 3.6p
(4.7p).
The interim dividend is being maintained at 3.5p.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Regal Hotel plans four more purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regal Hotel Group, the USM-traded provincial hotel operator, is set to
almost double in size via the planned purchase of four more hotels for
Pounds 9.5m.
To partly fund the acquisitions, Regal is proposing to raise about Pounds
11m by way of a placing and open offer of 628.57m new ordinary shares, 47.4
per cent of the enlarged capital, at 1 3/4 p.
Some Pounds 6.4m of the proceeds will be used to satisfy part of the
purchase consideration with the balance being satisfied by bank debt of
Pounds 3m and the issue of 5.71m new shares.
The remaining proceeds will be set aside to fund the acquisition of a
further hotel and to provide additional working capital.
Of the placing and open offer shares 312.5m have been placed firm by
Guinness Mahon with institutions and other investors, while 316.07m have
been placed subject to a clawback by ordinary shareholders on a 7-for-15
basis.
Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman, said the acquisitions represent further
progress in Regal's strategy of assembling a chain of 3 star provincial
hotels in commercial locations.
Regal is paying Pounds 1.65m for the Time Out Hotel at Blaby, near
Leicester, Pounds 3.5m for the Hillcrest Hotel, Widnes, Pounds 3m for the
Hall Garth Hotel, near Darlington, and Pounds 1.35m for the Cumbrian Hotel,
Carlisle.
The acquisitions increase the total number of hotels owned by Regal to nine.
A further two are operated under management contract.
Dealings in Regal's shares were suspended at 2p yesterday. They are expected
to resume on June 10, following completion of the placing and open offer and
shareholders approval of the purchase.

</HEADLINE>

Shares in Melville Group were suspended at 4 1/2 p yesterday after the
exhibition services and interior fittings company warned that it was in
talks which might lead to the sale of a substantial part of its business.
In November, the company reported pre-tax losses for the year to June 30 of
Pounds 1.18m, against a restated Pounds 18.6m deficit.
The result was after a fall in exceptionals and provisions from Pounds 12.7m
to Pounds 930,000.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Saloons set for showdown - The choices
facing GrandMet's pubs joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the customary blizzard of detail accompanying Grand Metropolitan's
interim results yesterday, there was one notable omission.
The market had half hoped for news on how GrandMet aimed to tackle one of
the most troublesome parts of its business: Inntrepreneur Estates Limited,
its pub joint venture with Courage. Instead, the official statement
contained just one line: 'IEL reached break-even for the half year, in line
with expectations.'
Given that IEL is by far the UK's biggest publican, with 6,500 pubs valued
at Pounds 1.7bn, this might seem a pathetic result. Quite the contrary,
according to Mr David Tagg, the GrandMet director in charge of IEL.
Everything is going to plan.
When it was formed in 1991, IEL was deliberately loaded with debt by its two
owners. It has lost money ever since.
'When we set it up,' Mr Tagg said yesterday, 'we said we would break even in
1994-95. We've done that. We also said we would consider with Courage what
to do when we got there. We're doing that now.'
Mr Tagg would not be drawn on various market rumours, such as a planned
management buy-out or the flotation of a couple of thousand pubs as a wholly
new company.
'There are a range of options,' he said. 'We can go anywhere from retaining
the whole business to getting out. Refinancing is an option somewhere in the
middle.'
And how long will the decision take? 'That's very hard to say. Not weeks: it
might be months - maybe years' (probably within the year, according to his
boss, GrandMet chief executive George Bull).
There is no doubt that GrandMet wants out: or, as Mr Tagg put it
diplomatically, 'IEL does not fit GrandMet's strategic profile.'
The snag is that Courage presumably wants out as well.
Its parent, the Australian brewer Foster's, is not flush with cash, and has
recently made clear that its ambitions lie not in Europe, but in the nearer
and faster-growing markets of Asia Pacific.
A further snag is that the two partners suffer from an inherent conflict of
interest.
As a pure pub operator, GrandMet will naturally aim to push its rents as
high as possible. This puts pressure on the individual publican to raise
beer prices, thus reducing sales. This is bad news for Courage, which
supplies beer to more than 4,000 of the pubs.
The contract for that supply lasts until the end of March 1998. Presumably,
Courage would like to extract itself from the venture in a way which left
the contract in place. This, says Mr Tagg, is not impossible. 'All these
issues are in the melting pot. It's all for discussion.'
Besides making no money, IEL has an image problem.
According to its rivals, the estate is in poor shape, with a long tail of
small and grotty pubs. Mr Tagg disputes this.
'We've disposed of almost 1,000 pubs since we started the joint venture,
largely at the tail end,' he said yesterday. 'The estate is now in pretty
good shape. I would say there isn't much of a tail compared with the other
major estates.'
The whole saga illustrates the continuing effect of the changes imposed by
the government on the beer industry in 1989.
Five years on, the industry is less stable than ever. As long as IEL's 6,500
pubs overhang the market, it is hard to see that changing.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter makes Dutch purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jarvis Porter, the specialist label printer, yesterday announced plans to
acquire three Dutch labelling companies for Fl 48.6m (Pounds 17.4m) from
Nederlandse Grafische Groep.
The deal came as the group reported a 43 per cent increase in full year
pre-tax profits, buoyed by earlier domestic acquisitions. Earnings increased
by 28 per cent to 14.6p (11.4p) and the final dividend is raised to 3.55p
making a total for the year of 5.2p (4.7p).
The proposed acquisition will be funded by a rights issue of 7.56m shares at
230p and provides Jarvis Porter with an important foothold in the
continental European label printing market. The shares closed 1p lower at
274p yesterday.
The rights will be on the basis of one new ordinary share for every 4.24
shares held and is subject to shareholders' approval at an extraordinary
meeting on May 31.
NGG reported pre-tax profits of Fl 8.05m (Fl 7.81m) in 1993 on turnover of
Fl 45.2m (Fl 43.9m).
Of the three operating companies, Peha Etiketten makes high quality
self-adhesive labels for the toiletry, cosmetics, food and household
products sectors, Jeka Speciaaldrukkerij en-Uitgeverji supplies the fast
turnround market for self-adhesive labels and Drukkerji Zwart specialises in
the production of heat seal labels used to seal the outer wraps of vacuum
packed coffee.
Mr Paul Jarvis, chairman, commenting on the acquisition, said it would
strengthen the group's position in the primary labels market and represents
a further step in the international development of the group.
'It continues our strategy of augmenting growth in existing businesses by
selected acquisitions in specific niche markets within the print and
packaging sector,' he said.
Jarvis's results for the year to February 28 highlighted the success of this
strategy to date. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 6.83m.
Turnover grew by 40 per cent to Pounds 55.6m (Pounds 39.7m) including Pounds
7.74m from the acquisition of Dolphin in Lewis and Irwin Packaging in
Cardiff at the start of last year.
The two acquisitions contributed Pounds 951,000 to operating profits which
increased by 48 per cent to Pounds 7.05m (Pounds 4.76m) and operating
margins improved to 12.7 per cent (12 per cent). Profits were slightly
reduced by net interest costs of Pounds 217,000, compared with receipts of
Pounds 24,000 a year earlier.
COMMENT
The NGG deal looks good. The self-adhesive label business is the fastest
growing segment of a fragmented, but expanding market and the acquisition
should enable Jarvis to supply an enlarged multinational customer base.
Jarvis is buying growing businesses which operate on healthy margins and the
price looks fair. With pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10.3m forecast for
this year, producing earnings of 18p, the shares are trading on a reasonable
forward multiple of 15.2. Although the rights offer is the third since 1991,
it deserves support.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Warner Howard up 16% and sees further
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner Howard, the hot air hand dryer and laundry equipment company,
overcame a 4 per cent decline in turnover to report its eighth consecutive
year of profits growth with a 16 per cent advance at the pre-tax level.
Mr Ernie Hazell, managing director, said he was confident the current year
would show further growth. The rate of business failures, which hit the
group hard in 1993, had slowed noticeably in recent months.
The final dividend 'which is a sign of that confidence' is increased by 15
per cent to 5.04p, for a total 12 per cent higher at 7.31p. Earnings
benefited from a lower tax charge to advance 21 per cent to 21.07p.
Warner Howard, which boasts 75 per cent of the UK market for rented laundry
equipment, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 5.91m to Pounds 6.84m in
the year to February 28, on sales Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 22.2m. Operating
profits of Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 5.92m) included profits of Pounds 112,000
(Pounds 337,000 losses) from discontinued activities.
The drop in turnover reflected the absence of a Pounds 1m contract in 1993
to sell laundry equipment to hotels in the former Soviet Union. Mr Hazell
said the profits on that contract had been so slim that the absence of the
business had not affected profits.
The rentals division, which supplies laundry, hygiene and catering
equipment, remained 'the engine of growth', with sales 7 per cent ahead at
Pounds 13.5m giving operating profits of Pounds 6.7m, a rise of 12 per cent.
The lower margin equipment sales division suffered a Pounds 1.2m drop in
turnover to Pounds 5m and operating profits halved from Pounds 400,000 to
Pounds 200,000.
The service division showed a 19 per cent drop in sales to Pounds 3.7m, with
profits falling from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 700,000.
Mr Hazell said the group was seeking to be more active on the acquisition
front, in particular to build its hygiene and catering equipment divisions.
Warner Howard had already completed its first purchase this year, paying
Pounds 1.02m for a hygiene rental portfolio.
The purchases would almost certainly be funded through either cash flow or
by gearing up the balance sheet. Warner Howard has net cash of Pounds
600,000.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Start-up costs behind Pounds 6.6m Flextech
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATRINA LOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flextech, the USM-traded cable and satellite television group, yesterday
reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.62m in the 12 months to December 31 1993
on turnover of Pounds 6.77m.
The operating loss of Pounds 6.26m was mainly due to start up costs
associated with the launch of the Family Channel and duplicated satellite
costs.
Directors said comparisons with 1992 were not possible as the group was
reorganised via a reconstruction in July of that year.
Flextech has undergone further changes in the current year, including the
merger with the European programming assets of United Artists European
Holdings.
Under the deal, Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television
operator, becomes Flextech's controlling shareholder.
The enlarged company becomes the biggest cable and satellite channel
operator in the UK after British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake.
Flextech has since added terrestrial broadcasting to its portfolio through
the acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in HTV, operator of the Wales and
west of England Channel 3 licence.
Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman, said income from satellite and cable
subscribers would form the most important revenue stream over the next few
years.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brewin Dolphin raising Pounds 6.6m via
share offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brewin Dolphin, the private client stockbroker, will raise Pounds 6.6m from
a forthcoming share offer, which will also include the sale of about 15 per
cent of existing employee shareholdings, writes Simon Davies.
The flotation is expected to value the brokerage at between Pounds 30m and
Pounds 35m, against the Pounds 6m price of its management buy-out two years
ago.
Trading for the four months to April 8 has been ahead of budget and up from
the previous year. In 1993, it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.52m,
excluding exceptional write-offs.
The issue is sponsored by Charterhouse Bank and pricing will be announced on
May 26.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Laying proper foundations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wave of property companies have joined the stock market in recent months.
But in the wake of the worst post-war property recession, few have been able
to claim a particularly distinguished record.
However, Argent has few qualms in claiming such a background. 'The Argent
team has anticipated changes in the property market correctly and acted
decisively,' the prospectus says.
Argent bases its claim on three shrewd decisions taken over the past five
years. It reduced its development exposure when the market peaked in 1989.
It bought investment properties at the bottom of the market between 1991 and
1993 and it bought the Brindleyplace development site in Birmingham in the
summer of 1993, shortly before a marked recovery in prime development land
values.
The other factor that distinguishes Argent, in the eyes of some analysts, is
the quality of its management. 'There are only two management teams (of the
property companies joining the market) worth backing, and this is one of
them,' says Mr Alec Pelmore of Kleinwort Benson.
Argent was founded in 1981 by Mr Michael Freeman, aged 42, and Mr Peter
Freeman, 38, sons of Mr David Freeman of DG Freeman, the City law firm, and
joint chief executives.
They began by assembling sites, winning planning permission and selling the
package on to an institution or property company. Sometimes they would carry
out developments themselves or with a joint venture partner. By 1989, Argent
was involved in 20 developments.
But the property market was becoming overheated and in April 1989, Argent
took the decision to get out. As a result, it now proudly states, it lost a
mere Pounds 1m on its development programme and never missed an interest
payment.
Two years later, it believed that property values had fallen so low that the
time was right to re-enter the market. In July 1991, it established a joint
venture with Warburg Pincus, a US venture capital company. Over the next two
years, it bought 16 investment properties at a total cost of Pounds 136m.
In June 1993, it turned its attention to development land and bought
Brindleyplace.
The company puts a heavy emphasis on having sufficient income from
investments to cover interest payments and administration costs. Its income
stream is already secure. About 85 per cent of its income will, barring
defaults, be secure for more than 20 years.
Although the investment portfolio can be expected to benefit from a
resumption in rental growth, Argent is unlikely to be generous in its
payment of dividends. Some analysts also believe that short term growth
prospects could be cramped by the full valuations that have been placed on
its properties, particularly at Brindleyplace.
Nonetheless, the company is likely to get an enthusiastic reaction from the
City when it joins the stock market.
'It is the most entrepreneurial of the newcomers,' says Mr Chris Turner of
BZW, the brokers. 'It is an issue which, even in today's market, will go
well.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dissidents win control of Andrews Sykes
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dissidents led by Mr Jacques Murray yesterday finally won control of the
Andrews Sykes board after shareholders at an adjourned extraordinary meeting
voted Mr Murray and four of his supporters onto the eight-man board.
Mr Murray, who holds a 29.67 per cent stake in the specialist industrial
services group, has waged an 18 month battle for control of the board. He
has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with Sykes' performance.
An earlier move by Mr Murray, who is also chairman of Nu-Swift, the fire
protection group, to unseat Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and take control of
the board in October 1992 failed because of lack of institutional support.
Yesterday shareholders decided on a majority vote by proxy to appoint Mr
Murray and his nominees to the board. They also decided to remove Mr Stuart
Ross, finance director, and Mr David Crowe, an independent director, from
the board. However, a proposal to remove Mr David Martin, Sykes' recently
appointed chief executive, was rejected.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo confirms Algerian discovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the independent exploration and production company under threat from
a hostile bid by Enterprise Oil, yesterday confirmed the discovery of
potentially big reserves in Algeria, writes Robert Corzine.
The announcement was made on the eve of Lasmo's expected publication of its
defence to the Enterprise bid.
Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer, said reserve estimates for the three
discoveries in the Hassi Berkine oil field amounted to 324m barrels of oil
and natural gas condensate. There was a possibility that as much as 900m
barrels could be recovered.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Halkin expects to return to dividend list
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Halkin Holdings, the former Hoskins Brewery recently taken
over by Mr Howard Hodgson, the funerals entrepreneur, are likely to receive
their first dividend in more than five years by the end of 1994.
Mr David Moffat, finance director, said yesterday the group expected to pay
a dividend which showed a yield of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent on the
shares in December. Yesterday's closing price of 61p, a rise of 2p, would
imply a net pay-out of roughly 1.2p.
Hoskins Brewery has had a chequered past, with several attempts by
discontented shareholders to remove management. Mr Hodgson bought into the
company last year, aiming to transform it into a mini-conglomerate. Mr
Moffat said the group would pursue acquisitions this year.
Halkin revealed its first set of results since the takeover and the Pounds
15m rights issue-funded purchase of two businesses - Ronson, the lighter and
household aerosol group; and Clifford, which supplies branded goods to the
duty-free market. Both business had met their profits targets of Pounds 1.5m
and Pounds 1m respectively.
The results, which cover only Hoskins Brewery as the other divisions were
bought after the year-end, showed a Pounds 998,000 loss for the nine months
to December 31, on sales of Pounds 478,000.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Costs and taxes restrain ADT net income to
Dollars 27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group with operations
in North America, the UK and continental Europe, yesterday reported a small
increase in first quarter net income held back by higher interest costs and
taxes.
Net income for the the three months to March 31 rose from Dollars 26.2m to
Dollars 27.1m (Pounds 18.5m) while earnings per share slipped to 18 cents
(20 cents). The shares closed 20p down at 585p.
The decline in earnings per share reflected a higher deferred tax charge and
finance costs together with an increase in the weighted average number of
outstanding shares as a result of the refinancing completed in the third
quarter last year.
Interest expenses jumped to Dollars 19.6m (Dollars 12.7m) while the income
tax charge increased to Dollars 6.6m (Dollars 4.2m).
Sales increased by 5.6 per cent to Dollars 348.8m, compared with Dollars
330.4m, fuelled by the continued growth in sales and installation of
residential security systems, and increased dealer consignment business at
vehicle auctions.
Operating income grew 20 per cent to Dollars 55.2m with electronic security
services at Dollars 32.8m (Dollars 27.4m) and vehicle auction at Dollars
24.2m (Dollars 20.5m).

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Argent property shows Pounds 23.6m increase
in value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brindleyplace, a Birmingham development site bought last June by Argent
Group, a property investment and development company, for Pounds 3m has been
revalued at Pounds 26.6m.
The valuation of the site, which has planning consent for 1.1m sq ft of
offices and 330,000 sq ft of retail space, excludes a parcel of residential
land, which Argent has sold for Pounds 2m.
The figures were shown in the pathfinder prospectus for Argent, which is set
to join the stock market with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 140m.
Argent also owns 16 investment properties, which were valued at Pounds
197.1m on March 31 and has exchanged contracts to buy another investment
property, valued at Pounds 13.3m.
The placing and offer will raise about Pounds 25m of new money.
The company has net assets before flotation of Pounds 123m and net debts of
Pounds 121m. Net assets per share have risen from 100.3p at the end of 1991
to 232.8p at the end of 1993.
In 1993, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 3.76m),
due to write-offs of interest rate hedging instruments.
Warburg Pincus, the US venture capital fund which owns 66 per cent of the
company, will reduce its holding to below 50 per cent. The management, which
own 16.6 per cent, do not intend to sell their shares.
Argent said it would not pay dividends until 'the board is satisfied that it
is in the interests of the group to do so'. Its principal objective is
growth in net assets per share.
