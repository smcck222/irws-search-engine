FT  28 JUN 94 / Technology: Death of a craft - Epoch-making changes are
afoot in the pre-press stage of printing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few aspects of modern life are so crucial and yet so taken for granted as
words on the printed page. Since the early days of printing, the technology
used to transfer ideas and images to paper has been fundamental to advances
in civilisation.
From the development of wood-block printing by the Chinese and various forms
of wooden and metal type by the Koreans and Japanese, to the movable type
pioneered in Europe by Johannes Gutenberg and William Caxton, the printed
word has stimulated culture, education and entertainment.
Today, in the multimedia age based on the enormous growth in computing
power, the printing industry is undergoing an upheaval comparable with any
of these epoch-making changes. Now that sound, text and pictures (from film
or photo-CD) can be handled digitally, printing companies are having to make
radical changes in the way they work.
Not only is the equipment changing rapidly, but the demands of customers
have also become tougher.
'I think another very dramatic structural change is about to occur,' says
Erwin Konigs, head of Linotype-Hell, the German maker of equipment for the
pre-press (text and picture preparation) stages of printing.
With the price of printing continuing to fall - he says it has been cut by
half in the past two or so years - and the tremendous pressure for work to
be done faster, 'the printing industry really has to rationalise'.
Konigs foresees the full computerisation of pre-press activity from the
creation of designs to the scanning of images, the manipulation of text and
pictures before they are put on film, and the making of pages ready for
printing.
Those at the industry's sharp end are feeling both the benefits and the
pressures of this surge of electronic innovation. 'We're at the beginning of
a new dawn of on-demand colour printing,' believes Joe Brim, head of
LaserBureau, a London printing company packed with the latest electronic
equipment. 'There's no mystique anymore.'
Traditionally, much of the skilled work involved in turning designs into
printed pages has been handed to specialists. This was, and still is to some
extent, especially true in the case of colour pictures and graphics.
Today, however, advanced software enables sophisticated artwork to be
carried out from desktop computers such as the Apple Macintosh.
For really high-grade products such as glossy advertising brochures, a wide
range of outside skills is still needed. But increasingly, superior quality
products can be produced from a range of electronic equipment - used to
scan, process, store and display images - integrated by special software
such as the PostScript system of California-based Adobe and available to
those printing companies willing to invest.
This is what Brim means by 'a new dawn'. With the advent of new printing
technology, products do not always have to be printed in large quantities to
be economically worthwhile. Also, because the information is in digital
form, each short print-run can be changed if necessary, or customised for
individual readers such as those being targeted by marketing companies.
'The world is going to short-run, on-demand colour printing,' says Brim.
Customers can now order a few hundred copies of any item they want printed
instead of having to take a thousand or more, as previously.
'These days,' says Tony Jarvis, head of Jarvis Field Press, 'things happen
so fast that it's frightening - with digital cameras, even more will
change.' This is because the images from these cameras, gradually coming on
to the market, will be able to go straight into the computerised network
without having to be scanned.
Jarvis, also in London, has not gone so far down the digital road as
LaserBureau. The company waited until last year, when prices had eased,
before buying its electronic scanning and image-setting equipment. When
finished, its investment will total around Pounds 500,000.
For the makers of equipment - especially that used in the pre-press stages
where Linotype, Agfa and Scitex of Israel are prominent - the digital age
has brought huge changes and opportunities. 'The software is now driving the
hardware,' says Alexander van Meeuwen, business group director for graphic
systems at the UK office of Agfa, owned by Germany's Bayer. 'The speed of
change in the graphic arts industry is phenomenal.'
As well as providing huge opportunities for printing companies, it also
poses a considerable threat. As the latest computer-based equipment allows
them to do more, or all, of the pre-press and printing work on their own
systems - many customers now send in jobs by disk or along ISDN (integrated
services digital network) lines - fewer companies will be needed.
'It has been a craft-based industry,' says Michael Austin, graphic systems
marketing director for Agfa in the UK. 'Everyone was specialised in a very
narrow field, so there are lots of very small businesses.' Thus he foresees
a concentration in the highly fragmented printing sector, with only those
companies able to invest in new equipment likely to survive.
But while he expects pre-press stages to disappear eventually as computers
control more of the stages up to the making of metal plates for final
printing, 'I believe we have a long way to go before heavy-duty printing
presses are replaced'.
Konigs reckons the pre-press industry will go in five to 10 years. 'The
prerequisite is technology that offloads those pretty complicated steps of
the human brain to the computer.' The brainpower has come from the
specialists; the technology is now advancing to a level where their colour
preparation and layout skills will increasingly become redundant.
He quotes the example of a printer on the US west coast who has two groups
of operators making up colour pages: those using traditional reprographic
skills earn Dollars 25 a hour, but a new employee doing everything by
computer earns Dollars 16.
Such 'de-skilling' is painful for those whose skills are being replaced
electronically but is an inevitable and already visible trend in a fiercely
competitive industry.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Technology: Smile, you're being digitalised - The prospects
for cameras that need neither film nor developing are assessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine it is 2005 and you have just returned from a holiday in Hawaii. You
have taken all your photos with no film; no developing is necessary. You
simply hook up the camera to your computer and begin looking at the pictures
on your screen.
It was cloudy while you were there, so you digitally add in some sun. You
did not make it to the volcano, but create a picture of yourself in front of
one, just for show. Then you modem the pictures to your envious brother in
Hong Kong.
This is the world that digital camera manufacturers are trying to create.
Professionals and businesses are already making use of the devices, which
can be cheaper than traditional cameras to operate and produce photographs
that can be manipulated easily.
Digital cameras are moving rapidly into the mass market, too. In March,
Apple Computer launched QuickTake 100, a digital camera aimed at the
consumer market, which retails for about Dollars 750. Two smaller
California-based manufacturers, Dycam and Logitech, have launched similarly
priced products. Sony of Japan already sells digital cameras, priced at
about Dollars 2,000 or more, to the professional and small business market,
and hopes to introduce a mass market version in the next few years.
'Digital cameras will replace a large part of the traditional camera market
over the next decade,' predicts Alexis Gerard, managing editor of Future
Image newsletter, an imaging publication. 'That's because ultimately it will
be cheaper to use - no film or developing costs are involved - and cheaper
to produce because the only moving part on the digital camera is the
shutter.
Digital cameras resolve certain storage problems as everything can be saved
on computer. They also allow images to be sent by modem easily from one
computer to another. 'Whenever you digitalise something, it becomes more
flexible,' says Charles Lee, chief executive officer of GTE, the
telecommunications group. 'You can store it, send it. For that reason,
digital cameras will eventually be an important part of the information
superhighway.'
Digital cameras do have drawbacks, however. The easy exchange of images
through the information superhighway depends just as much on the
construction of that network as on wide acceptance of digital cameras.
Moreover, as all 'ordinary' photographs can be digitalised, through the
extra step of scanning the image, traditional cameras can be made part of
the information superhighway.
Cost is also a barrier. Although the absence of film and developing expense
can make the digital camera cheaper in the long run, a hefty initial
investment is still required. The lowest priced digital camera is about
Dollars 750 - and that is before buying other hardware. Users must have
access to a computer that can read the digital images, and to a
sophisticated printer.
Images also need to be improved if digital devices are to pose a real threat
to the traditional camera market. 'One of the barriers to building the
market is the quality of the image,' says Michael Baron, vice president of
business systems for the digital camera division of Sony. 'With smaller
photos, most people can't tell the difference between the (traditional)
chemical and the digital product. But weaknesses are accented when you move
to larger sizes.'
Technology is moving rapidly to break down these hurdles. One of the most
expensive inputs in a digital camera is the cost of the chips, dubbed
'charge-coupled devices', and their price is coming down fast. 'We hope to
bring the price of a digital camera for the consumer market down to about
Dollars 350 within the next few years,' says Peter Zan, product manager for
Apple's QuickTake.
Dycam says its next model, to be launched early next year, will offer
features such as interchangeable lenses. Manufacturers are working to make
the camera compatible with a larger number of computers, and special
printers are being developed for the market.
The digital camera works in the following way. By pressing the shutter, the
user stores the picture in flash memory, and the image is compressed. The
camera is then connected to a computer through a cable. The picture is
decompressed and appears on the screen.
Despite problems, digital cameras are making inroads into the small business
market. The camera is especially cost-effective for photographs being
reproduced many times. Chemically developed images are expensive to
reproduce, but thousands of digital images can be run off cheaply. Estate
agents, for instance, could use the camera to provide photographs of houses
for mass mailings; and business cards with photographs can be made at low
cost.
Digital cameras are certain to encounter resistance in their push to replace
traditional versions. Consumers are used to the old film-based devices, and
will probably be reluctant to change. Professional photographers, morever,
have been trained in chemical processes and may have difficulties switching
to a technique that requires completely different skills, including computer
knowledge.
'The main hurdle right now is user acceptance,' says Sony's Baron. 'It is
very hard to change old habits, so we have to give people a very good reason
to do it. The technology has either to offer a price advantage that will be
hard to resist or produce something so superior that people will want to
switch to it. Those days may be here eventually, but they are not here yet.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Accounts guidelines 'must be balanced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry bodies developing specialist accounting guidelines must demonstrate
that their views are balanced and representative, under new rules unveiled
by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday.
Their ideas must be developed with due process and will be examined to
ensure that they do not contradict any fundamental points of principle in
current accounting standards or principles, said the standard-setting body.
Many organisations may be able to write so-called statements of recommended
practice (Sorps) which are not mandatory and are in too narrow an area to
justify formal standards.
Sorps must be ratified by the Accounting Standards Board, which said in its
guidance that it would provide a 'negative assurance statement' if it was
satisfied with new proposals.
The board has introduced two new committees to ratify the Sorps: the
financial sector and other special industries committee, and a second
specialising in the public and not-for-profit sectors.
Those independent bodies already recognised by the board to develop Sorps
include the Association of British Insurers, Association of Investment Trust
Companies, British Bankers' Association, Charity Commission, Finance and
Leasing Association and Oil Industry Accounting Committee.
The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals of the universities of the
UK yesterday issued its revised proposals for accounting guidelines in the
higher education sector.
The new Sorp recommends that land, buildings, equipment and furniture be
capitalised and included in the balance sheet at cost and valuation - in
contrast to the current practice in universities of immediately writing off
this expenditure. The change will affect balance sheets, boost information
on assets and introduce depreciation against the assets in the profit and
loss accounts of the higher education institutions.
The practice has long-standing precedents among UK companies and other
organisations but has traditionally been resisted by universities.
Institutions will be advised to disclose provisions for long-term
investment.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Regulator may be shifting on prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Offer, the electricity industry regulator, is showing signs of compromise in
talks with regional power companies over its plans for a tough regulatory
framework from next April.
However, the companies say the latest letter from Professor Stephen
Littlechild, Offer director-general, suggests there is still a wide gap
between his views on distribution prices and theirs.
'The general tone is that he is prepared to consider some of the problems
the industry has put to him,' said one chief executive. 'But he is still
being extremely stringent and our initial evaluation is that if he made his
final proposals now we would find them unacceptable.'
Some analysts expecting a compromise were also encouraged by remarks by
Norweb which reported annual results yesterday. Mr Ken Harvey, chairman,
said he could say nothing about the contents of Prof Littlechild's letter
but he confirmed that his company still expected to be able to offer real
dividend growth of 6 to 8 per cent annually until the end of the decade.
Some City houses believe Norweb would struggle to do so if the regulator
stuck to the tough line taken in his letter earlier in the summer which was
interpreted as suggesting distribution price cuts of up to 20 per cent
initially and rises of inflation minus 4 per cent in subsequent years.
Most analysts believe the final cuts will be less tough, although UBS
believes Prof Littlechild is unlikely to move significantly.
Prof Littlechild's letter of was faxed to companies on Friday evening amid
tight security precautions.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Gummer pressed on nature quango
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, is under pressure to disclose
whether directors of English Nature, the government's nature conservation
watchdog, face potential conflicts of interest with posts that they hold in
the private sector.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that he
had tabled a written parliamentary question to Mr Gummer, asking him to
outline the guidelines that exist for appointments to English Nature and
other Department of Environment quangos.
Mr Smith is raising the issue amid concern over the role of Lord Cranbrook,
a Conservative peer, who has been chairman of English Nature since 1991.
Lord Cranbrook is chairman of the environmental advisory board of Shanks and
McEwan, the waste disposal company, and has been a non-executive director of
Anglia Water since 1989.
Mr Smith said yesterday: 'I am sure there has been no specific conflict of
interest that has affected any decision at English Nature. But I want to
assure the public that this is the case.
'If it turns out that there are guidelines for such an appointment, I would
be interested to know what they are. If not, then that may be a cause of
concern.'
The government will shortly be putting fresh proposals to Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, to fund the Energy Savings Trust,
Mr Gummer said yesterday.
He told the environment select committee that the proposals would be 'very
detailed', and would be based on recommendations from a group he had set up
to look at the options. Last spring, Ms Spottiswoode startled the committee
by saying she did not think it was her role to impose a levy on gas
consumers to fund the trust, which is central to the government's strategy
to conserve energy and reduce harmful emissions.
He also said the UK would be able to exceed the target it has set itself to
return carbon dioxide emissions to their 1990 level by the year 2000.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Peers resist Lloyd's regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Henley, a government spokesman, told the House of Lords last night that
no case had been made for bringing any element of the Lloyd's insurance
market under the provisions of the Financial Services Act.
He resisted an amendment to the deregulation and contracting-out bill which
sought to end the self-regulation practised by Lloyd's under the terms of
private legislation approved by parliament in 1982.
Lord Williams of Elvel, who moved the amendment from the Labour front bench,
said there was a question mark over the future of Lloyd's as a result of
losses which could be attributed to incompetence and the failure of
self-regulation.
He said that if the amendment were approved it would put the insurance and
reinsurance activities carried out under the Lloyd's umbrella on a sure
footing for the future.
Lord Marlesford, the only Conservative peer who took part in the debate to
speak in favour of the amendment, described himself as a 'victim' of
Lloyd's. He said it was an act of myopia which had led parliament to grant
Lloyd's immunity from the Financial Services Act.
Lord Marlesford suggested that a future ruling by the courts could result in
the minutes of the Lloyd's council being disclosed and the extent to which
it had failed to protect Names being revealed.
He criticised the way in which Lloyd's had 'hypothecated' profits for 1994
to meet the losses of 1991.
He also called for an assurance that the Department of Trade and Industry
would discharge its responsibility for determining the solvency of Lloyd's.
Lord Williams withdrew the amendment, but indicated that he may return to
the issue at a later stage of the bill.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Nuclear Electric presents Pounds 1bn subsidy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity generation company, has
outlined an option for financing a new power station at Sizewell in Suffolk
which would require an initial government subsidy of up to Pounds 1bn.
The company says the subsidy would enable it to offer rates of return which
would attract private-sector investors to fund the remainder of the Pounds
3.5bn cost (in 1993 prices) of building the station.
The Pounds 1bn up-front payment is just one of a series of options for
building the 2,600MW station, the company has stressed in a series of
briefings with politicians on the government's nuclear review.
Other ways for the state to encourage the construction of Sizewell C with
largely private-sector finance could include continuing the nuclear levy on
electricity consumers after its planned expiry in 1998. According to the
company the amount needed would be less than a fifth of the total of more
than Pounds 1bn a year now collected through the levy.
Nuclear Electric's opponents will argue that the company's estimates are
further evidence of nuclear power's inability to compete in the market. The
Treasury is firmly opposed to providing the company with more state funds.
It is continuing to press strongly for the company's early privatisation
even though Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has said a sell-off before the
next election is highly unlikely.
Treasury ministers believe the government could sell both Nuclear Electric
and Scottish Nuclear without new legislation by using privatisation measures
approved by parliament in the late 1980s.
Nuclear Electric sees privatisation as its priority in the review. It says
that in presenting options for funding Sizewell C and other stations it is
responding to the government's request for suggestions on building new
plant.
'We are not asking for government money to build Sizewell C,' said Mr Mike
Kirwan, finance director. 'We are merely explaining the possibilities for
building it.'
New nuclear stations could play an important role in reducing UK emissions
of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, the company argued.
Nuclear Electric said that if the government subsidised Sizewell C with an
initial Pounds 1bn, it is possible that no more money would be needed from
the state if market prices per unit of electricity were 2.7p or above when
the station started to produce electricity.
Anything below that might need an extra injection of funding either from
electricity consumers or the taxpayer.
Prices in the wholesale market are likely to average 2.4p this year and the
plant would not produce electricity until after 2000. But many electricity
market analysts think prices may not rise much in the next decade or so
because of the abundance of gas supplies.
Nuclear Electric has also floated the possibility of building a smaller
station at Hinkley in Somerset at a cost of Pounds 2bn. Although the state
support needed for this would be less, unit costs would be higher because it
would not benefit from the same economies of scale as the twin-reactor
Sizewell C. The company's figures are based on the assumption that the
private sector would require a return on capital of 11 per cent.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Law urged on discrimination against disabled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party's Commission on Social Justice yesterday called for
legislation to outlaw discrimination against the disabled.
In a policy paper, the commission also called for research into a system of
income-boosting payments, reflecting disabled people's drastically reduced
earning capacity and extra costs of daily life.
Sir Gordon Borrie, the commission chairman, said: 'Disabled people are an
untapped resource of energy and ideas. We need a big shift in attitudes and
policies to tap their talent.'
The paper was written by commission member Mr Bert Massie, director of the
Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation.
Mr Massie says: 'The first principle of equality for disabled people should
be comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation.'
His paper, Disabled People and Social Justice, also called for:
Research into special payments.
'No fault' compensation, so disablement claims can be handled faster.
Disabled to be able to choose local authority services or the cash
equiva-lent.
Full involvement of disabled in policy-making.
According to government figures, the UK has 6.5m disabled people.
Out of this total an estimated 70 per cent of those of working age are not
employed, and fewer than one in three companies meets the quota that 3 per
cent of workers in companies employing 20 or more be disabled.
The paper says: 'Few people will reach their grave without experiencing
impairment or disability. Public policies which are perceived to favour
disabled people are in fact policies for everyone - not policies for 'them'
but policies for 'us'.'
It says legislation is not 'the whole answer' to disabled people's problems,
and highlighted the importance of healthcare provision, housing and
transport design.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Cementing the evidence of housing recovery: Brick shortages
are building up for the first time for six years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brick shortages have begun to emerge in Britain for the first time for six
years as the housing market continues its faltering recovery.
Butterley, one of the country's biggest manufacturers of house bricks, was
yesterday quoting 20 weeks' delivery to builders phoning its Kirton works in
Nottinghamshire. This time last year builders contacting Kirton could expect
deliveries the following day.
In spite of the shortage of house bricks, the industry still has large
stockpiles of higher-specification bricks used for offices, shops and public
buildings such as hospitals and schools.
Prices of house bricks have risen, but manufacturers say they have not yet
moved far enough to encourage them to reopen kilns mothballed during the
recession. There are also doubts about the pace and strength of the recovery
in the housing market which has had a setback following recent rises in
taxes and fixed-interest-rate mortgages.
So far this has not reduced demand for bricks from housebuilders. They have
increased land purchases and building programmes significantly in
expectation of better times. During the first four months of this year
builders started work on 11 per cent more private homes than during the
corresponding period last year.
Mr Richard Manning, managing director of the brick division of Hanson, the
conglomerate which owns Butterley and London Brick, the country's biggest
brick manufacturer, said: 'It is not clear the extent to which companies may
be building homes for stock to carry them through the winter. Demand could
fall just as we had reopened housing brick capacity.'
The absence of an outcry from builders about the length of delivery delays -
last encountered at the height of the late-1980s building boom - suggests
that supply is more than enough to meet prevailing demand.
The rise in sales has led to an increase of about a fifth in the average
ex-factory price of housing bricks from a low of about Pounds 100 a thousand
in autumn 1992 to about Pounds 120 now. Margins, however, are only just
approaching the minimum 20 per cent needed to justify capital investment, Mr
Manning said.
Manufacturers are thought to have achieved returns of about 50 per cent when
house brick prices peaked at about Pounds 160 a thousand during the late
1980s.
Prices of higher-specification commercial bricks, which have fallen by about
a fifth since the peak, have still to recover. Low demand from commercial
and industrial developers, which previously accounted for more than half of
all brick sales, means that the industry continues to suffer from
over-capacity in spite of higher sales to housebuilders and a stream of
plant and kiln closures.
Between 1987 and 1989, manufacturers in Britain spent Pounds 200m increasing
their capacity from 4.5bn bricks a year to 5bn.
Since then, permanent and temporary closures have reduced capacity to
3.45bn. Actual production last year was 2.64bn. Total sales by the industry
declined by a third from 4.7bn in 1987 to 3.13bn last year according to the
Brick Development Association.
Closures meant that the number of workers employed by brick manufacturers
fell by almost 40 per cent from 14,000 to 8,500 between December 1987 and
December 1993.
Predatory pricing, with too much capacity still chasing too few sales, has
inhibited price recovery according to Hanson, which believes further
rationalisation is needed in the industry following a stream of mergers and
acquisitions in the 1980s and early 1990s. Marshalls, a brick and concrete
products manufacturer, says some companies over-traded at uneconomic prices
in an effort to increase sales. This was adding to shortages and, in the
long term, would increase pressure for higher prices as other brick
producers sought to fill the gap.
The two largest companies in the sector are Hanson and Redland. Hanson
controls a third of British brick sales through London Brick (20 per cent)
and Butterley (13 per cent). Redland, which acquired Steetley's brick
operations two years ago, has about 19 per cent of the market.
The next-largest is Ibstock, with a market share of just over 10 per cent.
Tarmac, which last year swapped its clay tile business for Marley's brick
operations, is estimated to have under just 10 per cent. About 50 medium and
small producers share out the rest.
The recession in commercial building means that the industry still holds a
stock of 900m unsold bricks - enough to build another Great Wall, 6ft high,
for 5,300 miles from London to Beijing.
Life may be a little easier for brick manufacturers, which at the end of
1992 had unsold stock of 1.5bn, but recovery still has a way to go.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Unit trust savings continue to flow in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savers continued to invest in unit trusts last month in spite of uncertain
market conditions.
Figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds showed a
net inflow of Pounds 726m, of which 87 per cent came from private investors.
The figure is down from last May's inflow of Pounds 915m, but well above
1990-92 levels; 1993 was a record year for the unit trust industry, with net
investment of Pounds 9.1bn.
Mr Philip Warland, the association's director-general, said the figures
pointed to a healthy change in saving habits, as investors appeared to be
ignoring short-term market movements and investing for the long term.
The growth of regular savings schemes, particularly via personal equity
plans, also contributed to a steadier flow of money into trusts.
Trusts in the UK equity income and UK growth sectors were most popular with
private investors during the month, attracting Pounds 124m and Pounds 111m
respectively.
There are now more than 1m unit holders of UK equity income trusts.
Among institutional investors, funds shifted out of the Far East excluding
Japan, and European sectors, and into Japanese trusts in May. Japanese
trusts were also popular with private investors, attracting a total of
Pounds 158m net new money.
Unit trusts now have a total of Pounds 95bn under management, down from the
peak of almost Pounds 100bn in January this year, before most stock markets
started to fall.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Partnerships in business grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing numbers of UK companies are developing friendly 'partnership'
relations with their purchasers and suppliers, a survey has found.
Twenty per cent more businesses than a year ago are using 'partnership
sourcing' - a system in which purchasers and suppliers seek to set up
long-term, collaborative relationships with each other based on more than
cost analysis.
Nearly three quarters of purchasers and 61 per cent of suppliers use the
practice, according to the survey by the Partnership Sourcing group, a
non-profit making body established by the Confederation of British Industry
and the Department of Trade and Industry.
This compares with 56 per cent of purchasers and 36 per cent of suppliers
who used the system a year ago, said the Partnership Sourcing group.
For the first time in the four years of the survey more than 90 per cent of
companies said they had heard of the concept.
But in spite of growing awareness of an idea which has recently become
popular in information technology and electronics, the survey showed that
companies had found that adopting partnership sourcing was more
time-consuming and difficult than anticipated. Out of 300 companies
questioned across a number of industrial sectors, 41 per cent said that
'co-operation with the other party' was a key difficulty.
In total 85 per cent said that partnership sourcing had enabled them to cut
costs, 67 per cent said they had been able to improve delivery times, 81 per
cent said they could improve the service they gave their customers and 78
per cent said they had improved product quality.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Revival of CrossRail moves a step closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival of a bill promoting the Pounds 2bn London CrossRail project
moved a step closer last night when a motion backed by more than 250 MPs was
tabled by a Conservative backbencher.
The motion - tabled by Mr David Lidington, MP for Aylesbury - called for the
bill to be recommitted to the four-strong private bill committee, which last
month dealt the project a surprise blow by turning it down.
The motion, also urging that the committee be instructed to reconsider its
decision, is expected to be called in the Commons early next week. By this
time it may have gained the support of even more MPs.
The unusually heavy cross-party backing for the motion appears to give it a
reasonable chance of success.
Conservative whips gave permission for parliamentary private secretaries,
who as part of the government 'payroll vote' normally do not get involved,
to sign it.
Liberal Democrat MPs are also among the signatories, as are Mr Frank Dobson,
shadow transport secretary, and Mr John Prescott, the Labour leadership
candidate and employment spokesman.
The CrossRail proposal, which has the backing of British Rail and London
Underground, calls for an east-west underground rail link to be built in the
capital.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Companies House wins appeal case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies House, the govern-ment's corporate information depository,
yesterday an-nounced that it had won a significant legal victory in attempts
to impose its penalties for the late-filing of company accounts.
The organisation, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade
and Industry under the Next Steps programme, won on appeal a court case
against an arbitration. A company - Livepine - had initially succeeded in
overturning a Pounds 100 late-filing penalty after it missed the deadline
when Companies House rejected the accounts it initially submitted.
The company had failed to sign the directors' report in its accounts, and
argued in its defence that this was not required under section 242 of the
1985 Companies Act.
However, the Basingstoke court demanded that the fine be paid, arguing that
the wider context of the act required that the report must be signed.
Companies House allows companies submitting incomplete filings 14 days to
make modifications and re-file the accounts to avoid penalties. Most
companies have 10 months after their financial year-ends during which to
file. Late filing penalties were introduced in 1992 in response to
politicians' concerns over the high proportion of companies filing many
months after the legal date had expired.
Last month Mr David Durham, chief executive, told the Commons committee on
the parliamentary commissioner for administration that Companies House had
handled 65,000 disputes since the regime was introduced - the volume of
calls and letters was greater than he had anticipated.
Mr William Reed, the parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - said he had
completed examinations of two cases concerning Companies House in 1993 and a
further six were still under investigation. By that time, 164,000 penalties
had been imposed on companies, generating fines of Pounds 33m, which are
remitted to the Treasury. The annual administrative cost of running the late
penalty regime is Pounds 1.3m.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Revenue confesses to tax errors: Underestimates total Pounds
430m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taxpayers paid up to Pounds 100m less in tax than they owed to the Inland
Revenue last year, the Commons public accounts committee heard yesterday.
Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, told MPs
errors in Revenue calculations of assessments sent to taxpayers had
underestimated Pounds 100m tax from Schedule D (self-employed) and Pounds
330m from Schedule E (pay-as-you-earn) taxpayers.
These gross figures were offset by assessments for too much tax of Pounds
70m for Schedule D taxpayers and Pounds 260m for those under Schedule E.
Sir Anthony was answering questions following publication earlier this month
of a highly critical report on tax administration by the National Audit
Office, the Whitehall watchdog.
The report highlighted the fact that of the 5m taxpayers who receive
assessments each year the figures were incorrect for 3.1m of those on
Schedule D and more than 0.1m on Schedule E.
Many of the errors were caused by taxpayer mistakes, but 10 per cent - or
500,000 - were the fault of the Inland Revenue, and in many of these cases
it was the taxpayer rather than the Revenue who identified the
miscalculation.
Sir Anthony stressed yesterday that the difference between assessments and
the correct level of tax was just one-tenth of 1 per cent, and said the
Revenue had introduced a quality division to improve accuracy and ensure
taxpayers paid the right amount.
However, he said he was not satisfied with the current position. 'Any errors
that get people's tax wrong are to be regretted,' he said.
He also admitted that 'morale is not as good as it has been in the past'
among Revenue staff as they adjusted to periods of tremendous change and
uncertainty.
Mr Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, expressed
scepticism over the Revenue's belief that most taxpayers truly wanted to pay
the correct amount of tax, as they had stated in surveys commissioned by the
Revenue.
He said that in his experience as a chartered accountant taxpayers were
extremely reluctant to push for a revised assessment if they had been asked
by the Revenue to pay less tax than was due.
The issue is important because the new system of self-assessment places the
onus on taxpayers to calculate how much tax they pay, and the Revenue
generally to accept this figure unquestioned.
The National Audit Office report also pointed out that just 60 per cent of
taxpayers surveyed said they were satisfied with the Revenue's handling of
correspondence.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Dobson backs rail union's claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, yesterday moved Labour close to
outright public support for the series of one-day rail strikes mounted by
the RMT transport union.
Mr Dobson told the RMT annual conference in Liverpool that the signalmen at
the heart of the dispute 'think they have been swindled; they are right.'
He added: 'The government has been demanding that Labour should condemn the
strike. We refuse to condemn it. Workers who are being swindled out of their
wages have a fundamental human right to withdraw their labour.'
Mr Dobson was careful not to express explicit support for the strikes, which
have brought most of the rail network to a standstill on the past two
Wednesdays.
But he said Labour would 'continue to support the signal workers' claim . .
. not as some fix or favour. They will get our support because their claim
is just.'
Mr Dobson's comments point to a stronger line in support of the strikes by
shadow ministers, who have hitherto sought to avoid being too closely
identified with the strikes.
Labour MPs have been heartened by indications that many rail travellers
blame the strikes on government interference in negotiations between RMT and
Railtrack, the state-owned infrastructure company.
Mr Dobson also said Labour would 'reverse the break-up and privatisation of
the railways, and bring the system, the whole system, back under public
ownership and control.'
His comments strengthened Labour's commitment to renationalisation, which
has previously been restricted to those parts of the network still in state
ownership.
Renationalisation of the 'whole system' would be expensive if it meant
purchasing train operating companies sold to the private sector before the
next general election. But Labour officials said Mr Dobson's pledge was
subject to the shadow cabinet's agreement that all spending promises would
depend on available resources.
Mr Dobson accused the government of prolonging the dispute, and claimed that
a settlement could be financed from the millions of pounds being
'squandered' on privatisation.
'For years, signalling staff have contributed massive improvements in
productivity - accepting new technology and the changes in working practices
that go with it,' he said.
For two years, RMT negotiators had been told that an agreement rewarding the
signallers for past productivity gains would be concluded when Railtrack
took over track and signalling responsibilities in April.
Mr Dobson claimed that a settlement rewarding signalmen for productivity
gains would not breach the government's public sector pay policy, set out by
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in September.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Three counties to hear fate today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court will rule today on Avon, Cleveland and Somerset county
councils' applications for judicial review of proposals that they should be
abolished. The move comes as legal challenges to the English local
government review intensify.
If any of today's applications succeed, the credibility of the Local
Government Commission for England, chaired by Sir John Banham, could be
critically damaged in the week before it announces recommendations for
restructuring 16 more counties.
It could also open the way for more legal action, as several counties
already recommended for abolition are considering applying for judicial
review, and would be encouraged by any successes today.
Buckinghamshire, which was recommended for abolition two weeks ago, to be
replaced by three unitary authorities, is seeking 'top legal opinion' over
what it says 'appear to be serious inadequacies in a leaflet being
distributed to households in the county by the commission'.
The leaflet is central to the commission's attempt to gauge public opinion
in the area in the final stage of its consultation. But Mr Kenneth Ross,
council chairman, said the commission's concern that services would be
'fragmented' under the new structure, included in its formal report, had
been excluded from the leaflet.
Districts in Cumbria, which will be split into two large unitary authorities
under current proposals, are also discussing legal action against the
proposals. In Cambridgeshire, both the county and several districts are also
planning legal action over the commission's refusal to include the two-tier
status quo as an option.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Labour urges tax law rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night urged to re-examine proposals designed to make
complex tax legislation more effective and comprehensible by Mr Nick Brown,
a Labour frontbench spokesman.
He promised the co-operation of Labour MPs if the government agreed to
include technical tax provisions as part of the Budget to be introduced on
November 29.
Mr Brown said this could be dealt with separately by a special committee of
MPs able to take evidence from tax specialists employed by the Inland
Revenue and other organisations.
He stressed that the principal tax proposals announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, would be dealt with in the finance bill in the normal
manner.
Mr Brown secured agreement from some Tory backbenchers when he maintained
that a separate taxes management bill could be examined in an orderly and
considered way.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, yesterday urged 'caution' in
responding to calls for strengthened powers for Commons select committees.
Mr Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing and chairman of the liaison
committee which co-ordinates their work, praised the manner in which they
called ministers to account.
He questioned whether Baroness Thatcher, when refusing to give evidence
about her role in the controversial Pergau dam project, had been correct to
claim that convention required that ex-prime ministers should not be
questioned by select committees.
Mr Higgins recalled that two former prime ministers, Sir Edward Heath and
Lord Callaghan, had agreed to appear before select committees.
Mr Higgins acknowledged that, as a peer, Lady Thatcher had the right not to
appear before such a committee.
Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire South West, said the
select committees provided the only way forward in ensuring that an
increasingly powerful executive was subjected to scrutiny and restraint.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central and chairman of the
Commons trade and industry committee, warned that there was a danger of
select committees being used by governments to defuse a highly charged
situation.

FT  28 JUN 94 / MoD cuts beat Treasury needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence will next month announce cuts in military
expenditure well in excess of those required by the Treasury in the current
financial year, according to defence sources.
The MoD is required to shave around Pounds 750m off its budget for the
financial year 1994-95 to meet the targets set out in the last Budget.
Officials drawing together about 30 separate reports for the Defence Cost
Studies project have discovered far more room for cuts in military support
services than had been expected.
In the run up to the publication of the Defence Cost Studies, MoD officials
are arguing with the Treasury over whether the extra expenditure saved will
be retained by the department.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will want to announce several
'sweeteners' when the cuts in support services are announced, probably on
July 14.
Backbench Conservative MPs have expressed anxiety about the projected cuts
in military support services - such as hospitals and non-military transport
 -arguing that these will undermine the military's front-line capability.
While they accept that some support services can be reduced, some MPs have
argued that the army needs more land-based helicopters, tanks and stores of
ammunition.
As a sign of their concern over the issue, the defence select committee has
agreed, insisting that it will re-convene in the summer recess, if
necessary, to discuss the Defence Cost Studies proposals. A meeting outside
a parliamentary sitting would be almost unprecedented.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Chemicals industry claims ecological points
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's chemicals industry yesterday attempted to improve the sector's
environmental reputation by publishing figures demonstrating its improving
ecological and safety record.
The Chemical Industry Association released data showing that discharges by
its members of red-list substances - materials that are particularly toxic
in water - had fallen every year for the past four years.
The survey, of 340 chemical manufacturing sites representing 76 per cent of
sites owned by association members, showed that red-list substance
discharges fell from 360 tonnes in 1990 to 167 tonnes last year. The number
of sites reporting no such discharges increased from 189 to 207.
The association's figures are part of the industry's Responsible Care
campaign, aimed at improving environmental performance and then
communicating that to the public. A recent survey by Cefic, the European
Chemical Industry Council, showed that the UK population mistrusted the
chemical industry more than any other country.
Mr John Holloway, chairman and managing director of Exxon Chemical and
chairman of the Chemical Industry Safety, Health and Environment Council,
said: 'There is no doubt that opinion about the chemical industry in this
country is poor. We are not liked. But we are working hard to deal with
that.'
Recent research by the association suggested only 29 per cent of population
has positive feelings towards the chemicals industry. Mr John Cox,
association director-general, said he would not be satisfied until that
figure had risen to 50 per cent, a level achieved at the start of the 1980s.
The association's figures published yesterday were not all moving in the
right direction. Environmental expenditure fell last year as the industry
struggled with the recession. It dropped from Pounds 1.013bn in 1992 to
Pounds 956m.
Capital spending on the environment fell from Pounds 293m to Pounds 268m.
This reflected a fall in overall capital spending which has fallen two years
running from Pounds 2.19bn in 1991 to Pounds 2.09bn in 1992, and Pounds
1.915bn last year. The association said environmental capital spending had
been maintained at a steady 14 per cent as a proportion of overall capital
investment.
Environmental operating costs also fell, down from Pounds 720m to Pounds
688m, reflecting a decline in manufacturing volumes.
Mr Richard Robson, group environment communications manager at Imperial
Chemical Industries, said no clear pattern could be observed in the amount
of special waste disposed off-site.
This increased from 299,000 tonnes in 1992 to 358,000 tonnes in 1993. This
followed a fall from 316,000 tonnes in 1991. Special wastes are substances
that need to be disposed of with particular care. However, Mr Robson said
the figures could not be compared because of an increase in the number of
sites reporting data.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Scots keep 'not proven' verdict
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'not proven' verdict in Scottish courts is to be retained, the
government said yesterday.
The decision to retain three verdicts - guilty, not guilty and not proven -
was contained in a white paper on reform of the criminal justice system in
Scotland.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, also said the government intended that
Scotland retain 15-member juries.
He told an Edinburgh news conference that a considerable majority of people
 -including four voluntary organisations and two out of three police
associations - supported keeping the 'not proven' verdict.
The decision comes after widespread debate and a campaign by the parents of
a murdered girl to abolish the verdict.
A man accused of murdering 19-year-old Amanda Duffy two years ago had been
acquitted by a jury verdict of not proven.
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, a Scottish Office minister, said it would be left
to senior judges to explain the effect of the not proven verdict to juries.
Mr Lang also proposed new powers to increase the sentence for people who
offend while on bail.
The right to bail should not be available for those accused of a serious
offence such as attempted murder or rape where they have a previous
conviction for a serious offence.
The maximum fine for breaching a condition of bail will go up from Pounds
200 to Pounds 1,000.
There are also plans to increase the number of intermediate dates on which a
court can decide whether a case is ready to proceed. The aim is to save the
time wasted when police officers attend court to give evidence and are not
called or the case fails to proceed.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Portillo scorns EU 'fast lane': Minister boosts claim to
lead Tory right by speaking out for market forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo last night underlined his claim to the leadership of the
Tory right with an abrupt dismissal of fears that Britain might be left in
Europe's 'slow lane' and a call for tighter curbs on the welfare state.
In the latest of a series of speeches this year which have set out his basic
political philosophy, the chief secretary of the Treasury accused advocates
of greater European integration of 'bamboozling' the electorate.
He also warned of the dangers to individual freedom and to economic
efficiency from the growth in the powers of European governments.
Underlining his commitment to market forces, he said the role of governments
was to create the conditions in which individual initiative was free to
create prosperity.
He added: 'It has recently been argued that the free market is a jungle to
be tamed by governments. It is at least as plausible to argue that
governments are a jungle to be tamed by the free market.'
Mr Portillo told an audience in Barcelona during an official visit to Spain
that arguments that Britain could not afford to miss the European 'bus' or
must remain in the 'fast lane' had reached the height of absurdity.
They suggested that 'speed is more important than direction, that being in a
crowd is more important than heading for the right place'.
But 'What if the bus is the wrong one? What if the fast lane leads to the
wrong destination?' Setting out his agenda for the European Union, Mr
Portillo said that the creation of the single market should be the prelude
to ever-increasing global free trade.
There would be no point in seeking the benefits of free trade in Europe if
the Union then saddled itself with higher prices and outmoded industries by
putting up barriers to other countries.
He added that as Europe mapped out its future it was vital that supporters
of limited government and of free trade made their voices heard.
They also had to ensure that the regulations necessary to ensure a level
playing field within the single market were kept to a minimum.
Mr Portillo, whose speeches have sometimes angered Mr John Major, the prime
minister, was careful to frame his remarks as being in tune with those of
the prime minister. He twice quoted Mr Major to reinforce that impression.
But the speech will be seen at Westminster as the latest attempt by the
Euro-sceptic right of the Tory party to ensure that Mr Major continues to
promote its agenda.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Brent Walker director 'did not know of Pounds 5m fee'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former non-executive director of the Brent Walker Group knew nothing of a
Pounds 5m commission fee supposedly paid to a close business associate of Mr
George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the property and
leisure group, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
Mr John Hemingway, a solicitor who regularly attended main board meetings of
Brent Walker, had never heard of the payment made by Brent Walker to Mr
Michael Eland, he told the court.
He was giving evidence in the trial of Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina,
the former Brent Walker finance director.
The prosecution alleges the two men were involved in fraudulently boosting
the Brent Walker Group's profits by Pounds 19.3m between 1984 and 1987.
Mr Walker denies four charges of theft totalling Pounds 17m, two charges of
false accounting and one of conspiracy to falsify the company's accounts. Mr
Aquilina denies one charge of the theft of Pounds 4.5m, three of false
accounting and one of conspiracy to falsify accounts.
Mr Peter Rook, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, was questioning Mr
Hemingway about a Pounds 5m payment supposedly made to Mr Eland as
commission for his work in seeking out attractive new investments for the
Brent Walker group in continental Europe.
The prosecution claims the payment was bogus and part of an attempt to
conceal the profit-boosting fraud by a series of complex circular
transactions involving the apparent sales of film rights by the Brent Walker
film division.
It alleges that the claimed profits were bogus since the sales were
ultimately funded by Brent Walker itself.
Mr Hemingway agreed he had met Mr Eland on several occasions - usually in
the company of Mr Walker or Mr Aquilina.
However, he had no idea how much Mr Eland was paid or on what basis.
He could not remember the commission fee ever being discussed at a Brent
Walker board meeting. Neither could he remember seeing any details of the
payment in the Brent Walker accounts, he told the court.
Mr Rook then asked him whether he had been aware of the transfer of Pounds
5m and Pounds 7.5m in 1989 from Brent Walker to Goldcrest films, part of the
film subsidiary. Mr Hemingway replied that he had been unaware of these
transfers until he was interviewed by SFO investigators in 1991.
The trial continues today.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Praise for Major may be fleeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a party used to seeing its leader isolated and under fire from his own
back benches, yesterday's statement by the prime minister was unusual.
Mr John Major's speech on the Corfu summit won warm applause from Tory MPs
on both wings of the party. For once the prime minister gave his troops
something to cheer about and Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as
European Commission president appeared to unite the party.
Never mind that pro-European backbenchers privately warned that the battle
over the EC presidency may be only the first of many to come, or that
Britain may find itself bereft of friends when it mosts need them. As far as
the majority of Tory MPs were concerned 'a victory is a victory'. Nothing
was going to spoil their relief and delight at having something to applaud.
Mr Kenneth Baker, a Euro-sceptic and former party chairman, summed up by
telling the prime minister: 'The decision you took was not only right, but
courageous and popular - popular not just in the Conservative party, but in
the country as a whole and in many electorates across Europe.'
The prime minister's reception was probably better than it might have been
because of a disappointing response from Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader
of the Labour party.
In a speech which failed to inspire her own supporters she accused Mr Major
of being 'humiliated' by being in a minority of one. The accusation only led
to greater cheers from the Tory back benches.
Perhaps the most significant indication of Mr Major's success in the Commons
came from an intervention by Mr Ian Taylor, a member of the Tory Positive
European group. To the surprise of some of his pro-European colleagues in
the group, he said Britain was justified in using the veto.
Members of the group said privately they were 'appalled' by Mr Major's
decision to veto Mr Dehaene. Mr Robert Hicks, a member of the group, said on
Sunday that he regretted the decision. But not one of the Positive Europeans
decided to speak out against the use of Britain's veto in yesterday's
Commons debate.
It was left to Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, to air their
views when he said the big task facing the government was to concentrate on
'how to resolve this crisis - for crisis it is'.
The prime minister said he shared Sir Edward's regret that it was necessary
to use the veto. He argued that it was a point of principle.
Mr Major took obvious delight from the fact that the only cheers for Sir
Edward's intervention came from the opposition benches.
Even some Tory MPs who said they had no strong views about Mr Dehaene
believed the government was right to block his appointment. As they saw it
France and Germany were trying to 'railroad' their candidate through the
Community which Britain could not allow.
The only question being asked by Tory MPs yesterday was not whether Mr
Major's leadership had been strengthened, but how long the new mood would
last.
Many Euro-sceptics warned that his position could quickly weaken if he
allowed another federalist to be appointed at the special European summit on
July 15 called to resolve the issue.
Mr Baker, who was so full of praise for the prime minister, said: 'He cannot
resile now.'
Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 group, said: 'The prime
minister is in a much stronger position now. But it would be terrible if he
reneged on it.'
Mr Michael Carttiss, a Euro-sceptic, believes the prime minister 'would be
finished' if he backed down at next month's European summit by allowing a
federalist to be appointed president.
Mr Bill Cash, another leading Tory Euro-sceptic, said: 'The government can
and should veto every federalist for president.'
He described Mr Major's decision to block the appointment of Mr Dehaene as a
'first intermediate step' and urged the prime minister to follow through by
vetoing federalist policies. 'There is no room for compromise'.
The prime minister was careful to avoid any suggestion that he would veto
another candidate on the basis of 'federalist views'. He will not need
reminding, however, that adulation from Euro-sceptics can quickly turn into
hostility.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Modern art finds few buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christie's big summer sale of Impressionist and Modern Art in London last
night was a disappointment. Just over 50 per cent of the 49 lots on offer
sold, by volume and value, for Pounds 9.3m, Antony Thorncroft writes.
Auctioneer Charles Allsopp blamed falling international stock markets. The
top lot, one of Braque's late 'Atelier' works of around 1950, was unsold
when the bidding faltered at Pounds 1.8m, well below the Pounds 2.5m to
Pounds 3.5m estimate. But the other major work of the auction, a 1946 Miro,
a brilliant celebration of the end of the war, was in demand, with three
bidders in the room above the low estimate and an eventual successful
purchaser at Pounds 1,871,500, at the high estimate.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Spenders go off tea and tabloids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taxis, tourism and turnips have been among the beneficiaries of changes in
consumer spending since the mid 1980s while tea and tabloids have lost out,
Philip Coggan writes.
Figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show that UK
consumers spent Pounds 405.87bn in 1993, or around Pounds 7,000 per head.
Spending on vegetables rose by a third between 1986 and 1993 but Britons
still spend more on confectionery than they do on their greens.
Britons are venturing farther afield. Spending on overseas tourism increased
by 40 per cent between 1986 and 1993, while the money spent by foreign
tourists in Britain rose by less than 5 per cent. For domestic travel, the
attractions of a door-to-door service helped increase spending on taxis by a
third, while that on bus fares fell by over a tenth.
Spending on newspapers is down - a 7 per cent fall between 1986 and 1993 -
but spending on magazines is up.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Property hopes lifted by Pounds 106m City sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the City's best-known office blocks, home to Deutsche Bank and Baring
Brothers, has been bought by a German investment institution for Pounds 106m
in one of the biggest commercial property sales.
The sale has been concluded as the London Business School has forecast a
sharp rise in the value of commercial buildings over the next two years -
reversing a large part of the decline in property values between 1990-93.
The 145,000 sq ft building at 6-8 Bishopsgate has been sold by Electricity
Supply Nominees, the electricity industry pension fund, to Deutsche
Immobilien Fonds (DIFA) - one of the largest German investment funds.
It marks the latest in a series of property purchases by German
institutions. Other acquisitions by DIFA have included 12-15 Finsbury
Circus, let to the Bank of Tokyo, and St Andrew's House, let to accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe, which advised DIFA, said that the desire of German
institutions to acquire UK property had not been diminished by rising bond
yields which had affected the appetite of some UK institutions.
Further rises in UK property values following last year's gains are
expected, according to the London Business School which estimates that
capital values will increase by 18 per cent this year and by a further 7 per
cent in 1995.
The forecasts, sponsored by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors,
are based on about 1,500 UK buildings, owned by 45 investment institutions.
Commercial values according to the institution rose by 6 per cent last year
with most of the increase coming at the end of the year. This follows a fall
of 25 per cent between the third quarter of 1989 and the third quarter of
last year.
Mr Richard Lay, RICS commercial property spokesman, said: 'It is pleasing to
see that the growing confidence in the property market is supported by this
detailed forecast. However, a true recovery in the commercial property
market will not come about until there is a sustained recovery in confidence
in the business sector which will, in turn, lead to an increase in the take
up of space across the country.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Bottomley attacks 'federalist dreams'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday underlined the
growing appeal of anti-federalist thinking in the Conservative party by
endorsing the prime minister's recent statements on Europe.
Mrs Bottomley has traditionally been associated with the centrist and
pro-European part of the Tory party. But in a surprisingly Euro-sceptic
speech she attacked the 'pied pipers of federalism', saying they were
'losing their followers, even in countries where their ideas were once so
applauded'.
Delivering the Alison Tennant Memorial lecture in London, Mrs Bottomley said
the institutions of Europe needed to forget their 'centralist and federalist
dreams'.
She applauded the prime minister's recent call for a multi-speed,
multi-track Europe, saying that it was an idea that appealed far beyond the
British Conservative party.
'Some have argued that the only way to consolidate Europe's achievements is
to roll forward towards ever closer economic and political integration,' she
said. 'That view is misguided. The voters have rumbled it. Increasingly the
call is for nations to build Europe, not for Europe to supersede nations.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In his statement to the Commons, Mr Major said:
'The Corfu Council has highlighted an issue of increasing concern to many EU
members - the way in which decisions are reached.
'It is an important point of principle that the key decisions require
unanimity and that all member states should have an equal opportunity to
participate in collective decision-making.
'The procedures used for this decision, before and during the council, were
not satisfactory.
'There was no need for this matter to have come to an open division at a
European council. It should have been avoided. Had more comprehensive
consultation taken place, as in the past, and had the views expressed by
different states been heeded, it could have been avoided.
'I believe that there are a number of well-qualified people who could take
on this post, on the basis of a genuinely common accord. We stand ready to
play our part in consultations on it.
'There is no reason why this should not lead to an early and satisfactory
outcome.
'I want Europe to succeed. I want it to regain the affections of the people
of Europe. I want a Europe with which all member states - soon to be 16,
then 20 - can feel comfortable. Achieving that may mean disputes along the
way.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Court in Thailand acquits speculator

Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission, the two-year-old stock market
watchdog, received a setback yesterday when a local court acquitted an
influential speculator and 11 associates of ramping the share price of the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce in 1992.
The court ruled that the commission, in its first ever prosecution, had
insufficient evidence to show that Mr Song Watcharasrirong - known as Sia
(tycoon) Song - and the other 11 acted in concert when they made an
estimated Bt2bn (Pounds 52m) profit out of the spectacular rise in the price
of the troubled bank's shares.
Mr Rapee Sucharitakul, SEC spokesman, said the commission would appeal
against the verdict 'all the way to the Supreme Court'.
The SEC showed that most of the 12 investors worked from the same room, the
same telephone numbers, trans-ferred large sums of money between themselves
and bought blocks of shares in the Bangkok Bank of Commerce at or near the
same time. On November 24, 1992 - six days after the SEC had filed criminal
charges against Mr Song and his 11 associates - the Bank of Thailand said
that the 12 people named in the charges had a combined investment portfolio
worth Bt16bn.
The Thai judiciary - which survived a vigorously attempted revamp during the
caretaker premiership of Mr Anand Panyarachun two years ago - has rarely
found against well-connected members of the establishment.
Nevertheless, observers give the commission credit for getting such a case
as far as it did; one of the 11 was the daughter of a former leader of the
Democrat party which leads the ruling coalition government.
Mr Mark Greenwood, managing director of brokers Asia Equity, said: 'It shows
they are willing to drag suspects into court. Anyone engaged in questionable
trading has to consider that. OK, maybe you'll get off but maybe you won't'
Mr Song is also named in all four of the SEC's outstanding cases against
speculators who allegedly cheated the public by manipulating share prices in
1992 and early 1993.
The public prosecutor is preparing prosecutions in connection with the sharp
movements in the shares of property company Krisda Mahanakorn and the Siam
City Bank; the remaining two cases - involving the First City Investment and
Rattana Real Estate - are still in the hands of the police.
Although the Thai stock market fell heavily yesterday because of concerns
over the falling dollar, Mr Sriyan Pietersz, Smith New Court's country
representative, said: 'Many retail investors will give a sigh of relief
because it means that they are probably a little bit beyond the reach of the
SEC.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Tokyo sticks to strategy for shoring up Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It could prove to be an expensive week for the Bank of Japan. In its
attempts to shore up the dollar, it has thrown an estimated Dollars 3bn
worth of yen at currency markets in recent days.
So far the efforts have been in vain and the financial markets increasingly
expect a change of strategy to co-ordinated interest rate measures by the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries, including a cut in Japanese
interest rates. But Japan's monetary authorities are anxious to avoid a cut
in borrowing costs and, for the time being at least, seem prepared to
continue spending yen in the dollar's defence.
The crisis came out of a clear sky last week just as the central bank, which
implements policy under the watchful tutelage of the Ministry of Finance,
was congratulating itself on steering the economy out of recession.
Since the last cut in the official discount rate in September - to 1.75 per
cent, its lowest ever - the bank's governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, has been
under pressure for a further cut as the economy continued to stagnate. But
the bank resisted the pressure, arguing that policy was sufficiently
accommodating to engineer a recovery.
In the last month, Mr Mieno's policy appeared to be vindicated by distinct
signs of an upturn. Gross domestic product figures for the first quarter
suggested the economy was at last recovering. A sustained rise in the Nikkei
average pushed up asset prices and there were signs of a slight rise in
consumption. Market sentiment moved firmly into line with the bank's - there
would be no cut in interest rates.
But last week unwelcome foreign intervention blew the policy off course. The
currency crisis puts three main pressures on Mr Mieno for a relaxation of
policy:
The high yen is hurting the real economy by making exports uncompetitive.
Few economists believe the incipient recovery could survive a yen/dollar
rate above Y100 for long, and companies are clamouring for relief.
The bank's heavy selling of the yen has pumped liquidity into Japan's money
markets, forcing down overnight call rates to around 2 per cent - just a
quarter point above the official discount rate. In the past that gap has
been nearer half a point, and the narrower spread makes an official rate cut
more likely.
If intervention fails, Japan will be expected to participate in co-ordinated
G7 monetary measures - a rise in US rates and cuts in Japanese and German
borrowing costs.
The bank's reluctance to cut interest rates is based on more than just the
usual central banker's fear of inflation. The lessons of monetary history
suggest that an interest rate cut too far, brought on by short-term
pressures, can be costly.
And though inflation is virtually non-existent, the bank is acutely aware of
the dangers of taking its eye off the ball: 'The BoJ is anxious not to
repeat the US experience,' says Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James
Capel Pacific, 'where a loose monetary policy for too long was partly
responsible for the current global financial turbulence.'
So, for now at least, heavy central bank selling of the yen seems set to
continue. The bank is outwardly confident the crisis will pass, believing
that economic fundamentals, particularly a trade deficit that has begun to
shrink, will push the yen back well beyond the Y100 level to the dollar.
But if the markets' desire to dump dollars becomes compulsive, there will be
a limit to the profligacy and the unpalatable choice between a strong yen
and an interest rate cut will become unavoidable.

<TEXT>
The New Zealand Reserve Bank faces an important test of its
anti-inflationary powers as it seeks to manage the economy through a period
of robust growth and higher inflation over the next 12 months, Mr Don Brash,
the governor, said yesterday.
Releasing the bank's monetary policy agenda for the next six months, he
hinted that the bank would be comfortable with some additional, modest,
firming in monetary policy.
New Zealand financial markets treat the central bank's monetary policy
statements in the same light as the budget, because of its role in setting
foreign exchange and interest rate policy.
Mr Brash said that over the coming year the country faced growth, wage and
other cost pressures of a sort the bank had not encountered since the
Reserve Bank Act was passed in 1989.
While he did not see inflation taking off, pressures would push the rate
from the current 1 per cent to between 1.7 and 1.8 per cent by late next
year. This would be just below the 2 per cent maximum target allowed by the
Reserve Bank Act.
'Inflation at these levels would provide little room for error, and with the
economy continuing to grow strongly, New Zealand is more likely to encounter
greater, not less, inflation pressures,' he said.
He said the bank was comfortable with the latest rises in domestic rates,
which have increased by about 1 per cent since February.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Opposition parties flounder in bid to form government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's two main opposition groups were floundering in their attempt to
agree on a new government yesterday, so raising the possibility that the
coalition of Mr Tsutomu Hata could return to power.
The implications of the intervening political chaos on Japan's efforts to
curb its massive trade surplus contributed to a fresh surge of the yen to a
record post-war trading high of Y99.5 against the dollar in Tokyo. It eased
slightly, after heavy Bank of Japan intervention, to close at Y99.93. Share
prices plunged, leaving the Nikkei index down 465.79 points, or 2.24 per
cent, at 20,300.96.
'If the yen's steep rise is not checked, not only export-related firms but
the whole of our country's industry will be forced to a standstill,' warned
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation.
Mr Hata has kept a low profile ever since he announced on Saturday that
would resign rather than risk losing a no-confidence vote proposed by the
Liberal Democratic party, with Social Democratic party support.
Political observers believe he plans to let opposition parties' attempts to
form a pact reach impasse before reopening negotiations with potential
partners for a new government. 'He is being quite clever,' said Mr Takashi
Inoguchi, professor of politics at Tokyo University.
Talks yesterday between Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the left-wing SDP,
and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the conservative LDP, were inconclusive. A
day earlier, the SDP and LDP said they were considering an alliance, but in
the event they merely agreed on the need to form a new government by the end
of today, without specifying how.
Separately, the SDP and New Harbinger party, a former LDP splinter group,
agreed on joint policy guidelines, calling for maintenance of Japan's
pacifist constitution.
A coalition of the SDP, NHP and LDP is possible, but less likely than the
SDP's return to Mr Hata's coalition, said political analysts. A three-way
alliance would be even less stable than the Mr Hata's two-month minority
administration, since the LDP and SDP, long-time enemies, are far apart on
most important policies.
The pressure on the SDP to rejoin Mr Hata's camp increased yesterday when
its most influential backer, the Rengo trade union federation, called for
the establishment of a government modelled on the recent coalition of former
prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, in which the SDP was the largest party.
Normally, the SDP takes Rengo's advice, but the party may hesitate this time
because it is split. A faction loyal to the SDP's Mr Murayama is inclined to
join hands with the LDP, and call a snap general election - anathema to
Japan's business community, which fears an election campaign could hamper
economic recovery.
Mr Wataru Kubo, SDP secretary general, prefers siding with the coalition and
supports its plan for an election late this year under a new electoral
system, which could pave the way for more stable government.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Keating spurns interest rate rise: Bid to outface market
pressures

<TEXT>
Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday insisted the federal
government would not be pushed into lifting official interest rates, despite
the continuing drop in bond prices.
Mr Keating's comments helped to send the nation's currency, already unnerved
by the tumbling US dollar, to a six-week low, but failed to prevent bond
yields reaching their highest levels for over two years. The general mayhem
spilled over into the share market, where the All-Ordinaries Index fell by
about 3 per cent, to 1,957.4.
'The government won't be responding to pressures in the bond markets which
are induced from other markets,' the prime minister told parliament, shortly
before leaving for a three-day visit to Indonesia. 'The key point is
official rates have not risen and they have not risen because the government
believes that inflation has been checked.'
In recent days, Mr Keating and Mr Ralph Willis, the treasurer, have become
increasingly strident in their efforts to delay a rise in official interest
rates. The government argues inflationary pressures are negligible in
Australia, where unemployment remains high, and that business confidence and
investment needs to be encouraged. This viewpoint was given some weight
yesterday with publication of the latest quarterly survey from the
Australian Institute of Company Directors and KPMG Peat Marwick.
The survey, conducted shortly after the government's ADollars 6.5bn (Pounds
3.1bn) jobs package and budget plans were announced last month, suggested
that optimism about the Australian economy has ebbed in recent months. About
63 per cent of company directors, drawn from a wide range of businesses in
both private and public sectors, expected the economy to improve over the
next six months, for example, compared with 71 per cent in the March
quarter.
However, the government's repeated assertions it will not be rushed into
raising interest rates have not stopped financial markets betting a rise is
inevitable. A number of banks have already edged up home loan rates and, by
yesterday evening, 10-year bond yields had risen to 9.97 per cent, from 9.60
per cent at Friday's close.

FT  28 JUN 94 / ILO move on part-timers and mine safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 75th anniversary congress of the International Labour Organisation in
Geneva ended at the weekend having passed two new labour conventions  - on
part-time work and health and safety in mines - and established a working
party on the contentious issue of a world social clause.
The working party, set up by Mr Michel Hansenne, the ILO general secretary,
will report by November and hand its finding to the World Trade
Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which is due to discuss the link between trade and social standards next
year. The working party will also produce a report on the subject for next
year's United Nations social summit in Copenhagen.
Against the wishes of representatives of ILO employers and some governments,
including Britain, the organisation passed a convention calling for equal
rights for part-time workers.
The convention also calls for pro rata equal pay for part-timers. 'Measures
appropriate to national law and practice shall be taken to ensure that
part-time workers do not, solely because they work part-time, receive a
basic wage which, calculated proportionately on an hourly,
performance-related, or piece-rate basis, is lower than the basic wage of
comparable full-time workers', it states.
The congress took one small de-regulatory step by revising the convention on
private employment agencies.
The convention on health and safety in mines calls on employers to ensure
that all mines are designed and equipped to secure safety.
Where workers are exposed to physical, chemical or biological hazards, they
should be fully informed of the hazards and the employer must provide
suitable protective clothing.
Every employer is also called upon to prepare an emergency response plan,
specific to each mine, 'for reasonably foreseeable industrial and natural
disasters'.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Hong Kong land talks extended

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British and Chinese diplomats negotiating the future of military land in
Hong Kong have for the second time postponed conclusion of their talks in an
attempt to reach an agreement.
Mr Guo Fengmin, China's chief representative to the Joint Liaison Group
(JLG), a bilateral group which deals with Hong Kong's reversion to China in
1997, said the 29th plenary of the JLG would reconvene on Thursday.
Tomorrow Hong Kong's Legislative Council votes on Governor Chris Patten's
democracy legislation. Miss Emily Lau, an activist for greater democracy in
Hong Kong, said China had delayed making a decision in order to intimidate
legislators ahead of tomorrow's vote - expected to be close run.
Last Thursday the JLG meeting was suspended until yesterday in the hope of
an agreement being produced. Both teams worked until early yesterday morning
on the terms of a deal which is expected to result in the Hong Kong
government building the Chinese navy a new base, and refitting an unknown
number of existing British military bases for use by the People's Liberation
Army.
Mr Hugh Davies, his British counterpart, said: 'There were still some issues
in the defence lands portfolio which need to be sorted out.' It is
understood that the two sides reached agreement yesterday and that it is
being referred to Beijing for ratification.
A sticking point was a Chinese demand that the UK government guarantee
completion of the naval base and refitting of military sites. It is
understood a form of words which satisfies the Chinese but which does not
commit the UK Treasury to pay for the work has been agreed.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Early end to financial rand unlikely: S Africa's finance
minister talks to Tony Hawkins and Mark Suzman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the clearest signal of exchange control policy since the inception of
South Africa's government of national unity, the country's finance minister
has said that the financial rand, the country's investment currency, is not
likely to be abolished 'for some time'.
There has been widespread speculation that the financial rand might be
discontinued later this year. This would be a significant step towards the
abolition of exchange controls; their existence is cited by potential
foreign investors as one of their main concerns.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Derek Keys, reappointed as
finance minister last month by President Nelson Mandela, acknowledged the
pressure for change: 'I don't want to defend the existing situation. I think
it's awful.'
But, at the same time, he set out three preconditions which seem to rule out
the move during 1994. Interviewed shortly after last week's budget, Mr Keys
said it would need a clear international and domestic vote of confidence in
the new government of national unity, an understanding with the trade unions
on the need for wage restraint and higher foreign exchange reserves, which
at present amount to around about six weeks' import cover.
Mr Keys was confident about South Africa's economic prospects, forecasting 3
per cent growth in gross domestic product this year and inflation at no more
than 7.5 per cent.
Responding to questions about the financial rand, however, Mr Keys was
remarkably frank. 'If you had told me when I took the job of minister of
finance that two and a quarter years later I would be sitting with exactly
the same policy on foreign exchange that I inherited, I would have been
disgusted. I have not just not made progress. I have actually regressed.'
An ideal scenario would be that the reserves build up at the same rate as
the speculation increases about the end of the Finrand, leading to a point
at which both of them have developed sufficient momentum that one can do
something for which the markets have really prepared themselves. But if it
doesn't happen and we have speculation increasing while the reserves don't
go up, then this could possibly create a minor crisis.
'But even that could be better than what we've got. We've had this system
now for a very long time. People are absolutely fed up with it.'
One of the most critical factors was confidence in South Africa, said Mr
Keys: 'But we don't have an outstanding vote of confidence at present. Not
just as far as the outside world is concerned - but as far as South Africans
themselves are concerned, building up their assets in this country and
feeling secure about it. Then in my opinion, the (level of) reserves
wouldn't be critical, because you take the chance that the act of doing away
with it was itself a confidence-creating act, and you get great benefit from
that. But I just haven't received that message yet.'
Mr Keys ruled out negotiating an International Monetary Fund loan in advance
of abolishing the financial rand, and which could be held ready to boost
reserves if necessary. 'No IMF loan is going to save you if you get
confidence reading wrong,' said the minister.
Some understanding on wage restraint would also be necessary, he said. 'I
think a compact as such is not on the cards, but I think a tacit
never-expressed understanding is possible.'
Mr Keys accepted that several other African countries had been able to
liberalise exchange controls. South Africa's circumstances, he argued, were
very different.
For about 50 years, said the minister, South African residents had been
unable to diversify their assets. 'You have wealthy residents here in
command of large pools of savings. You have institutions whose entire
management cadre has longed for this opportunity to diversify worldwide.
'So for reasons totally other than those of panic or usual capital flight,
you have a large pool of capital that longs to enter the world.
'Now that's fine. All sorts of good results would flow from that, including
that we would then have plenty of shares available for the investors who
wanted to come in, because they complain because they can't get decent
amounts of SA shares.'
But there was a 'bridging problem,' said the minister: 'A lot will go before
a lot come in. And my advisers tell me that in that first phase interest
rates here could go to 30 per cent. I wouldn't like to see this government
facing the consequences of interest rates going to 30 per cent. I have a
duty to prevent that.'
Mr Keys continued: 'This is a government of national unity, operating on a
basis of consensus. We've marked out enough consensus areas. To try and
include taking a fundamentally new approach to the foreign exchange
situation is not impossible, but its going to take some time.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Abacha vows to end Nigerian military rule: Constitutional
conference opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's head of state, opened the country's
constitutional conference yesterday with a pledge to end military rule once
his regime had found the structure for lasting democracy. He refused,
however, to set a date for quitting office until after the four-month
conference.
Doubts remain whether the 360 delegates at the conference have the power to
shape Nigeria's political future. Gen Abacha described his government's role
in the conference as 'facilitators'.
Mr Adolphus Kabiri-Whyte, the chairman of the delegates, took a more
optimistic view of their powers at the opening session when he thanked Gen
Abacha for giving them a free hand. .
The outcome of the conference will be summarised in November in a report by
a government-appointed commission which will be the basis of next year's
political pro-gramme.
Previous constitutional conferences in Nigeria have been the springboard for
political parties and careers.
The list of delegates of whom 90, including the conference chairman, are
nominated by the government, contains many prominent figures from previous
regimes. They include Mr Shehu Yar'Adua, a leading candidate for the
presidency two years ago, former vice-president Mr Alex Ekwueme, and former
leader of the rebel Biafran state, Mr Emeka Ojukwu.
The most surprising come-back is by Mr Umaru Dikko, who returned from exile
in Britain on Sunday. Mr Dikko is a former minister of transport, whom a
past military regime tried to abduct from Britain for trial.
Although he would not give a timetable, Gen Abacha was specific about ending
military rule.
'We are aware that it is neither in our personal interest nor that of the
nation to perpetuate ourselves in power. Nothing could be further from our
plans.'
It should be clear even to his detractors, said Gen Abacha, that 'once
political parties begin to emerge from the first quarter of 1995, the next
logical process would be activities leading to elections into the various
tiers of governance which the constitutional conference will recommend'.
Gen Abacha's speech seemed to rule out significant changes to the federal
structure of Nigeria and made no reference to renewed protests over the
annulment of the presidential election which was won by Mr Moshood Abiola
last June.
Mr Abiola has been in detention at an unknown location since last week
following his demands that the military make way for him to become
president.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Taiwan pledges to ease curbs on foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan has promised to relax controls on foreign banks' operations on the
island in a bid to join the future World Trade Organisation and become a
regional financial centre, but bankers cautioned it was unlikely that
changes would precipitate an influx of foreign banks.
A Finance Ministry official yesterday said that regulations would be revised
to eliminate the limit on the number of foreign banks allowed to set up
branches. At present, a maximum of three banks may open a first branch each
year.
Restrictions on the number of branches foreign banks may establish in each
city will also be lifted, said Mr Sean Chen, deputy director of the Finance
Ministry's monetary affairs bureau.
Taipei-based foreign bankers greeted the announcement with guarded optimism,
describing the moves as an effort to make Taiwan more 'user-friendly'.
They cautioned, however, that the authorities had been sending out
conflicting signals in recent weeks, promising to relax some regulations
while simultaneously hinting at tightening others. For instance, it is
widely believed that the minimum capital requirement for foreign banks to
set up a branch will soon be tripled to Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m).
The head of a US bank dismissed the planned relaxation measures as 'form
over substance'. 'They're twitching little buttons here and there, but this
isn't going to make setting up a branch in Taiwan one-tenth as easy as it is
in Hong Kong,' he said.
In any case, many bankers view the local market as over-banked. Sixteen new
privately-owned banks opened in 1992 and, as a result, competition for
business has become ferocious. 'There are a lot of crazy bankers in this
town,' said the head of a North American bank's Taipei branch.
Few foreign banks are expected to seek multiple branches across the island,
as none apart from Citibank seriously targets the consumer market.
At present 37 foreign bank have branches and 22 have representative offices
in Taiwan.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Panetta's reputation for tight discipline pays off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For Leon Panetta, President Bill Clinton's new chief of staff, lessons in
money management began early. He is fond - critics might say too fond - of
telling the story of how his father, who emigrated to the US from Calabria
in the 1930s, 'beat the hell' out of his then 18-year-old son on discovering
he had secretly acquired a credit card. His father, he says proudly, never
had a credit card in his life.
The lessons were well learned and Mr Panetta went on to build his political
career on the kind of rigid financial discipline that has often brought him
into conflict with his fellow Democrats.
However, Mr Clinton's new right-hand man started his political life as a
liberal Republican, mixing, then as now, his hard-nosed stance on fiscal
matters with a softer line on social issues.
That stance soon brought him into conflict with the Nixon White House, where
he served as director of the Office of Civil Rights. Conflict over the pace
at which President Nixon was moving on desegregation led to Mr Panetta being
squeezed out of office in 1970, under the accusation of being too
aggressive, and he quit the Republican party soon after.
Elected to the House for a Californian seat in 1976, Mr Panetta quickly made
budgetary matters his principal area of expertise, and was finally elected
chairman of the House budget committee in 1989.
During his time in Congress, he opposed the balanced budget amendment as a
gimmick, but unlike many of his fellow Democrats he advocated constantly
that any new spending programmes had to be financed either by tax rises or
cuts elswhere. This earned him the reputation among party critics of being a
budget chairman first and a Democrat second.
His record as budget hawk, coupled with his outspoken criticism of Mr
Clinton's economic programme during the 1992 presidential election campaign
for being soft on the deficit, made his eventual nomination as head of the
Office of Management and Budget all the more surprising.
Mr Panetta's successor, former budget office deputy Ms Alice Rivlin, is as
hawkish on budget matters - if not more so - than her old boss.
Mr Panetta delivered handsomely for his president, pushing through, as Mr
Clinton acknowledged yesterday, the first two budgets to be adopted on time
for 17 years and 'three years of deficit reduction in a row for the first
time since Harry Truman'.
Mr Panetta's record of dogged and successful management has contrasted
sharply with the impression of disarray elsewhere in the Clinton White
House.
But his tenure at the budget office has not been all plain sailing.
Mr Panetta stunned Washington and infuriated Mr Clinton in April last year
by an extraordinarily frank interview in which he admitted that the
president's legislative programme was in deep trouble in Congress.
That was all forgotten yesterday as Mr Clinton hailed 'the budget director
who began to slay the deficit dragon.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Threat to Nasa's space station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Representatives could this week move to force the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to abandon its Dollars 30bn (Pounds
19.3bn) space station project.
The project last year survived by a single vote in the House. The Clinton
administration is predicting a more comfortable margin this year, but
congressional opponents claim they have the votes to kill the project
outright.
The House appropriations sub-committee has proposed cuts of Dollars 240m in
Nasa's budget for fiscal 1995, but has left the space station budget intact,
at around Dollars 2.1bn. Nasa has requested a total budget of Dollars 14.3bn
for 1995.
The sub-committee is instead proposing cuts of Dollars 127m to the space
shuttle programme, Nasa's manned space flight project. The shuttle will fly
eight missions next year instead of nine, and plans to upgrade hardware have
been postponed or abandonned.
However, in the House vote, which could take place as early as today,
opponents of the planned station are likely to introduce an amendment to
kill it completely.
The amended bill would then go to the Senate where, within the next two
weeks, the Senate sub-committee, in its parallel consideration, is likely to
recommend cuts of up to Dollars 600m in Nasa's budget.
Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa administrator, whose agency has taken a 30 per cent
budget cut over the past two years, has pleaded with senators not to slash
his budget again.
However, any reconciliation of the amendment to abandon the station from the
House and the proposed cuts of Dollars 600m from the Senate would be likely
to mean the end of the space station.

FT  28 JUN 94 / California to discuss cover for quakes
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Governor Pete Wilson of California was yesterday due to meet representatives
from some of the country's biggest insurers to discuss the gathering crisis
over earthquake insurance in the state.
The meeting was prompted in part by a decision two weeks ago by Farmers, the
Los Angeles-based insurer owned by the UK's BAT, to stop writing new
homeowners' insurance policies in the state.
Under Californian insurance rules, earthquake cover has to be made available
on all homeowners' policies. Farmers, which puts its losses from the January
earthquake at more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 658m), said it wanted to reduce
its exposure to such catastrophes.
Twentieth Century, another of the state's biggest insurers, has also stopped
offering cover since the January earthquake, which is estimated to have cost
the insurance industry Dollars 6.6bn. Its move was part of a plan agreed
with Mr John Garamendi, the state's insurance commissioner, to return it to
financial health.
The meeting with insurers follows a move by Mr Garamendi last week to extend
the so-called Fair Plan - an insurance scheme adopted after brush fires in
Southern California rendered many homes uninsurable - to homes exposed to
earthquake risk.
Under the Fair Plan arrangement, uninsured risks would be pooled, and spread
between the insurers according to their market share in the state.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Mexico Elections: Carpizo's standing boosted by abortive
offer to quit - Mexico's interior minister is back, and stronger than ever.
But who was he criticising?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jorge Carpizo, Mexico's interior minister, could hardly have predicted
the outcome. But in deciding to resign from his post on Friday, and then
changing his mind under pressure on Sunday, he appears to have bolstered his
position in the government. He came back to the job after most of the
political parties and scores of non-partisan groups pleaded with him to
stay. President Carlos Salinas spent two days in talks with him in a finally
successful effort to make him withdraw his resignation.
The wide show of support has given Mr Carpizo, respected for his
independence and integrity, more authority than other members of the
government. Hardline factions in both the governing and the opposition
parties may find it more difficult to challenge him, or the Electoral
Institute that he presides over, in coming months.
Still, the alarm that greeted his resignation has underlined the fragile
political situation in Mexico, and the temperamental nature of the man who
will play the key role in overseeing the elections. That so much seemed to
depend on Mr Carpizo and his willingness to stay reflects how much further
the government has to go in building credibility for the electoral
institutions.
The attempted resignation has further called attention to the division in
the ruling party between reformists and hardliners, which may surface again
before or after the poll.
While Mr Carpizo was ambiguous in giving reasons for his resignation, there
seems little doubt that frustration with elements of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) played a part. He was appointed
interior minister in January, 10 days after the Zapatista revolt in the
state of Chiapas, replacing the hardline Mr Jose Patrocinio Gonzalez
Garrido. A former rector of the National University, head of the National
Human Rights Commission and attorney-general, he revealed earlier this year
that he is not even a member of the ruling party.
Within weeks of his appointment Mr Carpizo helped persuade all the main
political parties to accept far-reaching democratic reforms, ending the
ruling party's control of the electoral apparatus and tightening limits on
campaign spending.
But when resigning on Friday, Mr Carpizo denounced those who were
obstructing his efforts to implement these democratic reforms.
The uproar that followed his resignation reflected fears that the progress
made since January would unravel, and Mexico would face a turbulent
presidential election like that in 1988, when the opposition took to the
streets after reports of widespread fraud.
His resignation letter said: 'I have urged society and the government that
we all work together exclusively for the truth; the only response has been
more lies, more calumnies and more hypocrisy.'
The interior minister reserved his most bitter comments for one political
party which he did not name. 'In my job I promised to be impartial in my
relation all the political parties.
'I am beginning not to be respected by one of the parties, given that I am
not and cannot be in agreement with multiple acts of some of the sectors of
this party.'
The government has insisted that Mr Carpizo was referring to the leftist
opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, which has criticised democratic
reforms as insufficient, and with which Mr Carpizo has been fighting. The
PRD has demanded another audit of electoral rolls, and a reduced role for Mr
Carpizo in the elections.
But leftist politicians and many analysts believe Mr Carpizo was alluding to
the governing PRI, arguing that Mr Carpizo would not resign because of a
difference with the opposition, since he has no obligation to be in
agreement with it.
Mr Carpizo's struggle with certain sectors of the PRI is no secret. The
interior minister has reportedly threatened to resign three times this year
because of opposition within the PRI to implementation of democratic
reforms. Since the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, former
presidential candidate of the PRI, the influence of the hardline faction in
the PRI has risen, possibly exacerbating tensions with Mr Carpizo.
The conservative faction appear to enjoy the backing of Mr Ernesto Zedillo,
the PRI's new presidential candidate. Mr Zedillo has allied himself with
many of the party's old-style politicians such as Mr Carlos Hank Gonzalez,
the powerful agriculture minister, in an effort to shore up his support in
the party.
Recently, Mr Carpizo has become more isolated in the government. Last month
Mr Diego Valades, the reform-minded attorney-general close to Mr Carpizo,
was replaced by a little-known politician with ties to Mr Hank Gonzalez. Ten
days ago Mr Manuel Camacho, the conciliatory peace commissioner in Chiapas,
resigned, citing differences with Mr Zedillo.
Now, however, Mr Carpizo is in the driving seat. It remains to be seen what
he can do with his power.

<TEXT>
The role of White House chief of staff is ill-defined, and different
occupants have performed it in very different styles.
One function they have shared, however, is to take the rap when a presidency
seems to be going astray.
'It's a little bit like being in the Secret Service. Sometimes you take the
bullet,' said Mr Jack Watson, who served President Jimmy Carter as chief of
staff.
Since Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty played with future President Bill Clinton at
Miss Mary's kindergarten in Hope, Arkansas, his departure is being managed
with more grace than is usual on such occasions; indeed, it was Mr McLarty
himself who suggested that he be replaced by Mr Leon Panetta, the budget
director.
Nevertheless, the bullets are coming thick and fast in Mr Clinton's
direction, and Mr McLarty must be hoping his departure will stop some of
them.
His lack of decisiveness in foreign policy continues to irk the US's allies
and to worry US voters, even if administration officials argue, with some
justification, that much of the apparent confusion is unavoidable in the
uncertainties of the post-Cold War era.
In economic affairs, too, Mr Clinton is getting little of the credit for the
current recovery and much of the blame for the rise in interest rates.
Overall, the percentage of those questioned in a Wall Street Journal/NBC
poll who expressed confidence that Mr Clinton has the right personal
qualities to be president has declined from 47 per cent when he took office
to 30 per cent last week. The same poll showed only 37 per cent found him to
be very or mostly honest - a better showing than Mr Ross Perot, the
eccentric Texas billionaire politician, or than the news media, but worse
than Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate.
Mr McLarty joins the long list of Mr Clinton's old friends and fellow
Arkansans who have become casualties of his administration's battles with
itself and with Congress, often to be replaced by politicians more
experienced in Washington's ways such as Mr Panetta.
In outlining the reasons for the reshuffle, Mr Clinton listed a long
legislative agenda that included health care reform, the crime bill,
enactment of the Uruguay Round Gatt agreement, an overhaul of campaign
finance and lobbying laws and a remake of the welfare system.
It was Mr McLarty, however, who mentioned November's mid-term congressional
elections, in which the president's Democratic party is staring at sweeping
losses, as the key to his decision to step aside.
Both Mr Clinton and his fellow Democrats need some legislative successes -
especially an anti-crime bill and a reform of the health care system that is
sweeping enough to justify claims of victory - to lay before a disaffected
electorate if they are to avoid a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the
Republicans, possibly losing control of the Senate or even the House of
Representatives.
Mr Panetta's task as the new chief of staff is to bring a new discipline and
focus to the White House as it tackles these issues. Whether he succeeds,
however, will depend to a great extent on whether he can impart the same
values to the president.

earlier, according to the Trade Ministry, Reuter reports from Mexico City.
The figure took total investment during the administration of President

<TEXT>
Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera last night announced a series of
measures that include controls on foreign exchange transactions, new price
controls covering mass consumption goods and special payments to workers to
help offset inflation.
Mr Caldera, who took office in February, also said that his government would
suspend 'constitutional rights.' It was not immediately clear if this
suspension covered civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, or only
rights associated with freedom of economic activity.
He said his administration was forced to adopt exchange controls by waves of
'rumours and speculation' that sharply drove down the value of the country's
currency in recent months. Venezuela removed exchange controls in 1989 when
the last government initiated market-oriented reforms. These reforms,
however, have generally been discontinued by the Caldera government.
Mr Caldera asserted that the new measures would not be a drag on private
investment.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Arrest of bank executives renews Ecuador drugs fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT

   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ecuador has been the one Andean country to enjoy relative immunity from the
attention of drugs traffickers. But the arrest last week of top executives
of the Banco de los Andes on money laundering charges has renewed concern
that the country is becoming a centre for drug traffickers seeking to
legitimise profits.
Police assert that the bank's general manager, retired rear admiral
Guillermo Duenas, as well as other executives, were involved in laundering
money from the infamous Ecuadorean drug traffickers, Reyes Magos. Four
executives have been arrested and arrest warrants have been issued for 11
others.
Funds were allegedly laundered in the Banco de los Andes - a medium-sized
retail bank - and its offshore operations in the Caribbean, as well as in
the military-owned Banco Ruminahui.
The allegations are the second stage of a case first uncovered in December
1992, which has already led to the dismissal of the general manager of Banco
Ruminahui and the subsequent capture of gang leader Jorge Hugo Reyes.
As a former military official, Duenas is likely to face trial before the
country's supreme court. In their defence, bank officials said the
allegations covered no cash, but only cheques and money transfers from
renowned international banks including Swiss Bank Corporation, Dresdner Bank
New York, Deutsche Bank, Citibank International, Bayerische Vereinsbank, and
Brown Brothers Harriman.
Despite continuing uncertainty about the extent of the scandal, investors
and traders in the financial markets have remained calm. The superintendent
of banks, Ricardo Munoz, assured the 170,000 customers of the Banco de los
Andes that the bank's liquidity was not affected by the arrests.
Accounts in Ecuador, the US and Europe allegedly containing drugs funds, and
the personal assets of the accused bank officials have been frozen for some
time. A recent agreement between the US and Ecuador allows confiscated
assets to be redistributed between the two countries.
Yet the latest scandal raises questions about controls within Ecuador's
financial system. Situated between Latin America's largest drug-producing
and exporting countries, Peru and Colombia respectively, international
observers fear Ecuador could turn into a money-laundering haven for drug
dealers.
Government officials insist that the existing legal framework is sufficient
to control money-laundering. Mr Jose Iturralde Arteaga, an official at the
Superintendency of Banks, says: 'The problem is not that we don't have
adequate laws and regulations, rather it is a lack of enforcement that
permits money-laundering in the country.'
He adds that the recently approved financial sector law grants the police
authority to search suspect financial institutions and confiscate
confidential documents. Yet critics say drug money enters the country
unchecked through any number of illegal channels. Offshore banking
operations, artisan gold trade, and falsified export/import invoicing are
some of the most common ways to launder money, besides cash purchases.
Mr Alberto Acosta, an economic analyst, estimates the amount of money
laundered in Ecuador to be around Dollars 400m annually. 'Only the flow of
narco-dollars can explain the great consumption of luxury goods in a country
in recession,' he says.

<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government may have to intervene to help local insurance
companies hit by the country's banking crisis, according to Mr Konrad
Firgau, the Venezuelan superintendent of insurance.
Mr Firgau said yesterday that some of the frozen deposits held in seven
commercial banks, closed by the government on June 14, held the technical
reserves of insurance companies. As a result he said, at least two insurance
companies could face state intervention.
Insurance companies are obliged by law to maintain 40 per cent of their
premiums as 'technical reserves'.
The banks closed down by the government were Amazonas, Bancor, Barinas,
Construccion, La Guaira, Maracaibo and Metropolitano, all of which were
controlled by private investors.
Some of them were the central organisations in financial groups which
included insurance companies. The government also shut down an industrial
finance company, Fiveca.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Brazil expected to limit issue of new currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's central bank is likely to be limited to issuing Dollars 9bn (Pounds
5.9bn) of the country's new currency, the real, between its launch on Friday
and April next year.
The limit is one of the key mechanisms the government hopes will prevent
inflation creeping into the new currency.
In the past, governments have relied on printing increasing amounts of
currency to pay debts, leading to inflationary spirals.
The government is still finalising the details of the currency launch, which
it will announce later this week. However, it has already said the real will
be linked at parity to the US dollar for an 'indeterminate' time.
It is also expected that the Dollars 9bn limit, as well as interim
three-monthly targets, will be set in law and monitored by a strengthened
National Monetary Council, a body of senior Ministry of Finance and central
bank officials.
The present monetary base is very low at about Dollars 3.5bn, reflecting the
effects of inflation of nearly 50 per cent a month on the local currency,
which has seen the value of notes and coins decline steadily in dollar
terms.
However, if inflation falls when the new currency is introduced, as is
widely expected, the dollar value of the notes and coins in circulation is
likely to be far greater than at present.
'The limits are difficult because they can't be too tight nor too lax,
otherwise you run into credibility problems,' according to Mr Pedro Malan,
central bank president.
To allow for short-term problems, the law is likely to let the bank relax
issue limits for one-month periods. However, any breach of the limits would
have to be corrected later.
The law creating the new currency is also likely to contain a reference to
gradually increasing the autonomy of the central bank, a move it has been
seeking for some months.
However, it is unclear how substantial these reforms will be, especially
since the often populist President Itamar Franco is suspicious of the bank
and its policy of keeping interest rates high.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Nasa space station at risk: House may force agency to
abandon Dollars 30bn project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Representatives could this week move to force the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to abandon its Dollars 30bn (Pounds
19.3bn) space station project.
The project last year survived by a single vote in the House. The Clinton
administration is predicting a more comfortable margin this year, but
congressional opponents claim they have the votes to kill the project
outright.
The House appropriations sub-committee has proposed cuts of Dollars 240m in
Nasa's budget for fiscal 1995, but has left the space station budget intact,
at around Dollars 2.1bn. Nasa has requested a total budget of Dollars 14.3bn
for 1995.
The sub-committee is instead proposing cuts of Dollars 127m to the space
shuttle programme, Nasa's manned space flight project. The shuttle will fly
eight missions next year instead of the scheduled nine, and has postponed or
abandoned plans to upgrade some its hardware.
However, in the House vote, which could take place as early as today,
opponents to the station are likely to introduce an amendment to kill the
planned space station completely.
The amended bill would then go to the Senate, where within the next two
weeks, the Senate sub-committee, in its parallel consideration, is likely to
recommend cuts of up to Dollars 600m in Nasa's budget.
Mr Daniel Goldin, Nasa administrator, whose agency has taken a 30 per cent
budget cut over the past two years, this month pleaded with senators not to
slash the Nasa budget again.
But because the quirky Congressional appropriations process forces Nasa to
compete for funds with the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, both of which have large
budgetary mandates, Nasa will probably have to bear a heavy burden.
Any reconciliation of the amendment to abandon the station from the House
and the proposed cuts of Dollars 600m from the Senate would be likely to
mean the end of the space station.
'I don't know how to logically cut and maintain the balance,' Mr Goldin
said, when pressed by the senators on how Nasa would deal with a worst-case
scenario budget of Dollars 13.7bn. 'If we have to go below (Dollars 14bn),
we could lose either a space station or we could lose a major science
mission.'
Many on Capitol Hill think losing the space station is exactly what Nasa
needs.
A report issued in March by the Congressional Budget Office - Congress's
independent budget authority - concluded that Nasa would be unable to keep
the space station within budget, and another one issued last year by the
General Accounting Office, the government audit agency, reported that Nasa
had underestimated costs on 25 of its 29 large projects.
There is also an 'anti-big science' atmosphere in Congress, where many
believe the applications from projects such as the space station are too far
removed from everyday reality.
'This space station will cost far more than its sticker price and will
continue to displace more cost-effective space research,' said
Representative Dick Zimmer, a New Jersey Republican who will lead the charge
against the station along with Representative Timothy Roemer, an Indiana
Democrat. 'It's a case of too much money for not enough science.'
The station will study the effect of gravity on humans, to enable further
space exploration, and will undertake a number of micro-biological and
medical experiments, with the aim of producing new vacc ines.
The station has so far cost around Dollars 10bn and legislators report
Nasa's public relations machine is in high gear as the agency attempts to
save the space station from being blasted away before it ever gets a chance
to blast off.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Jack's armies mass for battle - Ireland plan
to add another chapter to their soccer legend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jack Charlton, the irascible - and now censured - English manager of the
Irish World Cup team, commands two armies in the US. The first comprises 22
fit, competitive young men and a carefully organised support team of
physiotherapists, shirt washers, press officers and so on. His other army is
a huge, good-humoured rabble.
Jack's two armies join forces again today, when Ireland play Norway at
Giants Stadium, New Jersey, in the last of their first-round Group E
matches. With Group E almost exactly evenly poised, it is make-or-break day
for Ireland, as well as for Norway and for Italy and Mexico, who clash in
the other Group E game, in Washington.
In New Jersey 10 days ago, Jack's players overpowered Italy while his fans
outnumbered and outsang the Italian fans. In Orlando last Friday, Jack's men
seemed stunned by the heat and humidity. The players were caught by the pace
of Mexico and the supporters surprised by the number and voice of the
Mexican fans.
Regardless of what happens to the team, the Irish fans will go home with a
tall tale or two to tell. The supposedly unsophisticated Irish have already
outplayed the aristocrats of Italy.
And a lot of the fans who say they don't care if Jack's team win or lose
know by heart all the possible permutations of quarter-final and semi-final
matches in which Ireland might play. But first they have to win or draw
today.
Anyway, the secret is out. After the opening win against Italy, it dawned on
a lot of people that this Irish team were something more than the collection
of over-achieving scuffers who had clawed their way to the quarter-finals in
Italy four years ago.
Charlton has been able to add the mid-field power of Roy Keane and the
defensive pace of Phil Babb to his team. Another youngster, Jason McAteer,
has made two impressive appearances as substitute. If there are weaknesses,
they are at centre-forward and goalkeeper: the two most important positions
on any team.
Charlton only brought four attackers along and has only played one at a
time, preferring to field a fifth good mid-fielder rather than a second
mediocre striker. This allows him to stick to his strategy of defence in
depth and attack on the break. But he has also brought in John Sheridan to
orchestrate a more measured passing game.
Ireland's chief weapon used to be the long high ball aimed at the head of
Niall Quinn or Tony Cascarino or John Aldridge. Cascarino and Aldridge
remain, but now Ireland's spearhead is speed down the wings, particularly
from full backs Terry Phelan and Denis Irwin.
Both are suspended for today's game. This gives Charlton a problem, but also
an opportunity. He can give McAteer a start and also pick the most exciting
youngster in his squad: Gary Kelly of Leeds. Kelly lacks experience, but
where Irwin is fast and Phelan faster, Kelly is fastest.
A lot of Irish fans wish Charlton would pick another Kelly: Alan, the
Sheffield United 'keeper. Many thought that Pat Bonner, having broken an
Irish record for caps in warm-up games, would be relegated to the
substitutes bench.
Bonner is dependable. He dominates in the air and neither makes basic errors
nor indulges in the unnecessary flashiness with which Jorge Campos of Mexico
dealt with even quite straight-forward Irish shots last Friday.
The problem is the perennial one when assessing goalkeepers. Mexico's Luis
Garcia beat Bonner with two hard and accurate shots. Might another man have
reacted quicker, dived faster, reached further, and perhaps saved a goal? It
is impossible to tell. The nagging suspicion remains that Bonner will not
reach shots that other goalkeepers in this tournament might save.
Nevertheless, the Irish hold a slight edge today. A draw means they would
finish above Norway and at least third in the group.
The temperature has been in the 90'c in New Jersey in the last few days, but
it is still cooler than in Orlando. The Norwegians are no more accustomed to
heat than Ireland and must do the attacking. The setting is perfect for
Ireland to add another chapter to their myth.
Charlton, meanwhile, has been adding to his. He began a running battle with
Fifa during the weeks before the World Cup, complaining ceaselessly about
the heat and the rules which effectively forbade giving players drinks
during play.
During the first two games he would not sit obediently in his seat. He stood
on the bench, strayed from the painted box around it, berated Fifa
officials, linesmen and referees, coached players (which is against the
rules) and found countless ways to give his players water.
After the Mexican match he again criticised Fifa for forcing his team to
play at noon in Florida and refused to answer questions he did not like.
Now he has been suspended from the touchline for 'misbehaviour.' This need
not be a handicap. It might even help.
Players like the way Charlton stands up for them, and the fans love him for
trying to outwit Fifa's pompous officials.
But the fans will not allow Charlton and his team all the fun. They are part
of the story, too. Already there are tales to match the myths of Irish
bravado which came back from Italy four years ago.
On a flight from Florida last Friday, an Ireland fan told me a tale.
The night before the Ireland-Mexico game, he said, a group of fans in
Orlando had found a bar which advertised that it was open all night. Better
than a hotel, they thought, and went in. In the early hours the manager said
that he was locking up and going home. The fans saw him to the door, locked
it, and put a glass on the bar to collect money for the drinks.
The manager called the police. Hearing that European soccer hooligans had
captured a bar, the police sent 16 squad cars. They encircled the building.
When all the police were armed and in place, an officer was sent to knock on
the door. It opened.
An Irish fan put his head out, surveyed the scene, and started singing Danny
Boy. One by one the fans trooped out, glasses in hand, singing along.
Nobody, said the man who told me the tale, was charged.
For Jack and his lads it has all, so far, been too good to be true.

Romanian striker Florin Raducioiu, who scored two goals in his team's

Raducioiu was penalised for challenging US defender Marcelo Balboa. Romania

against the third-place team from Group C, D or E.
Bucharest is agog. Many in the Romanian capital said the win against the US

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Italy reshuffle for crucial Mexico game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Injury-weakened Italy face a must-win test against Mexico today while
Ireland battle Norway to unlock Group E, the World Cup's most closely
contested first-round group (see story left).
'It will be a game of life or death,' says veteran Mexican striker Hugo
Sanchez, who describes the Italians as a powerful team with 'a beautiful
soccer history.'
The Italians have reshuffled their team after injuries to defenders Paolo
Maldini and team captain Franco Baresi. In addition, goalkeeper Gianluca
Pagliuca was suspended for two games after being ejected from last
Thursday's game against Norway.
Baresi may be out for the rest of the tournament after arthroscopic surgery
to remove cartilage from his right knee-cap. Alessandro Costacurta will
replace him as sweeper and Luigi Apolloni will play centre-half.
Maldini, nursing a sprained right ankle, is doubtful for the game. If he
doesn't start, Roberto Baggio will captain Italy. Baggio, considered Italy's
most imaginative player and the key to the side's attack, was substituted in
the game against Norway and failed to impress against Ireland.
Mexico's Luis Alberto Alves isn't worried that Mexico has never beaten Italy
in World Cup play. 'History is for museums,' he said.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Germans escape Korean assault to win Group C
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defending champions Germany dodged a major bullet in scalding 120 degree
heat in Dallas yesterday, barely escaping with the most tenuous of 3-2
victories over South Korea, Jurek Martin writes.
With a 3-0 lead at the break, courtesy of a spectacular strike by Jurgen
Klinsmann and some dreadful Korean goalkeeping, Germany seemed in full
command. But the Koreans, who had scored two goals in the last six minutes
to draw with Spain, raised their game to spectacular levels, running at,
through and round a suddenly wilted lettuce of a German defence.
After 52 minutes Hwang Sun Hong broke free on the left and flicked the ball
over the advancing Bodo Illgner; 10 minutes later it was Hong Myung Bo
beating Illgner from 35 yards. Thereafter, as the Germans literally gulped
for air, the Koreans assaulted the German goal. Illgner, so suspect earlier,
made three spectacular saves in the last 15 minutes. Time expired as a
Korean free kick from the edge of the area was deflected over the bar.
It had seemed a formality for the first 50 minutes. Klinsmann's first, after
12 minutes, may have been the most spectacular individual goal of the
tournament. Standing on the penalty spot he flicked up a low cross with his
right foot, swivelled the full circle and, almost parallel to the ground,
hooked a left-foot volley home.
This seem to traumatise poor Choi in the Korean goal. Seven minutes later he
made a complete hash of an opportunistic poke from the right, which
rebounded off the post and left Karlheinz Riedle with an open net.
Matthaus limped off with an apparent foot injury after the second Korean
goal and Klinsmann spent most of the last half hour in his own penalty area.
But his two goals means that, with four to date, he is the tournament's
leading marksman.
The Koreans are on their way home. After what they nearly did to Germany,
every other surviving team will breathe a sigh of relief.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Fresh US healthcare compromise: Senate works on latest draft
that would cover 95% of population by 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate finance committee yesterday began work on a possible
compromise bill on healthcare reform, as arguments swirled over what level
of coverage would meet President Bill Clinton's demand for a universal
health system.
Mr Clinton has already dismissed as inadequate proposals that would have
covered only 91 per cent of the population, but the White House yesterday
withheld its fire from a new draft prepared by Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, that would set a target
of taking care of 95 per cent of the population by the year 2000.
Mr Moynihan was due to present his draft to the committee in a closed
session yesterday afternoon, amid a mounting sense of alarm in Washington
that time is running out for completing a bill before Congress breaks up.
Like proposals floated by some moderate Republicans and conservative
Democrats, the Moynihan plan would eliminate one of the most important but
also most controversial components of Mr Clinton's comprehensive reform: the
requirement that employers provide health insurance to all of their workers
and pay for 80 per cent of its cost.
This employer mandate is flatly rejected by almost all Republicans, making
it virtually impossible to pass, at least in the Senate, where procedural
rules allow a minority to block any action.
The alternative of obliging individuals to buy health insurance, just as
they must buy car insurance, arouses little enthusiasm among Republicans;
many can already imagine the slogans in this autumn's election campaign: 'We
wanted to make your employer provide you with health insurance, but the
Republicans wanted you to pay instead.'
Mr Moynihan's draft would avoid both employer and individual mandates, and
instead rely on incentives to companies which do provide insurance to their
workers. Low wage businesses that pay 80 per cent of their employees' health
costs would receive cash subsidies from the government, while small
companies paying at least 50 per cent of their employees' costs would be
eligible to enrol in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, a
flexible and generally well-regarded scheme which currently covers most
government workers.
This programme offers federal employees a menu of different private sector
health plans, with an 'open season' once a year in which they can switch
from one plan to another.
In order to finesse Mr Clinton's demand for universal coverage, Mr Moynihan
would establish a National Health Care Commission if 95 per cent of the
population does not have insurance by the year 2000. Congress would be
required to act by a specified deadline on the commission's recommendations,
which would take effect automatically if Congress did nothing.
Mr Moynihan's scheme is similar in many respects to a plan drafted by a
group of centrist Republicans and Democrats on the finance committee, and it
was welcomed by Senator John Chafee, one of the authors of that plan and one
of the principal Republican spokesmen on healthcare.
White House officials yesterday welcomed the Moynihan proposals as a sign of
progress, and pointedly refrained from criticising its goal of 95 per cent
coverage.
'We didn't put a number on it. Universal is a plan that covers everybody,'
said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary.

FT  28 JUN 94 / White House irritates advocates for Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Americans interested in sub-Saharan Africa are a small and beleaguered band,
who generally welcome any attention from the administration with desperate
gratitude.
Yet a two-day White House conference addressed by President Bill Clinton,
Vice-President Al Gore and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, not to
mention secretary of state Warren Christopher and national security adviser
Anthony Lake, has accomplished the remarkable feat of irritating even
Africa's most devoted advocates.
Several experts who had been told they would be asked did not receive
invitations, and most members of the congressional black caucus stayed away,
partly in protest at the administration's policy towards Haiti, and partly
because they felt they had been asked as an afterthought.
The conference, due to be addressed late yesterday by Mr Clinton, was billed
by the White House as an attempt to refocus attention on issues such as
sustainable development, responses to internal conflicts, support for
democracy and human rights, and enhancing bilateral trade and investment
ties.
But the idea of an occasional gathering of the great and the good has drawn
criticism as being no substitute for continuous attention to the continent's
problems. 'It is the typical Clinton method: you get 150 of the brightest
minds you can find into the same room, and come up with the lowest common
denominator,' sniffed one Washington diplomat.
And while Mr Mandela, in a videotaped message, called on the US to become
'the leading partner in the most novel and challenging project since the
Marshall Plan', Mr Lake warned the US's willingness to get involved was
constrained by lack of budget resources and by the US public's doubts about
overseas intervention.
Although Mr Lake acknowledged that genocide had taken place in Rwanda - a
question on which the State Department has equivocated, to the outrage of
human rights groups - he offered little prospect of future US action.
With the end of the cold war and South Africa's transition to democracy, as
well as the unhappy experience of humanitarian intervention in Somalia, the
US has been pulling back from Africa.
The Central Intelligence Agency, for example, plans to close 15 stations in
Africa, which it says existed not to gather information about Africa but to
monitor and recruit eastern bloc officials.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Cameroon seek face-saving win
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cameroon and Russia, both stricken by player rebellions, need face-saving
Group B wins today. Unfortunately, they are playing each other.
Cameroon - only one point so far in a group that also includes Brazil and
Sweden - have a chance of qualifying for the second round if they beat
Russia in San Francisco.
Russia - without a point - have only a theoretical chance of advancing but
want a win to restore their battered dignity.
'It will be very hard against the Russians,' said Cameroon coach Henri
Michel. 'But if we set our own troubles aside, I think we can win,' he said,
referring to a continuing squabble between Cameroon players and their
soccerfederation over unpaid wages. Cameroon's goalkeeper, Joseph-Antoine
Bell, the reported leader of the players' rebellion, has said he is
quitting.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Unfancied Saudis still confident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holland, a team full of stars, were mightily fancied. Saudi Arabia,
contesting their first World Cup finals, were not.
Yet with two Group F matches remaining - Morocco vs Holland and Belgium vs
the Saudis, both tomorrow - Saudi Arabia may have a fractionally better
chance than Holland of making the second round.
Belgium leads the group with six points. Holland and the Saudis have three
each, and the same goal difference. But the Saudis lead Holland on goals
scored by three to two.
Saudi mid-fielder Fuad Amin predicts that his team will beat the Belgians.
'We're going to win,' said Amin, who scored the winner in Saturday's 2-1
victory over Morocco and the team's only goal in their 2-1 defeat by
Holland.
'We represent Saudi soccer and the whole Arab world. God willing, the next
game will be a great victory.'
A draw against the Saudis would clinch first place in Group F for Belgium,
but their coach, Paul Van Himst, said the team would be playing to win.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Airlines in plea to Clinton on UK flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six US airlines yesterday wrote to President Bill Clinton urging him to
intervene to break the current deadlock in efforts to liberalise airline
services between the US and the UK.
The airlines - including United Airlines, Trans World Airlines, Northwest
Airlines, Federal Express, Tower Air and Unted Parcel Services - are
concerned about the possible repercussions involving transatlantic airline
services should the two countries fail to negotiate a new air agreement this
year.
The US Department of Transportation walked away last December from
negotiations on air liberalisation following the UK's refusal to open up
London's Heathrow airport to all US carriers immediately.
The DOT has also indicated it was not prepared to approve a recent marketing
agreement between Delta Air Lines, the third largest US carrier, and Virgin
Atlantic which would enable Delta to gain access into Heathrow.
In May, Britain said it was ready to approve the transatlantic partnership
between to encourage greater competition and consumer choice on flights from
Heathrow airport to the US market.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, has already agreed to approve the
Delta-Virgin deal and has also offered the US airlines greater access into
UK regional airports as well as London's Stansted airport as part of a new
air liberalisation package.
The six US carriers wrote to Mr Clinton saying it was important for the US
to resume negotiations as soon as possible.
Since it was impossible to achieve full and immediate liberalisation, the
airlines suggested the new negotiations should seek 'realistically
obtainable' opportunities in the short term setting the stage for a 'full
open skies regime' in the future.
This approach would appear to meet the UK's long-standing position of a
gradual three-stage process of liberalisation in UK-US air services.
However, the US authorities are under pressure from other airlines,
especially American Airlines, which have pressed Washington to block
negotiations unless the UK opens up Heathrow, the world's largest
international airport.
The initiative of the six US carriers also comes as Mr Clinton's National
Economic Council is about to make recommendations to the White House on
whether to renounce the current air agreement between the two countries.
This could lead to cuts in the number of flights between the US and the UK.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Brown in Brazil to boost US business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Raytheon Company of Massachusetts yesterday received a boost in its hotly
contested bid for a multi-billion-dollar Brazilian radar project with the
visit to Latin America of Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary.
The SIVAM project for the Amazon is a combination anti-drug, air traffic
control and environmental scheme, also sought by Alcatel/Thompson of France.
The first phase of the project alone is worth an estimated Dollars
1bn-Dollars 1.5bn.
Mr Dennis Picard, Raytheon chairman, is among the 22 company heads
accompanying Mr Brown on his trade and investment mission. Also in the
delegation is Mr Arthur Pilzer, a vice president with the US Export-Import
Bank.
Mr Pilzer said the US was determined to offer a competitive finance package
consistent with the rules agreed by the industrialised countries. At one
point yesterday the delegation was in touch with Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank
chairman, in Washington.
Mr Brown, who successfully lobbied Saudi Arabia for two multi-billion-dollar
contracts for aircraft and telecommunications, has made export promotion a
key tenet of the administration's foreign policy. He was on the telephone
yesterday with President Bill Clinton, who was also brought into the bidding
effort for the Saudi contracts.
Mr Brown has been telling his Brazilian hosts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo the US 'intends to compete and win'.
Part statesman, part preacher and part politician, Mr Brown is a powerful
sign of US interest in a country which needs to get its currency under
control. He races from meetings to receptions to briefings in a cavalcade of
cars and vans, accompanied by sirens and leather-jacketed motorcycle police.
To stress the importance of raising living standards, he visited two
impoverished neighbourhoods. He headed two soccer balls at a neighbourhood
centre, supported by Xerox. At a school he sat on a small chair listening to
a boy stumble as he read to him.
Mr Fernando Opitz, Rio Stock Exchange vice chairman, has seen US officials
promote 'partnership' between US and Brazil for years. 'We've never seen
anything like this before,' he said.
Mr Pilzer announced that the Eximbank was ready to lend money to Brazilian
state-owned companies. 'We view Brazil as a market we could do a lot of
business in within a few years,' he said.
The Eximbank has not lent Brazil or its state-owned companies money for at
least eight years.

Westinghouse Electric of the US has raised the temperature in the
highly-competitive power station market by launching a new gas turbine
claimed to be the world's largest and most efficient, writes Andrew Baxter
in London.
The 230MW turbine creates a challenge for rivals in the power generating
equipment industry. Customers are looking for larger gas turbines and can
save millions of dollars of fuel costs through greater thermal efficiency.
The US group's new turbine, the 501G, is designed to serve markets which
require electricity at 60 hertz (cycles) - North America and parts of Asia.
With a steam turbine added to create a combined-cycle system, the turbine is
expected to provide a net efficiency of 58 per cent.
The Westinghouse turbine was developed in collaboration with its technology
partners Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and FiatAvio of Italy.
Westinghouse and Mitsubishi will both make the 501G, with the US company
using its North American manufacturing network and MHI its Takasago works.
Both expect to ship the first machines in 1996.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Ford plans Dollars 50m China investment -
US giant signs joint ventures with two components makers

Ford Motor Company is to spend more than Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) on its
first motor components manufacturing investment in China.
It said yesterday it had signed joint venture agreements with two Chinese
components makers, in what it intends to be the first substantive step
towards assembling vehicles in China.
The company, which has been relatively slow in comparison with its western
rivals in establishing a presence in China, signed agreements with Shanghai
companies engaged in producing plastic automotive items such as instrument
panels and in making safety glass.
Ford's partners are the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) and
the Yao Hua Glass Works. Both ventures are expected to get under way this
year.
China has told international automotive makers that before they become
involved in vehicle assembly in China they must show their commitment by
investing in the components sector.
Beijing has placed a freeze on new entrants to vehicle manufacture and
assembly until 1996.
Mr James Paulsen, president of Ford China Operations, said the new
partnerships 'represent the beginning of our manufacturing presence in this
important new market and the chance to show our strengths and commitment'.
Ford is negotiating other deals with components makers. General Motors and
the big Japanese car makers are simultaneously engaged in a similar
exercise.
Yen Feng is the largest supplier of automotive trim components in China,
while Yao Hua is said to have the highest quality glass fabrication line in
China.
Ford, which is in the process of a global reorganisation aimed partly at
establishing a much greater manufacturing presence throughout Asia, is also
investigating electronics, engine management, cooling and air conditioning
systems as other potential areas for collaboration with Chinese enterprises.
Ford officials declined to give a breakdown of the Dollars 50m investment
between the two ventures. Both agreements are subject to final approval by
the Chinese government. Ford is taking a 51 per cent stake in both ventures.

Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the opposition Social
Democrats claimed a moral victory yesterday in the state elections in east
Germany's Saxony-Anhalt, and demanded the right to lead the next government.
Only one seat separated the two leading parties, with 37 seats for the CDU
and 36 seats for the SPD, after the final results were announced.
In the event, they may be condemned to govern together, thanks to the 21
seats gained by the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed former
Communist party, with which neither will countenance any form of coalition.
Mr Kohl said the results were a good omen for a clear victory for his party
and his ruling coalition in the general elections on October 16.
The biggest losers in the state elections, the latest in Germany's 19-poll
election marathon this year, were the minority Free Democrats, the junior
partner in coalition with the CDU in both Bonn and Magdeburg, the state
capital.
They received only 3.6 per cent, 9.9 points less than in 1990, and therefore
fell below the 5 per cent threshold needed to enter the parliament.
Final results, with a turnout of 54.9 per cent, gave the CDU 34.4 per cent
of the vote, 4.5 points less than the 1990 state elections, while the SPD
gained 34 per cent, up 8 points.
Mr Christoph Bergner, the CDU prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt, declared
himself in favour of a grand coalition, claiming the right to lead it as the
head of the largest group.
However, Mr Gunther Verheugen, secretary general of the SPD, said the result
was a clear defeat for the ruling coalition, and his party would consider
forming a minority government. The Bundnis 90/Greens party, with five seats,
or 5.1 per cent of the vote, down 0.2 points from 1990, said it would do
'everything possible' to support Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the SPD's leading
candidate, in forming the next government.
A minority SPD/Green government, having a total of 41 of the 99 seats, would
have to depend on support from either the CDU or the PDS.
Mr Kohl played a big part in the party campaign, holding a string of rallies
across the state and attracting bigger crowds than any of the opposition
politicians.
He said that only six months ago the CDU was dismissed as a certain loser in
the state, but it had recovered to maintain its role as the biggest single
group.
The embarrassment for both Mr Kohl and the SPD is the continuing strong
showing of the PDS. If the party wins seats in the Bonn parliament in
October, it could force them into a grand coalition at national level, as
well as in state parliaments such as Saxony-Anhalt.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: West German inflation at 2.9%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West German consumer prices rose by 0.1 per cent in June from May, taking
annual inflation to a provisional 2.9 per cent, the German Federal
Statistics Office announced in Wiesbaden yesterday. It is the first time
since April 1991 that the headline annual rate of inflation has been below 3
per cent, assuming there is no upward revision. The June figure is the same
as that for May, although last month the final figure was revised upwards to
3 per cent. The preliminary inflation figure is based on data from the
states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hessen, North-Rhine Westphalia and Bavaria.
Price pressure on rents and services subsided but food prices rose,
reflecting seasonal factors. David Waller, Frankfurt
Wholesale prices in Denmark jumped 0.6 per cent in May from April, and
commodity prices rose 0.8 per cent. Wholesale prices had posted a 0.1 per
cent monthly rise in April. Economists in Copenhagen said the increases were
higher than expected but were unlikely to push consumer prices over forecast
levels. Danish consumer prices for May released on June 20 showed a 0.4 per
cent monthly and 1.9 per cent year-on-year rise, slightly lower than market
expectations. The Danish government has forecast consumer prices will rise
2.0 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 1995.
Italian wage inflation stood at an annual 2.5 per cent in May, the same
level as in April. The May figure compares with an annual growth of 4.1 per
cent in consumer prices the same month. Industrial producer prices rose 3
per cent in the year to April.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Moscow woos foreign investors
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's prime minister yesterday made his strongest bid yet for foreign
investment - promising tax holidays and an end to restrictions on capital
movements and land ownership.
Speaking to leaders of foreign companies with substantial investment in
Russia, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin claimed his package of draft laws - which
must still pass through parliament - would improve the meagre investment
record by the end of the year.
'For any normal economy it is a sign of improvement when it moves towards a
realistic investment policy - and Russia has made the first steps in that
direction. 'Never since the start of 1992 (when economic reform began) have
we had a political atmosphere so favourable for a normal course of reforms,'
he told the business group, which is advising Moscow on investment.
Government figures show that foreign investment is weaker than had been
thought. Mr Jakov Yurinson, the first deputy economics minister, told the
gathering that foreign investment had totalled only Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds
1.8bn) over the past five years - and would be no more than Dollars 1bn in
1994.
The government also said yesterday there were signs of economic improvement.
Inflation would be brought down to below 7 per cent a month by the end of
the year - and would fall further to 5 per cent by the middle of next year
and to 3 per cent by its end, Mr Sergei Dubynin, the acting finance
minister, said.
The lengths to which Mr Chernomyrdin was prepared to go appears to signal a
realisation that Russia's maze of regulations and taxes and the growing
power of organised crime gangs are a powerful disincentive to international
capital with other, more stable, developing markets from which to choose. Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the president, this week introduced a decree to crack down on
organised crime, although parliament argues the decree is unconstitutional.
The measures promised by Mr Chernomyrdin are:
A five-year income tax holiday for foreign companies;
An end to restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country;
The right to retain all hard currency earnings from exports;
No import tax payable on materials used for production;
A three-year exemption from any changes in tax legislation - seven years if
the foreign holding is above Dollars 100,000.
Further drafts shown by Mr Chernomyrdin to business leaders yesterday were
plans for the establishment of free economic zones and a new law on foreign
investment.
The group is chaired by Mr Michael Henning, chairman of the consulting
company Ernst and Young, and includes heads of such companies as ABB Brown
Boveri, Coca Cola and United Technologies. The government is also being
pressed, according to one western businessman at yesterday's meeting, to
create either a new ministry to deal with foreign investment or a series of
committees with the power to push through legislation and improve the
climate.
Mr Chernomyrdin laid out a long and tempting list of projects in which he
wanted foreign participation - such as toll highways, bridges, tunnels and
cargo terminals. He said that the government attached particular importance
to the development of small and medium-sized business with the aid of
foreign partners.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Lisbon offer to bridge protestors: Commuters angry over rise
in tolls
</HEADLINE>

Portugal's centre-right government made concessions to militant commuters
yesterday amid a growing campaign of civil disobedience in protest against a
50 per cent rise in the toll for crossing the April 25 suspension bridge
over the Tagus river in Lisbon.
The protests, which continued for the eighth consecutive day yesterday, are
fuelling a controversy over the award of a Es180bn (Pounds 707m) contract to
build a second bridge in Lisbon to a consortium led by Trafalgar House of
Britain.
Riot police intervened on Friday to lift an 11-hour blockade mounted by
angry lorry drivers across the only bridge linking Lisbon with southern
Portugal. Many commuters continued the revolt yesterday by refusing to pay
the toll, honking their horns and paying in large notes or with bags of
small coins.
The government sought to defuse the campaign last night when Mr Joaquim
Ferreira do Amaral, public works minister, announced a 'substantial
discount' for frequent users of the bridge, which is crossed by more than
110,000 vehicles a day.
He also decided to waive the toll altogether during July and August, a
traditional holiday-period concession normally made for only one month. The
opposition Socialist Party (PS) called on the minister to answer questions
in parliament on the toll increase and the award of the contract for the new
bridge.
The government said the rise in the toll for a two-way crossing to Esc150
for cars and Esc720 for lorries was needed to help finance the building of
the second bridge and a Esc112bn railway crossing under the existing bridge.
The civil disobedience campaign against the government has refuelled a
public row between Trafalgar House and the French company Bouygues whose
consortium lost a bid to build the second bridge.
Bouygues claimed yesterday that its offer involved a lower toll price for
the second bridge. 'We proposed the cheapest toll possible because we
realised it could be a very political issue,' a senior Bouygues manager said
yesterday. The company is still hoping that the government will rescind its
decision.
Mr Ferreira do Amaral has told Bouygues the decision to award the contract
to Trafalgar House group was based entirely on recommendations of
independent experts who studied the two groups' proposals for six months.
Mr Joao Morais Leitao, lawyer for the Trafalgar House consortium, said: 'The
fact that the Bouygues group has decided not to present a claim against the
award in my mind clearly shows that they do not have grounds for making such
a claim.'
He said negotiations on the technical aspects of the new bridge were the
first to be completed and were closed by both bidders in January.

Sweden's right-centre government has narrowed the lead held by the
opposition Social Democratic party in the race for the general election on
September 18, but still trails by almost 10 percentage points, according to
two new opinion polls. They gave Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, some
encouragement that a return to economic growth this year would win voters
back to his market reform policies despite record unemployment. A poll in
the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet showed support for the four coalition
parties rising to 40.8 per cent from 39.3 compared to a similar poll in May.
Both polls showed Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party was now more
popular than at the 1991 general election. However, the Social Democrats,
under Mr Ingvar Carlsson, remain clear favourites to form the next
government. Although the party slipped by 1.2 percentage points to 49.5 per
cent in one poll, in the business daily Dagens Industri, it held steady at
50.4 per cent in the Svenska Dagbladet poll.

An historic attempt to form a Dutch government without the Christian
Democrats failed yesterday, creating a chance for outgoing prime minister
Ruud Lubbers to return to power despite his party's heavy losses in the May
general election. Talks lasting six weeks among the other three main
political parties were called off after they failed to agree on cuts in the
Netherlands' social security system. The right-wing Liberals wanted heavy
spending cuts, which were opposed by Labour and left-of-centre D66. The
Christian Democrats and their forerunner parties have belonged to every
Dutch coalition since the first world war and have never been pushed into
opposition.

The forces of Bosnia's Moslem-led government, which have gained ground in
recent fighting, were engaged yesterday in fierce artillery duels with Serb
fighters in the north of the republic. A British soldier was killed in an
exchange of fire with Serb troops on Sunday night near the Moslem enclave of
Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, the United Nations said yesterday. He was the
sixth Briton to die in the conflict. The contact group of US, Russian and
west European negotiators is expected to announce a high-level meeting by
next week at which the warring parties in Bosnia will be pressed to accept a
partition formula. Both sides have in recent days pledged to fight on, in
spite of the ceasefire which came into force on June 10 and initially held
quite well. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the new peace
efforts were doomed to fail because 'Serb soldiers are the only ones who
draw maps on Bosnian territory'.

Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the
former prime minister, will face each other in a run-off election scheduled
for July 10 to select the country's next leader, officials said yesterday.
Preliminary returns suggest the two are clearly ahead of the five other
presidential candidates, but neither obtained the outright majority required
for victory in the first round. Sunday's vote underscored deepening regional
divisions.
Mr Kuchma, who was a director of the former Soviet Union's largest missile
factory and who promised to bring law and order to Ukraine, improve links
with Russia and boost economic performance, won a landslide in the mainly
Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine and the separatist Crimean peninsula,
taking up to 80 per cent of the vote. Mr Kravchuk, who sought to position
himself as the only candidate able to preserve stability and national unity,
won more than 90 per cent of the vote in the less populist, but fiercely
nationalist west. Mr Oleksandr Moroz, the hardline socialist who leads the
dominant bloc in parliament, was placed a poor third.

FT  28 JUN 94 / SPD ready to join Kohl on postal privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrat party said yesterday it was likely to
support a crucial vote to change the constitution and clear the way for the
sale of the postal and telecommunications service, the country's largest
privatisation.
Mr Hans Gottfried Bernrath, the SPD telecommunications spokesman, said the
party leadership was due to endorse the privatisation plans at a meeting
last night, overriding objections from the German Postal Union (DPG).
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government needs a two-thirds majority in the
Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, tomorrow - days before the summer
recess - so that the constitution can be changed and the privatisation can
go ahead.
If the change is approved, the state-owned postal and telecommunications
service which employs 670,000 people will be turned into three joint stock
companies on January 1, 1995: Deutsche Telekom, Postdienst and Postbank, the
post office's banking arm.
Telekom, the first of the three likely to be fully privatised, wants to
offer 30 per cent of its capital to the stock market in 1996. The SPD has
said it will back privatisation if money can be found to guarantee future
pensions payments and other rights.
These safeguards have been mostly agreed but Mr Peter Paterna, the SPD
deputy who chaired the parliamentary postal committee which oversaw the
legislation, said the package before parliament was a 'disaster'.
An independent study forecasts that the three companies would have to find
about DM35bn (Pounds 14.2bn) to cover pensions and other commitments, making
it difficult for them to keep up with their international competitors, Mr
Paterna said.
He accused the finance ministry of being short-sighted for failing to make
more money available.
Burdened with extra liabilities, the share issue price for the companies is
now likely to be much lower and the shortfall will have to be financed by
the finance ministry anyway, Mr Paterna said.
Meanwhile a series of warning strikes and demonstrations which have
interrupted the postal service during the past three weeks were set to
continue as talks between management and the DPG remained deadlocked.

The Serbs will today mark one of the most fateful anniversaries in their

on the battlefield and not around the negotiating table.
The forces of Bosnia's Moslem-led government, who have gained ground in

A British soldier was killed in an exchange of fire with Serb troops on

in Bosnia will be pressed to accept a partition formula.
Both sides have in recent days pledged to fight on, in spite of the
ceasefire which came into force on June 10 and initially held quite well.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the new peace efforts
were doomed because 'Serb soldiers are the only ones who draw maps on
Bosnian territory'.
His remarks may have been directed at a domestic audience on the eve of
today's twin anniversary of the battle of Kosovo, when the Serbs were
subdued by the Turks in 1389, and the 1914 assassination in Sarajevo which
triggered the first world war.
In recent interviews, General Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnian army,
has said his army is entering the 'liberation phase of the armed struggle'.
Commander Eric Chaperon, a UN spokesman, yesterday reported artillery duels
of up to 15 rounds a minute, suggesting that the fighting was unusually
intense.
According to unconfirmed local media reports, some 6,000 Serb villagers have
fled their stronghold in the Mount Ozren area. Croatian radio said 12 Serb
settlements had been captured.
The latest fighting is to the south of the Serb land corridor in the Sava
River valley, a strip of land that is seen by all sides as crucial to the
outcome of the war. The Serbs have vowed to defend the route because it
links Belgrade to Serb-held parts of Bosnia and Croatia. Bosnian Moslem
leaders believe they can capture several towns in the north which were
mostly Moslem before the war.
Croatia, too, hopes that by severing the corridor they would gain the upper
hand against Serb forces who have carved out their own state covering a
third of Croatian territory.
Lord David Owen, the European Union mediator, said yesterday he was anxious
to see talks restarted soon between the Croatian government and the Croatian
Serbs.

Italy's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi suffered his first electoral
setback when opposition candidates won several regional polls, results
showed yesterday. His opponents won weekend run-off votes for mayors,
provincial presidents and a regional council. The results of elections in
137 smaller cities were issued as the Senate president warned that new
national elections could become necessary if the opposition used its slight
majority in the upper house to block legislation. However, political
analysts said the significance of the polls was muted because of the low
turnout, with only about half of the 6m eligible voters casting ballots.

French economic growth in the second quarter was healthy, according to Mr
Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor. He was responding to a
question on the bank's latest monthly survey of 12,000 companies. Mr Trichet
said the economy had 'all the ingredients' for the growth to be 'durable and
provide sound employment'. Inflation would be '2 per cent or less this year
and in the years to come'.
Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portuguese finance minister, said unemployment would not
improve until Portugal's recession-hit economy resumed an annual growth rate
of at least 2 per cent. The government does not expect this to happen until
1995.

<TEXT>
Kazakhstan accused Russia yesterday of cutting off most of the republic's
oil exports, all but paralysing its most lucrative industry.
Kazakhstan's leaders have recently been subjected to strong political and
economic pressure from Russia, which has demanded an equity share in
Kazakhstan's giant Karachaganak natural gas field and is also said to be
seeking a stake in the rich Tengiz oilfield in western Kazakhstan.
The country exports some 17m tonnes of oil a year, of which around 6m tonnes
go to countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent States. The two
export pipelines to the Black Sea both cross Russian territory and are under
Russia's control.
Any cut-off could be part of the pressure by which Moscow has been gradually
choking off Kazakhstan's natural gas and oil flow.
Mr Ravil Shardabayev, Kazakhstan's oil minister, said in a telephone
interview that Russia had severed the republic's oil exports although
Chevron of the US, which possesses rights to develop the Tengiz oilfield,
'is continuing to export its oil in a limited amount'.
Russia's energy ministry in Moscow yesterday would not confirm Kazakh claims
that the flow of oil through the larger of the two pipelines had been
halted, but Russia has long complained that it could export more of its own
oil through the pipelines if they were not carrying the products of others.
In an interview published this month in the Petroleum Argus newsletter, Mr
Yuri Shafrannik, Russian energy minister, said Russia was losing Dollars
300m a year by transporting oil from Kazakhstan and other central Asian and
Caucasian republics.
He added: 'There are joint ventures on the territory of Russia with western
partners which have surrendered the right to transport oil because we are
acting for Kazakhstan's western partners.'
Mr Shardabayev said yesterday that Russia had begun cutting supplies at the
beginning of last month. Mr Bulat Yeleymanov, director of Kazakhstan's state
oil company, told the local newspaper Panorama: 'There is oil, but no
possibility to sell it.' The republic's own internal refinery system has
ground to a halt.
Recent actions by Moscow have brought into question the ability of western
energy companies to negotiate legitimate contracts with the Caspian Sea
region's republics, particularly Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
Moscow this year issued a diplomatic letter to Britain in which it demanded
veto rights over any resource development project on the Caspian, claiming
that without its approval any deal was illegal.
The demand appeared to jeopardise western oil deals both in Kazakhstan and
Azerbaijan.

The Irish government is coming under growing opposition pressure at home to
give its backing to Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing director-general of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as a compromise candidate to succeed
Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.
Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, is to table an
emergency motion in parliament today in an effort to force the government's
hand on the issue.
'There has to be a way of re-engaging Britain with Europe,' Mr Bruton said
yesterday. 'This is Europe's biggest problem now. If Britain moves further
away from Europe, Ireland stands to lose the most because of our trade
dependence. Peter Sutherland is someone who can bridge that gap.
'He is a committed European but one who can speak to the British in terms
which does not provoke their prejudices.'
Mr Sutherland was a former attorney-general in a Fine Gael-led government in
the 1980s, and a former EU competition commissioner. He would have to be a
commissioner to be eligible for the presidency post and the present Fianna
Fail-Labour coalition government has insisted that it has no intention of
replacing Mr Padraig Flynn, Ireland's commissioner, who holds the Social
Affairs portfolio in Brussels.
Ms Mary Harney, leader of the opposition Progressive Democrats party, which
is also backing Mr Sutherland, said yesterday: 'There is no country blocking
Mr Sutherland except his own. There is nobody against him except the Irish
government which is a crazy situation.'

<TEXT>
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the
former prime minister, will face each other in a run-off election scheduled
for July 10 to select the country's next leader, officials said yesterday.
Preliminary returns from across Ukraine suggest that the two men are clearly
ahead of the five other presidential candidates, but neither obtained the
outright majority required for victory in the first round.
Sunday's vote underscored deepening regional divisions.
Mr Kuchma, who was a director of the former Soviet Union's largest missile
factory and who promised to bring law and order to Ukraine, improve links
with Russia and boost economic performance, won a landslide in the mainly
Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine and the separatist Crimean peninsula,
taking up to 80 per cent of the vote.
Mr Kravchuk, who sought to position himself as the only candidate able to
preserve stability and national unity, won more than 90 per cent of the vote
in the less populist, but fiercely nationalist, west of the country.
Results are more sparse from the Ukrainian heartland, but the Interfax news
agency reported that, in Kiev, 42 per cent of the vote went to Mr Kravchuk
and only 19 per cent to Mr Kuchma.
In contrast with neighbouring Belarus, where an outsider won a plurality of
the votes in the first round of presidential elections last week, the five
other candidates were far behind the two leaders. Mr Oleksandr Moroz, the
hard-line socialist who leads the dominant bloc in parliament, was placed a
poor third.
While Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma will return to the campaign trail to
continue the fight over the two main issues in Ukraine - national
sovereignty and the economy - important changes are expected in the
government.
In a move criticised by Mr Kuchma, the president and parliament approved a
new prime minister, Mr Vitali Masol, before the election.
Mr Masol, like Mr Kravchuk, was a Communist party functionary and was
expected to continue the Ukrainian government's lacklustre economic
performance. But some western diplomats and Ukrainian cabinet ministers now
say that Mr Masol has undergone a conversion to the market and is following
the path of Russia's unlikely reformist, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin.
Mr Roman Shpek, Ukraine's reformist minister for the economy, said the prime
minister had asked him to stay on. Senior Ukrainian officials predict that
when Mr Masol asks parliament to approve a new cabinet later this week,
other reformists will be appointed and opponents of change will be sacked.
In what some observers view as an 11th-hour effort to burnish Mr Kravchuk's
economic track record, Ukrainian officials say that the government will ask
parliament this week to approve a number of progressive laws, including
price liberalisation and the abolition of the country's fixed exchange rate
system.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Plans for telecoms infrastructure gather pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rapid acceleration of plans to liberalise the supply of telecommunications
infrastructure across the European Union is likely following the Corfu
summit.
A consultative document could be published as soon as this August setting a
firm timetable for liberalisation, despite continued opposition from
national telecoms operators fighting the loss of their monopolies.
At Corfu the heads of government gave broad support to the recommendations
of the Bangemann group of industry leaders, which called for speedy
liberalisation of EU telecoms infrastructures and services.
Mobile, satellite and other business-related services are already open to
competition. Union governments agreed last year to set a target date of 1998
for the opening to competition of basic 'voice' services, which account for
most of the revenue of the telecoms operators.
However, the question of competing infrastructure, as permitted in the UK,
was left for decision in 1995 with no prior commitment to liberalisation.
The Bangemann group's objectives - to bring forward the decision and secure
a commitment to infrastructure competition - were endorsed by the heads of
government.
A senior commission official said: 'To follow up the recommendations of the
Bangemann group, there is a need for something shorter and punchier in
addition to the green paper. We need a target date for infrastructure
liberalisation.'
The most favoured date appears to be 1998, to coincide with the
liberalisation of telecoms services. However, senior officials in the
Commission's telecoms directorate want to see immediate competition for
infrastructure to supply services - such as private corporate networks  -
already open to competition.
Given the proximity of January 1998, they believe that such a move would
encourage new operators to build infrastructure immediately capable of
extension or adaptation as competition is extended to public 'voice'
services.
They are attracted to the competitive potential of radio and microwave
technology and existing cable television networks. The extent of cable
networks varies widely across the EU, but the conversion of cable systems
could bring early nationwide competition in Germany, Ireland and the Benelux
states.
National operators in France, Italy and Germany believe the process towards
liberalisation is moving too fast. Consultations on the mobile telecoms
green paper in Brussels earlier this month attracted opposition from France
Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and Stet, the Italian state company, to the pace
of planned liberalisation.
The companies asked the Commission to wait until it published plans for
infrastructure liberalisation across the industry. 'Their objections just
amount to more prevaricating,' said the Commission official.
Backing Brussels' move to push forward decisively with liberalisation, EU
heads of government agreed that member states should create a new
ministerial post to co-ordinate all aspects of telecoms development:
political, financial and regulatory.
The summit also agreed that that the Commission should establish a
regulatory framework, concerned with access to markets, compatibility
between networks, intellectual property rights, data protection and
copyright.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Germans likely to take a quiet approach: With looming
elections on its mind, Bonn is expected to be diplomatic in presiding over
EU wrangles

<TEXT>
The German presidency of the European Union has still not begun, and yet
already accusations of German high-handedness are being heard in such
capitals as London and The Hague.
The unseemly wrangle at the Corfu summit over a future president of the
European Commission was precisely the sort of start that German officials
and diplomats were hoping to avoid.
Whether justified or not, the charges about the way Chancellor Helmut Kohl
sought to promote the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier,
against Mr Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, were what senior Bonn diplomats
had feared would happen.
When they take the reins of the EU council of ministers on July 1 for the
rotating six-month presidency, Bonn's officials and ministers will be
bending over backwards to be effective and persuasive, but certainly not
pushy.
'We are very conscious of the sensitivity of some of our fellow member
states, so we see a particular need to be sober and restrained,' a senior
diplomat said last week.
Add to that the coincidence of Germany's marathon election year, with five
state polls and a general election in September-October, and the chances of
an aggressive and high-handed German presidency are extremely slim.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics
minister - the two most important ministers involved - are fighting a
desperate rearguard action to keep their minority Free Democratic party in
parliament at all. Mr Kohl and Mr Theo Waigel, his finance minister, will be
delighted to welcome all opportunities for a televised high international
profile. But their priorities are all domestic until October 16, the general
election day.
'It is one reason Germany has been keen to co-ordinate its presidency with
France next year, and then Spain,' according to one foreign diplomat. 'They
are worried that they will get very little started this year.'
Another argument against expecting too many fireworks from the next six
months is that Germany is anxious not to alienate electors in Finland,
Norway and Sweden, the three future member states that still have to hold
referendums to ratify their accession treaties. Thus any talk of sweeping
institutional reforms at the forthcoming 1996 conference is being firmly
discouraged.
In spite of that, the ministries have been working hard to draw up a clear
programme of EU priorities, which Mr Kinkel will spell out to the German
Bundestag tomorrow.
The first is simply trying to make the Maastricht treaty work. That means,
in particular, putting the reforged relationship between the newly elected
European parliament and the council of ministers on a good working basis.
Germany is determined to take the parliament seriously.
That is one important reason why Mr Kohl wants to agree on a candidate for
the European Commission before July 18 - when that person is supposed to
address the parliament in Strasbourg for the first time. It is also why he
pushed hard in Corfu to have parliamentary representatives fully involved in
the working group preparing for the 1996 conference.
Another aspect of making Maastricht work will be a big effort to promote
ever closer co-operation on both foreign policy and internal security
between the member states.
Thus the whole area of opening up the EU to central and eastern Europe, in
areas of political co-operation as much as market opening, is a clear German
priority. But Mr Kohl and Mr Kinkel will be making every effort to ensure
that EU policy is pushed as much by other member states as by themselves.
The German government has always been keen to promote co-operation on
crime-fighting, anti-drugs operations, and common immigration policies.
As for economic policy, the theme will be deregulation, and the emphasis
will clearly be on firm cost control. It is the one area where there could
be tension between Germany's national interests and its presidential
priorities. For there are election pressures to keep German payments to
Brussels more strictly under control.
Mr Waigel has already promised to be a hard financial task master in fixing
next year's EU budget.

FT  28 JUN 94 / The Delors Succession: The EU's unseemly family feud -
Lionel Barber tracks the rivalry and division that ended in failure to
decide on a new Mr Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the evening of December 9 1991 the leaders of western Europe gathered in
the Dutch border town of Maastricht for final negotiations on a new treaty
on European political and monetary union.
Over dinner in Maastricht City Hall, the conversation turned to the future
of Jacques Delors, the visionary, volatile Frenchman who had contributed as
much as anyone around the table to the cause of European integration.
Delors' second term as president of the European Commission was due to
expire at the end of 1992. It was time to think about a successor.
'It must be one of us,' declared Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, to
general approval.
From his first month in office, in 1985, Delors had steadily accumulated
power. The 1992 Single Market programme, the European Economic Area, the
grand design for political and monetary union - all bore his indelible mark.
Delors had turned into Mr Europe. Next time, Europe's leaders wanted the
Commission president to come from their own ranks.
The president is chosen by unanimous decision of the 12 heads of government
of the European Union, meeting in secret session known as the European
Council. The Maastricht dinner conversation appeared to seal the chances of
one member of this exclusive club - past or present - taking over the top
job in Brussels.
But that solemn pledge of solidarity degenerated over the next two and a
half years into a family feud that culminated in the debacle in Corfu at the
weekend when the UK vetoed the choice of Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
premier. It has also cast the entire process of selecting the president of
the European Commission into question.
The story of the Delors succession offers a rare insight into the manner in
which Europe's leaders conduct business. It is a tale of rivalry between
small and larger states, fear about the preponderance of German power, and
the predicament of the UK inside the European Union - a fact underlined by
British prime minister John Major's calculation in the early hours of last
Saturday morning that isolation among his European partners was preferable
to losing the support of Conservative Euro-sceptics at Westminster.
It is also a story about the mental contortions and hesitations of one man:
Ruud Lubbers, the youngest and longest-serving Dutch prime minister ever,
whose hopes of a new career on the European stage foundered on Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's resentment over his attitude to German unification.
At least two leaders present at that Maastricht summit had their ambitions
fixed on succeeding Delors. The first was Lubbers, a millionaire who came
from a line of Rotterdam industrialists. The Jesuit-educated Lubbers' weak
point was a stubborn streak and a self-appointed mission to 'stand up to the
Germans', says a senior EU diplomat.
The second was Wilfried Martens, a long-serving Belgian prime minister whose
enthusiasm for European political integration infuriated Margaret Thatcher,
the UK prime minister, in the 1980s. A thoughtful man from Flanders, his
chief disadvantage was that he had alienated President Francois Mitterrand,
resisting the French leader's campaign to move the European Parliament
full-time from Brussels to Strasbourg.
In the spring of 1992 Chancellor Kohl, still riding high after the
unification of Germany, informed Martens that he was the best candidate to
head the Commission. Kohl had sent a similar message to Gonzalez the
previous year. But Martens guessed, correctly, that Gonzalez would be unable
to leave Madrid without bringing down his Socialist government.
But the summer of 1992 changed everybody's calculations. Danish voters
rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum, plunging the Union into
crisis. Suddenly, Delors did not look so dispensable. Despite mutterings
from Major, Delors was re-appointed for a third term, albeit for a curtailed
two-year stint ending on January 5 1995.
At that point, EU club rules suggested that the successor to Delors - a
French socialist - should be a conservative from a small member state. As
president of the European People's Party, the umbrella for the Christian
Democrats, Martens looked well-placed. He had the right background (the Low
Countries), and he could count on the support of Lubbers, his most obvious
rival.
'Mr Lubbers always defended my candidature,' recalls Martens, 'He said: I am
not a candidate if you are a candidate.'
Meanwhile, Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, had been thinking of
making a run for the post for some months and was formally asked to enter
the race during a meeting with Major in Downing Street in the spring of
1993. The Brittan candidacy, though clearly a long-shot, appeared to offer
the UK a bargaining chip in the coming negotiations.
By the autumn of 1993, it was clear that Martens' chances of succeeding
Delors were ebbing away. He had resigned as premier a year earlier, his
energy sapped after more than 11 years in office juggling the Flemish and
French factions in a stream of coalition governments. His successor was his
former chief of staff, a little-known Flemish politician by the name of
Jean-Luc Dehaene.
Dehaene's political career advanced under the trade union wing of the
Christian Democrats. He was known as 'the fixer', 'the plumber' or 'the
carthorse'. Despite his vulgar language, scruffy donkey jackets, and greasy
hair, Dehaene was widely recognised as the power behind the premiership in
the late 1980s.
On July 1 1993 Belgium took over the rotating EU presidency from Denmark.
The prospects were poor: the Maastricht treaty was still unratified in the
UK, and the German Constitutional Court had still to pronounce its verdict
on it. Divisions inside the Union were emerging over world trade talks under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. On August 2 the European
exchange rate mechanism collapsed under a wave of speculation against weaker
currencies, forcing members to create a de facto floating exchange rate
system.
For Dehaene, the idea of a run for the Commission presidency could not have
been more remote. His coalition government remained shaky. Labour unrest
threatened. There were calls to abandon the policy of shadowing the D-Mark,
a move which would have jeopardised Belgium's anti-inflation policy.
The 'plumber' pulled out his tool-box and produced plans for a 'social pact'
 -an agreement between government, employers and trade unions which amounted
to Belgium's most ambitious austerity programme since the second world war.
Watching events in Belgium with interest was Chancellor Kohl. His favoured
candidate, Martens, had failed to win the support of the Belgian government
and Lubbers was anathema to him. The only candidate on offer was Sir Leon,
whose free trade views and British nationality were unacceptable to France,
Germany's main partner.
A senior German official says that Kohl was soon impressed with Dehaene's
down-to-earth manner, his energy and his political skills. 'The Belgians are
the artists of compromise because of the precarious nature of their country.
That is very attractive for Kohl who is also a wheeler dealer by nature,'
recalls the official.
A special European Council called in Brussels to decide the location of more
than a dozen new Euro-institutions provided the occasion for their
relationship to develop.
Kohl was desperate to secure the the European Monetary Institute, forerunner
of a future European central bank, for Frankfurt. Putting the EMI in the
same city as the Bundesbank was viewed as 'the absolute minimum' needed to
appease the German public's fears about giving up the D-Mark in exchange for
a single European currency. But the British were holding out for London, and
Lubbers was campaigning for Amsterdam.
One week before the Brussels summit, Lubbers delivered a provocative speech
in the German town of Munster. He suggested that Germany was exaggerating
its role as 'paymaster of Europe'. He said it was unwise to neglect the
interests of smaller member states in a political union. He added that the
Dutch guilder was just as sound an 'anchor' currency as the German mark.
Kohl was furious. He thought Lubbers was underestimating the shift in German
public opinion against Maastricht and the single European currency - a shift
which threatened to undermine his own historic mission to bind a
newly-united Germany into an integrated Europe.
The summit in Brussels on October 29 1993 opened with a torrent of special
pleading, with the Spanish and British at their most aggressive. 'Dehaene
was a model of self-control,' recalls a participant. 'He sat perfectly still
and let the others run out of steam until they realised there was no other
answer (to Frankfurt). That takes a lot of nerve.'
Kohl was so impressed that he asked Dehaene why he had not thought of
putting himself forward as a candidate to succeed Delors. The Belgian
premier was stunned. A friend recalls that he could not imagine that he was
in the same league as Delors. His initial response was to employ his
favourite weapon: silence.
The German approach was the result of prior consultation with the French.
President Mitterrand had already agreed with Chancellor Kohl that, after
Delors, it was a Christian Democrat's turn to head the Commission. Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, later told French journalists that he
had come up with the name of Dehaene.
Around this time, Lubbers talked to Kohl. 'He asked me if I was interested
in the job. I did not exclude the possibility,' recalls the Dutch premier.
'He asked me if I was supporting Mr Martens. We agreed to try to seek a
(joint) Christian Democrat candidate.'
The conversation ended with a promise to talk things over again in the
spring. Lubbers did nothing to encourage the impression he wanted the job;
but Kohl may have deliberately introduced Martens' name to signal to Lubbers
he could not expect German support.
The exchange points to the complex relationship between the two men. Kohl
has never much liked Lubbers, and Lubbers has never much cared for Kohl.
Some blame Dutch uneasiness about their big German neighbour and the
memories of Nazi occupation.
A senior EU diplomat says Kohl cannot abide his manner and his independent
streak. All agree the relationship soured irretrievably during German
unification. Later, in a private moment of exasperation, Kohl declared he
was against Lubbers because he was 'egotistical, anti-German and an
accountant'.
Lubbers was not alone in harbouring doubts about the speed with which Kohl
sought to unify East and West Germany in 1989-90. Mitterrand and Thatcher
shared his concerns. But it was the Dutch leader who spoke out most
forcefully over a dinner at the European summit at Strasbourg in December
1989.
Lubbers began by saying there were dangers in talking about
self-determination and 'one German people'. It was impossible to unite all
the Germans in Europe. He urged Kohl to be clear about the Oder-Neisse line
 -which marked Germany's border with Poland - so as not to 'give
expectations' to Poland's minority German population.
Kohl said Germany had paid for the last war by losing one third of its
territory. He intended to be '100 per cent' clear on the Oder-Neisse line,
but the timing of his statement on it would be his own responsiblity. As the
dinner broke up, one participant recalls Kohl thundering at Lubbers: 'You
have not learnt the lessons of history.'
On January 10 1994, the date of the Nato summit in Brussels, Lubbers was
again asked whether he wanted the Commission job. This time, it was Gonzalez
who failed to receive a clear answer. Fearing that Kohl would renew pressure
on him to run, Gonzalez issued a statement saying he had no intention of
leaving Madrid and that his first choice was Lubbers.
The next approach came from the French. Again, Lubbers declined to give a
firm commitment, citing uncertainty about the upcoming general election in
the Netherlands.
Lubbers admits in retrospect that he may have played into the hands of Bonn
and Paris by giving the impression that he was not interested in the job.
What is more, by this time Sir Leon, exploiting his role in reaching an
agreement in the Gatt world trade talks, was touring Europe's capitals in
the first-ever public campaign for the top Brussels job.
On February 9, Martens visited Dehaene who hinted for the first time that he
was thinking about the Commission presidency.
The truth dawned on Martens two weeks later when he visited Hamburg to
attend the Christian Democrat congress. Chancellor Kohl indicated he might
be interested in backing Martens to be head of the Christian Democrat
grouping in the European Parliament, after the death of Bernard Saelzer,
Kohl's protege. Then the Chancellor added: 'I don't understand why Dehaene
is not a candidate (for Commission president), he handled the presidency (of
the Union) so well.'
The following day, February 23, Delors paid a visit to Madrid to see
Gonzalez. He asked the Spanish premier if he was running. The answer was No.
'In that case, it will be Dehaene,' said Delors, to Gonzalez's surprise.
Soon afterwards, word of the Franco-German push for Dehaene was leaked to
the Guardian newspaper. It looked like a trial balloon to test reaction
among the other member states. The Belgian premier remained silent, though
by some accounts he had not been forewarned.
By April, Lubbers was becoming desperate. He remained committed to Martens,
but was pressing his own candidacy privately in European capitals. Yet his
public position was that he would declare his intentions only after the
Dutch general election on May 3.
Lubbers' position looked all the more vulnerable when Peter Sutherland, the
Irish head of Gatt and a former EU Competition commissioner, announced that
he would leave his post at the end of the year. He then hinted he might be
interested in the Commission job - only to be disowned by the Irish
government.
Minutes after the result of the general election result in the Netherlands,
Lubbers ordered a fax to be sent out formally announcing his candidacy.
Belatedly, he sought to curry favour with Kohl. In a speech in Aachen, he
paid tribute to Kohl as a statesman with vision, and declared that he had
not opposed German unification.
Privately, Lubbers turned bitter about his prospects of winning support from
EU leaders, now that he was ready to step down as prime minister. 'They are
throwing me away like an old sock,' he said.
By this time, France and Germany were increasingly confident of Dehaene's
prospects. It seemed only natural for Kohl and Mitterrand (accompanied by
Balladur) to agree on the Belgian premier as a common candidate when they
met in Mulhouse to co-ordinate positions before the European Council in
Corfu.
Their desire was to select a candidate who would not run the Commission as
his own power base as Delors had occasionally appeared to be doing.
In retrospect, it is clear that the French and Germans overplayed their
hand. Though there was nothing out of the ordinary about Paris and Bonn
reaching a common position, it looked like a diktat to the rest of the
Union. This impression gained force when officials leaked the name of
Dehaene even though the Belgian premier had still not publicly announced his
candidacy.
For the Greek presidency, things were running out of control. The one chance
of avoiding an unseemly row was a 'package', whereby the Commission job
could be traded as one of a number of top jobs in Europe. These included
those of secretary general of Nato and of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, director general of the World Trade
Organisation, and the top civil servant post of the European Council.
But this required diplomatic skill (not least because the Nato, OECD and WTO
jobs were not within the EU's exclusive preserve), and political leadership.
With Andreas Papandreou, the ailing 75-year-old Greek premier, unable to
travel, the job of sounding out EU partners fell to Theodoros Pangalos, the
unpredictable European affairs ministers. Several leaders, including Kohl
and Mitterrand, deemed him too junior to talk to before Corfu.
It was only fitting that the battle for the Delors succession should reach a
climax over a dinner of the 12 heads of government, just as it had begun two
and a half years earlier - this time accompanied by the leaders of Austria,
Finland, Sweden and Norway, the four countries planning to enter the Union
next year.
The setting this time was the Achilleon, a gaudy 19th century palace built
for the Empress Elisabeth of Austria. At a given moment, Dehaene and Lubbers
were invited to leave, to replaced by their deputies - Willy Claes, Belgian
foreign minister, and Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister.
Major opened with a presentation on behalf of Sir Leon Brittan. Kok spoke
for Lubbers, and Claes for Dehaene. Papandreou, visibly weak, then surprised
everyone by calling for an immediate secret ballot - only the second time in
the EU's history that a formal vote has taken place rather than the
customary practice of using a general discussion to reach a consensus.
Eight countries led by France and Germany expressed a preference for
Dehaene: Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal. Three
voted for Lubbers: the Netherlands, Spain and Italy. Sir Leon received the
solitary vote of the UK.
Just before midnight, Papandreou retired to bed. The meeting broke up. But
within a quarter of an hour, it was reconvened under the chairmanship of
Pangalos.
Major sat at the end of the table, well clear of Kohl and Mitterrand. 'This
is not going to be sorted out tonight,' he warned, 'I won't agree to Mr
Dehaene even if the vote is 11 to one.'
Other prime ministers sought to persuade Major to come round, but he was
irreconcilable. The job of the president of the European Commission was 'one
of the most important in the world', he said. 'For the umpteenth time, I am
not going to support Mr Dehaene.' Kok asked why Kohl was against Lubbers. 'I
don't have to explain this,' said the German Chancellor. Kok threatened to
walk out.
President Mitterrand, a veteran of more than 20 European Councils, said it
was clear that a solution could not be reached quickly. Kohl, who had done
so much to promote his protege Dehaene, looked across the table. 'We need
new candidates,' he sighed.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Dollar steadies at above Y100 in New York
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar recovered slightly in New York yesterday after falling to a new
postwar low of Y99.50 during trading in Tokyo on Monday. Analysts estimated
that the Bank of Japan bought between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn (Pounds
645m) supporting the US currency but there was no repeat of Friday's
concerted central bank intervention.
In European trading, fears of a dollar collapse were averted and the dollar
closed in London at Y99.865, rallying to Y100.43 in late New York trading.
It opened in Tokyo at Y100.4. The dollar's weakness caused most European
markets to open lower, before firming as the currency steadied. The FT-SE
100 Index closed at 2,899.9, up 23.3.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Kohl prepares to abandon Dehaene: Search renewed for
acceptable EC president - Italy will attempt to break deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday committed himself to finding a
candidate to head the European Commission who would be acceptable to all 12
member states, as it became clear that EU leaders were starting from scratch
in their search for a successor to Mr Jacques Delors.
'We will talk to everyone involved, and we will work out a proposal,' Mr
Kohl said. 'I am not blind. I want to come up with a result.'
His comments were taken in Brussels as a signal Germany was preparing to
abandon its preferred candidate, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier.
Mr Dehaene was vetoed by the UK at the EU's Corfu summit on Saturday.
Germany, which takes over the EU's rotating EU presidency from Greece on
Friday, has called a special summit in Brussels on July 15 to resolve the
dispute.
'The deadline for my efforts will be midday on Friday, July 15,' said Mr
Kohl. He added that it was essential to reach agreement before the first
session of the new European parliament, which opens on July 18, when the new
presidential candidate is supposed to address the assembly.
A series of prearranged foreign ministers' visits have placed Italy in the
role as a potential broker to break the deadlock. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the
German foreign minister, is due in Rome today for talks with Mr Antonio
Martino, his Italian opposite number. Mr Martino is due to visit London on
Wednesday - to be followed on Thursday by Mr Kinkel.
Mr Kinkel insisted that Mr Dehaene remained in the running, saying: 'We do
not change candidates like we change our shirts.' But the German chancellor
would not confirm he was still backing Mr Dehaene, indicating that the
selection process was starting with a clean slate.
The Dutch premier Mr Ruud Lubbers, who withdrew on Saturday, is unlikely to
rejoin the race. Although the Dutch, would like to field another candidate,
the collapse of talks in the Hague yesterday on a new Dutch coalition meant
Dutch officials could not see any figure of calibre becoming available.
The widely canvassed candidacy of Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish
director-general of Gatt, is thought unlikely to prosper because the
continental European perception is that he is too close to the UK.
Belgium is expected to put forward another candidate, possibly Mr Wilfried
Martens, the former prime minister, or finance minister Mr Phillipe
Maystadt, both Christian Democrats, or Viscount Etienne Davignon, a former
EU Commissioner.
An alternative theory circulating in Brussels yesterday was that Mr Giuliano
Amato, the socialist former Italian prime minister, respected for his role
in steering Italy through its political upheaval, might come to be seen as
an attractive candidate.
Another Italian name being mentioned was that of Mr Renato Ruggiero,
currently a candidate to head the new World Trade Organisation.
But the unwritten rules the 12 heads of government had set themselves in the
last selection round may have to be torn up. These were that the successor
to France's powerful Mr Delors - a socialist from a large country - should
come from their own ranks; from a small member state; and from the
centre-right. One EU diplomat said yesterday that if all three criteria were
impossible to fulfil his feeling was that 'they will try to give it one of
the smaller countries'.
'This is now between countries more than personalities,' one senior Brussels
official said.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Tory Euro-sceptics seek to broaden tough stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night basked in the approval of Conservative MPs as he
insisted there was no question of Britain removing its veto on the
appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as president of the European Commission.
His statement came amid clear signs that the Euro-sceptic right of the Tory
party is moving to capitalise on the reaction to the veto by insisting the
prime minister take a tougher line across a range of European issues.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Thatcherite chief secretary to the Treasury, used a
speech in Barcelona last night to dismiss fears that Britain might be left
behind in Europe's 'slow lane'. If others were going in the wrong direction,
the government should be confident in staking out its own position.
Other prominent Euro-sceptics said Mr Major had to be be ready to use his
veto again if other European governments proposed another 'federalist'
candidate for the Commission presidency.
Speaking in the House of Commons, the prime minister called for a new slate
of candidates to break the deadlock in the European Union. Effectively
staking his own premiership on blocking the candidacy of the Belgian prime
minister, Mr Major stressed he would not change his stance 'at any stage'.
As ministers analysed the outcome of the Corfu summit they were confident
that the prospect of an autumn leadership challenge has been greatly
diminished. Mr Major had also given himself a freer hand in the impending
cabinet reshuffle.
To rowdy applause from the Conservative backbenches, Mr Major delivered a
thinly-veiled rebuke to the German and French governments for attempting to
force the issue at the Corfu summit. Relishing his best performance in the
Commons for some time, he told MPs the government wanted Europe to succeed
before adding: 'But being a good European does not mean signing up to
everything which our partners propose.'
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, struck a discordant note by
criticising Mr Major for creating a crisis in the European Union but most
pro-European Tory MPs preferred to reserve their anger for private
conversations.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim Labour leader, accused Mr Major of putting
appeasement of the right wing of the Tory party ahead of Britain's
interests.
Mr Major refused to speculate on the names of new candidates for the
succession to Mr Jacques Delors. But the government believes that Italy,
Spain, Belgium and possibly Ireland may be among those adding names to a
fresh slate.
The prime minister said he was doubtful whether Mr Ruud Lubbers, the
outgoing Dutch prime minister, would be a candidate. But he appeared
confident that a choice could be made by the time of the proposed emergency
summit on July 15.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Clinton replaces White House chief of staff in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton announced a thorough shake-up of his top aides
yesterday in an effort to head off incessant criticism of the White House's
lack of organisation and leadership.
The shake-up will bring Mr Leon Panetta, the former congressman who now
heads the Office of Management and Budget, into the White House as chief of
staff in place of Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, Mr Clinton's boyhood friend from
Arkansas.
Mr McLarty, who himself approached the president with the idea of
reshuffling the White House staff, will become a senior counsellor to Mr
Clinton with particular responsibility for shepherding legislation through
Congress and maintaining the White House's relationships with members of
Congress and political constituencies.
Ms Alice Rivlin, currently Mr Panetta's deputy at OMB, will take over the
top budget position, if she is confirmed by the Senate, while Mr David
Gergen, the former Reagan communications guru who was brought into the White
House last year in a bid to produce a more coherent message, will take on a
new role as special adviser on foreign policy both to Mr Clinton and
secretary of state Warren Christopher.
Mr Clinton said the reshuffle was intended 'to find the highest and best use
for a talented and dedicated group of people', and was not in any sense an
avowal of failures in the White House organisation.
Mr McLarty said he had felt for some time it was essential 'that we put the
strongest possible team on the field in this critical year and that we put
people in positions that best suit their talents and abilities'.
But politicians and officials around Washington said it would be very
difficult to shake the impression that Mr McLarty was being demoted.
Although everyone found him a decent and likeable man, not everyone felt
that he had taken tight enough control of the White House structure.
The image of disarray has been reinforced by repeated incidents such as the
use of a Marine helicopter for a golfing trip by two senior aides and the
purloining of embroidered towels and bathrobes, possibly by other White
House staff members, from a Navy aircraft carrier.
A recent book by Mr Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter of Watergate
fame, portrayed a chaotic White House torn by divisions between Mr Clinton's
political advisers and his economic policy team.
However, while criticisms of the Clinton White House have been greatly
exaggerated - previous White Houses have often been just as chaotic - yet
there remains a kernel of serious concern about the administration's
indecisiveness, particularly in international affairs.
That indecisiveness, however, stems less from the White House management
structure than from Mr Clinton's own character and lack of priorities.
Washington veterans doubted whether moving Mr Gergen to a role in
articulating foreign policy would solve the underlying weaknesses in Mr
Clinton's foreign policy.
'The problem is not only the message; the problem is substance,' said Mr
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security adviser to former president
Jimmy Carter.
Although Mr Clinton insisted yesterday that Mr McLarty was 'not going
anywhere' and remained his 'closest and most trusted personal adviser', it
seemed clear that the former gas company executive, like so many of the
friends that Mr Clinton brought with him from his home state, would soon be
heading back to Arkansas.
Mr Panetta, who represented a California district in Congress for 16 years
and chaired the House of Representatives budget committee before moving to
OMB, is, like so many of those who have replaced the Arkansans, a veteran of
Washington politics.
Mr McLarty's own comments yesterday sounded very like a farewell to
Washington, while the tributes of his colleagues sounded more like an
obituary.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Student loans 'get Pounds 250m subsidy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Student loans include a state subsidy of Pounds 250m a year, and should be
replaced with loans repaid via the tax system, says a report published
today.
The report, published by the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free-market
think-tank, says loans should charge a 'real' rate of interest which would
include a premium over the present repayment rate, which is pegged solely to
retail price inflation.
The government intends to increase the proportion of students' living costs
funded via repayable loans - rather than grants - by 10 per cent for each of
the next three years. It aims to ensure that parents and students pay a
greater share of the costs.
A quango, the Student Loans Company, administers the loans, which are
repayable in fixed instalments after students have graduated. They are
excused making any repayments if their income is less than 85 per cent of
the national average.
Professor Edwin West, author of the IEA report and professor emeritus of
economics at Carleton University in Canada, says: 'The amount that is
repayable remains obscure. Judging by Britain's current loan system, new and
disguised forms of government subsidies or grants are quickly emerging and
are taking the form of increasing costs associated with the present loan
structure.'
Students, typically graduating with loans valued at Pounds 2,150, and then
taking three years to reach the income threshold at which they have to make
repayments, will in effect enjoy a grant of Pounds 304, he says.
Their freedom from 'real' interest rates while they are repaying their loan
will give a 'total exemption from all 'real' interest of something
approaching Pounds 500 per student - about 22 per cent of the value of the
original principal'. He calculates that the 500,000 loans made in the
1992-93 academic year involve a total grant by the state of Pounds 250m.
He says that instead administrative costs should be cut by linking loans to
the tax system. Graduates on lower incomes would therefore repay more
slowly, in smaller amounts.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Benchmark is set by clear
winners in product groups - Paul Taylor takes a look at some of the results
by sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Europe's senior executives were asked to nominate the most respected
companies in their industries on the basis of seven measures of business
performance, clear winners emerged in most business sectors.
As a result the first Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey should provide
a valuable tool for corporate executives and others wishing to benchmark
their companies against the best in Europe.
This is a summary of the some of the results by sector:
Automobiles/Auto Trucks &amp; Parts
Bayerische Motoren Werke, the German carmaker came top in this sector which
had a particularly high response rate.
BMW was followed by Robert Bosch, the German components manufacturer, and
then Peugeot Citroen, the French motor group.
Banks
Although Deutsche Bank no longer ranks as Europe's biggest bank - that title
is now held by HSBC following its takeover of Midland Bank - the German bank
emerged well ahead of its rivals in a large sector.
HSBC ranked fifth equal with Germany's BHF-Bank, behind UBS, Lloyds Bank and
Spain's Banco de Santander.
Beverages &amp; Tobacco
In this sector the only two non-British contenders, LVMH Louis Vuitton Moet
Hennessy, the French luxury goods group, and Heineken, the Dutch brewer
which has a substantial international reach, topped the rankings.
However, Guinness and Whitbread were well placed and Grand Met scored well.
Chemical, Paper &amp; Packaging
Ciba-Geigy, of Switzerland, which also has substantial pharmaceuticals
interests, took first place in this sector even though L'Air Liquide, the
world's biggest industrial gases group, made it into the top 25 list. Ciba
did well mostly because of its customer focus, products and financial
performance.
However, unlike many other sectors, votes were very evenly spread across the
industry. L'Air Liquide came second, followed closely by ICI, of the UK,
Akzo, of the Netherlands, and Rhone Poulenc, the French chemicals group.
Construction, Homebuilding &amp; Building materials
German and British companies shared the top honours in this sector. Philipp
Holzmann emerged with most votes by a clear majority, followed by Britain's
RMC Group, the world's biggest concrete producer, and Pilkington, the UK
glassmaker.
Dykerhoff, the German cement group which recently acquired a 50.05 per cent
stake in Ciments Luxembourgeois, and Wolseley, the UK-based heating and
plumbing merchant, also made it into the sector top five.
Diversified Holding Companies
This was one of the most difficult categories to rank because of the wide
range of business activities covered.
Nevertheless BTR, the British industrial conglomerate, emerged as clear
winner, closely followed by UK-based Rentokil and Hanson. Chargeurs, the
French textiles, transport and communications group, and Pinault, which owns
the Printemps stores also made the top five.
Electricity &amp; Water
Germany's largest utility group, RWE, led the electricity and water field,
closely followed by Britain's Powergen and then Belgium's Electrabel,
National Grid and Sweden's Vattenfall utility.
Electronics &amp; Electrical Components
Siemens came top by a wide margin, followed by Alcatel-Alsthom, of France,
Finland's Nokia, Sweden's Electrolux, Britain's GEC and then Philips of the
Netherlands.
Engineering
Although ABB Asea Brown Boveri dominated this sector, Britain's Rolls-Royce
and Linde, the German lift truck maker also rated highly.
The top three were followed by Sandvik of Sweden and Williams Holdings of
the UK.
Food Processors
Unilever and Switzerland's Nestle group headed this sector. They ranked
fifth and sixth in the overall winners group.
They were followed by BSN, the French-based multinational food group,
Barilla, Italy's family owned pasta and biscuit group, was ranked number
four in the sector.
Insurance
Germany's Munchener Ruckversicherungs group won the most praise in this
category followed by Fortis, the Dutch/Belgium group, Swiss Reinsurance,
Zurich Insurance and Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company.
Media, Printing &amp; Advertising
Reuters Holdings, the new and financial information group, stood
head-and-shoulders above its rivals in this category receiving as many
commendations as the next five companies put together.
Reed-Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, came second, followed by
the German Bertelsmann media group, Britain's EMAP and Wolters Kluwer, the
Dutch publishing group. Pharmaceuticals &amp; Healthcare
Switzerland's Roche claimed the top slot in this sector.
Surprisingly however, Roche did not figure in the 25 overall winners. Glaxo,
made it into the top 25. But in the sector it ranked third behind its arch
ulcer drug competitor Sweden's Astra. SmithKline Beecham ranked fourth.
Retail
British companies, J Sainsbury and John Lewis took second and third places
respectively after Marks &amp; Spencer.
Migros, Switzerland's leading food retailer, came fourth followed by the
French-owned Carrefour group.
Telecoms &amp; Communications
British Telecom emerged as the top-rated company, followed by PTT Nederland,
the partially privatised Dutch telecommunications and postal company, and
Vodafone, the UK cellular network operator.
France Telecom, ranked number four followed by Cable &amp; Wireless which owns
the Mercury network in the UK.

<TEXT>
The largest of Australia's natural resource companies, is due to report its
full-year earnings on Friday. Most analysts expect a strong performance,
with sentiment having been boosted by this week's robust production report,
covering the same 12 months to end-May. Domestic steel despatches, for
example, were 13 per cent higher, while exported steel from Australia rose
19 per cent. Iron ore and copper production also increased sharply, and
while Australian coal exports were slightly lower, output from BHP's
Indonesian coal mines showed a marked rise. Estimates for the after-tax
profits figure are around ADollars 1.25bn (Dollars 900m), compared with
ADollars 991m (excluding abnormals) last time.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Turn-out high for Ukraine election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainians turned out in large numbers yesterday for their first
post-independence presidential election. Preliminary results are not
expected until later today, but most observers expect top contenders,
President Leonid Kravchuk and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister,
to face each other in run-offs on July 10.
Opinion polls on the eve of the elections suggest that Mr Kravchuk has made
a near miraculous transformation, from the man who destroyed Ukraine's
economy, to the only leader who can guarantee the country's stability. 'I
know that nothing has changed for the better under Kravchuk, things have got
worse,' said Mrs Yulia Sokol, a 40-year- old engineer who cast her ballot
for the incumbent in central Kiev. 'The most important thing is to keep the
peace.'
Manipulating state television with his considerable political skill, Mr
Kravchuk in recent weeks seems to have successfully reshaped the national
debate. Now, instead of being about repairing the economy, it is about
maintaining national independence and stability.
Even Mr Kuchma, who was the clear front-runner until very recently, has been
forced on the defensive. As former director of the Soviet Union's largest
nuclear missile plant, Mr Kuchma comes from the heart of the old regime and
has advocated closer ties with Russia. However, campaigning in central
Ukraine on the eve of the elections, Mr Kuchma was forced to tone down his
pro-Russian rhetoric.
The need to defend his Ukrainian credentials has diluted his image as a
strong man who can impose law and order and revive the Ukrainian economy.
The most likely result is that Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma win the bulk of the
votes, but neither an outright majority.
Under Ukrainian election law if no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of
the vote in the first round, the top two compete in a second round.
Analysts are wary of making predictions. Following the surprisingly strong
showing of a firebrand outsider in last week's presidential poll in Belarus,
Ukraine's traditionally quiescent neighbour, some pundits warn an upset is
possible here as well.
If Ukrainians defy the predictions, their votes could go in two very
different directions: the hardline socialist candidate and chairman of
parliament, Mr Oleksandr Moroz, or Mr Volodymyr Lanoviy, a reform-minded
economist and former cabinet minister. These outsiders, and Mr Kuchma, could
be the beneficiaries of a protest vote.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: USA must wait as Romania and Switzerland go
through
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Romania, inspired by tireless midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, produced a
disciplined display last night to burst the USA's bubble by beating them 1-0
at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
The result, along with a 2-0 victory for Colombia over Switzerland in San
Francisco, means Romania finish as winners of Group A. Switzerland also
progress to the second phase on goal difference from the US, who must wait
to see if their four points will be good enough to take them through as one
of the four best third-place finishers.
After taking the lead in the 17th minute through Dan Petrescu following poor
positioning by US keeper Tony Meola, Romania showed some of the
inventiveness and dominance missing from their drubbing at the hands of the
Swiss earlier in the week.
They could - and should - have put the game beyond reach by the first ten
minutes of the second half, Raducioiu in particular having several good
opportunities. But the US team pressed relentlessly in the last half hour,
without ever making the crucial final breakthrough.
In San Francisco, Switzerland were all but certain of a second round place
for the first time for 40 years, and their play was suitably passionless.
Colombia's midfielder Hernan Gaviria scored with a close-range header just
before the end of a first half which his side had dominated with some
delightful approach work.
Gaviria nodded home a free kick by Colombian captain Carlos Valderrama to
round off the team's most sustained display of open, attacking soccer since
the start of the tournament, in which Pele had seen them as potential
champions.
Substitute Harold Lozano sealed victory with a second goal in the final
minute. But the win was not enough to stave off elimination for the
Colombians after two defeats in their earlier matches.

Ukrainians turned out in large numbers yesterday for their first
post-independence presidential election. Preliminary results early this
morning suggested the vote would go to a second round between the incumbent,
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, in two
weeks' time.
Early reports from several polling stations throughout Ukraine indicated
that Mr Kuchma had made a strong showing in the more Russified eastern
regions of the country and Crimea but this had been offset by Mr Kravchuk's
popularity in the centre and the west. Mr Oleksandr Moroz, the hardline
socialist chairman of parliament, was running a weak third.
Turnout was reported to be 68 per cent of the 38m voters. Results were
expected later today.
Opinion polls on the eve of the elections suggested Mr Kravchuk had
undergone a transformation, from the man who destroyed Ukraine's economy, to
the only leader who could guarantee the country's stability.
Manipulating state television with considerable skill, he seemed in recent
weeks to have successfully reshaped the national debate. Now, instead of
being about repairing the economy, it is about maintaining national
independence.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (13): Fresh Rbs3,000bn attack on crime -
Law and Order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two bomb attacks on businessmen in Moscow on the same day this month
provided a brutal impulse for Russian President Boris Yeltsin to declare
all-out war on organised crime.
In broad daylight, right outside Paveletsky railway station, the driver of
the chief of Logovaz, a big car-dealing company, had his head blown off
although his boss, Mr Boris Berezovsky, escaped unscathed. The other
intended victim, the manager of a smaller company, was less fortunate: a
car-bomb earlier in the day cost him his leg.
A few days later, on June 10, President Yeltsin announced he had ordered the
security services to 'cleanse Russia of criminal filth'. The interior
minister, prosecutor-general, and head of the domestic intelligence service
promptly unveiled a new Rbs3,000bn programme to fight crime. Mr Yeltsin said
they would be held personally responsible for its success in beating back
criminal forces who were trying to 'seize control of the economy and push
their way into politics'.
He followed this up in mid-June with a presidential decree giving security
forces unprecedented powers to fight organised crime, including the right to
detain suspects without charge for 30 days and the right to search the
premises and bank accounts of any company suspected of illegal dealings.
The measures were promptly denounced as unconstitutional by parliament and
the liberal media, which warned of a possible return to to Russia's more
repressive past. Given an overwhelming public longing for law and order, a
successful crackdown could prove the greatest vote-spinner for a government
unlikely to deliver quick results on economic reform. But criminals' close
links to corrupt police and officials provide the strongest reason to doubt
the likelihood of a successful campaign against Russia's so-called 'mafia'.
The word 'mafia' is widely used in Russia to mean anything from organised
crime to extortion by officials seeking bribes. The crime problem is unique
because of its intimate connections to an inherently corrupt economy and
bureaucracy inherited from the Communist era.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a renowned Russian economist and presidential hopeful,
argues that the old state-run Soviet economy was designed for lawlessness.
He says its vestiges - such as a reliance on personal patronage, excessive
discretionary powers for bureaucrats, and a very high degree of monopoly in
the economy - need to be dismantled if there is any chance of making inroads
against crime and racketeering.
How dangerous is Russia today? In term of statistics for ordinary crime, a
big city such as St Petersburg is no more dangerous than the more
crime-ridden cities of Europe, and is safer than New York or Washington.
Major-General Arkady Kramariev, the St Petersburg police chief, says that
the higher levels of crime in Russia's second city - 845 murders last year
compared to 150 a decade ago - correspond more closely to a free market
economy than previous low levels prevailing under the old police state. The
difference between Russia and the west is that police who are underpaid,
uninsured and demoralised are unlikely to do much to solve crimes.
Much of the violence can be blamed on an antiquated legal system's inability
to meet the requirements of a market economy. Because the courts take so
long to solve commercial disputes, Maj-Gen Kramariev says that 'Judge
Kalashnikov' remains the most reliable way to recover debts.
This is true of any sphere of activity in Russia. But banking, as one of the
most profitable businesses in an ailing economy, provides a useful
starting-point for exploring organised crime's involvement in the economy.
More than a dozen bankers have been gunned down in contract killings over
the past couple of years but not one of these crimes has been solved. The
victims were believed to have rejected extortion attempts or to have become
too deeply involved with unsavoury customers.
Given that Russia has no guidelines on money laundering, it is not
surprising that Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, admits
that 'any banks may have customers related to illegal, underworld
activities'.
Mr Tulin, in charge of banking supervision and restructuring, categorically
rejects, together with other Russian officials and bankers, some of the more
far-fetched western speculation that the entire banking sector is run by the
mafia.
But while top bankers usually have the means to protect themselves - Mr
Vladimir Gussinsky, chairman of Most-Bank, says his construction and banking
group has a security force of 650 men - many smaller businesses have no
choice but to pay up and shut up.
The same differences apply to foreign companies. Big multinationals which
are beginning to invest in Russia and do not operate small cash-based
businesses are unlikely to do deals with the mafia. But smaller outfits,
such as new foreign restaurants in Moscow, or retail outfits, are asked to
pay protection money, and often do.
Fears are often expressed that organised crime and extortion are stifling
economic reforms and growth.
While these problems do discourage many newcomers, the hardier entrepreneurs
have simply adjusted to a business climate in which most participants find
they have to break the law in one way or another in order to prosper. In
this context, many businessmen complain that the mafia is less of a problem
than the corrupt bureaucracy or over-burdensome taxation.
Mr Sergei Klementiev, a private farmer with a small farm and entrepreneur in
the province of Nizhny-Novgorod, is doing exactly what bold agricultural
reforms in the province are designed to achieve. He is challenging the state
trading and food-processing monopolies by taking milk directly to town to
sell it more cheaply to consumers. But he says he also has to pay protection
money to 'small-time crooks' who otherwise threaten to damage his retail
stall.
However, he says paying protection money to the same people on a regular
basis is the least of his problems, in so far as 'nobody else comes and asks
for money'. Without even bothering to go to the police, he is far more
concerned that the government should lessen taxation on his businesses.
Perhaps the main victim of organised crime is public opinion, which widely
perceives market reforms as giving greater freedom to the 'mafia' while
impoverishing the quality of their lives. It is for this reason, if only to
fend off the coming-to-power of more ruthless extremists who promise summary
executions and plan dictatorship, that Russia must hope President Yeltsin
can toe a fine line between restoring order and returning to the arbitrary
rule of the communist past.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (14): Stable business can be done - A Guide
for Visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doing business in Russia has become in some ways more, in some ways less,
taxing. The more first.
The Russian language is difficult, although it is a worthwhile courtesy to
learn a few words. Few people speak English and interpreters should be
carefully chosen.
It is thus both time-saving and sensible to learn as far as possible before
travelling what officialdom will require of you.
Most international airlines serve Moscow and many serve St Petersburg.
However, Aeroflot and the independent companies, which have been created
from its partial breaking-up, dominate the internal market.
These are usually bad, sometime very bad. Like most areas in which
foreigners operate, they are charged more for the same low service. However,
genuinely private airlines are beginning - of which Transaero, with several
destinations within Russia and the former Soviet Union, is the best. Travel
agents should be consulted.
Outside of Moscow and St Petersburg, food and hotels are at best adequate.
If travelling widely, bookings should be made well in advance and confirmed
shortly before arrival. Elementary items, such as towels and bottled water,
should be taken and the traveller must be prepared to be patient and to
wait.
Although there is a tradition of warm hospitality in most parts of Russia,
there is little or none of service and politeness: thus, public encounters
are often abrasive and can quickly degenerate into squabbling. Sometimes
shouting works, sometimes it makes matters worse.
Negotiation and reaching agreement can be harder than in settled economies,
although far from impossible and often more rewarding. The underlying issues
which must be carefully examined are those of property rights, especially of
land, legislation and taxation.
The first can be very vague: that is in large part either because the law is
vague and because title, even when apparently firmly vested, can in practice
be hard to establish in court if challenged. The second, legislation, is a
minefield of overlapping and contradictory laws which produce the effect of
a field of struggle between the actors, rather than a reasonably ordered
code which defines rights and responsibilities.
Taxation, which for the moment is seen - especially by the oil companies -
as usually the most severe problem, is serious because of the height of
taxes and because of their variability. Companies, both Russian and foreign,
must often pay taxes which can amount to more than their income: a clearly
unsustainable position which is solved by evasion.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, has recently promised to reduce
taxes and to grant tax holidays to foreign investors.
These issues can, of course, be clarified by reference to consultants,
lawyers and accountants, of which there are now many - Russian and foreign -
in Moscow, St Petersburg and, to a much lesser extent, elsewhere. But the
advice cannot solve the basic problem that huge confusion exists in all
these areas.
Last on the downside: a business culture is only developing in Russia and in
the other former Soviet states. This means that Russian business people can
display one or more of the following characteristics: an extreme naivety
which foreigners were and are not slow to exploit; extreme suspicion, which
bedevils relationships, certainly at first; extreme untrustworthiness, which
gives rise to the saying that Russian business people start to negotiate
after an agreement has been signed.
All of these views, made famous by anecdote, have a basis but they can be
moderated by care and checking. The number of foreign companies - Unilever,
ABB, Brown Boveri, BAT, Proctor &amp; Gamble, United Technologies and others -
which are now investing with success or the expectation of it, show that the
basis for business and profits exists, albeit on a fragile foundation.
This has led us to the upside: it is a function of the steady opening-up of
Russia and its neighbours which causes pain but which, nevertheless,
continues. Russian politicians and officials, whatever their past and
present views, are - often reluctantly - constrained to work within an
economy which is being pulled towards that of the world economy; it is no
longer possible to adopt an autarchic policy on either investment or on
industrial structure.
Although Russia has been independent for a little over three years only and
though legislation and policies to create a full market structure are even
younger, it is already evident that many, especially younger, Russians
working in new sectors such as finance and banking, have experienced a steep
learning curve and are anxious to reach standards of professionalism equal
to those in developed economies. Increasingly, these are the people with
whom foreign business visitors are working and collaborating.
The influx of foreign capital, still slow compared with other developing
countries, will be encouraged in the second part of this year by new laws
and regulations prepared for the next phases of the privatisation process.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation,
has announced that the new privatisation programme will be designed to
encourage much more rapid and significant strategic investment in the
privatised Russian companies and has said that he wishes to attract much
more foreign investment than he was able to do in the first phase.
Already, foreign companies large and small have taken generally modest
shares in the privatised companies and there are signs that some of them are
prepared to go much further - buying out companies, creating majority
shareholdings and making partnerships with Russian companies in key market
sectors.
The experience of those few companies which have already done so shows that,
in spite of the macro-economic problems afflicting Russia, good and stable
business can be done if the ground is well prepared.
The development of foreign hotels, restaurants and shops in Moscow and St
Petersburg has been rapid in the past three years, transforming the
facilities for visiting and resident foreigners and for the growing, if
still small, proportion of wealthy Russians. Prices are very high by
international standards and often are grossly out of line with service.
However, their development has meant that discomfort need not necessarily be
an inevitable accompaniment of the business traveller.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (11): Confrontation is a possibility - John
Lloyd sees a change in foreign policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this month, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned
the US Congress against insisting on the implementation of its vote to arm
Bosnian Moslem forces. This would be, he said, a harbinger of a new great
power confrontation - when Russia and the US would again arm their allies in
a proxy war. He obviously had in mind, but did not explicitly mention, the
Serbs as Russia's proxy.
This was not the Mr Kozyrev who became foreign minister in 1991 and who has
stuck - despite constant rumours of forced resignation - to his post ever
since. But the country's mood towards foreigners has changed greatly and Mr
Kozyrev with it: it is the reason for his survival.
The swing to the nationalist right and left in the elections of last
December is usually held responsible for this, but that is only true in
part. Some time before, the country's politicians had begun to make quite
sharp corrections to a pro-western foreign policy which even western
diplomats thought excessive. Russia had rediscovered its 'interests' and it
is still doing so.
As now expressed, these interests include:
A concentration on the 'near abroad,' the Russian designation for the 14
other former Soviet states, most of which have a common border with Russia
and all of which are still strongly linked to it by economic, political and
security ties. The news here, for Russia, the former Soviet states and for
the 'far abroad' is not all bad - although some of it is.
The good news is that Russian troops are withdrawing or have withdrawn from
Lithuania and Latvia: only Estonia among the three Baltic states still has
no agreement (and the negotiations remain tense and mutually abrasive) - but
both Estonian and Russian officials still say they expect one.
Further, the states which make up the Commonwealth of Independent States,
which include all former Soviet countries except the Baltics, are now
prepared to work together more closely than in the first two years of that
organisation's life. They lack properly functioning bureaucracies to
implement the network of agreements they have signed between themselves -
but they are now making efforts to moderate the burst of destructive
protectionism in which they indulged immediately after the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
The bad news is that the CIS is not a common market, has no properly working
interstate economic mechanism or banking agreement and most of the
non-Russian states are extremely dependent on Russia - to the point of being
vulnerable to, and suffering from, Russian pressure.
For this reason, there remains, and will remain, great ambiguity about
Russian military and security activities there - always interpreted by
Russia as necessary measures to keep the peace and preserve or bring back
stability, but interpreted by some at least in the west, and on occasion by
the other former Soviet states, as more or less dangerous manoeuvring to
further Russian power.
In the past year, the west has drawn a rough line under the Baltic states,
saying that these at least should not be touched and must be cleared of
Russian troops: for the rest, it averts its gaze.
An effort to strike a relationship with the US and with Nato which confirms
Russia's 'great power' status - even as that status is more and more under
question in any but the field of nuclear weapons.
This is proving hard: although the Russians probably will sign up to the
Partnership for Peace - the Nato-inspired plan to bring the former communist
countries into association with it while withholding full membership from
the central European states which wish it - they do so with some reluctance.
This is accompanied by demands for a special status to be recognised and
codified and with a constant commentary that Nato should be subsumed into a
larger organisation such as the Conference for Security and Co-operation in
Europe - a trend which could serve as a warning for the future.
Russia is also likely to be accepted as a 'political' member of the Group of
Seven advanced industrial countries in Naples next month - a membership
which will give its politicians the sense of belonging to a wealthy club but
which will impose responsibilities for which their reduced circumstances
badly fit them.
It will be a further mark of acceptance by the international community that
reforms continue or are at least deemed to continue - the other this year
was the granting of a Dollars 1.5bn loan by the International Monetary Fund
 -but it comes when Russia is proving a prickly and difficult partner and
when much comment in the west points to the impossibility of a real
'partnership' with a country whose interests are seen by itself as being so
different from those of most western states.
Russia wishes to be both of Europe and out of it: although western Europe,
and in particular Germany, remains the second most important focus of its
diplomacy after the CIS, it cannot forget its Eurasian nature and cannot
take its place as simply a bigger, more eastern, European state.
Its relations with the countries to its east and south have generally
improved. China - now its largest trading partner - presents no quarrels for
the first time for many years and seems as interested as is Russia in
preserving good neighbourly relations. Visits by Mr Yeltsin and Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, confirmed the importance of the
relationship.
India is no longer as close as it was when it sought to use the Soviet Union
to balance western influence on it - but there is no tension. Of the leading
states to the east, only with Japan does suspicion and a certain animus
remain, expressed over the Kurile Islands or Northern Territories taken by
the Soviet Union at the end of the last war, and whose return Japan demands
before it puts its diplomatic relationship with Russia on a normal footing.
For the rest of the world, Russia has largely withdrawn. The former Soviet
satellites find little interest and no support from a state now forced to
weigh expenditure much more carefully than in the past, and with no
ideological profit to be gained from buying their alliance.
Before this year, this withdrawal was accompanied by a commensurate absence
from many of the theatres of the world where the most important states,
above all the US, were playing a mediatory or controlling role. In the past
year, however, Russian diplomacy has again become more active - insisting on
being taken into account in the former Yugoslavia, in the Middle East and in
the present crisis in North Korea.
In each case it has proposed distinctive approaches and though often posing
a challenge has so far been accommodated without major ructions. Mr
Kozyrev's challenge over Bosnia, however, raises the question of how long
this will continue to be so.
Russia has, in this past year, shown it will advance its interests. It has
not so far pushed these to direct confrontation with those of other leading
countries with whom it has a new-found friendship. But the possibility now
exists.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (12): Better investment climate -
Developments in the gold-mining sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lure of Russian gold is finally paying off with a start to foreign
investment in one of the country's most closely-guarded industries.
Over the past month, two unprecedented gold-mining deals have cleared final
hurdles to more than a third of a billion dollars' worth of investment. The
Russian gold mining industry, previously a state-owned monopoly, found
itself starved of capital following the collapse of the Soviet-era
command-economy. As a result, gold output in a country which is the world's
second-largest producer, has been steadily falling. This in turn has forced
Russia, despite its deep-rooted fears of 'selling off the family silver', to
look abroad for finance for bigger projects requiring sophisticated
technology and vast amounts of capital.
Dozens of Russian companies have already won contracts to develop smaller
deposits concentrated mainly in Siberia. But the two foreign deals, for
bigger and more difficult deposits, are the first of their kind following
the successful conclusion of more than two years of negotiations.
After altering its initial plan to meet objections from Russian authorities,
Star Mining, a small Australian exploration company, has all but finalised a
deal to develop Sukhoi Log (Dry Gulch), Russia's largest hard-rock gold
deposit. It has promised to invest Dollars 250m in Lenzoloto, the local
Siberian producer in which it holds 31 per cent, up from an initial proposal
to invest Dollars 150m. The aim of the project is to raise Lenzoloto's
annual production to 2m ounces in six years, about three-quarters of which
would come from Sukhoi Log.
Earlier this month, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic) of
the US and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development finally
approved Dollars 110m in loans and investment guarantees for the development
of the Kubaka deposit in Russia's Far East. The tender for the project was
won last June by a joint venture between Cyprus Amax Minerals of the US and
five regional mining companies. But, responding to companies' nervousness
about investing in Russia, Opic will provide investment guarantees of
Dollars 55m plus Dollars 150m insurance cover against expropriation and
political violence. The EBRD will lend the project a further Dollars 55m.
The aim is to produce 326,000 ounces of gold and 255,000 ounces of silver a
year.
The contrasting histories of the two deals speak volumes about the gradual
improvement of Russia's investment climate since the launch of market
reforms in 1992.
While big companies remained on the sidelines, Star - invited by Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian leader, to scout for mining opportunities in Russia
before it even became an independent state with the collapse of the Soviet
Union - directly negotiated a joint venture with Lenzoloto, a local Siberian
producer. But the project soon ran into trouble with Russian authorities who
argued that the deal did not meet the requirements of either the nation's
interests or its fast-changing legislation. A main objection was that the
deposit should have been put to tender, while Star and Lenzoloto argued that
they had concluded their deal before new legislation was passed requiring
all new deposits to be put to tender.
Coming in later than Star, Cyprus Amax Minerals faced a much smoother ride
because ground rules making tenders compulsory were already clearly
established. Mr Adrian Ball, Moscow representative for Morgan Grenfell, the
investment bank which acted as adviser to the western parties, says the deal
also received powerful support from local authorities of Magadan province,
which stands to receive rich tax returns from the deal. Mr Ball points out
that taxation is so high, however, that the deal is only just about
profitable.
Mr Boris Yatskevich, deputy chairman of the state committee which is
responsible for issuing mining licences, agrees that taxation remains far
too high by international standards.
But having led objections to the Star deal, he said he had agreed to drop
his legal quibbles after Star improved their terms. 'Today Lenzoloto, with
7,500 employees, is on the edge of bankruptcy. It is not possible to torture
them any further.'
The Russian government also stepped in to ease objections from local
authorities in the eastern Siberian province of Irkutsk by giving them 10
per cent of the equity in the project. It is now up to the Irkutsk
administration to finally endorse the deal.

After 18 months in power, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin has succeeded in becoming
the second most powerful man in the country and has remained the most
elusive. The Russian premier, appointed in December 1992 when pressure from
the then Congress of People's Deputies forced Mr Yegor Gaidar from his role
as acting prime minister, has apparently changed greatly while appearing
exactly the same.
His first year was hard. He took over a cabinet which may have been shorn of
Gaidar but still had many 'Gaidarites' in it, in the key economic posts,
whose contacts with the western financial institutions and advisers were
much better than his and whose distrust of him was manifest. These ministers
still had the president's ear and were thus able at times to circumvent
their ostensible boss.
Moreover, he stumbled badly on his first appearance as prime minister -
calling for price controls and then being forced to back down after an
outcry from his own ministers.
He was close to the powerful industrialists' lobby headed by Mr Arkady
Volsky, and as a former chairman of the gas monopoly Gasprom and an energy
minister in both the Soviet and Russian governments, he knew and shared many
of their concerns.
He clearly opposed many of the measures and proposals of his ministers -
siding with Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the Russian central
bank, and protecting him from presidential dismissal in favour of Mr Boris
Fyodorov, then finance minister; calling the privatisation programme akin to
Stalinist collectivisation; and agreeing with Mr Gerashchenko to scrap
pre-1993 banknotes in a currency reform which took place while Mr Fyodorov
was out of the country and without his knowledge.
It became accepted - since it was promulgated by the radicals and to a
degree confirmed by the prime minister's actions - that he was at best a
reluctant reformer, one whose instincts remained with Soviet industry and
with at least a corporate if not a command economy. Uneasy before most
audiences, he tended to reiterate the need for hard work as an antidote to
the country's evils.
It was the clash between the president and the Russian Supreme Soviet,
culminating in the latter's suppression by force last October, which
revealed how far Mr Chernomyrdin had succeeded in creating a position for
himself independent of both Mr Yeltsin and his cabinet colleagues and with
its own power and influence. He remained silent for some days after Mr
Yeltsin banned the Supreme Soviet in September - then came out with an
expression of solid support which clearly carried weight and which appeared
to speak for a body of centrist opinion of the kind the radicals could not
reach.
Mr Chernomyrdin it was who went with Mr Yeltsin to the Ministry of Defence
in the early hours of October 4 last year, after the pro-parliamentary
forces had attacked the mayoral offices and the TV centre, to argue the
generals into giving the order to their nearest troops to come to the
defence of the capital - and of the executive power. Mr Yeltsin's own
account - in his memoirs The View from the Kremlin - has Mr Chernomyrdin
directly challenging the defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, to take
upon himself the responsibility of ordering in the tanks.
Mr Yeltsin's appreciation of him is generous, befitting someone who has
shown conspicuous loyalty to his president - 'the prime minister brought a
refreshing note into the atmosphere of market reforms, which in fact
continued. It was an accent on reliability, permanence, stability. . . The
political pressure on the government lifted dramatically. . . The hard,
authoritative prime minister created a bulwark for the president's policies,
a second centre of power that cemented together all the different government
groupings.'
With the apparently unassailable support of the president behind him, Mr
Chernomyrdin positioned himself well before the parliamentary elections last
December. In contrast to many of his ministers - including Yegor Gaidar, by
that time returned to the cabinet as his first deputy - he was not seeking
office: instead he received the endorsements of a number of his cabinet
members to continue as premier whoever won.
When the result turned out to be a swing to the right and left extremes,
with no one group in the ascendancy, Mr Chernomyrdin benefited hugely. The
radicals, after a brief struggle, left the cabinet - with the sole exception
of Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister. Mr Chernomyrdin, with his
own choice as first deputy in Mr Oleg Soskovets, a similarly taciturn
workaholic, had for the first time his own government.
It was widely assumed he would bring in a different programme: after all, he
had commented immediately following the election that there must be 'an end
to market romanticism.' But what followed that remark was an extraordinary
turnaround: to date, Mr Chernomyrdin has not only refrained from diluting
the radicals' programme, he has actually advanced it - retaining a tight
squeeze on credit, keeping down inflation, forcing the central bank to
impose more discipline and keep real interest rates high, approving (in
Russian conditions) a very tight budget with low expenditure on the military
and protecting the remaining reformists in the government.
This 'new' Mr Chernomyrdin - his supporters would say it was always there -
took some time to be obvious, but impressed when it did. It was enough to
convince Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, to go to Moscow in March and after talks - and a hunting
expedition - with the prime minister, to extend to his government a Dollars
1.5bn loan.
In an article written for the Financial Times last month, Mr Chernomyrdin
revealed himself not just as a man determined to carry on reforms, but as
one who took pleasure from the commercialisation of the cities,
privatisation of businesses, and the signs of enterprise among his fellow
citizens. If he is still presenting a false reformist image, he is doing it
very well, and keeping it up for a long time.
He has clearly conceived a taste for the power he could not have expected
would be his: and he may join the other combatants for the president's chair
when it becomes vacant in two years time at the end of Mr Yeltsin's term. He
does not enjoy high popularity ratings - he is too much associated with hard
economic times - but he may be able to succeed to the rather tattered mantle
of Yeltsin and pose as a centrist able to unite the nation. It has been a
remarkable progress and a remarkable transition - and Mr Chernomyrdin
appears to have a way to run yet.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (10): Opportunity for the peasants - Recent
agricultural reforms are full of promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time after seven decades of gross mismanagement by Communists
who put Russian agriculture on its knees, Russian peasants are finally being
given the chance to put things right themselves.
A new reform programme introduced in the Nizhny-Novgorod province and
decreed a blueprint for the whole of Russia, is based on the premise of Mr
Boris Nemtsov, the local governor, that 'the Russian people are a lot
cleverer than the country's leadership gives them credit for'.
A clear system for collective and state farms to reorganise into more
efficient private units is so simple and so promising that it prompts
questions as to why Russia's rulers have come up with it only now, and only
after the intervention of foreigners. But although he has been accused of
bowing to foreign 'imperialism', Mr Nemtsov has nothing but praise for the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private investment arm,
which developed the plan together with Russian agricultural experts.
'The foreigners did what Russians couldn't do. They carried an idea through
to its logical conclusion,' says this energetic 34-year-old chief of a
province often described as a laboratory for economic reform. 'In Russia, we
have lots of ideas but little capacity to see them through.'
Another reason for the failure of previous attempts at reform has been a
fierce ideological debate over private land ownership. Since the collapse of
Communism, agriculture has been held hostage to battles between radicals
seeking to break up state and collective farms, and conservatives who oppose
private property and call for more subsidies.
Farm subsidies pushed through by the country's powerful agrarian lobby
consume up to 10 per cent of national budget expenditure. Although
agriculture has recorded a much milder drop in output than industry - and
Russia has even begun cutting back grain imports - prices remain high,
quality poor, and distribution uneven.
Farmers are unable to use their land as collateral for bank loans to
develop. A poorly-developed trade infrastructure and a backward,
over-monopolised food-processing industry mean waste, high costs, and a raw
deal for Russian consumers. Even when peasants manage to bypass middlemen
and take their produce directly to town, they usually have to pay protection
money to racketeers.
A middle course followed by Mr Boris Yeltsin since his election as president
three years ago sought to encourage the development of a new class of
private farmers without forcing the break-up of collective and state farms.
This meant that some city dwellers and peasants were able to obtain land
from state reserves and existing collective and state farms.
With generous injections of cheap credit, up to 300,000 private farms
appeared around the Russian countryside. But old state and collective farms,
ordered to 'reorganise' without instructions on how this should be done,
remained basically unchanged: costly to maintain and no more efficient than
before.
President Yeltsin, having dissolved the conservative parliament last autumn,
sought to adopt a more active land reform policy and issued a decree
overturning a five to 10-year moratorium on the resale of land imposed by
the old parliament. In a December referendum - the results of which have
since been queried but not reversed - he pushed through a new constitution
laying down private property as an inalienable right.
At the same time, however, prospects for further reform appeared to receive
a setback when December elections also returned a parliament dominated by
ultra-nationalists, and neo-communists. A newly-reshuffled government, shorn
of radicals, promptly announced protectionist import tariffs, new subsidies
for agriculture, and old-style output targets specifying, for example, that
Russia should produce 39bn eggs this year.
But the government's lack of a coherent strategy for agricultural reform had
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin embracing the Nizhny-Novgorod project as
a model for the whole of Russia last March.
The government has since drawn up instructions spelling out how local
authorities in other provinces can reproduce the scheme. Moscow also says it
is about to submit to parliament a land code, setting out the ground rules
for a land market.
Relying on the greed of peasants rather than compulsion from on high, the
Nizhny-Novgorod scheme is strictly voluntary. The scheme, bowing to
peasants' suspicions of outsiders, for the time being restricts the
distribution, and subsequent re-sale, of agricultural land to local farmers.
These two elements make the programme much more difficult to challenge
politically.
The programme also differs crucially from Russia's initial system of
encouraging individual farmers because it does not rely on the good will of
local bureaucrats or collective farm chiefs. Once a farm has opted to
reorganise, each worker gets a property entitlement certificate whose value
is calculated according to an individual's length of service. Before
equipment, stocks and land are auctioned off, farmers wishing to work
together in a private partnership have an opportunity to pool their
entitlements together and bid jointly for selected tractors and land.
This means that rather than systematically breaking up farms into
inefficiently small individual units - as was done in Lithuania, for example
 -the scheme allows farmers themselves to decide what size farms are likely
to be most effective.
The first results of the reorganisation of six collective and state farms
under the Nizhny-Novgorod pilot project are being closely studied by other
regions.
'We don't know what the result will be but we chose this path and we are
trying it,' says Mrs Yekaterina Makaricheva, 39, the energetic chief of
Moshkinskoye, one of eight private farms spawned by the reorganisation of
the Sixty Years of October collective farm. 'It is better to try rather than
wait for a gift from on high because I'm sure nobody will give us anything.'
She says the first results are encouraging. If the 300-member farm she heads
proves unwieldy, she is confident that farmers like herself will survive by
setting up smaller businesses. Another offshoot of the programme has been
the encouragement of enterprises devoted to the servicing of the farms
themselves.
Mr Sergei Klementiev not only farms land he won at one of the auctions with
his land-entitlement certificate, but has set up his village's first cafe,
and takes produce to town for other farmers such as Mrs Makaricheva. Another
local entrepreneur provides Mrs Makaricheva with fuel at half the price
charged by the local state fuel monopoly.
Clearly, not all the new businesses will succeed. Mrs Liubov Bubnova appears
weighed down by her new responsibilities as head of the neighbouring Rostok
farm. Of all the problems facing new farms, Mrs Bubnova suggested that
motivation was the most serious. 'They need to be a little bit more
ambitious,' observed Mr Christopher Shupe, a Michigan agricultural student
working on Mrs Bubnova's farm to research the results of the reorganisation.
But Mrs Bubnova said that it was difficult to get people to work harder on
her 35-member farm when pay was 'low' - even though the local monthly wage
of Rbs150,000 is not too bad for Russian standards - and often late. The
reason the money was late was because many of her clients did not pay for
deliveries.
In Nizhny-Novgorod, the scheme is being accompanied by Rbs6bn this year in
subsidised loans for farms like Mrs Bubnova's which decided to reorganise.
Cheap loans for setting up small food-processing units designed to create
competition for local monopolists also led to the creation of 123 new
dairies and meat-processing businesses in the Nizhny-Novgorod region last
year. The British government, which is financing the IFC's work, is also
helping to establish local advice centres for farmers.
While the Nizhny-Novgorod project displays an impressive alliance of Russian
political will, and western technical assistance, it is clear that much
painstaking work remains to be done to deliver similar results on a massive
scale.
Mr Nemtsov reckons it will take at least 10 years to reproduce the plan
across the province and Russia as a whole. Dr Vassily Uzun, the Russian
agricultural expert who is considered the main inspiration for the scheme,
says he will be glad if it takes only 20 years.
Providing Russia's squabbling politicians do not interfere with progress on
the ground, the reform gives Russia's long-suffering peasants a unique
chance to prove that they are capable of seizing the initiative with both
hands.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (8): Grievances shed some useful light /
Profile of Uralmash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advertisement outside the gates of recently-privatised Uralmash,
Russia's biggest heavy engineering company, promises great hope for the
future. 'New Times, New Ideas, New Frontiers. Uralmash - the Guarantee of
Your Success.'
But the reality at the factory in President Boris Yeltsin's home town of
Yekaterinburg gives less cause for cheer. Mr Victor Korovin, Uralmash's
41-year-old director, finds adjusting the company to the new circumstances
of Russia's market economy tougher than he expected when it was privatised
last year.
Mr Korovin is one of a breed of younger managers who have welcomed radical
market reforms. His grievances, which are not the whinings of old-style
managers who have no idea of how to cope, shed useful light on the long-term
problems facing the flagships of Russian industry.
For all its reformist zeal, Uralmash is caught in a vicious squeeze - by its
sheer size, built up in the Soviet past when big was beautiful and quality
irrelevant, and by a dearth of investment finance to make it more
competitive for the future.
Far from warning that the company is on the verge of collapse, as many
directors do when they try to squeeze subsidies from the government, Mr
Korovin says Uralmash will survive - but will continue a gradual decline.
'There is no money for investment and this means we are not looking after
our future,' he says. 'For a good businessman, for someone who wants the
company to flourish, this is a catastrophe.'
Monthly inflation, which has been lowered from 30 per cent last year but is
still high at 10 per cent, discourages investment while prohibitive interest
rates discourage bank-borrowing. Meanwhile, many of Uralmash's potential
customers are caught in a web of mutual debts, caused by the government's
failure to impose financial discipline on companies for fear they will go
bust. Uralmash itself owes, and is owed, some Rbs13bn.
In his fight to control costs, Mr Korovin has already begun painful
restructuring. The workforce has contracted from 28,000 to 19,000 - with
some of the departures voluntary but others compulsory. Mr Korovin has also
closed down or mothballed entire sections of the 5 sq km plant. He expects
his output to fall by another 30 per cent this year - roughly in line with a
25 per cent drop forecast for industrial output as a whole but less than the
40-plus per cent fall forecast for machine-tool plants such as his. He
agrees that much of this is necessary slimming - 'We have to pay for the
(Communist) system we had for 70 years'. But he believes that this year's
contraction in output - to a third of what the company produced in 1987 - is
'the limit beyond which we cannot afford to go'.
And even if it pares its own costs further, Uralmash is unlikely to be able
to finance investment from its own funds. Having made a pre-tax profit of
Rbs13bn last year, Uralmash paid Rbs5.2bn in taxes, and spent most of the
rest on wages, workers' housing and working capital. To appease the
workforce, which acquired half the company during privatisation, it spent
another billion roubles on dividend payments which other shareholders would
have preferred to plough back into the company. Very little was left for
capital investment which Uralmash needs to replace inefficient, worn-out
equipment.
Adding injustice to injury, it is 'official' enterprises such as Uralmash
rather than Russia's booming unofficial economy, which carry the brunt of
taxation in Russia. In addition, many of them continue to finance a heavy
burden of so-called social assets - such as housing, hospitals, and
kindergartens - which elsewhere in the world are taken in charge by the
state.
Mr Korovin has made an energetic start in paring these so-called
'non-productive assets.' But despite these efforts, Uralmash still spent
Rbs1.3bn out of its pre-tax profits on the upkeep of housing built for its
workers but no longer exclusively occupied by them.
The best deal which Mr Korovin could squeeze out of the regional
administration was a promise that it would take on 30 per cent of these
costs this year, 50 per cent next year, and the whole lot in five years'
time.
The changes which this former Communist youth movement leader has already
pushed through have led to his growing unpopularity among a demoralised
workforce which accuses him of uncaring capitalist exploitation. 'He does
not strive for the working class,' said Sasha, a 24-year-old worker.
But as one of the few managers who did not try to block outside investors
from buying into the company when it was privatised, Mr Korovin appears to
be disappointed with the kind of support he has received from his own
capitalist backers.
He says Mr Kakha Bendukidze, a Moscow entrepreneur who acquired 18.5 per
cent of the company when it was privatised, has not, for example, provided
him with the sort of financial expertise and advice he had hoped for. A deal
he engineered to supply equipment for the development of Russia's huge
copper deposit at Udokan in eastern Siberia may also be at risk because the
Russian entrepreneur who won the tender to develop it is having trouble
raising the finance needed to build the mine.
Having sought strategic partnerships with western engineering companies, Mr
Korovin has tried to get around foreign investors' reluctance to invest
directly in Uralmash by setting up joint ventures with the likes of
Caterpillar of the US. But these are taking time to translate into contracts
for orders.
Meanwhile Uralmash is quickly losing a competitive advantage due to cheap
Russian raw materials which are now climbing in price towards world levels.
Mr Korovin, like many industrialists, argues that the government must at
least create minimal conditions for him to succeed. In the absence of a
coherent industrial policy from the government, he recently convinced it to
repay debts owed by Russia to Bulgaria with Uralmash machinery. The benefit
for the government would be to assess the machinery's value in world prices
but pay Uralmash only up to 70 per cent of that amount.
However, an official from the local administration, Mr Yevgeny Grachev,
berates Uralmash for not doing more to help itself. He says the company is
doing a poor job marketing what it produces, and should drastically slim
down its range of products anyway.
'Our big tragedy is that everybody is waiting for economic and political
stability, perfection of the banking system, and tax improvements,' claims
Mr Grachev. To which Mr Korovin's assistant, present at the interview,
replies that 'this is all easier to do than it sounds'.
For the time being, Mr Korovin's pessimism about the future seems better
founded than the bright hopes he started off with a year ago.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (7): Thrown in at the deep end / Review of
the privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In three days' time, Russia will have completed the most ambitious
privatisation programme in history. More than 11,000 state-owned
enterprises, accounting for 70 per cent of Russian industry, will have been
sold to the public for 148m vouchers distributed free of charge to every
Russian citizen. Under a new government programme which has yet to be
approved by parliament, a second phase of privatisation due to begin after
July 1 would sell remaining state-owned stakes in privatised companies for
money only.
However, as Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister responsible for
privatisation, observed earlier this month: 'The great battle for
privatisation has clearly been won, but the battle over the assessment of
its results is only just starting'.
For Mr Chubais, the only radical reformer still in office two years after
the launch of market reforms in Russia, the wider challenge of protecting
his legacy is daunting. Assuming that he manages to stay in office, it
consists of nothing less than ensuring the survival of hundreds of companies
thrown into market reform at the deep end by privatisation. 'I know what to
do to make things right,' he said recently. 'I have the levers and the team
to do it. I carry responsibility for it too.'
Already, however, his legacy is being attacked by conservatives such as Mr
Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, who claim it has aggravated the crisis of
Russian industry, set for a 25 per cent drop in output this year. Even
better-managed factories are starved of the capital they need to modernise,
restructure and survive in a more competitive environment. Companies owe
each other Rbs22,000bn in unpaid debts - their own way of subsidising each
other in order to avoid the harsh realities of market economics.
Although he cannot be held responsible for the high inflation and the lack
of a structural policy which are prolonging the agony of Russian industry,
Mr Chubais faces a dual challenge in helping the more promising companies
benefit from privatisation. One is to force bankruptcies and reorganisations
at companies which are badly managed and have failed to restructure of their
own accord. The other is to encourage investment in companies with the
prospects and the will to change.
The 'mass' privatisation ending this month achieved a qualified success in
attaining the three aims it set out to achieve.
The first was political: to dramatically lessen the over-weening role of the
state in the economy, and make the shift from state planning to capitalism
irreversible. Giving away vouchers entitling citizens to a share of the
nation's wealth, as well as enabling workers and managers to acquire at a
discount of up to 51 per cent from their workplaces, was designed to create
grass roots support for market reforms in the face of opposition from
parliament and old-style industrial managers.
Given the inability of a weak and old-fashioned state bureaucracy to make
managers act in a more market-orientated way, the second goal was to force
enterprises to change their behaviour simply by exposing them to market
forces.
But partly because of the government's reluctance to apply hard budget
constraints to enterprises, many are doing nothing to adjust, paying workers
to come to work while producing less and less. 'They are simply waiting for
something to happen', as Mr Vladimir Shcherbakov, a former Soviet minister
who now heads a privatisation fund, put it.
There have also been some cases of privatisation producing positive changes
in management. One example was provided by the Vladimir Tractor Plant
earlier this year. There, institutional investors elected as chief executive
officer a former deputy director of the plant with a degree from Harvard
Business School - in order to begin the restructuring which an old-style
director had tried to avoid by borrowing money to pay wages and supplying
goods to insolvent customers.
The third aim, to facilitate a flow of foreign investment needed by Russian
companies to acquire not just new technology to replace outdated and
inefficient equipment but business know-how, has perhaps proved the most
successful.
Most of the leading foreign companies with a strategic reason to build an
industrial presence in Russia have begun doing so only thanks to Mr
Chubais's voucher auctions, not least because this has proven easier than
trying to negotiate deals with government officials. Such 'strategic'
investors have typically acquired minority stakes in Russian companies
occupying the markets they would like to join - mostly in consumer
industries such as food-processing, alcoholic beverages, clothing and
tobacco. There has also some growing interest from western fund managers,
attracted if nothing else by rock-bottom prices and hopes of a high return
on a high-risk investment.
Although figures are hard to come by, Mr Chubais says that foreign equity
investment totalled Dollars 1.5bn last year and could reach Dollars 4bn this
year.
Privatisation has itself generated the momentum for some of the further
reforms which are necessary to ensure its success. The overnight appearance
of millions of small investors and of thousands of private companies starved
of investment has created a double imperative for the development of
efficient capital markets.
This means establishing ground rules for everything from the protection of
minority shareholders, to fair advertising standards, company disclosure,
and self-regulating professional associations to run reasonably transparent
markets.
Mr Jonathan Hay, a US adviser to the Russian privatisation ministry (whose
formal title is Committee for the Management of State Property), believes
that the very success of privatisation depends on the development of capital
markets. 'The whole assessment of privatisation will be tied to this. If
companies cannot get access to capital markets, the view will be that
privatisation was an awful thing to do. If they do, people will say that
privatisation laid the basis for the rebirth of the Russian economy and
Chubais will become a folk hero.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (6): End of the Wild West free-for-all -
Commercial banking is coming of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian commercial banking, one of the fastest-growing sectors of the
economy, is coming of age - as is the country's central bank, which only
recently began taking seriously its role as guardian of the country's
financial health.
As the central bank gets to grips with banking supervision and responsible
monetary policy, the country's 2,214 banks may finally be embarking on a
transition from a Wild West free-for-all to competition, consolidation, and
regulation.
In the latest sign of changes to come, President Boris Yeltsin only two
weeks ago gave up attempts to keep western competition out of the domestic
market and reversed restrictions on half a dozen western banks licensed to
set up full banking subsidiaries in Russia.
The licences, issued by the central bank almost a year ago in an attempt to
attract western investment and banking know-how to Russia, had been
effectively frozen under fierce pressure from some powerful Russian banks.
'Bringing in foreign banks is like saying 'Let's invite foreign police to
Russia to deal with crime',' says Mr Garegin Tasunian, chairman of
Technobank and deputy chief of the Association of Russian Banks (ARB).
Technobank and other ARB members had lobbied for blanket protection against
western banks for at least a few years more to give 'Russian banking time to
stand on its own two feet'.
But apart from bringing in foreign banks to raise standards through
increased competition, the Russian central bank has also begun to turn to
the task of restructuring and monitoring the health of domestic commercial
banks.
The growth of Russian banking since the break-up of the old Soviet Union's
state banking monopoly in the late 1980s has been prodigious - and virtually
unregulated.
Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy central bank governor, reckons that with a 71 per
cent return on equity last year, banking is probably the most profitable
sector of the Russian economy.
Benefiting from wild currency fluctuations, high inflation and, until
recently, ridiculously cheap central bank credits, banking in Russia has
been tantamount to a licence to print money.
But the boom days may be numbered since the central bank began charging
positive interest rates on loans to commercial banks intended to support
industry, agriculture and Russia's northern territories.
This form of state subsidy, first attacked by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former
finance minister, was intended to act as a sort of industrial policy but is
now recognised as ineffective and open to corruption.
The central bank itself says its official goal is to phase out so-called
directed credits altogether so that its resources are allocated only by a
new system of auctions introduced this year. It auctioned off 13 per cent of
total first-quarter lending to commercial banks of Rbs2,700bn.
Meanwhile, in a welcome move to make a clear distinction between lending and
subsidies, Rbs6,000bn (Dollars 3bn) which started off the year as 'credits'
earmarked for agriculture have already been incorporated into the 1994
budget as straight subsidies.
Another improvement for consumers is that Sberbank, the national savings
bank, has been paying positive interest rates on savings accounts for the
first time since the value of citizens' savings were wiped out by price
liberalisation in January 1992.
In an attempt to flush out a proliferation of smaller institutions which, to
quote Mr Tulin, are just 'pretending to be banks', the central bank decreed
from January 1995 a 20-fold increase in banks' minimum capital requirement.
Under the old threshold of Rbs100m, he says that entrepreneurs could 'choose
between buying a new car and setting up a bank'. From 1999, the threshold
will rise further from Rbs2bn to the equivalent of Ecu5m - the present
minimum requirement for banks in the European Union.
The main game of small banks and financial institutions has been to attract
the savings of citizens using deceitful advertising promising very high
interest rates.
As long as they can continue to attract funds, such institutions may be able
to keep their promises to investors for a while. But as soon as the new
money runs out, the danger is that if they have not already run off with
depositors' money, such institutions will simply collapse.
In an attempt to pre-empt such dangers - which take on important dimensions
in a country where viewers are used to believing everything they see on
television - President Yeltsin earlier this month issued a long-awaited
decree banning dishonest advertising.
But a potentially more serious threat to the banking sector comes from
bigger banks owed large sums of money by ailing enterprises which happen to
be their shareholders and may for the first time be allowed to go bankrupt.
The threat in this case is of a 'domino' effect of bank crashes
precipitating business collapses across the economy.
For the first time in post-Communist history, the central bank withdrew
licences from 19 banks last year. Another 21 lost their licences for
non-compliance with central bank regulations in the first half of this year
alone.
'There have been no major banking scandals so far because we have been
dealing with small banks, with very few individual customers, and very small
companies as clients,' says Mr Tulin.
But he reveals that 40 banks now being investigated for potential trouble
include some among Russia's top 50 to 100 banks although, he hastens to add,
none of them are well-known internationally. Some of the problems are the
result of 'classical mistakes' by banks which, for example, invested too
much in real estate, including their own new premises, at the expense of
liquidity. Other banks were caught napping by the central bank's sharp
increase in interest rates from negative levels of 100 per cent to now
positive rates of about 200 per cent.
Despite the problems, the banks' wealth has attracted not just the keen
interest of Russian organised crime, which launders money through the banks
without controls, and is behind contract killings of bankers who resist
extortion attempts. At a time when industry is starved of capital, certain
politicians, including Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister,
have issued veiled threats about the need to force banks to lend to the
'productive sector of the economy'.
Any attempts to force banks to lend by legislation will not work,' retorts
Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Soviet-era central bank chairman, who until last
year expressed more concern about the health of industry than the health of
the rouble or the banks.
Except when they are acting as transmission belts for state loans to
companies, the banks as a rule do not provide medium or long-term loans
because of high inflation, still at about 10 per cent a month, and a lack of
security for such lending.
Typical is the loan portfolio of Incombank, one of the leading private
Russian commercial banks. Last year, only 3 per cent of its rouble loans
were for more than a year, with 75 per cent up to six months.
Although President Yeltsin promised that the arrival of foreign banks would
make it easier for entrepreneurs and industry to borrow money at low rates,
the western banks also see obstacles to lending in Russia.
'We are prepared to lend to Russian companies if we can get security,' says
Mr Dominique Menu, Moscow representative for Banque Nationale de Paris. 'But
for the moment this is an economy without sanctions.'
Apart from the fact that most clients do not have a track record, many
standard tools for assessing credit risk do not apply in Russia, and the
most popular methods for recovering loans from bad borrowers remain violent.
The only companies which can raise bank finance in Russia today are involved
in trading and Russia's more lucrative exports.
But the picture may slowly begin to change. In a project inspired by Mr
Fyodorov when he was still in the government last year, the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development is trying to encourage banks to lend to
small businesses which could play an important role in the country's
economic recovery.
For example, Nizhegorodsky Bankirsky Dom, a commercial bank in the reformist
province of Nizhny-Novgorod, has already been lent Dollars 500,000 under an
EBRD scheme which consists of lending funds to Russian banks which agree to
pick up half the cost of loans which do not get repaid.
But the main hope of harnessing banks to economic growth is for the
authorities to stick to their new-found financial orthodoxy, while making it
easier for banks to lend money to companies - for example by improving the
courts' ability to handle commercial disputes.
Prof Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Yeltsin, says that
the government is examining ways of insuring banks against lending risk.
Meanwhile, the central bank, whose own irregular practices were revealed in
a Coopers &amp; Lybrand audit two years ago, faces the prospect of external
supervision on its own activities. Mr Fyodorov, the former finance minister
who now heads parliament's sub-committee on central bank reform, has,
together with commercial banks, drafted a new law which inter alia would
create a supervisory council to monitor the central bank's performance.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (4): Malign legacy resurfaces - Russia
remains a militarised state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The military accounts for some 2.1m men and women in Russia: police and
paramilitary account for another 1m. Russia remains, as the Soviet Union
was, a militarised state in which the ratio of men under arms exceeds that
of most others.
It is a reflection of the militarisation of a state which was geared to an
aggressive - and defensive - posture vis a vis an encircling world. It is
changed greatly: but the legacy of the huge defence machine is not swept
away in an instant.
This year, the third since Russia's independence, has seen that malign
legacy of a communist state which regarded most others as potential enemies
impose its imperatives upon the present in a particularly sharp form.
The legacy is not just one of bases all over Russia and over much of the
former Soviet Union: it is also one of an industry whose best plants were
geared to produce weaponry, and whose best engineers, technicians and
scientists were set to work on military output and research. The former
Soviet war effort, hugely weakened but basically unreformed, now presents
the struggling government of Russia with one of its greatest tests.
This test may be divided into three parts:
First, to redefine the role of the Russian military in the post-cold war
world;
Second, to restructure the armed forces;
Third, to wean industry away from a dependence on military orders towards
responding to the civilian market.
The first of these has begun. Russia's military doctrine has been published
 -itself a huge breakthrough - and although it contains some difficult
passages as the right to intervene in conflicts affecting neighbouring
states, it generally takes account of Russia's changed circumstances.
However, it presents guidelines rather than describing what the military is
actually doing: not surprisingly, for that is still evolving.
Russia, as its leaders have often said in the past three years, has no
enemies: even the intercontinental missiles - Russia still has 30,000
nuclear warheads - have been symbolically detargeted from the US and other
Nato countries. However, it remains doubtful about co-operation with new
friends - especially with Nato, for so long the closest antagonist to the
Warsaw Pact military alliance which the Soviet Union dominated.
Nato has proposed a Partnership for Peace, a loose grouping in which the
former communist states would draw closer to their former antagonists, stage
joint exercises but fall short of joining Nato itself. Russia seems likely
to sign up in concert with most other former Soviet states, but only after
long hesitation and with many reservations.
Russia regards itself still as a superpower which, in nuclear terms, it
certainly is; as a regional leader, which it also is; and as a country still
liable to be isolated by surrounding states. Russian military tradition has
emphasised, naturally, the vulnerability of the flat open spaces of western
Russia to invasion. Now, with its borders closer to Moscow than they have
been for centuries, Russia feels vulnerable, deprived of protection.
It has attempted to solve this problem by making agreements with the
neighbouring states to have their borders policed by Russia as well as
native border guards. It has also intervened in Georgia - first on the side
of the Abkhazian rebels - unofficially - and now as an officially sanctioned
peacekeeping force.
It retains an army in the Transdnestr area of Moldova to protect the
Russian-speaking population there. Its troops shore up the regime in
Tajikistan and guard its border with Afghanistan. And they hold bases in all
republics which are members of the Confederation of Independent States,
except Azerbaijan - and there they are pressing for at least one, as a
condition of halting the Armenian advances in that country.
The troops have, however, been withdrawn from Lithuania; agreements have
been signed to withdraw from Latvia; and in Estonia, negotiations are
proceeding with the target date for final withdrawal set at the end of
August.
The Russian general staff broadly accepts the need for change and has backed
the Partnership for Peace. However, it has had to delay joint US-Russian
exercises which should have taken place in Russia this month because of
nationalist pressure, especially from parliamentary deputies.
Decades of isolation and of regarding the west as an enemy have left deep
marks. While co-operation continues, the limits of it have become much
clearer this year.
Though an agreement signed earlier this year between Russia and Ukraine
under US auspices to bring the nuclear weapons from Ukraine to Russia is
being observed, considerable worries remain over stockpiles of chemical and
biological weapons in Russia - stockpiles which, western analysts fear, may
not be wholly accounted for by the Russian authorities. Research may even be
continuing unknown to these authorities or to which they are deliberately
blind.
The military remains a conscript force, although with a draft much reduced
from Soviet times due to widespread evasion. Morale is said to be low in all
services; budget cuts have limited exercises and the state of readiness is
thought to be low. The official aim is a professional army, but the
resources to transform it are lacking. This has meant a huge oversupply of
officers and generals compared to other ranks while the officers remain very
often badly housed and sporadically paid.
Military industry has suffered in the past two years from very deep cuts in
subsidies and orders: at the same time, military conversion has been
limited. The current military budget for 1994, set at Rbs40,000bn, would
make up about one third of total budget expenditure, but is still said by
the top commanders to be too low to preserve the army in a reasonable
condition. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has lobbied
vigorously for more resources and the struggle is not yet over.
Politically the military remains hugely influential - especially after the
October events of last year saw it intervene on the side of the president
against the parliament. The need to preserve its loyalty may well dictate
extra spending and will further delay necessary reforms. Its traditional
loyalty and subservience to civilian leadership has not yet been broken, but
the danger is greater than before.
The positive side is that it has successfully and peacefully withdrawn from
eastern Europe and, in doing so, from the Baltics. Its discipline has held
and it is no longer automatically favoured by the authorities - indeed, in
some respects it has suffered disproportionately.
The challenge facing it over the next few years is to reshape itself into a
force capable of guaranteeing national security, while regaining a spirit
and an efficiency which would in turn ensure that it remained outside of
politics.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (2): From revolution to evolution - The
economy is already restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two-and-a-half years after President Boris Yeltsin launched radical market
reforms, the Russian economy may finally be settling from revolution to
evolution.
'The most important role of reformers now is to prevent silly things from
happening,' explains Mr Sergei Vasiliev, deputy economics minister and one
of the few radical reformers still in government.
Six months after the election of a parliament dominated by
ultra-nationalists and Communists, and the departure of senior reformers
such as deputy prime ministers Mr Boris Fyodorov and Mr Yegor Gaidar, this
may sound a bleak assessment.
But Mr Vasiliev believes that in order to continue its tortuous march
towards a market economy, Russia 'doesn't even need very active reformist
policies at the moment. The necessary measures are of a long-term nature and
require day-to-day efforts.'
Professor Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Yeltsin, takes
this argument one step further, claiming that Russia has already completed
'the main reforms' needed by its economy. 'Now we need painstaking polishing
work,' he says, citing for example, the need for a more efficient banking
and judicial system, and for a crackdown on organised crime.
At the alarmist end of the spectrum, Mr Sergei Glaziev, head of parliament's
economic reform committee, warns that an expected 25 per cent drop in
industrial production this year will mean the 'liquidation' of entire
sectors of Russian industry.
But dramatic Russian statistics tell only half the story of an economy that
is already restructuring in what an IMF economist described as 'a completely
chaotic, unplanned way'. With services exceeding 50 per cent of gross
domestic product for the first time in Russian history, industrial output,
considered the most sacrosanct economic indicator under Communism, now only
accounts for 30-35 per cent of GDP. A booming private economy in services
and trade is under-reported and virtually untaxed. As a result, up to 40 per
cent of the economy may not be taxed at all, and GDP may be undercounted by
as much as 15 per cent.
In the pursuit of attempts to drive down inflation and set the foundations
for economic growth, 1994 has marked the onslaught of the tightest monetary
and credit policy since Russia's botched attempt at Polish-style shock
therapy in January 1992.
The paradox is that the squeeze is being operated by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
the prime minister who six months ago floated the idea of fighting inflation
by 'non-monetary means', and by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, once dubbed the
'worst central banker in the world'.
The belated reformism has also been accompanied by some clumsy attempts to
return to greater state control over the economy in order to 'restore order'
to it. For example, one of Mr Yeltsin's least enforceable decrees issued
this month, designed to crack down on tax evasion, require companies to
report any banking transactions greater than Dollars 10,000 to the tax
authorities.
But reformers who feared the worst can pride themselves on the fact that
reforms have not been rolled back - not least because a middle-of-the-road
government which proposed to change tack turned out to be ideologically
bankrupt.
Mainly because the departure of the radicals left Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr
Gerashchenko carrying full responsibility for any resurgence in inflation,
it has remained under 10 per cent a month since February, its lowest level
since August 1992.
An end to subsidised credits to all enterprises except for agriculture,
coalmining, and the biggest factories means that companies face a real
prospect of closure unless they restructure and as long as the government
maintains its tight policies. Related attempts are being made to force
companies to repay the Rbs22,000bn in debts they have accumulated with each
other in an attempt to cushion themselves against the shock of government
policies.
'How can you have a market economy where people don't pay their debts? We
have to teach people to give back money they owe,' says Prof. Yasin.
At the same time, a mass privatisation programme, putting 70 per cent of
industry into private hands by July 1, has been allowed to draw to a
successful conclusion. Foreign trade liberalisation has continued, with the
lifting of quotas from next month on most exports including the oil and gas
which are Russia's main source of hard currency. If carried through, these
will effectively remove the last controls on domestic energy prices, as well
as abolish an important source of corruption.
President Yeltsin, who returned to the economic stage with a host of decrees
this month, also ordered the scrapping of exemptions from export and import
duties which have cost the country dear. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy
finance minister, estimates that these and other tax breaks may represent as
much as 7-10 per cent of GDP.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for the economy,
says the authorities' decision to stick to financial orthodoxy reflects a
'realisation that there are no extravagant means for stimulating economic
growth'.
Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, claims the new stance
is due to a 'general change in the mentality of monetary authorities. . .
who, by their own experience, not through textbooks, realised there is a
very simple correlation between money supply growth and the growth of
prices.'
Mr Chernomyrdin can also cite as his personal achievement the relative
political stability which has followed the election of the new parliament
and the adoption of a new constitution setting out a clear division of
powers. Confounding predictions of further conflict between the executive
and the legislative authorities, he recently cajoled powerful conservative
forces in the new State Duma into accepting an anti-inflationary budget for
1994.
Particularly revealing of the political elite's new understanding of
economic realities was a refusal by the energy and agricultural lobbies  -
strongly represented in the Duma - to support Rbs15,000bn in additional
spending demanded by the military. This would not only have wrecked a budget
already under threat from falling tax revenues at a time when the government
says it has collected only 36 per cent of tax receipts due in the first
quarter of this year. It would have meant undermining their own energy and
farming subsidies through a sharp increase in inflation because Russia
finances its budget deficit, which will be at least 10 per cent of GDP this
year, mainly by printing money.
Lying not far beneath the surface of reformers' relief over the avoidance of
'silly' decisions, is concern that more is not being done by the government
to push through structural reforms.
Mr Alexashenko, the reformist deputy finance minister responsible for the
budget, says 'the most dangerous problem is that we have no strategic
thinking in the government'.
'To the extent that the government is not meeting all the needs of declining
industry, there is shock therapy going on but it is a passive policy,'
agrees an IMF economist. 'However, there are many sectors which require a
pro-active policy and in which the government has to play an organising
role.'
An industrial policy, providing selective government support for sectors and
companies most likely to achieve growth, is described by the government as
urgently-needed but has yet to materialise.
This year, for example, Russia is to spend Rbs10,000bn on coal subsidies,
representing almost a tenth of budget revenues projected at Rbs124,000bn.
But none of this money will be used for the longer-term restructuring which
is the only way to secure the Russian coal industry's future and stop a
debilitating drain on the country's finances.
'There has been a chance for two years to close down at least one mine,'
says Prof Yasin. 'Maybe there is not enough political will now; maybe
different people are needed in office.'
The government is also failing to build up an adequate social safety net to
cope with future unemployment and prevent poverty. Earlier this month,
President Yeltsin forecast that the fight against inflation would lead to
'regional' unemployment in specific parts of the country, such as Ivanovo
province where textile plants have been on the verge of closure for months.
Mr Vasiliev argues that even if bankruptcies become more prevalent in
Russia, the present financial policies 'mean that enterprises will be dying
very slowly in Russia, which is not a bad thing. We can always consider the
possibility of a social outburst but I don't think there will be something
sudden in this sphere.'
But nobody knows exactly what the effects of these financial policies will
be on overall employment, not least because of uncertainty over whether the
government will keep to them. Unemployment, measured in terms of
job-seekers, is still remarkably low at 1.8 per cent. But it is already far
greater if one counts the number of people who are being kept on by
enterprises but are not being paid.
The main question over the next six months is whether the government will
adhere to its financial policies when enterprises start closing down.
Although the central bank has yet to phase out so-called 'directed credits'
to the economy, they carry real interest rates for the first time. Although
subsidies are still being found for the biggest enterprises - 'those with
good connections to the president and prime minister' according to Mr
Alexashenko - most companies now face hard budget constraints.
The central bank says it is following to the letter monetary growth targets
agreed with the International Monetary Fund. A memorandum of understanding
between the Fund and Russia - setting a monthly inflation target of 7 per
cent by the end of the year - may be unambitious. But because the government
is so much stronger than its predecessors, it may also be the first IMF
agreement to be carried out to the letter.
'We haven't set very ambitious goals,' says Mr Tulin. 'But we are realists.
The present state of affairs in the economy does not allow us to be more
restrictive.' Displaying continuing central bank concern about areas which
should be the responsibility of the government, he argues that more
ambitious targets for inflation would trigger 'very high unemployment'.
But one veiled signal that the government may already be unable to stick to
the 1994 budget and monetary growth ceilings came when the central bank
earlier this month lowered its official lending rate from 200 per cent to
only 185 per cent. This was well above a 140-150 per cent average interest
rate calculated by the International Monetary Fund as the benchmark which
the central bank agreed to shadow in the memorandum of understanding.
Explaining the caution, Mr Tulin says that 'the monetary factors of
inflation are under the control of the central bank except for one: the size
of the budget deficit.' He says the restrictive policies must also be
accompanied by an industrial policy.
However, because of the government's likely failure to implement an
industrial policy to minimise the damage to Russian industry, foreign
investment appears to be Russia's best hope for restarting growth in its
manufacturing sector.
Mr Chernomyrdin is due to meet international business leaders today to
discuss obstacles facing foreign investors in Russia. Prof. Yasin says the
government must take the lead in insuring foreign and domestic investors in
order to get growth going.
When Mr Chernomyrdin travels to Naples to attend the G7 summit with
President Yeltsin next month, he will be renewing pleas for foreign
investment. He will also be pressing for early negotiations for an IMF
standby credit of Dollars 3bn and a long-term rescheduling of Russia's
Dollars 80bn of foreign debt.
Although the west has been sidelined in its importance to domestic reforms
since the radicals tried and failed to carry out shock therapy with western
support, the good will of the western financial community remains crucial to
Russia's balance of payments. The IMF has calculated that Russia, which has
overestimated its trade surplus for this year, faces an external financing
gap of Dollars 25bn in 1994, compared to Dollars 15bn last year.
Because of the way in which the foreign debt was contracted, with bunched-up
maturities, an inordinately heavy burden of debt payments - Dollars 14.5bn
of principal and Dollars 6bn in interest - falls due this year. Part of that
burden has already been alleviated by an agreement this month rescheduling
Dollars 7bn in debt owed to the Paris Club of creditor governments in 1994.
So far, however, Russia has been unable to come to any arrangements over the
Dollars 26bn it owes commercial banks because of its refusal to accept that
banks should be able to seize state-owned assets if it defaults on payments.
Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, hopes nonetheless that
Russia will be able to reschedule 'all our debts on a long-term basis' this
autumn.
For all the present government's shortcomings, Prof. Yasin may be right in
arguing that political realities mean there is no realistic alternative to
the present team in Moscow. He says that because Russia is not a
dictatorship, but a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, 'people find reforms
difficult to put up with. They expressed themselves in the December 12
elections.'
But here lies the main weakness of a government which has been better able
than its radical predecessors to promote political stability in the short
term. The danger, ahead of elections scheduled for 1996, is that it lacks
the vision and expertise to promote the wider-ranging reforms required for
longer-term stability.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (3): Inspired individuals needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Some western observers ask whether it is realistic to expect Russia, with an
administration which is itself desperately unreformed, to carry out the
sorts of structural policies which have defeated many western governments,
writes Leyla Boulton.
Russian history reveals a deep-rooted tradition of state interference in the
economy even before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution killed off Russian
capitalism. But the doubts revolve around whether a Communist-era
bureaucracy, with a Third World-level of corruption, can cater to the
requirements of a modern market economy.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist and a presidential hopeful,
argues from his experience of conducting grass-roots reform in
Nizhny-Novgorod province that the necessary policies are so simple they
require little more than political will and expertise at the top.
'The problem is the mentality of a government and various lobbies which try
to use money in a Soviet way,' he says.
One example of a simple solution he is trying to introduce in
Nizhny-Novgorod is provided by the burden on enterprises which have to pay
for the maintenance of housing built for workers but no longer occupied
exclusively by them.
On the grounds that subsidising individuals is much more effective than
subsidising unwieldy companies, the idea is to transform the corporate
housing subsidies into salary increases for workers and let them deal with
the housing as they like.
Mr Yavlinsky is convinced that maintenance costs would fall to a third of
their present level as residents sought to save money and rented out extra
space to businesses.
The benefits would be significant for attempts to restructure the economy as
a whole.
'Only after that can you seriously talk of widespread bankruptcies of
enterprises because this kind of reform would finally create a proper
housing market, enabling people to move around the country to look for other
jobs.'
But he says the scheme is being held up because the government is refusing
to let companies deduct from their tax bill the amounts they have until now
deducted as housing subsidies.
President Yeltsin's attempt to adopt a more pro-active approach to reform
with the issue of a dozen new decrees this month included instructions for
the sale of bankrupt state-owned enterprises.
But Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor of Nizhny-Novgorod, finds that it is
still too vague to be helpful precisely because it provides no clear
instructions on how to dispose of the so-called social assets attached to
these enterprises.
A related failure remains the absence of a convincing safety net capable of
coping with poverty and mass unemployment. 'The main issue is that social
support is not targeted,' says Mr Sergei Vasiliev, the radical deputy
economics minister, who argues that reasonably well-off parents like himself
should not, for example, qualify for child benefits.
But partly because of political hang-ups about giving up a Soviet-era
promise of benefits for all, means-testing - developed with success in the
Baltic republic of Latvia - is unheard of in Russia.
'The social services do not know who the poorest are,' says Mr Vasiliev, who
points out that it would be easy enough to use state-owned television to
invite citizens who fall beneath a minimum subsistence level to apply for
benefits.
Despite widespread political hand-wringing over the social consequences of
reform, he adds that the fact that no single ministry has overall
responsibility for social policy means that nobody can be held responsible
for its absence.
The World Bank is discussing the establishment of pilot projects in three
regions for improving the social safety net. But these would only take
effect next year and would be of minor significance. Mr Vasiliev concludes
that the government will only begin to take serious action under pressure
from 'an external crisis, like an explosion in unemployment'.
Meanwhile, the regions are being left to their own devices, with mixed
results, as illustrated by the contrast between conservative Ulyanovsk
(Lenin's birth-place), and Nizhny-Novgorod, a laboratory for economic
reform.
Both have social safety nets of a kind. Ulyanovsk, which continues to
control prices, is maintaining a Soviet-era system. Nizhny-Novgorod has set
up a minimum monthly income threshold of Rbs55,000 for every man, woman, and
child. This means that the family of a factory worker on a salary of
Rbs100,000, with an unemployed wife and two children, qualifies for an
additional payment of Rbs110,000. This may not be much. But such initiatives
provide ample proof that with inspired individuals in charge, Russia could
deal with these pressing problems a lot more effectively than it is now.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (1):  Russians will decide their own future
 -No one can say which of three possible courses Russia will take as it
struggles to transform itself / there are far too many imponderables.  The
west can do little to influence the outcome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Looking at Russia today can be done through three possible prisms. Through
one, we would see economic and political improvement, albeit springing from
 -and to an extent dragging with it - considerable chaos.
Through another, we would see a further and perhaps even more damaging
confrontation between political powers and or economic collapse - albeit not
leading back to a reassertion of a communist regime.
The final one is muddling through - albeit with a question mark over how far
'through' gets you, and to where.
Let us take the first, and most pleasant point. After the elections of last
December which produced such a strong showing for the right-and-left
nationalist groupings, the trimming of the radical reformers from the
cabinet did not result in an abandonment of economic reform. On the
contrary: in many ways the government under Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime
minister, squeezed more tightly on credit and inflation, to keep the latter
under 10 per cent a month - good by recent Russian standards.
In March, Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, went to Moscow to agree a loan of Dollars 1.5bn as the second
part of a systemic transformation facility - a soft loan to Russia which
assisted in generating further lending from the World Bank and greater
international business interest and confidence.
At the same time, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier in charge of
privatisation, has completed his great task of giving away Russian state
industry to the population in exchange for vouchers. The next phase, in
which the remaining shares will be bought for money and when, it is hoped -
and there are some signs that the hope is realistic - Russian and foreign
investment begins to restructure these companies, should now begin.
In part, this has been made possible by a political truce which contrasts
extremely favourably with the fevered and inimical relations which existed
between President Boris Yeltsin and his government on the one hand and the
former Supreme Soviet on the other for most of 1992-93.
The leaders of the two parliamentary houses are a presidential ally - such
as Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, speaker of the Federation Council or Upper House -
and a potential opponent turned ally, such as Mr Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the
State Duma or lower house.
Although an early vote by the Duma released the ringleaders of the
parliamentary revolt of October last year, a more recent one, in June,
confirmed a tight budget on a second reading in spite of intense pressure
from the military and industrial lobbies.
The constitution which was voted in on a referendum in December 1993
unambiguously confers most power on the president, greatly moderating the
struggle for primacy between the legislative and executive branches. The
armed forces - including the military, the Interior Ministry and the
re-vamped security force, the former KGB - are directly subordinated to the
president and so far continue to show loyalty of the kind which brought them
in on his side, if belatedly, in the confrontation with the Supreme Soviet
last October. Under this general peace, entrepreneurship thrives.
Especially in Moscow and St Petersburg, the effects of this become more and
more obvious, as shops begin to transform themselves from mere distribution
points to much more attractive sales venues, as a wider range of goods
become available, and as competition begins between companies for customers.
Russian banks and financial companies, though many are still weak, now begin
to produce larger and more powerful entities which are beginning to shape up
to foreign competition and are training staff in the skills to make that
possible.
Let us take the second prism. Through it, one sees a political and economic
climate which is not peaceful, but static with ominous movements below the
surface. The tight budget has been passed by parliament, but most economists
and politicians believe it will be impossible to meet, and that it will
buckle before the military and other demands - sparking high inflation,
perhaps hyperinflation, by the end of the year.
Privatisation, though its first stage is formally accomplished, has mainly
made quasi-private monopolies of what were previous state monopolies - that
is, less under any kind of control which might have moderated their
predatory and uncompetitive behaviour.
The parliamentary lull is also temporary, on this view. It is the period in
which the opposition forces - especially the ultra-nationalist Liberal
Democratic Party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the communists and others -
are extending their organisation and support, ready for an assault on the
presidency and the government later in the year when the economic situation
worsens.
The constitution is not really accepted by many of the political parties,
and may not prove robust enough to withstand any serious challenge.
President Yeltsin, though apparently recovered from a shaky period at the
beginning of the year which saw him disappear from view for weeks on end, is
still detached from government and is given to governing by decree through a
closed inner circle of advisers.
In the states surrounding Russia, conditions are mostly worse - the Baltic
states, especially Estonia and Latvia, are an exception. In particular,
Ukraine continues to plunge downwards economically and to produce political
stasis - a state of affairs which impacts directly on Russia, since the
Ukrainian region of Crimea is seeking closer ties with Russia and eastern
Ukraine also supports a pro-Russian policy in contrast to the still-radical
nationalism of the west of the country.
The Caucasian states, though no threat, are extremely unstable, as is
Tajikistan. The other Central Asian states are stable enough, but
desperately poor.
Crime is now an epidemic, from corruption to highly-organised Mafia-style
criminality. Official corruption means an assumption of bad and dishonest
government on the part of most of the public: the organised crime instils
fear, most of all in those trying to start or maintain businesses.
The last year has seen violent deaths of a number of bankers and prominent
businessmen: their fellows now huddle in heavily-protected offices behind
security guards. At a more mundane - but perhaps as damaging - level,
widespread tax evasion deprives the state of huge amounts of tax revenue and
contributes to its weakening as well as to the decay of the infrastructure.
A last turn of the prism. Muddling through - which might describe much of
the policy this year - has the attractiveness to the governing elite and to
many others of implying no radical change.
Inflation may go up, but may again be corrected. Politics will be at times
unstable, but no one powerful enough has enough stake in violent change to
attempt to institute it. Privatisation does not produce much improvement in
enterprise behaviour initially but, bit-by-bit, the better managers and
companies find it in their interest to modernise and restructure - leaving
the bad to decay and die, even if preserved long after effective extinction
to maintain employment.
The nationalists and the communists continue to exercise a malign influence
on policy, especially foreign policy - but not so much as to turn the
country back into autarky or outright hostility to the west, or to any other
group of states - Russia is too weak for that kind of adventure.
Mr Yeltsin does not innovate but is not toppled: parliament does not bring
in the necessary legislation but does not make another grab for power: the
government does not fully control the economy but is not so weak as to lose
power entirely. Through all of this, the tender shoots of private enterprise
continue to grow as best they can - sometimes failing, sometimes partially
succeeding, but generally increasing.
No one can say which of these courses will be closest to the one which
Russia takes: there are far too many imponderables. The west can assist
Russia to avoid the worst and can contribute at the margins by helping
Russians to help themselves wherever the goals are clear and achievable. But
ultimately, as always, the fate of Russia depends on the Russians
themselves.

HK airport progress review
The Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which deals with the details of the colony's
1997 transfer to China, reconvenes. Commentators will also be looking for
signals of progress on the Hong Kong airport, which has been held up as a
result of China's concerns about its financing.
US and Canadian trade and agriculture ministers meet in Chicago in an
attempt to resolve their farm-trade dispute.
Washington has threatened to impose a quota at the end of July if the
Canadians fail to agree to curbs on fast-rising exports of durum wheat, used
for pasta. Ottawa has threatened to retaliate against a range of US
products.
US commerce secretary Ron Brown, on a trip to Latin America accompanied by
22 business leaders, inaugurates a US commercial centre in Sao Paulo. He
meets Argentine President Menem on Thursday in Buenos Aires and President
Frei of Chile on Friday.
Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, leaves for a three-day visit to
Indonesia, where he will have talks with President Suharto. Australia has
been eager to promote trade ties with its south-east Asian neighbour.
However, the visit has been overshadowed by protests over the Indonesian
government's decision to revoke licences for three local news magazines.
Nigerian military leaders meet:
The Nigerian four-month National Constitutional Conference opens in Abuja.
The military regime says this will help to restore civilian rule, but
opponents say the government is stalling and should make way for Moshood
Abiola (above), the winner of last year's annulled presidential poll, who
was arrested last week.
Vat in harmony: The European Commission opens a conference on European
enterprises and VAT. Business leaders and Brussels officials will address
the problem of how to harmonise value added tax regimes in the Union by
1997.
Chess: Gary Kasparov faces his younger challengers in the second leg of the
Dollars 750,000 Intel Grand Prix in New York (to June 30). India's Vishy
Anand won the first leg at the Kremlin.

TUESDAY
Korean nuclear crisis
Deputy prime ministers from North and South meet to discuss arrangements for
a summit between the leaders of the two countries in an attempt to resolve
the crisis precipitated by the North's nuclear programme.
The Japanese government, against a background of fresh political turbulence,
may announce a package of deregulation and tax reform measures in an attempt
to curb the high trade surplus. Events will be closely observed by
Washington and foreign exchanges, and may affect the value of the yen, the
week after it attained a new high against the dollar.
China's eight-year-old bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade enters a crucial stage with negotiations in Geneva today. Following
Washington's decision in May to renew China's most-favoured-nation trading
status and to dissolve the link between this issue and that of China's human
rights record, the Gatt negotiations are bound for the home straight.
Beijing hopes to become a member by the year-end, so that China can become a
founder member of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation.
Chile's president Eduardo Frei meets US President Bill Clinton in
Washington. Mr Clinton has already assured Chile that it will be next in
line for a free-trade agreement, but the necessary 'fast-track' negotiating
authority to enable that has run into difficulties in Congress.
Haiti's exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, will speak on efforts to
restore democracy in his country at the National Press Club in Washington.
He is likely to repeat his demand for US military action to allow his return
to Haiti.
Impressionists hammered:
Manet's first version of one of the most famous of all Impressionist
paintings 'Un bar aux Folies-Bergere' is on offer at Sotheby's in London
tonight. It is sketchy by comparison with the finished product, but a price
of about Pounds 3m is anticipated. In the same auction is one of the 10
paintings of poplars completed by Monet in 1891 (above). It might also fetch
Pounds 3m.
FT Survey: Computer Networking.
WEDNESDAY 29
Hong Kong awaits vote
Chris Patten puts his democracy proposals for Hong Kong to the vote at
today's meeting of the Legislative Council (LegCo). The governor first
mooted his proposals to broaden democracy in the colony in October 1992,
immediately incurring China's wrath.
China accused Mr Patten of violating the Basic Law, which lays out the
constitution for Hong Kong after transition, and said that it would
dismantle representative bodies upon assuming sovereignty in 1997.
Some 17 rounds of talks between Britain and China failed to resolve
differences.
Bulgarian debt: Bulgaria and Deutsche Bank are due to sign a
debt-rescheduling deal which will reduce the country's USDollars 9.27bn
foreign commercial debt by USDollars 3.8bn.
Last November Bulgaria and some 300 London Club commercial banks, chaired by
Deutsche Bank, agreed to reduce principal on the debt, which was racked up
by the former Communist regime, by about 50 per cent, and they set a
mid-1994 deadline for agreeing final terms.
Bulgaria plans to make an advance payment of more than USDollars 700m. The
country hopes that settlement of the debt will attract foreign support in
its transition to a market economy.
India's prime minister PV Narasimha Rao begins a three-day visit to Russia.
De Beers of South Africa, which controls at least 80 per cent of world trade
in rough (uncut) diamonds via its London-based Central Selling Organisation,
reports first-half sales today.
These are expected to at least match, and perhaps to exceed, the record
USDollars 2.54bn reported for the first six months of 1993.
Safety in numbers: 1,321 quoted companies, about 95 per cent of those in the
first section of the Tokyo stock exchange, hold annual shareholders'
meetings today. The companies deliberately meet on the same day in order to
frustrate the efforts of sokaiya, extortionist gangs who blackmail companies
not to disrupt AGMs.
Rowing: Henley Royal Regatta, premier aquatic event of the English summer,
opens (to July 3).
Cricket: Oxford University play Cambridge University at Lord's (to July 1).
FT Survey: Business Books.

Day gains a leap second
Today's final minute will have 61 seconds, so as to bring atomic clocks in
step with solar time, which is defined by the Earth's relatively erratic
rotation. Atomic clocks are accurate to one second in a million years, but
the Earth is gradually slowing down.
Bill Birch, New Zealand's finance minister, is due to deliver the country's
annual budget. It is expected to show the first fiscal surplus since the
late-1970s. Mr Birch has cautioned forecasters against being too optimistic,
but many economists are predicting a surplus between NZDollars 200m
(USDollars 340m) and NZDollars 500m.
An important question is how NZ uses this 'reward' from a decade of hard
economic reform - and to what extent it chooses to meet social goals, such
as a reduction in unemployment, at the expense of faster reduction in public
debt.
Abkhazia talks: United Nations-sponsored talks resume in Geneva between the
Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists on a permanent political
settlement for the embattled province. Under the terms of a ceasefire accord
signed in Moscow in May, some 3,000 Russian troops are being deployed to
police the Abkhaz border with the rest of Georgia. Over 200,000 non-Abkhazis
fled the region during brief but bloody fighting last September.
UK by-election: Labour, the main opposition party, defends the Monklands
East parliamentary seat near Glasgow against a strong Scottish Nationalist
party challenge. Labour has a big majority in the constituency, which was
held by John Smith, the party leader who died in May. But the party is under
pressure over allegations of corruption on the local council.
Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani's term expires. Prime minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has warned his battle to topple the president could
intensify if Rabbani does not step down on time.
Fundamentalists in Bangladesh have called a general strike to support their

Russia's sell-off continues
The largest sell-off of state property in the world formally enters its
second phase. Foreign investors are being encouraged to join in.
Germany takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.
It is keen to promote opening up to eastern Europe, and to demonstrate that
the Maastricht framework of closer co-operation on foreign policy and
internal policing, together with enhanced powers for the European
Parliament, will succeed.
Roman Herzog, Germany's new president and former chief justice of the

In the aftermath of the Fed's attempt to defend the dollar against the yen
last week, the US and Japan will be the key economic focus this week. A
clutch of Japanese statistics should indicate that Japan's recession has
bottomed out, and there are mixed signs of recovery.
Tuesday: Analysts expect today's data will show that Japanese unemployment
rose to 2.9 per cent in May, from 2.8 per cent in April, while May's retail
sales were 2.9 per cent lower than May last year.
In the UK, the Treasury's revised economic forecast is expected to point to
an increasingly healthy recovery. Predictions for 1994 gross domestic
product growth are likely to be up from the earlier figure of 2.5 per cent,
while inflation forecasts are likely to be down from 3.25 per cent.
Thursday: A spate of US economic indicators today and tomorrow are expected
to show the recovery remains strong but spending has slowed slightly.
Today's data is likely to show a small rise in factory orders in May, while
Friday's purchasing managers' index is likely to reflect the healthy state
of the manufacturing sector.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Falling dollar offers perfect excuse to sell
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bearish reaction on Wall Street to Friday's multinational effort to prop
up the dollar suggests stocks could take a hammering again this week.
In the hours after the intervention, the Dow tumbled 62 points to end a
five-day stretch which wiped a net 105 points off the bellwether index.
It was a fitting climax to a trading week dogged by concern over the dollar.
The sliding US currency could make foreign investment in US-denominated
securities less attractive, cutting off an important source of cash from the
equity markets. It could also make imports more expensive, raising the
threat of higher inflation. Most importantly, it could increase pressure on
the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates again, which would threaten
economic growth and corporate earnings.
The currency markets will remain the main focus for investors this morning.
Analysts say the futile rescue mission only served to underscore the
dollar's vulnerability. 'We need a stable dollar to hold the market
together,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany
in New York.
But others were less certain about the relevance of the currency's plight to
the downturn in share prices. 'The market right now is moving from a weak
technical standpoint, not on the basis of any fundamental changes,' says Mr
Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at Westfalia Investments in New York. 'In
the dollar, we have found a perfect excuse to sell off.'
Indeed, on Friday morning stocks were falling long before it became apparent
that the central banks would meet fierce resistance in the foreign exchange
markets. A wave of computer program-guided selling commenced with the
opening bell and drove the Dow down 52 points within two hours.
Mr Cardillo believes the programs had been set up in response to the
previous session's close below the key technical support level of 3,700. To
him, that suggests the market is destined to test its April lows of just
below 3,600.
The broad-based retreat by technology stocks last week adds credence to such
a scenario. On Thursday, the decision by Mr Michael Karfopoulous, an analyst
at SoundView Financial Group, to lower his short-term rating on Cisco
Systems set off a chain reaction which battered the technology-laden Nasdaq
composite. Even Mr Karfopoulous expressed surprise at the impact of his
rather tame comments about the computer networking company.
'When one stock can cause a whole sector to move so sharply,' observes Mr
Cardillo, 'it shows there are a lot of nervous investors out there willing
to dump anything because of the technical erosion.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Support levels become a moving target -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When one of the most noted bears in London assures us that 'the markets are
not going to crash', the bulls must indeed be having a bad time;
Mr Nicholas Knight, international equity strategist at Nomura Research,
added, however, that markets will merely 'trade to lower levels in
true bear-market fashion', which offered only scant comfort to
investors.
That was written before the central banks made their concerted intervention
to defend the dollar on Friday.
The banks' move inspired a powerful bounce at the long end of the gilt-edged
market and a determined rally to the Footsie 2,900 mark.
This morning, the stock market will be watching to see if currency
intervention alone can preserve the dollar.
If, as the stock market believes, only action on interest rates can save the
day, then share prices will again be at risk.
'Support levels' in the stock market have become something of a moving
target, with the Footsie 2,920 no longer sacrosanct.
For the record, the chartists fear that any further sell-off would leave the
Footsie vulnerable right down to 2,800.
Mr Knight believes that the dollar will remain under pressure until
US short rates are materially
higher.
Until the problems of the US dollar are convincingly addressed, runs
the market argument, bargain hunters in UK equities had best equip
themselves with long spoons.
On the brighter side, however, selling of equities remains fairly moderate
and international broking houses maintain that there are heavy institutional
buying orders waiting to go into UK equities as soon
as the outlook becomes more
settled.
Views on UK equity market valuations remain favourable, although these are
moving targets while bond market yields continue to threaten the 9 per cent
level.
Even at these levels, Strauss Turnbull sees an equity dividend yield of
almost 4 per cent as indicating that shares are not expensive relative to
conventional gilts.
Like many others, Strauss Turnbull warns that the relative against
index-linked gilts, now close to
a multiple of one, gives no such
support.
For 'yield buyers', this is the time to buy UK equities. If bond markets are
overshooting wildly in their fear of inflation, then prospective yields of 5
per cent on equities next year imply, according to S. G. Warburg, that
equities would be able to hold the line even against yields of 10 per cent
on long gilts.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Liberty Life blazes trail for corporate
South Africa - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty Life's Dollars 360m to Dollars 500m global convertible bond
offering, due to be priced in two weeks, is likely to prove a landmark
issue. A successful deal could pave the way for a spate of financings by
South Africa's underborrowed corporate sector; a flop could turn off the tap
of international investment before the flow has really started.
The deal, for the country's fourth largest company, was approved at cabinet
level as a suitable trail-blazer for the return of corporate South Africa to
the international capital markets following the first non-racial elections
in May.
In fact, Robert Fleming, which won the mandate to arrange the offering, did
not offer the cheapest terms to the company. But the generous indicated
pricing of a 6 to 6 1/2 per cent coupon and a 10 to 12 per cent cent
conversion premium for 10-year bonds, non-callable for at least the first
five years, was felt to be necessary to attract a broad range of foreign
investors.
First of all, bearish global market conditions have made international fund
managers much more choosy. (In fact, Robert Fleming has indicated that the
pricing can be adjusted if the current weakness in world markets worsens.)
In addition, South African companies are a little known quantity. The
company is doing its best to address this problem, fielding a visit from
underwriters and fund managers to Johannesburg last week and hosting a
series of roadshows in Asia, Europe and the US this week, when the
book-building process begins.
In practice, the decision on whether to buy the deal will for many investors
be a decision on South Africa. The fiscal discipline of the new government's
first budget, presented to parliament by finance minister Mr Derek Keys last
week, encouraged investors and the imminent inclusion of the country in the
IFC global emerging market index, at 13 per cent, is set to boost interest
in South African shares generally.
'Liberty Life is a good proxy for South Africa, and the convertible
structure gives it a defensive quality which appeals to more conservative
investors,' said one fund manager on last week's trip.
For investors viewing the company as proxy, there are several attractive
features: its broad range of interests, such as brewing and property, mean
that it stands to benefit from domestic economic growth. However, the deal
also has a keep-well agreement which gives investors concerned about
political risk the added security of Liberty's UK assets, which include Sun
Life.
Further, the large size of the transaction, which has made some underwriters
nervous, is an added incentive for some investors.
The South African stock market, with average daily volume this year of
Dollars 63m, is not very liquid, and some investors expect the convertible
bonds to be easier to trade than the stock.
Some fund managers will not be able to buy the bonds even if they want to,
because they are not rated. (South Africa itself has yet to be rated.)
Further, in the US, where sanctions on South Africa were strongly enforced,
some fund managers have not yet received approval to start re-investing.
However, the reception of two straight equity offerings for South African
companies following May's elections bodes well.
A Dollars 67m offering for industrial and mining giant Anglovaal, priced
late Thursday at Dollars 27.33, was 2.7 times oversubscribed, according to
arranger SG Warburg, with just over half the demand from the US. Meanwhile,
a Dollars 70m offering for retailer Pepkor is due to be priced this week.

<TEXT>
ZURICH
Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based human fertility drug specialist, has much to
talk about at its annual press conference today, writes Ian Rodger. Hard hit
last year by pressures from governments on drug prices, it has nevertheless
boldly intensified its commitment to pharmaceuticals in recent months. The
diagnostics division has been sold, minority shares in the Israeli beta
interferon subsidiary Interpharm have been mopped up and big investments
have been made in new plant.
Tomorrow the directors of Logitech, the world's leading maker of mice,
scanners and other peripherals for personal computers, face the press. Net
profit trebled to SFr27.8m in the year to March 31. But an unexpected sales
slump in the three months to March showed again that the PC sector can
spring a surprise at any time.
Last Thursday's news of a Pounds 124m provision at Rothmans International
has added an additional negative factor to the assessment of Richemont, the
Swiss group that controls Rothmans and a gaggle of luxury goods companies
brought together in Vendome, a new holding subsidiary, last summer.
Richemont reports results for the year to March 31 on Friday. Net income was
broadly flat at Pounds 96.6m in the first half, but the group warned in
December of weaker sales of luxury goods in some markets.
FRANKFURT
The Daimler-Benz supervisory board is expected to meet on Wednesday to elect
a successor to Mr Edzard Reuter, the management board chairman, who steps
down next year. Mr Juergen Schrempp, head of the Daimler Aerospace
subsidiary, is widely tipped for the job. Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary,
holds its annual news conference tomorrow and Audi's AGM is on Wednesday.
MADRID
Sevillana, the electricity distributor in the south of Spain, which last
month reported a 17 per cent increase in first-quarter after-tax profit,
holds its shareholders meeting on Wednesday. Last week, James Capel
downgraded the stock, saying that the Spanish government's official estimate
of the sum owed to the company in respect of its 50 per cent stake in the
Valdecaballeros nuclear plant under moratorium had been set at Pta170bn,
substantially below the Pta258bn included in its books. Banco Popular meets
its shareholders on Thursday. The bank, more than 50 per cent-owned by
non-Spanish institutional investors, has reported a 7.3 per cent rise in net
profits for last year. Hoare Govett, which recommends the stock, along with
that of Bankinter, says that both offer an almost irresistible combination
of high rates of profitability, strong balance sheets and low market
ratings.
PARIS
The market, under pressure since the start of the year, found no respite
last week, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
Analysts and economists are convinced, however, that on economic
fundamentals the CAC-40 should recover over the summer. But there is concern
about the Paris market's vulnerability to gloomy economic news from the US
and Germany and also to the political uncertainty in France itself in the
approach to next spring's presidential elections.
'The political situation is a factor,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief
French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'The presidential campaign raises the
risk of various candidates pledging themselves to more expansionary policies
to recapture lost votes from the demagogues: Philippe de Villiers and
Bernard Tapie.'
TOKYO
Continued uncertainty over currency fluctuations are expected to keep
investors away from the stock market, writes Emiko Terazono.
Figures this week are likely to provide further evidence that the economy
has bottomed, but may also reveal that previous expectations of an imminent
upturn may have been over optimistic.
Industrial production data on Wednesday are expected to show weak output in
May, while Tuesday's May unemployment figures are likely to highlight
continued sluggishness in the labour market.
HONG KONG
Domestic politics may dominate hearts and minds in Hong Kong this week, but
it is unlikely to have anything more than a marginal impact as investors'
attention remains firmly on the US dollar, interest rates and long bond
yields, writes Louise Lucas.
Retail investors have gained the upper hand in the absence of institutional
buyers and international players and there is scope for an upwards spike,
albeit on thin turnover, in the event of progress on talks between Britain
and China over the colony's future.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: The Big Bang comes to Portugal -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, 'Big Bang' came to Portugal, bringing the country's bond market
into line with the rest of Europe and boosting its attractiveness to foreign
investors.
The long-awaited reforms are largely structural and unlikely to change
investment flows overnight. But, coupled with Portugal's improving economic
fundamentals of falling inflation and a declining budget deficit, they are
likely to boost the market's allure in the medium term.
'These reforms are ambitious for one of Europe's smallest economies, but
underline the government's commitment to raising liquidity in this market
and increasing its attractiveness to overseas investors,' says Ms Wendy
Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International.
Since Portugal joined Europe's exchange rate mechanism in April 1992, it has
been working on a complete overhaul of its financial system, resulting in a
raft of reforms, most of which took effect last Thursday. They include:
Abolition of a 20 per cent withholding tax on non-resident holders of
government debt. 'This was the most important reform - without it, the other
measures would have been mere gimmicks,' says Mr Manuel Pinho, director
general of the Portuguese Treasury.
Creation of a screen-based, over-the-counter wholesale market in government
bonds and a market-maker system. Retail bond transactions will continue to
trade on the stock market.
Legislation permitting short-selling and bond lending will soon be passed;
this is expected to provide further liquidity and risk-management tools.
The Bank of Portugal will engage in government bond repos to provide
liquidity to the market.
Stamp duty and stock market charges will be reduced; fees and stamp tax on
Treasury bond repos have been eliminated.
A new delivery-versus-payment settlement system is expected to reduce
counterparty risk and ensure smoother settlement.
Non-resident entities will be able to issue debt in the domestic market
after giving four days' notice.
A screen-based derivatives market, set up by the Oporto Stock Exchange is
set to kick off early next year with the launch of futures on government
bonds.
Amid recent turbulence in international bond markets, Portugal has performed
particularly badly. This is partly due to the fact that the higher-yielding,
peripheral markets underperformed core markets during the sell-off. The
slide was further exacerbated by the Portuguese market's lack of liquidity
and the absence of efficient risk-management tools.
Last, the rise in Portuguese short-term rates to bolster the flagging escudo
has caused the yield curve to invert, creating the only negative curve in
Europe. The resulting negative cost of carry makes it impossible for players
to fund themselves at the short end of the curve and invest at the long end,
and this has been weighing on the market. On Friday, Portuguese three-month
money was trading around 13.6 per cent, well above the 11.15 per cent yield
on the 10-year benchmark.
The yield spread between Portugal and Spain has also widened sharply in
recent weeks, especially at the short end. After yielding flat to Spanish
bonds in March, Portuguese 10-year bonds now pay a premium of 65 basis
points over Spain. The three-year spread is at 174 basis points over.
However, 'even if Portugal offers a large yield pick-up over Spain, that's
not attractive when you have a negative cost of carry', says Mr Steve Major,
head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais. 'They have to get short-term rates
down.'
The currency also remains a concern, despite officials' assurances that they
are committed to a strong escudo. 'We will do everything necessary to
support the escudo, and are willing to accept short-term costs to achieve
longer-term benefits,' said Mr Pinho.
However, some say the currency remains overvalued and may slip further -
especially if short-term rates fall. 'Real short-term rates are almost 8 per
cent - that's unsustainable in the long run,' says Ms Niffikeer, who expects
the authorities to let the escudo drift down to around Es106 per D-Mark. On
Friday it was trading at Es103.30.
Currency worries, the negative yield curve, last week's replacement of the
central bank governor and the lack of fresh supply in recent months may
overshadow the market reforms, keeping investors at bay near-term. However,
once international markets and the escudo stabilise, Portuguese bonds could
stage a strong recovery, with the yield spread over Spain narrowing back
towards zero, Mr Major predicts.
Sentiment could be further lifted by good news on the inflation and budget
deficit front. Consumer prices rose by 5.7 per cent in the year to May, down
from 6 per cent in April, and are expected to fall further, averaging
between 5 3/4 and 6 per cent this year after 6 1/2 per cent in 1993.
After last year's setback, budget consolidation also appears to be back on
track. In the first five months of the year, fiscal revenues have risen by
21.2 per cent over the same period last year - substantially higher than the
4.8 per cent increase in expenditures over the same period.

Renewed declines in the dollar sent US bond prices reeling on Friday. In
spite of yields that just a few weeks seemed attractive, few investors were
willing to take the plunge into the market with the dollar in such a
precarious condition, and traders were busy selling in anticipation of
further falls in bond prices this week. By the end of the day the yield on
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond had reached 7.52 per cent, its highest
since mid-May.
The direction of bond prices in the days to come will again be linked to the
dollar, and with currency traders predicting that further central bank
intervention will be insufficient to relieve the pressure on the US
currency, the portents do not look good.
If investors do manage to tear their eyes away from the dollar, they will
find plenty of statistics on the state of the US economy. Perhaps the most
closely-watched gauge will be the National Association of Purchasing
Management's business index for June, due out on Friday, which will give an
assessment of manufacturing conditions in the economy.
Bond market bulls, however, may find little comfort in the figures, which
are likely to show that demand and inflation gauges remain disturbingly
high. Salomon Brothers predicts that the overall index will be up 0.3 points
to 58, a four-year high.

Bunds staged a recovery last week but can this be sustained in the coming
days?
Sentiment may be helped by data on manufacturing and industrial output for
May, due this week. Mr Klaus Baader at Lehman Brothers predicts that both
figures will grow by less than 0.5 per cent - a sharp slowdown from the
previous month and further confirmation that the German economic recovery is
pallid rather than vigorous.
Provisional inflation figures for June are also expected. The consensus is
that the year-on-year rate will at worst be unchanged from the 3 per cent of
May, although the closely-watched number could fall to 2.9 per cent.
Mr Klaus Holschuh of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, says the market may recover
confidence, with the yield on 10-year bunds heading below 7 per cent. He
warns though that there may well be false starts and investors may sell into
a price recovery.
Crucial to the market in coming weeks are Germany's private and other
'non-bank' investors, who bought DM20bn of bunds in the first four months of
the year. The Bundesbank is hoping to drive these investors out of
short-term deposits into longer-term investments and this has started to
happen. But these purchases are offset by sales by foreign investors who
off-loaded DM37.7bn of bunds in February to April.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT

<TEXT>
With no significant UK economic data due this week, international factors
are set to play a key role in the gilt markets. In the aftermath of the
Fed's apparently unsuccessful attempt to defend the dollar on Friday, the
international bond climate seems set to remain both bearish and volatile.
This is expected to have a knock-on effect on gilts, not least because UK
bonds are currently closely reflecting developments in continental European
bond markets such as Germany.
On the domestic front, the main event of the week will be the Bank of
England's Pounds 2bn auction on Wednesday of a floating-rate Treasury 1999
issue. With the size slightly lower than the Pounds 2.5bn of the last FRG
issue, some analysts, like Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International,
argue that this indicates the Treasury is revising down its expectation for
the public sector borrowing requirement.
Other traders disagree. and argue that it is too early in the financial year
to forecast a change in the level of government borrowing.
Either way, the release of the Treasury forecast on Tuesday, which will
include a PSBR prediction for this year, will be scrutinised by the gilts
market. The forecast is expected to show that expectations of inflation have
been revised down and those of growth rates up.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Madden's team goes global to fund
Ontario - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to do business with the Canadian province of Ontario, one of the
biggest borrowers in the international bond market, here's some important
advice.
Don't insist on dealing only with John Madden, the assistant deputy minister
who is responsible for the province's borrowing strategy, because the rest
of his team is equally important.
Since his arrival at Ontario's finance ministry in late 1992, Mr Madden has
concentrated on building a team approach to raising the large sums needed to
fund the province's ballooning budget deficit - not an easy task when its
credit rating was on the skids.
An integral part of the strategy which they devised was a decision to
embrace the global bond concept which became fashionable a few years ago. By
so doing, the province was able to raise copious amounts through a small
number of transactions.
'We have developed large, liquid benchmarks with maturities of five, seven
and 10 years and these have served us well in the current climate,' Mr
Madden said during a visit to London last week.
Extensive pre-marketing of deals, listening to what investors want and
awarding mandates on a negotiated basis rather than through competitive
bidding have also worked in Ontario's favour.
This year, Canada's largest province is well ahead of its funding programme,
having raised CDollars 4bn of its borrowing requirement of CDollars 7.7bn.
It also expects to pre-borrow a further CDollars 2bn to CDollars 3bn for
next year. 'We like to stay ahead in our funding, it allows us to be
flexible,' Mr Madden said.
However, difficult conditions have prompted some changes to the way Ontario
taps the market. 'We are having to shorten the time needed to launch a deal
and we have to be careful to size and price appropriately,' he said.
This was evident in Ontario's recent offering of 10-year global bonds - the
size was restricted to Dollars 1bn and the yield spread of 67 basis points
over comparable Treasuries was wider than the spreads on Ontario's bonds in
the secondary market. But by the end of last week, the spread on the bonds
was unchanged, a rare occurrence in the current climate of sliding bond
prices.
Although the province will continue to rely on global bonds for around 60
per cent of its funding, like many other borrowers it is becoming more
dependent on private placements and structured deals.
It has raised around Dollars 800m under its Dollars 2bn medium-term note
programme, at 15 basis points below Libor for five-year maturities and Libor
minus 20 basis points in the one to three-year area.
Although Mr Madden has made it a priority to be open with the banks in order
to garner their support, he has avoided becoming a sitting duck by not
making them privy to risk-management decisions behind each deal. 'Everyone
knows our goal is to get back into fixed-rate Canadian dollars, but we come
home a different way each time,' he said.
Although Ontario still needs to raise a lot of money, its debt burden should
get lighter in the next few years. The budget deficit is forecast to drop to
CDollars 8.1bn in the 1995-96 fiscal year, from CDollars 8.5bn in 1994-95,
and to CDollars 7bn the following year. This should allow its credit rating
to bottom out at current levels.
Bankers, who find Mr Madden's homespun attitude of encouraging dialogue a
refreshing change to the cloak-and-dagger behaviour of other borrowers,
believe that his current job will not be his last. 'Although he is handling
one of the largest accounts in the world, he will be looking to move on,'
says one banker, adding that he would be an ideal candidate if the post of
chief financial officer at a large organisation became vacant.
At 38, Mr Madden has ample time to return to the private sector whence he
came (a chartered accountant by training, he came to government from
Beneficial Canada where he held a senior financial post).
He rules out a political career, though his convincing remarks about wanting
to serve the people of Ontario and making the world a better place for his
children would go down a treat during any election campaign. He even
tolerates the incessant flash of a photographer's camera.
But wherever he ends up, one thing is sure: his future colleagues will end
up believing that any successful deal is due to them, not him.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government bond market has been a victim of the recent sell-off
in global bond markets, prompted by fears of rising inflation due to
economic recovery, but a closer look at the economic data suggests declines
in Tokyo may be overdone.
The worst seems to be over for the Japanese economy. The tankan, the
quarterly survey of business confidence, released two weeks ago indicated
the first upturn in sentiment for five years, while first-quarter GDP grew
by an annualised 3.9 per cent, the best in three years.
However, while the economy has stopped deteriorating, statistics suggest
that a recovery and inflationary pressures will be weak.
Considering the theoretic equilibrium of long-term rates should be around
economic growth, the bond market seems to be overshooting at current levels,
says Mr Jim Vestal at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Evidence of slow growth may be provided by this week's industrial production
figures for May, which are expected to fall, while consumer prices for June
are likely to reveal low inflationary pressure.
Mr Vestal points out that while government bonds are not a long-term buy,
current levels are not justified by the underlying economic condition and
predicts the benchmark will fall below 4 per cent during the next two
months.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Romania shows commitment - The Emerging
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Romania is on course to become the latest of eastern Europe's former
communist states to open a stock exchange following parliament's acceptance
this month of a securities bill.
The bill, due to be promulgated within the next two weeks, paves the way for
the establishment of an equity market and securities commission this autumn.
The passage of the bill is being seen as a sign of greater commitment to
reform by the government which in the past three months has pushed through
parliament more reform legislation than it did in its first 16 months in
office.
Foreign investors have also been encouraged by signs of economic
stabilisation and growth and by the agreement with the International
Monetary Fund last month of Romania's first new loan agreement in two years.
Under the terms of the deal the IMF will support the minority left-wing
government's reform programme with loans worth Dollars 720m over 19 months.
The reform programme, drawn up last autumn with the World Bank and IMF, has
already had promising results.
The tough monetary policy adopted by the country's reformist central bank
since last November has brought inflation down to 6 per cent a month against
last year's average of 12 per cent. The leu, the national currency, has been
liberalised and made internally convertible. Exports are up 39 per cent over
the first five months of last year while industrial production has
stabilised after nearly halving between 1990 and 1993.
Foreign investors and the country's emerging private sector hope that the
government will now begin structural reform in earnest by speeding up
privatisation and restructuring of the state sector.
Emphasis is being placed on the stock exchange and the development of
capital markets.
Certificates of ownership (COs), representing the population's 30 per cent
free share in the equity of the 6,300 state companies due for privatisation,
have been distributed to some 15.5m Romanians. At first the new exchange is
due to trade COs while the government finalises mechanisms for their
transfer into shares.
As a precursor to a mass privatisation programme, the authorities, advised
by Hambros, the UK merchant bank, are preparing a series of public offers.
The aim is to sell about five medium-sized companies at a time for a
combination of cash and COs. So far, the only Romanians able to use their
COs to buy shares have been those participating in the privatisation of some
500 small companies via management and/or employee buy-outs.
The public offer programme will also provide foreign investors with a
relatively quick and simple way to buy into a state company. Foreign
companies will be able to purchase part of the 70 per cent offered for cash
or to come in via a capital increase.
Until now there has been little foreign participation in the privatisation
scheme. This is partly because the first companies to be sold were generally
too small to attract foreign interest. Uncertainty over commitment to
reform, excessive bureaucracy and difficulties in setting up the six funds
charged with implementing privatisation are other factors.
This has meant that most of the Dollars 900m in direct foreign investment
since 1990 has come through joint ventures rather than direct purchases.
The hope is that the Bucharest exchange will attract significant foreign
investment like those in other central European countries.
Wasserstein Perella, the US boutique bank, has taken the lead, becoming the
first western bank to set up a local merchant bank and investment fund.
Capital markets will also boost the country's cash-strapped but rapidly
expanding private sector. Larger private companies involved in production
are beginning to emerge from the thousands of small trading companies and
farming associations set up in the immediate post-communist period. There
are also many state firms, such as the Agriculture Bank, one of the
country's big four commercial banks, which have diluted state ownership
through capital increases.
The authorities believe that there are already enough private or partly
state-owned companies planning a listing this autumn to pass the minimum of
five companies needed to launch the stock exchange.

<TEXT>
Hungary is experiencing an unprecedented burst of new equity issues. Public
offerings in Egis, the pharmaceuticals producer, and Global, a retailer,
were oversubscribed last week. Subscriptions for shares in Pharmavit, a
thriving private-sector producer of vitamin pills, opened on Friday and are
expected to close today or tomorrow, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Holders of compensation coupons - securities issued to victims of communist
expropriation - can from today apply for shares in Chinoin, a leading
pharmaceuticals company. Queues of investors were already growing at the
weekend. Another issue scheduled for next week is that of Graboplast, a
manufacturer of artificial leather. Some 58 per cent of the company, worth
Dollars 14m, is on offer from June 30. In addition, AV RT, the state holding
company, gave the go-ahead for the sale of a minority stake in Richter
Gedeon which the authorities hope will raise Dollars 47m.
Although international interest in Hungary has cooled since the Budapest
bourse began to fall in February, demand for new issues still remains much
stronger than last year.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar bears looking for more action -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the light of the dollar's dismal performance after concerted central bank
intervention to support it last Friday, the foreign exchange markets will be
testing the US currency's downside again this week.
Cynical markets are expected to continue to ignore favourable economic
fundamentals such as steady growth and low inflation in the US in favour of
speculative activity.
A host of US statistics, including a May survey of consumer confidence and
the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, will be released
this week. But economists do not expect the data to affect the market as
dealers have been disregarding statistics for some time.
In Germany, important cost of living indices and figures for industrial
production and manufacturing output will be released this week.
Under normal circumstances, statistics conforming with market forecasts of a
stable inflation rate at about 3 per cent and a slowdown in the pace of
growth might be expected to diminish sentiment towards the D-Mark.
But most analysts believe traders are determined to drive the dollar down in
an attempt to draw out further central bank action.
The US government can expect little relief from the domestic monetary
policies of its G7 partners. The Bundesbank has shown it is unwilling to cut
its discount rate and the Bank of Japan, while vigorously intervening on
behalf of the dollar last week, is unlikely to cut its interest rates while
the government of Prime Minister Tsutomo Hata is in political difficulties.
Furthermore, the Fed itself is unlikely to raise rates before the July 5-6
FOMC meeting, as US officials have been indicating that underlying
inflationary pressures are under control.
Sterling may test its upside against the dollar this week as investors
relinquish their view that the UK economy is merely reflecting trends in the
US.
Last Friday's surprise headline figures on the UK current account deficit in
the first quarter and a stable inflation profile could sustain the pound's
strength against the dollar, pushing it up to the Dollars 1.56 level.
Meanwhile, the D-Mark, the Swiss franc and the Dutch guilder may continue to
benefit from jittery bond markets as they are perceived as safe haven
currencies for investors seeking risk reduction.
Developments on the European crosses could also be affected by investor
perceptions of the outcome of the EU summit in Corfu.

ECUADOR
The biggest single trade ever crossed on the Quito stock exchange was
executed last Wednesday when the Ecuadorean government sold its remaining
stake in the cement company, La Cemento Nacional, writes Stephen Fidler.
The stake - 20 per cent of the company - was bought by the London-based
merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, and placed with investment institutions in
the US, which took 70 per cent of the shares, and the UK.
The shares were sold by the government at the prevailing market price -
215,000 shares were sold at 404,000 Ecuadorean sucres (Dollars 187) each,
giving a value to the trade of about Dollars 40m.
The shares had fallen from a peak of 580,000 last November, in part because
of a dispute with the mayor of Guayaquil about tax payments. They rallied
sharply afterwards.
Bankers at Morgan Grenfell said they planned to create an unsponsored global
depositary receipt programme for the shares, which should be in place in
about two months.
Recent excitement in emerging markets largely by-passed Ecuador, which has
only moved ahead slowly with economic reform. That has meant that shares are
cheaper than in other Latin stock markets.
Morgan said La Cemento's prospective price-to-earnings multiple this year is
about 9, compared, for example, with 17 for Colombia's Cementos Diamante,
while the dividend yield is about 7.5 per cent.
Until Wednesday, La Cemento, which sold 1.4m tonnes of cement in 1993 to
generate Dollars 128m in revenues, had been a joint public/private company
since 1974. Holderbank, the Swiss cement giant, took a 50 per cent stake in
1976, which it retains. La Cemento also has an 8.1 per cent stake in the
Peruvian company, Cementos Norte Pacasmayo.
OMAN
The first fund to offer foreign access to a Gulf stock market will open for
trading on the London and Muscat stock markets on Thursday.
The Oryx fund, jointly managed by London-based Blakeney Management and the
Oman National Insur-ance Company, raised Dollars 52m in an issue completed
last week.
As obliged by Omani law, 51 per cent of the fund's capital was raised in
Oman, with the remainder coming from a 'comfortably oversubscribed'
international issue, with most interest coming from the US, the UK,
Switzerland and the east Asia.
MAURITIUS
Mauritius is to open its stock market to international investors following
an announcement last week in the country's budget.
Previously foreign investment in securities could be channelled only through
the UK-based Mauritius Fund, which was started 18 months ago. Thirty-four
securities are listed on the equity market, which saw a 290 per cent
increase in turnover in 1993 as the market index surged by 119 per cent.
Market capitalisation currently stands at Rs18.8bn (Dollars 1.1bn).
BURMA
More than 100 companies have invested over Dollars 1bn in Burma since the
ruling junta began liberalising the economy in late-1988, said Brig Gen
David Abel, minister for national planning and economic development.
He added that Singapore was the major foreign investor, having invested some
Dollars 500m.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Markets: A green-backed bear - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International markets face a serious test of confidence this week: the
dollar crisis shows no signs of abating and it has now pushed US long bond
yields, which set the pace for global markets, very close to the top of
their recent trading range. A significant downward break-out would send
fresh shock waves through fixed income and equity markets around the world.
The weekend resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Hata has hardly helped
market stability. The political turmoil in Tokyo is likely to intensify
pressure on the dollar this morning, with traders arguing that it will make
a US-Japanese trade agreement much harder to achieve.
This in turn increases the likelihood of further rounds of concerted central
bank intervention to stabilise the dollar, but there is little reason to
think this will prove any more successful than Friday's Canute-like failure
to stem the tide running against the US currency.
Whatever the cause of the dollar's weakness (inflation worries, the US trade
deficit, distrust of President Clinton), the central message of the market
is that the US does not offer nearly large enough a risk premium to
encourage foreign investors to hold American assets.
The markets suspect this will force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary
policy again, either at the next meeting of its policy-making committee, on
July 5 and 6, or even before then.
Irrespective of currency factors, the robust (though slowing) American
economic expansion probably justifies another quarter point rise in the Fed
Funds rate some time over the summer, but gradualism of that order will
hardly encourage investors to hold dollars, while a sharp rise in rates
would risk damaging the economic recovery.
Last week's sharp drop in bond and equity prices has already factored some
tightening into the US market, but that may not prevent further market
instability if the Fed does act.
The low rate of US inflation may give some underpinning to the bond market.
Although Wall Street has been focusing anxious attention on the recent sharp
increases in commodity price indices, the fact is that labour costs are a
far more important component of output and they appear to still be well
under control.
The equity market, however, looks more vulnerable. Since the Fed first
tightened in early February, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been
relatively robust, losing less than 10 per cent of its value at the worst
point and trading in a drifting, sideways range.
There has, however, been a slight downward bias to the movement and last
week's near 140-point drop brings the average near the bottom of its
post-tightening trading range. Until now, investors have bought on the dips
and private individuals have continued to be net investors in stock mutual
funds.
However, mutual fund cash inflows dropped last week to their lowest level
since early April, when the market suffered its only week of net redemptions
this year, and further dollar problems will only increase the private
investor's edginess.
If the Dow dips through 3,600, it could trigger a sharp drop in US equities
over the coming few weeks, with an inevitable ripple effect around the
world. The US market correction of the past five months has yet to produce
the kind of sharp downward lunge, the final submission to the bear, which
often marks a turning point. Unless the dollar bounces, one could be coming.
Mexico
Emerging markets will take their lead this week from Wall Street, but Mexico
could face additional volatility following Friday's resignation of interior
minister, Mr Jorge Carpizo McGregor, even though this was rejected by
President Salinas, who will try and twist Carpizo's arm this week.
Carpizo is the man responsible for Mexico's August 21 presidential election
and his departure, complaining that 'diverse sectors' are trying to block
his efforts for fair poll, are bound to throw fresh doubts on the validity
of the country's electoral processes.
Some analysts suspect his resignation may be linked to that of Mr Manuel
Camacho Solis, who last week stood down as the government's peace envoy to
Zapatist rebels after criticism from ruling PRI presidential candidate Mr
Ernesto Zedillo. The implication is that Camacho allies (who may include
Carpizo) will not support Zedillo's campaign.
The resignation increases the perception of political risk in Mexico. The
IPC index fell 55.66 after Friday's news and is down 16 per cent on the
year.
Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns says the country is suffering from a
'buyers' strike', with investors seeing little reason to buy.
He thinks the country remains a long-term buy but does not rule out further
short-term weakness.
General Motors
This week General Motors is expected to announce its first big shake-up in
senior management since the autumn of 1992, when the board ousted Mr Robert
Stempel and replaced him as chief executive with Mr Jack Smith.
Mr Smith will remain chief executive but hand over responsibility for GM's
North American vehicle operations to young turk Mr Rick Wagoner.
The handover is a measure of how far Mr Smith has turned round GM's North
American operations. In the first quarter they were more than Dollars 500m
in the black, thanks to, in part, an improving market, which has allowed all
US car manufacturers to cut sales discounts.
But the distance GM still has to go was underlined by a report last week
from consultancy Harbour &amp; Associates, which estimates it would have to cut
20,000 jobs to become as efficient as Ford.
GM shares trade on a 1994 p/e ratio of a mere 7.3 and many Wall Street
analysts rate it a buy, given its restructuring and the strong cyclical
upturn in North American vehicle sales.
But GM still has much to prove, the market will soon start focusing on the
next cyclical downturn (if it has not already done so), and a very jittery
equity market means this is not the time to be increasing exposure to US
consumer durable stocks.

FT  27 JUN 94 / The Markets: Diamond record possible - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First-half sales by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which controls
at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, are reported
on Wednesday and are widely expected to match or even exceed the record
USDollars 2.54bn achieved in the first six months of 1993.
That does not mean, however, that the diamond market is in sparkling
condition. De Beers is being pressed on two fronts: By its customers, who
cut and polish gem diamonds and by the Russians, who supply about 25 per
cent of the stones that are sold by the cartel.
The big customers are complaining that their profit margins have been
squeezed so hard during the past two years that they are now practically
non-existent.
The CSO is to meet a delegation to discuss these problems. The CSO
drastically reduced the number of diamonds it made available at its two most
recent 'sights' or sales, a move welcomed by the cutters and polishers.
Meanwhile, difficult negotiations in Moscow about a new contract between
Russia and the CSO will continue in Moscow next month. Some Russians are
pressing for big changes and it is unlikely that agreement will be reached
quickly.
Mr Mark Cockle, editor of CRU International's Diamantaire newsletter, says:
'The likely outcome of the talks - having to choose between terms that
threaten to push Russia out of the cartel or alternatively favour Russia to
the point of antagonising South Africa and Botswana mining interests - is
one De Beers' officials want to postpone as long as possible.'
On Wednesday the International Wheat Council's annual World Grain Conference
will be held in London. Speakers include Mr Eugene Moos, US undersecretary
of agriculture, Mr Zhou Mingchen, chairman of China's Ceroilfoods, and Mr
Warren Lavorel, deputy director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Economics Notebook: Shortage of capital?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In economics, as in other walks of life, new ideas are rare. So it is not
surprising that faced with the conundrum of sharply rising bond yields in
the world's capital markets, some analysts and commentators have revived the
notion of a global capital shortage. The last time the idea did the rounds
was after the Gulf War of 1991, when extravagant estimates of the costs of
rebuilding Kuwait were thrown together with back-of-the-envelope
calculations of the bill for modernising the former communist countries of
eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Talk of a global capital shortage was quickly forgotten as the recession of
the early 1990s stifled investment and the problems of turning former
communist countries into market-based economies became apparent. Last year's
speculative bond market boom also seemed to indicate that funds for
investment were not in short supply. But as economists and analysts seek to
explain the upwards spike in long-term interest rates over the past six
months, some are re-examining the idea that capital might be scarce.
One such economist is Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming Securities. He
believes the world experienced a bond market bubble in 1992-93 that obscured
a secular fall in private and public sector savings in the industrialised
countries. 'It is not that we have a capital shortage that has happened
suddenly', he says.
There is plenty of evidence suggesting strong demand for capital. Only last
week, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) reported that the total net resource flow from industrialised to
developing and former communist countries was a record Dollars 159.5bn last
year, up from Dollars 153.2bn in 1992 and higher than the 1991 level of
Dollars 124bn.
Global claims on capital seem set to grow further.
In the industrialised world, economic recovery is spreading from the
Anglo-Saxon countries to Germany, the rest of the European continent and
Japan. Industrial country governments are still running large budget
deficits.
In its recent World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund
complained: 'Most if not all industrial countries failed to consolidate
their fiscal positions adequately in the 1980s and entered the 1990s with
high actual and structural budget deficits, high public debt to GDP ratios
and considerable unfunded pension liabilities.'
The IMF has forecast that the industrial countries' budget deficits will
fall to 3.5 per cent of their gross domestic product next year against 4.2
per cent. Although an improvement, this would still leave the overall budget
shortfall well above the 3 per cent of GDP deemed prudent for European Union
countries by the authors of the Maastricht Treaty and substantially higher
than the recent low of 1.3 per cent of GDP in 1989.
The dynamic newly-industrialising economies of Asia continue to grow
robustly while other developing nations, including China, India, Vietnam,
Argentina and Chile, are expanding rapidly. When populous giants such as
China, India and Indonesia stir, the effects in terms of demand on financial
resources can be great indeed.
In his recent Hayek memorial lecture to the Institute of Economic Affairs in
London, Mr Peter Sutherland, the director general of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) pointed out that the world's population is set
to increase by nearly 2bn in the next 20 years. Of these, 95 per cent would
be born in countries other than the industrialised member states of the
OECD.
'One consequence is that between now and the year 2015, the number of new
jobs required to keep unemployment rates unchanged in the developing world
will exceed the current populations of western Europe and North America
combined', Mr Sutherland said. 'The economic implications are manifold,
including competition for capital.'
This increase in activity comes as savings rates are falling around the
globe.
By contrast, savings in the developing world, and in Asia in particular,
have been strong. According to the BIS in Basle, the developing nations
share of the world's Dollars 5,000bn pool of savings was 20 per cent in
1992, up from 12.5 per cent in the early 1970s, and higher than the US
share. But savings as a percentage of GDP have started to decline in the
developing as well as the industrial countries.
But how will our lives be affected if there really is a world capital
shortage?
One distinct possibility is that the low bond yields at the end of 1993 and
the start of 1994 will turn out to have been no more than a passing
phenomenon. Even though some of the near 3 percentage point increase in 10
year UK gilt yields from low to recent high and the roughly 2 percentage
point jump in comparable US rates may unwind, capital scarcity would be
certain to leave real interest rates higher than 6 months ago.
With globalisation, that means the required real rates of return on
investment would increase throughout the world. Given their higher costs,
the industrialised countries would find it even more difficult than today to
compete with the fast-growing developing nations of Asia in labour intensive
production of low-tech tradable goods.
In the industrialised world, the need for higher skills and more high
value-added occupations would grow ever more intense.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: GiroCredit aims to remain
independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GiroCredit, Austria's third largest bank, aims to remain an independent
force in spite of the purchase by Bank Austria, the country's largest, of a
controlling stake in it two months ago.
Mr Herbert Lugmayr, Giro's new chief executive, said the bank would
co-ordinate its activities with Bank Austria in a few areas where joint
efforts were sensible, but would pursue its own strategies in most.
It was planning a public flotation of shares within the next two years
provided earnings improved and dividends could be restored. It expected to
achieve an unchanged Sch2bn (Dollars 177m) operating profit this year, he
said.
Last February, following a two-year tussle between the two largest savings
banks groups, Bank Austria and First Austrian, over the future shape of
Giro, Bank Austria unilaterally bid for enough shares to take its 30 per
cent stake to a small majority.
Since April, when Bank Austria achieved its objective, analysts have been
wondering how this socialist bank would treat its traditionally conservative
acquisition.
Its quick decision to appoint Mr Lugmayr as chief executive provided few
answers. He is a socialist and spent most of his career in Zentralsparkasse,
one of Bank Austria's predecessors, before joining Giro's management board
in 1988.
However, Mr Lugmayr said in an interview that Giro would remain a basically
conservative bank. 'It will be independent from Bank Austria. They have not
tried to exert pressure.'
He said the two banks would co-operate mainly in foreign business and data
processing. Also, Giro's highly rated capital markets department would be
merged with Bank Austria Investment Bank.
Giro would then concentrate on its core business, supplying various
financial services to its savings bank owners throughout Austria.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Harris Trust takes loss on
mortgage-backed deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Harris Trust, the Chicago-based subsidiary of Bank of Montreal, said it
would absorb losses of Dollars 51.3m on behalf of customers whose money it
had invested in unsuitable securities created out of mortgage-backed bonds.
The bank's decision, which will lead to a Dollars 33m post-tax loss, echoes
moves by some other US banks and fund managers whose investment strategies
have proved fallible in the volatile markets of recent months.
BankAmerica recently injected Dollars 17m into a money market mutual fund it
runs to make up losses which otherwise would have been born by customers,
while PaineWebber paid Dollars 33m to cover mortgage-backed bond losses on
behalf of investors in one of its funds.
The latest losses stem from Dollars 2.3bn of collateralised mortgage
obligations (or CMOs) which Harris bought on behalf of 40 of its pension
fund customers. These instruments are created out of standard
mortgage-backed bonds and comprise a near-Dollars 800bn market in the US.
Harris said the pension funds were customers of its securities lending
division. The money used to buy the bonds was collateral which had been
deposited with the bank against securities it had lent out on behalf of the
funds.
This money should have been invested in safe, short-term instruments, the
bank said, adding that it had decided to absorb the losses to protect its
reputation. The money invested in the risky bonds represented more than a
third of the Dollars 6.7bn in its securities lending portfolio.
CMOs range in riskiness from highly geared instruments whose price can move
quickly as interest rates change to standard fixed-income securities.
Bank of Montreal said the CMOs in the Harris portfolio were capped
floating-rate notes - instruments which pay a higher interest rate as market
rates rise, but only to a certain ceiling.
The losses were caused by the sharp fall in loan repayments by mortgage
borrowers in the US, Bank of Montreal said. As repayments decline, the
duration of the bonds grows longer, hitting their value - a trend which has
caused widespread price falls in mortgage-backed bonds.
The Dollars 2.3bn of bonds have been taken over by Bank of Montreal, which
said it had sold Dollars 800m of the holdings in recent days. The remainder
will be held as an investment, the bank said. As a result, the bank will not
have to mark the bonds to market, something Harris would have had to do
under US accounting rules.

Foron, the successful east German refrigerator company has been rescued from
liquidation after the Treuhand privatisation agency secured investment
commitments from the London-based East German Investment Trust fund (EGIT).
Egit will hold 47 per cent of Foron, and will put up DM11m (Dollars 6.7m) in
capital. However, the Treuhand, anxious to save Foron, one of the region's
most innovative companies, has agreed to allow Egit to reduce its purchase
price of Haushaltsgerateservice, which holds the majority stake in Foron.

Uruguay has completed its first privatisation with the sale of 51 per cent
of Pluna, its national airline, to a consortium of Argentine and Uruguayan
companies.
Mr Juan Piaggio, Pluna's president, said the consortium paid Dollars 2m cash
and assumed the carrier's liabilities of Dollars 20m.
The consortium is led by the Buquebus ferry company, which runs passenger
services between Buenos Aires and ports in Uruguay.
The buyers selected Varig, the heavily loss-making private Brazilian
airline, to operate Pluna on a contract for 10 years. Mr Alberto Fajerman,
Varig's assistant planning director, said the airline will take over Pluna's
financial and commercial management as well as operating its aircraft.
Mr Fajerman said Varig 'will receive a fixed payment and a variable amount'
linked to Pluna's performance.

Boddington mine

<TEXT>
The West Australian Supreme Court has cleared the way for Poseidon Gold,
part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Posiedon group, to purchase a 40
per cent stake in the Boddington gold mine from Reynolds Metals.
The court dismissed a claim by Newcrest Mining, which has a 20 per cent
interest in the West Australian mine, that it had certain pre-emptive rights
over the sale of interests in the joint venture.
However, Newcrest is seeking a stay of proceedings 'pending consideration of
the grounds for any appeal'. That was duly attacked by PosGold, which is
therefore unable to complete the deal and said it was 'disappointed at the
prospect of further delay and expense'.
The Reynolds/PosGold deal - which involves payment of USDollars 116m plus
delivery of 30,000 ounces of gold over seven years - had originally been due
to close in March.
The ruling, if it is upheld, may facilitate Shell Australia's planned sale
of its metals interests, which include 37.5 per cent of the Boddington mine.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sanofi shifts centre of gravity
 -The drugs group has taken a big strategic step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, chairman of Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals
group, compares his company to a locomotive. After last week's deals, which
bring it the prescription drugs business of Eastman Kodak of the US and
involve the sale of its own bio-activities division, the locomotive has been
firmly shunted towards a new destination.
'It is a major strategic step,' declares Mr Dehecq, arguing that the centre
of gravity in the company would now shift squarely towards pharmaceuticals.
The group's cosmetics division, which include Yves Saint Laurent and Yves
Rocher, will remain a core business. But even here, cashflow will be used to
help finance the company's pharmaceuticals ambitions.
The bio-activities division, until last week the third pole of the company,
will be used to provide a much quicker source of finance. The businesses,
ranging from food additives to veterinary products, will be sold to pay the
bill for the Dollars 1.68bn acquisition of the prescription drugs business
of Sterling Winthrop from Kodak.
So what lies behind the strategic step? Mr Dehecq has long expressed a
desire to expand in the sector and push his group, a subsidiary of
Elf-Aquitaine, the recently-privatised oil company, into the ranks of the
world's largest pharmaceuticals groups. This week's deal propels Sanofi into
the top 20 international drugs companies, with annual sales of FFr3.2bn
(Dollars 570m) and a base in most of the world's biggest markets.
Such ambitions lay behind the strategic tie-up with Sterling Winthrop.
Formed in 1991, the alliance gave inexpensive access to markets in the US,
Latin America and Asia. But Kodak's announcement in May that it would sell
its healthcare activities to focus on core businesses signalled the end of
the alliance and gave Sanofi the opportunity to go it alone by buying parts
of its US partner.
Kodak's decision also gave Sanofi a strong bargaining position. 'Sanofi was
effectively a poison pill in Sterling Winthrop because of the alliance
agreements,' says Mr Peter Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel.
This helps explain what most analysts regard as a good price for the
acquisition. 'The amount they paid was at the lower end of what we were
expecting,' said one.
But the price will only prove reasonable if the logic of the deal can be
proved. 'We are making a bet on pharmaceuticals,' admits Mr Dehecq.
He believes the odds are tilted in his favour because the acquisition will
expand the company's direct presence in international markets, from the US
to south-east Asia, provide an outlet for products in the pipeline, and
because economies will be achieved through merging the businesses of Sanofi
and Sterling Winthrop.
'We will not be a Merck,' admits Mr Dehecq, 'but we will have a foot in the
door to market our new products.'
As for cost-savings, Mr Dehecq argues that the merging of the businesses
will provide economies not available to the joint venture with Sterling
Winthrop. Head office functions can be combined, as can marketing and
development budgets.
These synergies, he believes, combined with the profits of Sanofi's new
businesses will soon feed through to the bottom line. 'Earnings per share
should be 10 to 15 per cent higher in 1995 as a result of the acquisition',
he estimates.
Such forecasts should be welcomed at Elf-Aquitaine, Sanofi's parent, which
last Friday forecast a fall in operating profits of up to 20 per cent in the
first half of the year.
As with any important strategic decision, however, there are question marks.
In this case, many relate to the disposals necessary to finance the deal.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman of Elf-Aquitaine, has issued strict
instructions to subsidiaries to the effect that debt must not be increased.
Neither did Elf want to see its 52 per cent stake in Sanofi reduced through
a capital increase.
As a result, Mr Dehecq must sell assets. He says he is confident that buyers
will be found for the bio-activities division, and Sanofi has already been
contacted by almost a dozen potential suitors.
With a gearing ratio of 20 per cent, and net debts of between FFr2bn and
FFr3bn, a bridging loan can be easily arranged, he says.
An additional challenge is that Sanofi is far from alone in seeking to
expand in pharmaceuticals. The plethora of recent acquisitions and mergers
in the industry are evidence of stiff competition in the sector. Mr Dehecq
argues that prescription drugs are not exposed to the low price competition
of non-prescription over-the-counter drugs and that new products over the
next few years will allow the group to expand from its newly-gained
bridgehead. That, alone, will determine whether Sanofi can stay on track.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Insas to control Power in
IPounds 50m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia's Insas group will take control of Power Corporation, the Republic
of Ireland-based property development group, under the terms of a memorandum
of understanding agreed by the two companies.
Insas, an investment holding company quoted on the Kuala Lumpur stock
exchange since 1969, has conditionally agreed to subscribe IPounds 50m
(Pounds 49m) for new ordinary shares in Power as part of a complex capital
reconstruction involving a placing and open offer.
The investment is subject to a number of conditions including the completion
of discussions between Power and its bankers over the proposed capital
reconstruction and the rescheduling of a portion of Power's debts. The
proposed reconstruction also includes reducing the par value of Power's 116m
shares from 10p to 5p.
Following this, about 1bn of new ordinary shares with 200m detachable
warrants will be issued to Insas as part of a placing and open offer at a
price 'that would not differ materially from the current market price.'
Power's shares closed unchanged at 5 1/2 p on Friday.
Each warrant will entitle the holder to subscribe to one new Power share
until September 30, 2004.
Power plans to raise up to a further IPounds 50m through a simultaneous
placing and open offer of a similar number of shares and warrants, which
will be underwritten by Credit Lyonnais.
Insas recently disclosed that it held a 4 per cent stake in Liberty, the
upmarket fabric and fashion group, and confirmed that it was acting in
concert with Mr Brian Myerson's family vehicle - Concerto Capital
Corporation - which holds a 12.8 per cent in Liberty.
Under the terms of the memorandum Insas' 900,000 share stake in Liberty will
be sold to Power in exchange for new ordinary shares with warrants worth
about Pounds 4m.
Once completed, Insas, which plans to use part of a planned MDollars 600m
(Pounds 150m) rights issue to finance its investment in Power, will hold
just less than a 50 per cent stake in the Irish group and will gain control
of the board. Insas' managing director, Mr Thong Kok Khee, will become
Power's chief executive.
Power intends to use the remaining cash from Insas' subscription and the
placing and open offer, totalling about IPounds 70m, to acquire and develop
more shopping centres.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: BAT looks again at Dollars 1bn
deal - American Tobacco acquisition in jeopardy after FDA accusations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance group, yesterday warned that
its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) acquisition of American Tobacco could be
jeopardised by the increasingly aggressive attitude of the US Food and Drug
Administration.
The warning follows accusations last week by Mr David Kessler, FDA
commissioner, that a US subsidiary of BAT had secretly developed a form of
tobacco with high nicotine content through genetic engineering. Mr Kessler's
allegations were part of a campaign by the FDA to gain regulatory control of
the tobacco industry.
Mr Michael Prideaux, director of public affairs at BAT, said: 'If the FDA
takes control of tobacco regulation and introduces closet prohibition - by
stopping the sale of cigarettes containing nicotine or banning cigarettes
that generate smoke - that could have a material impact on the results of
American Tobacco.'
The contract between BAT and American Brands, the diversified US owner of
American Tobacco, contains a material adverse change clause, according to
BAT. This allows BAT to cancel the deal - though not change the price - if
the results of American Tobacco, the US's fifth largest tobacco group,
deteriorate significantly.
'We will be looking carefully at American Tobacco's next few quarters,' said
Mr Prideaux. The deal is scheduled to be concluded by April 1995. The
acquisition, currently being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission,
would increase BAT's sales by about 50 per cent, raising its share of the US
cigarette market from 11 per cent to 18 per cent. BAT is already the US's
third biggest cigarette manufacturer.
Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of BAT's subsidiary, Brown &amp; Williamson
Tobacco, last week accused Mr Kessler of leading 'a dangerous crusade' to
advance his 'personal and political agenda' of banning tobacco products.
'We don't expect Mr Kessler to succeed in his agenda - the tobacco industry
is already tightly regulated. But it's a worrying development,' said Mr
Prideaux.
Any attempt to pull out of the acquisition would probably lead to litigation
with American Brands, he admitted.
When the deal was announced BAT already knew the US tobacco market was in
trouble. Competition has become increasingly fierce since Philip Morris, the
market leader, cut the price of its Marlboro brand last year.

FT  27 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Martin Retail to join market with Pounds
100m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Retail Group is coming to the market in the autumn via an
institutional placing and open offer which is expected to value the
neighbourhood newsagent chain at about Pounds 100m.
Although the flotation will not raise any money for the group itself, MRG is
expected to use its quote and the debt-free balance sheet to expand on the
high street and in the convenience store sector. At least 60 per cent of the
shares are expected to be placed with institutions.
The flotation will mark the end of a difficult period for the group, which
has been owned by a consortium of banks for more than two years. 'We will
have a more normal share ownership structure which will allow us to take the
group forward,' said Mr Rob Leak, managing director.
After a brief period under the ownership of Guinness, MRG was sold in 1987
for what has since been acknowledged as an excessive price to an Australian
consortium which included News International and Panfida.
When Panfida collapsed in 1992, the banks took over Martins. Since then,
they have left the management, led by Mr Leak, to expand the product range -
into spheres such as off-licences and post offices - and roll out a computer
system which eliminates the need for regional managers.
MRG will come to the market with 766 branches, including the RS McColl chain
in Scotland, and has capacity in its warehouse to take on a further 600. The
group intends to expand through acquisition, but will focus on developing
its convenience store concept and high street presence.
MRG has ambitions to take on high street giants WH Smith and John Menzies.
By the first full year of flotation, it is expected to add 100 sites.
Since 1992, MRG has raised profits before tax and interest from Pounds 6.5m
to Pounds 11m. Last year it generated estimated net cash of Pounds 5m, after
Pounds 10m in capital expenditure.
Analysts estimate profits will rise by at least 10 per cent in the current
year. Most expect investors to be drawn to MRG's growth potential rather
than its dividend prospects.
MRG's sponsors are Kleinwort Benson, and advisers are Barclays de Zoete
Wedd.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: SCI bid for Great Southern
doomed to failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Service Corporation International's hostile bid for funeral operator Great
Southern Group is doomed to certain failure, because of restrictions in the
Memorandum and Articles of Association of the UK company's large
shareholder, writes Simon Davies.
The restrictions mean that the US funeral giant has been forced into a tight
timeframe, which could considerably weaken its negotiating position assuming
that it is prepared to increase its bid for Great Southern, as expected.
SCI launched its offer document last Tuesday, offering Great Southern
shareholders 600p a share, 26 per cent above the pre-bid closing price.
A separate offer was made to JD Field &amp; Sons, the private company controlled
by the Field family, which owns 56.1 per cent of Great Southern's shares.
SCI's success rested on gaining the support of five trusts which control
close to 70 per of JD Field, since the company's five directors immediately
rejected the bid as 'wholly unacceptable'. However, these trusts are legally
prohibited from accepting the bid within the set timeframe, even if they
could be swayed by SCI's cash.
Under JD Field's Articles of Association, there is an extraordinarily
complex procedure for any shareholders wishing to transfer shares.
A firm of accountants has to give an estimate of fair value for the shares,
which can take up to 21 days. The shares must then be offered to existing
shareholders at the agreed price, for a minimum of 14 days.
Finally, the directors have four months from the initial announcement of a
shareholder's intention to sell, in which they have the right to find an
alternative buyer for the shares.
Under the Takeover Code, the current offer for Great Southern can last a
maximum of 60 days, and if it lapses, SCI will not be able to bid for Great
Southern until after a year.
The restrictions on share transfer would take JD Field shareholders well
beyond that time limit.
JD Field's restrictions on share transfers can be removed, but this requires
75 per cent approval from shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting.
Unfortunately for SCI, the directors, who have unanimously rejected the
offer, own 27 per cent of JD Field's shares, making the current offer an
empty gesture.
Yesterday Schroders, which is advising SCI, confirmed that SCI's directors
had been aware of the contents of the Memorandum and Articles of Association
and, 'recognised that the only way the bid could succeed was with the
agreement of JD Field, the 56 per cent shareholder.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Enterprise and Lasmo prepare for
final phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil's Pounds 1.7bn hostile bid for fellow oil explorer Lasmo
enters its final phase this week as both sides prepare their last
presentations for institutional investors in the UK.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo chief
executive, spent much of last week making the rounds of US investors, who
control more than 20 per cent of Lasmo.
Enterprises's final all-paper offer closes at 1pm on Friday. Some
institutions are known to have made up their mind about the bid. However, it
is widely expected that big shareholders, the largest with more than 16 per
cent of Lasmo shares and 5 per cent of Enterprise, will wait until Friday
morning before declaring which side they will support.
Speculation continued at the weekend that Enterprise would begin buying
Lasmo shares this week if it is not confident that it can reach the 50 per
cent target through straight acceptances.
The company can buy up to 10 per cent of Lasmo shares in the market. It is
believed that any such buying would include both US and UK shareholders if
it materialised.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Italy puts 'prudent' price on Ina shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ina, Italy's state-owned insurer, go on sale this morning at
L2,400 each, in an international public offering which will raise more than
L4,800bn (Pounds 2bn), making it Italy's biggest privatisation so far.
It is the first sell-off under the new Italian government of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, and provides an opportunity to test policy for the larger
privatisations of Stet, the telecommunications holding company, Enel, the
electricity generator, and Eni, the energy and chemicals group, likely to
take place over the next year.
The Ina price is just below the middle of the L2,200-L2,700 range set when
the privatisation was launched a month ago.
Ministers pressed for a higher price, but officials insisted that after a
week of turbulence on Italian and world stock markets it would be more
prudent to price the issue at the lower end of the range, in line with
analysts' expectations.
The Treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, has imposed new rules for the
sale, aimed at giving the smallest shareholders a voice on the board and
limiting the ability of a few large investors to exercise effective control
over the newly privatised company. It is selling 51 per cent of the
insurance company, which claims a bigger share of the Italian life and
non-life insurance market than any of its private-sector rivals.
The Ina offer can run until the end of the week, but it could close as early
as tomorrow night if demand is strong. Previous public offers of shares in
state-owned financial institutions - IMI, Credito Italiano, and Banca
Commerciale Italiana - have been oversubscribed and closed early. Trading in
Ina shares will begin officially on July 6.
Last Monday Italian equity prices fell nearly 4 per cent, forcing
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, to postpone its L1,500bn rights issue.
The stock market recovered later in the week but investors are still nervous
about the government's economic policy.
However, officials say initial retail demand for shares in the company -
particularly from existing policyholders, who will receive priority
treatment - is strong. The international tranche of the shares is said to be
three times covered by demand from institutions.
Shares in other Italian insurers such as Generali and Ras slipped last week
as investors adjusted portfolios to prepare for the Ina sale. Goldman Sachs
and IMI of Italy are acting as global co-ordinators.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Brewers fight for China's potential: A growing beer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's tie-up between Foster's of Australia and Wheelock of Hong Kong
to seek joint brewing ventures in China marks a new stage in the struggle
for the country's beer market.
US, European, Asian and Australasian groups are striving to develop brewing
and distribution networks for their flagship brands such as Becks, Kirin,
Foster's and Budweiser as China emerges as the potentially biggest
international beer market.
Mr Nick Norgard, managing director of Foster's China, was euphoric after
signing the agreement with Wheelock, the Hong Kong merchant house.
'The China market is growing at an enormous rate on an enormous base,' said
Foster's. 'In 1993, it grew by 23m hectolitres which is 140 per cent of
Australia's entire brewing capacity of 17m hectolitres.'
This explosion explains why international brewers are drooling over China.
Anheuser-Busch, the world's biggest brewer, announced earlier this month
that it was planning to take over the Zhongde brewery in Wuhan (a joint
venture involving Steinbrau) as a step towards building a national presence
with its Budweiser brand. Foster's, too, is eyeing opportunities in Wuhan as
part of its strategy to establish nationally-accepted brands.
In a highly fragmented market - China boasts some 800, mostly tiny,
breweries - there are no identifiable national brands with the possible
exception of Tsingtao which has just 2.5 per cent of the market. National
distribution is hampered by a clogged and crumbling transport system.
Ms Helena Coles, an investment analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Hong Kong,
said: 'Distribution and marketing is going to sort the men from the boys.
Excess demand is not going to last forever.'
But at this early stage China's thirst would seem unquenchable. Average per
capita consumption is around 8 litres per annum compared with 158 in
Germany, 92 in the US, and 50 in Taiwan.
According to a Kleinwort Benson survey of Asian beverages, the China beer
market will double by early next century to become the biggest in the world.
Growth is running at 20 per cent, but long-term average growth rates of 10
per cent are 'achievable'.
Since 1984 China has moved from seventh place to second behind the US as a
beer producer with output in 1993 of 12.25m tonnes. The number of breweries
in that time has doubled. But this proliferation of brewers is coming to an
end, and evidence of a shake-out is already surfacing, with takeovers of
near-bankrupt smaller brewers in increasingly competitive local markets.
Mr Norgard said Foster's strategy was to proceed as quickly as possible in
establishing a national brewing network. Foster's last year formed joint
ventures with brewers in Shanghai and in Guangdong province.
Its aim, in alliance with Wheelock, which has experience in Chinese property
and infrastructure, is to develop five regional hubs for production,
marketing and distribution based on Guangzhou in the south; Shanghai and
Wuhan on the Yangtze; Chengdu/Chongqing in Sichuan province in China's
south-west; and Beijing/Tianjin in the north.
Foster's and Wheelock are looking at establishing 'greenfield' breweries in
Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu. Mr Norgard said it would 'depend on
circumstances' whether these were joint ventures with local producers.
International brewers are pursuing widely differing strategies. According to
China's Ministry of Light Industry, some 30 separate partnerships have been
established with foreign entities.
There is also Anheuser-Busch's 5 per cent stake in Tsingtao, purchased last
year when the Chinese brewer floated on the Hong Kong market.
Others seeking to position themselves in the market either through joint
ventures or licensing are Asia Pacific Breweries, a venture between Fraser
and Neave of Singapore and Heineken, the Dutch brewer; San Miguel of the
Philippines; Becks of Germany; Kirin of Japan; Carlsberg of Denmark; Pabst
Brewing of the US; and Lion Nathan of New Zealand. Notable by their absence
at this stage are the larger UK brewers.
Hong Kong-listed companies, including China Strategic and China Resources,
are also investors in China ventures. Mainland-backed China Resources has a
majority stake in a Shenyang brewery in the north-east, and China Strategic
has ventures with brewers in Bejing and Hangzhou.
With all this activity it would be hard to disagree with Kleinwort Benson's
assessment that the beer industry in China is 'at a crossroads'. The
penetration of foreign beers and premium local brands is certain to gather
pace as Chinese consumers become more discerning and affluent.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Hope of acceleration to break-even
point - Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector
industrial group, should tell shareholders on Thursday that the group
expects to break even this year at net profit level.
In May, Fiat revealed the biggest loss in its 95-year history - L1,783bn
(Pounds 731.9m) compared with a net profit of L551bn (Pounds 226.2m) in 1992
 -and decided not to pay a dividend on ordinary shares for the first time
since 1947. But 1993 now appears to have been the low point.
This year, the group should benefit from gradual improvement in its main
sectors - cars, trucks, and building and farm equipment - and especially
from the success of the Punto range of small cars. The Punto leads a wave of
new models to be launched in the next three years under the group's Fiat,
Lancia and Alfa Romeo brands.
Restructuring and cost-cutting across the group should also help
profitability, and the innovative 'integrated' car factory in southern Italy
spearheads a shift in Fiat's manufacturing culture, according to the group.
On Thursday, shareholders should approve a potential increase in Fiat's
maximum nominal share capital, to L10,000bn from L5,000bn, because last
year's rights issue - which raised L5,000bn - took the company up to the
limit of its issued share capital. But the group should not have to draw on
the facility in the near future.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Black moves to limit fears on price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph group, said yesterday he hoped
the drop in profits resulting from the cut in the cover price of The Daily
Telegraph to 30p would be limited to no more than Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m in
a full year.
The company has conceded that the cut from 48p to 30p in the price of the
weekday Daily Telegraph to attack the cut-price Times, now at 20p, will cost
Pounds 40m gross in a full year - an admission that led last week to a sharp
fall in The Telegraph share price. Mr Black said yesterday he believed as
much as Pounds 25m of that could be regained from extra revenue, reduction
in tax and cost-cutting at The Daily Telegraph, which saw its circulation
fall below 1m in April for the first time in more than 40 years.
The company, he said, is also likely to benefit from normal growth in the
company's subsidiaries in Canada and Australia. 'It's not progress but we
can live with that,' he said.
Sales of The Daily Telegraph have already started to rise since last week's
price cut, according to Mr Black. 'The Telegraph was up 90,000 on Friday,'
he said.
Mr Black believes that the very steep fall in his share price from the 587p
at which Hollinger sold 12.5m Telegraph shares on May 19 to institutions to
Friday's closing price of 332p was a 'ludicrous overaction' by the City. He
said if the share price did not rise when there was evidence of increasing
sales and reduced costs he would be happy to buy the shares back himself.
Mr Black yesterday thought two of the three main accusations against him had
fallen away. One was the 'legal-ethical question' over the May share sale.
The Stock Exchange ruled on Friday that there was no connection between the
sale of the shares and the announcement of the price cut.
The second accusation Mr Black believes he faces is that he is a co-predator
with Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The News Corporation.
A front page editorial in The Independent on Saturday, signed by Mr Andreas
Whittam Smith, the paper's editor, said: 'Two right-wing ideologues, Rupert
Murdoch and Conrad Black, have set about destroying the quality newspaper
market.' Mr Black said that for taking action to counter the Murdoch
price-cutting campaign 'Andreas Whittam Smith should embrace me as a
brother'.
It is too early to know if the third accusation - that Mr Black has simply
got it wrong and thrown away millions of pounds - is correct. 'If I have got
it wrong I will acknowledge the error publicly. If a policy is mistaken then
we must find another,' he conceded.
None of the other national newspaper groups is expected to join the price
war, although The Independent is likely to drop to 45p before long to
correct what is now seen as a mistaken policy last year to increase the
price to 50p.

FT  27 JUN 94 / KPMG discusses option to incorporate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KPMG Peat Marwick, one of the UK's largest accountancy firms is considering
abandoning its traditional partnership status in favour of incorporation.
A meeting later this week of senior partners will decide whether to proceed
with plans that could lead to it becoming a company as soon as this autumn.
The move would be the first by a firm of any size to incorporate, although
it has been theoretically possible by law and under professional ethical
rules for the past two years.
Sources within the firm suggest that the action has been driven primarily as
a method of protection against the rising costs of litigation in respect of
audit and other clients.
Incorporation would be unlikely to lead to the introduction of outside
investment or a stock market flotation. It would almost certainly force
public disclosure of the firm's financial performance.
Accountancy firms are secretive about their results, revealing only their
billings. KPMG showed reported revenue of Pounds 498m last year.
The firm's decision to consider new options follows radical plans for
reorganisation being considered by the larger firms in the US, where the
scale of the liability crisis is more serious.
A number of other large UK accountancy and other professional firms have
discussed incorporation, but none is believed to have gone as far.
The 25 'general partners' who control KPMG will meet on Friday and are
expected to consider options for the future structure of the firm.
Partnerships have unlimited liability when sued - they can be forced to
surrender not just the firm's assets such as buildings, but also the
personal assets of all the partners.
Most senior staff in an equivalent limited liability company would be
protected from such claims on their personal assets, except for those who
were most directly involved in any negligent advice for which they were
being sued.
Mr Colin Sharman, head of the firm, would not comment publicly but said: 'I
believe incorporation for both accounting and other major firms will be
unavoidable.'

Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the tour group, is due to report first-half results today, with
pre-tax losses expected to be about Pounds 18m after a profit of Pounds 3.5m
from disposal of fixed assets. This compares with a loss of Pounds 6.9m last
time before the expenses of Airtours' failed bid for its rival Owners
Abroad. The loss will occasion no surprise as travel companies usually make
seasonal first-half losses. Nor will the size of the loss be unexpected:
Airtours said it would not exceed Pounds 18m when it launched a rights issue
in April. The increased loss will largely reflect the winter losses of
acquisitions. More significant will be what the group has to say about
summer bookings and the prospect of a price war.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Hiding their light under a bushel
ahead of review - RECs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven of the 12 regional electricity companies will be trying to show how
different they are from each other
when they report their results this week. Most will have only limited
success.
Their problem is that they will not want to increase their profits by a
percentage that is much larger than the rest of the pack. To do so would
attract unwelcome attention from consumers and the regulator just ahead of
the most important review of prices they are likely to face.
Later this summer Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, will
announce the results of the review which will determine how much the 12
companies, together with Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric, can charge
customers for distributing their electricity for the five years from next
April.
The companies that have reported so far have announced fairly modest
increases, mostly in the 15 to 20 per cent range; some have been helped in
keeping the total down by making some pretty hefty provisions for
restructuring. This week's seven are expected to follow suit. Dividend rises
are likely to be around the 15 per cent mark.
Norweb and Seeboard report today. Norweb is expected to announce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 175m, against Pounds 157m, and a dividend of about
22.5p, up from 20p, whereas Seeboard is predicted to announce Pounds 125m
(Pounds 113m) pre-tax and an 11.6p (10p) dividend. Tomorrow Midlands is
forecast at about Pounds 200m (Pounds 167m) and 23p (20p) respectively. On
Wednesday Northern should announce about Pounds 125m (Pounds 111m) and 24.6p
(21.4p) and Eastern about Pounds 220m (Pounds 183m) and 22p (19.2p). Sweb on
Thursday should achieve Pounds 115m (Pounds 101m) and 23.3p (20p). Yorkshire
will bring the show to a close on Friday with about Pounds 175m (Pounds
156m) and 23.5p (20.4p).

FT  27 JUN 94 / M&amp;S and ABB win most respect in Europe: Executives name
rival companies they admire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, the British high street retailer, and Asea Brown Boveri,
the Swedish-Swiss multinational industrial group, are the most respected
companies in Europe, according to a peer-group poll published today.
M&amp;S and ABB emerged as the clear winners when top executives were asked to
identify European companies they most respected, in a survey undertaken by
the Financial Times in association with Price Waterhouse, the accountants.
The study, the first of its kind, is based on responses to a questionnaire
sent to almost 2,000 chairmen, chief executives and finance officers from
637 European companies, including the largest quoted, state-owned and
private companies in 17 nations.
The results provide a fascinating insight into senior management attitudes
and the qualities they judge to be important to business success in the
1990s.
Almost all the top 25 companies were identified as committed to their
shareholders, customers and employees. The most frequently cited attributes
across all industry sectors were consistent growth and long-term
profitability, clear policy and objectives and high customer loyalty.
Conversely, for most respondents, a commitment to equal opportunities,
progressive policies regarding childcare and a strong stance on social
issues hardly rated a mention. Perhaps more surprisingly, research and
development and design were also low scorers in most sectors.
Some interesting differences also appeared at national level. Customer
loyalty was rated the most important quality for a successful company in the
UK and was equal second in Sweden, but came lower down for respondents in
other big European countries.
Growth and profitability were cited as most important by German and French
respondents and ranked second in the UK and Italy, but came eleventh in
Spain where market leadership in terms of products or services and
displaying a positive management style were rated equal first.
In the Netherlands, the most important attribute was judged to be having a
satisfied staff which was also high on the list in France, Germany, Sweden
and Belgium. It was not seen as being particularly important in either the
UK or Italy.
In Germany, training and development were rated as the third most important
qualities, but were only tenth for UK respondents. Providing employees with
the means and facilities to deliver high quality services and products was
the top attribute in Italy and was fourth in the UK, but was viewed as being
less important in France and Germany. Italian executives also rated making
good use of technology in providing customer services as being fairly
important.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Kohl's CDU edges ahead in German state poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party and the
opposition Social Democratic party were last night running neck and neck in
the first east German state election since 1990.
The SPD's attempt to become the largest party in Saxony-Anhalt was hindered
by strong gains made by its leftwing rival, the Party of Democratic
Socialism, which is the successor to the former East German Communist party.
According to unofficial results, the PDS share of the vote rose from 12 per
cent in 1990 to 19.7, making it the third largest party.
The CDU was edging into the lead with 34.7 per cent, down five percentage
points from 1990, and the SPD, led by Mr Rudolf Scharping, had polled 34.1
per cent, an increase of 5 percentage points. The outcome raises the strong
possibility that the CDU and SPD will be forced into a grand coalition in
the state. Two other German states have such coalitions - Berlin and
Baden-Wurttemburg in the west.
The election is seen as a pointer to the remaining state elections and to
the federal election on October 16, particularly because the left-wing vote
was split. If the left vote is split on the federal level, the CDU and SPD
could be forced to form a grand coalition in Bonn.
Mr Gregor Gysi, the driving force behind the PDS, said: 'What is important
is that we have not been pushed off the agenda.'
The CDU had steadily moved up in the state opinion polls over the past few
weeks and had been hoping to form a coalition government with the Free
Democrats, which had gained 13.5 per cent in 1990. But the FDP was trailing
with 3.5 per cent, too low to enter the state parliament.
The question for Mr Kohl's CDU, which still governs three of the other
eastern states, is whether the FDP, its junior coalition partner, can
recover from yesterday's debacle to retain its national representation in
October.
'There is only one negotiating partner, and that is the Social Democrats,'
said Mr Christoph Bergner, the CDU incumbent prime minister of
Saxony-Anhalt.
The SPD remains reluctant to form a coalition with the PDS, and is not in a
position to rule with the Bundis 90/Greens, the environmental party. The
Greens' provisional share of the vote dropped to 5.0 per cent from 5.3 per
cent in 1990, not enough to form an SPD/Green coalition.
The SPD's Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the opposition leader in parliament, said:
'If we opt for a grand coalition, the talks will be very difficult. But we
did very well unlike the CDU which lost much support.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Bell Cablemedia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bell Cablemedia looks a little foolhardy to be pressing ahead with its
Dollars 1.2bn flotation given the state of financial markets. Three other UK
cable companies - TeleWest, Comcast and General Cable - pulled their
flotations last month. But Bell has its own special reasons for seeking a
listing. The company, which involves pooling the UK cable interests of Bell
Canada, Cable &amp; Wireless and Jones Intercable, does not yet exist. Its
creation is contingent on a public flotation.
One might therefore be forgiven for expecting the shares to be sold cheap.
But, if anything, the price sought looks a touch on the high side. Even at
the bottom of the pricing range, Bell's franchises are valued at roughly
Dollars 300 per home. Comcast, which came closer to flotation than TeleWest
or General Cable, had to pull its offer when investors baulked at a
valuation not much higher than that.
Price per home is, of course, only a crude yardstick and there are
differences between Bell and Comcast. Bell, for example, controls a greater
proportion of its franchises than Comcast - a factor investors rightly
appreciate. Unfortunately, other factors point in Comcast's favour. In
particular, the company has invested proportionately more in its franchises
than Bell. So it is not obvious that Bell deserves a premium rating. Given
that, the flotation's success cannot be guaranteed at the current pricing
range. If it flops, the chances of reviving the other three flotations will
grow even slimmer.

FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two months after its first all-race elections, South Africa is reaping the
reward in terms of access to international capital. Liberty Life, the
country's largest insurance company, is leading the way with a Dollars 500m
convertible bond offering. Smaller debt and equity issues are sure to
follow. Last week's budget included a government overseas borrowing target
of R1.8bn (Pounds 320m).
Yet buying rand-denominated assets remains difficult. Despite being the
world's 10th largest equity market, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is
notoriously illiquid thanks to a complex web of cross-holdings. Until South
African companies and institutions are free to invest overseas, equities
will remain gridlocked. The financial rand - a closed pool of currency
through which all inward investment must be channelled - is another hurdle.
True, foreign investors enjoy exceptionally high bond yields because the
financial rand trades at a discount to the domestic currency. But the closed
pool restricts liquidity, making it difficult to buy and sell.
These factors are likely to limit the flow of foreign investment in South
Africa, however promising the economic fundamentals may seem. While the
discount on the financial rand remains high, the government may be too
worried about capital flight to abolish exchange controls. The danger is
that the discount will not close because international investors dislike
dealing in the volatile financial rand. Unless the government takes the
initiative, South Africa could find itself locked into a damaging stand-off.

FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Ina
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian treasury must be relieved to price Ina shares in the middle of
the indicated range. Turbulent financial markets are uncomfortable for
insurance companies, which are priced relative to net assets. In addition to
the malaise afflicting international markets, Italian investors appear to be
losing patience with the new government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. At a 13 per
cent discount to stated net assets, Ina looks reasonable value against other
European insurers. But it would be rash to expect a windfall profit, at
least until financial markets recover some poise.
The long term case for investing in Ina rests on the argument that Italy is
underinsured by the standards of most industrialised countries. Despite the
recent setback in the courts, reform of the generous state pensions system
should open the way for private sector providers of savings. Liberalisation
of the motor insurance market from July 1 - premiums have been set by
government until now - should also bring opportunities.
The question is whether Ina can capture its fair share of expanding markets
without losing sight of the risks. Its market share in life insurance has
fallen sharply in recent years, although a new bancassurance alliance with
Banco di Roma should stop the rot. On the non-life side, Ina must resist the
temptation of an unprofitable battle for supremacy with Generali. If the
group can make the most of its powerful franchise, though, the offer price
leaves room for the shares to outperform.

FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Enterprise's paper tiger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Decision time is approaching for Lasmo shareholders. By Friday they must
either back the oil explorer's continued independence or accept Enterprise's
Pounds 1.6bn all-paper bid. Though the two-month battle has seen a welter of
accusations, several issues stand out.
Most important, Enterprise has failed to demonstrate any added value from
putting the companies together. Comments by Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and
chief executive, that it was necessary to be one of the 'big boys' smack of
empire building. And although it would have been easy to criticise Lasmo's
management or financial strength last year, such arguments carry less weight
following management changes and the recent rights issue.
It might still be argued that Lasmo shareholders are being offered such a
generous deal that they should accept Enterprise's paper regardless of any
industrial logic. The snag is that the offer, which would give Lasmo
shareholders 44.5 per cent of the combined entity, looks fair but not
generous. As the bid has progressed, perceptions of the relative values of
the two companies have shifted in Lasmo's favour. Investors have become
aware of how Enterprise's reported profits have been inflated by writing
down sharply the value of assets it acquired during the 1980s.
A further problem is that, if the merger went ahead, the market could be
flooded by reams of Enterprise paper that nobody particularly wants. So
Lasmo shareholders who accept the bid with the aim of selling Enterprise
shares in the aftermarket could receive a poor deal. Given the lack of
industrial logic or sufficiently attractive terms, investors should reject
the offer.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Europe's Greek farce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's weekend summit on Corfu was a fiasco from which none of
the main protagonists emerges with much credit. Not only did the leaders
fail in their main task of deciding on a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as
European Commission president; they ended up in a slanging match of a
vehemence and pettiness to match the worst Euro-rows of the mid-1980s.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand must
bear some of the blame, for attempting to bulldoze through their own
candidate for the Commission post without proper prior consultation. Those
countries which had misgivings about the way France and Germany handled the
process should, in fairness to Mr John Major, now make their position clear
and insist on a more genuinely consultative approach.
Even so, Mr Major emerges as a sorry figure. By vetoing a candidate agreed
by all other 11 member states, he has once again cast himself as the spoiler
of European politics. Given that he has vowed not to back down and that the
Union cannot depart from its unanimity rule for this appointment, he will
almost certainly succeed in blocking Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime
minister. But the price, in terms of a further reduction in Britain's
influence and credibility in the EU, will be high.
The real mystery is why Mr Major chose to behave this way. In the weeks
before Corfu, it seemed that Britain would accept Mr Dehaene as a last
resort. Mr Major's main purported objection to Mr Dehaene - a claim that he
'represents a tradition of big government and intervention' - seems
implausible. The Belgian was put forward, not because he has strong
ideological views, but for his reputation as a deal-maker.
Mr Major's other argument - that he wanted to demonstrate disapproval,
widely shared by other member states, for the way in which the decision was
being handled - strikes a slightly more resonant chord. But exercising a
veto when all others have reached a consensus can scarcely be the most
effective way to influence the subsequent process.
Unfortunately, one is forced to conclude that the veto was no more than an
improvised and futile gesture to Tory Eurosceptics - futile since no
Commission candidate who would command a consensus on the continent is
likely to attract their support, and the party's civil war over Europe can
now only deepen.
It falls to Mr Kohl, who takes over the EU presidency this Friday, to pick
up the pieces. He has called an emergency summit on July 15, and it seems
likely that one or more compromise candidates will be considered. That would
be desirable, if only because as Mr Dehaene himself recognises, to press on
would be to risk turning a petty personal squabble into a crisis. Then, once
the process is concluded, EU leaders need to show that they have learned the
lessons of Corfu by resolving never again to select a Commission president
in such a way.

The BBC's exhausting, sorry exhaustive, coverage of the football world cup
has been interspersed with what the corporation calls 'mood music' which is,
it points out, 'entirely unrelated' to the different national teams.
That is a relief.
For the tune that pipes up when Cameroonian players appear sounds very like
'The Lion', by Senegalese singer Yousso N'Dour, described in the record's
sleeve notes as 'a sprightly, rallying tribute to Senegal's national heroes,

One more tale to add to the Queens Moat Houses' collection.
When the bankers to the heavily-indebted hotel group were scrabbling around
last year wondering what to do as deadlines approached, they decided in
desperation to call in an accountancy firm specialising in corporate
breakdowns.
Imagine the bankers' horror on finding that most of the experts had departed
for the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency annual junket - in Melbourne.
Fortunately, Alan Griffiths, head of 'corporate recovery' accountants Grant
Thornton, was still manning his phone. He got the job while his competitors
got sunburn.
Barclays, the lead bank, stresses that Griffiths always had been its first
choice. 'We had our fingers crossed that he would be there.' Of course.

Almost six months after taking over as director-general of the UN's largest
specialised agency, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation,
Jacques Diouf has just met the press.
He announced a shake-up for the FAO, with plans to winkle out 200 of the
FAO's 1,500 Rome-based experts from their dolce vita, shifting them to the
capitals - and, horror of horrors, perhaps even the fields - of Africa and
Asia.
Could Diouf be implying some criticism of his long-standing predecessor,
Edouard Saouma? asked one diffident hack.
Hardly: 'I am not here to make judgments,' replied Diouf. Not even about the
sense of keeping the remaining 1,300 experts beavering away in Rome?

And now, the end of the road for the car that made a Lada feel luxurious -
the Zaporozhets, the box that mobilised Soviet citizenry.
The last rolls through the factory gates on Thursday, 34 years after Nikita
Khrushchev, who called it the 'tin can,' first gave the go-ahead for its
mass production in the Ukraine.
Viktor Suzalenko, chief of research at the plant is more polite, describing
it as a 'no-frills car,' adding that 'style or how much fuel it drank was
not an issue when it was designed. The key question was whether it could
cope with the rotten roads in the Soviet Union.'
Foreign competition and inflation have been its undoing. In 1960 the basic
model cost 20 times average monthly pay, but today it is 87 times the
typical Ukrainian monthly salary, equivalent to Dollars 870.
At that price, surely there's a thriving export market somewhere?

British inventors, arise - you have nothing to lose but your overdrafts.
Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB - manufacturer of the ubiquitous yellow
earth-digger - is considering offering venture capital to assist British
inventors and entrepreneurs who need backing for practical, innovative
projects in design and engineering.
Sir Anthony, a champion of all things British, will also plough in the
considerable back-up skills of his company in marketing and distribution. He
says there is a nucleus of knowledge and skill - and a modest pot of gold -
at JCB.
All of which might just set a young British inventor on the road to success
 -so emulating 'Mr JCB,' his father Joe Bamford.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Observer: Taxing times in Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When last year Switzerland finally introduced a value added tax, the Swiss
government naturally took it for granted that tiny Liechtenstein would join
in.
After all, the postage-stamp principality has contentedly co-existed in a
customs and currency union with Switzerland since 1923. It also allows the
Swiss finance ministry to collect the existing turnover tax on goods on its
behalf.
But the mouse has squeaked 'enough'. As a fully-fledged member of the United
Nations and the European Economic Area - Switzerland is neither  -
Liechtenstein feels it is time it collected its own taxes. Is this a canny
means of slipping in some VAT loopholes, tempting business away from Zurich?
Not at all. 'We have said our VAT will be the same so there will be no
competitive advantage. We think we are a sufficiently trustworthy partner
for Switzerland,' opines a Liechtenstein diplomat.
In other words: do not even think of putting your armoured bicycles on our
lawn.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Tokyo adjusts to tempestuous times: William Dawkins says the
downfall of Tsutomu Hata has far-reaching implications for Japan and its
partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's partners could be forgiven for feeling some alarm that the world's
second largest economy has just dumped its fifth prime minister in five
years.
The forced resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata, one of Japan's more competent
leaders, after just 59 days in office, has wider international repercussions
than the departure of his predecessor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
The downfall of Mr Hata, a victim of Japan's latest series of political
brawls, makes it possible that Japan will, for the second year running, send
a lame duck head of government to next month's Group of Seven summit in
Naples. It is a symbol of the new instability of what used to be one of the
world's most stable political systems.
Unless Japan's politicians achieve a miracle and pull together a strong
coalition in the next few days, whoever represents Japan at the G7 will lack
the authority to deliver a contribution to solving one of the world's
biggest economic difficulties, the recent plunge of the dollar to record
levels against the yen.
Whoever holds the precarious top job in Tokyo - a caretaker Mr Hata or his
successor - will have little chance of obtaining a pre-summit resolution of
the dispute with the US over how to curb the huge Japanese trade surplus.
This increases the risk of another surge of the yen on the foreign exchanges
this morning, which would be an unwelcome blow to Japan's fragile recovery
and, as a consequence, threaten the economic health of its trade partners.
Already, Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister in the outgoing government, has
had to cancel a weekend meeting with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, because of the axe hanging over his short ministerial
career. Japanese trade negotiators report that it was becoming hard to make
progress in talks with the US last week, because of political indecision in
Tokyo.
It is cold comfort to Japan's partners that the downfall of Mr Hata's
government, the shortest-lived since 1945, was widely expected. The
weekend's events were the latest stage in a chain reaction started by a
corruption scandal which precipitated last summer's downfall of the Liberal
Democratic Party, after 38 years in power.
Yet wider forces are also at work, suggesting that Japan's partners should
adjust to the fact that it may be only at the start of several years of
wobbly coalition governments. The formerly stable structure of Japanese
power has become unbalanced, argues Mr Kiyoaki Kikuchi, a former ambassador
to the UN who is now senior adviser to Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer
electronics company. 'The collapse of the triangle of politics, business and
the bureaucracy is greater than foreign observers might think,' he said in
an interview last week.
'Now that one dominant party has ceased to exist, business no longer knows
where to go for favours and bureaucrats feel there is no power centre . . .
The whole cement of Japanese society has collapsed. It's very real.'
Japan's influential bureaucracy has attempted to fill some of the vacuum
created by the weak political leadership - and its influence may rise as a
result of the latest government collapse. But not even Japan's civil
servants can set the political agenda. They would hate to be seen trying to
do so, judging by their hypersensitivity to criticism by the US and Japanese
press.
Mr Hata's departure has an air of tragi-comedy, which illustrates the
unbalanced state of the nation described by Mr Kikuchi. His policies and
personality are popular and all mainstream politicians agree that Japan
needs a stable government now more than ever, to tackle its domestic
economic problems, the rise of the yen and the North Korean nuclear threat.
Mr Hata is untainted by allegations of corruption, unlike his predecessor Mr
Hosokawa, brought down in April by LDP allegations of financial impropriety.
Mr Hata is, however, tainted by his perceived closeness to Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
the government's brilliant but unpopular backroom strategist.
But for better or worse, the end of Mr Hata's reign was inevitable. The LDP
and Social Democratic Party, the second largest opposition group - both
criticised for irresponsible behaviour in the Japanese press yesterday - had
repeatedly warned they would launch a no-confidence motion as soon as
parliament had passed this year's budget. The LDP saw a chance to return to
power, while the SDP was partly motivated by revenge: the formation of a
centre right bloc in the governing coalition caused the SDP to walk out of
the Hata government, depriving it of a majority, just after it was formed in
April.
True to its word, the LDP swung into attack straight after the budget
cleared Parliament last Thursday, delayed by three months because of the
wranglings leading up to Mr Hosokawa's departure. It took less than two
days, until Saturday morning, for Mr Hata to discover the SDP was asking an
impossible price to come back into the coalition. It wanted Mr Hata's head,
plus a watering down of the tax reform plans eagerly hoped for by G7 members
at the July 8 summit to stimulate Japan's economy.
After a 10-hour meeting with Mr Ozawa, a pale and exhausted looking Mr Hata
announced on television that he would step down.
Japanese business leaders were relieved that Mr Hata chose to sacrifice
himself and leave it up to the opposition to form a new government, rather
than fight it out in a general election. 'That was the best decision Mr Hata
could make,' said Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren economic
federation. The ensuing one-month election campaign would have paralysed
economic policy, worsening the existing upheavals on the foreign exchanges
when the yen's recent rise already threatens a recovery in corporate
profits. That, said Mr Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel, would have
been the worst scenario for Japan.
A majority of politicians agree that now is not the time for an election, as
shown by a petition signed 10 days ago by 306 of the 511 members of the
lower house of Parliament. They share Mr Saito's worries. Just as important,
political funds are low after last year's general election and a judicial
crackdown on corruption.
An election would have also delayed, maybe even prevented, plans to
introduce a more stable and representative political system, due to be ready
by the autumn. The political reform scheme, supported by a powerful younger
generation of politicians, but strongly opposed by the old guard, would
encourage parties to win votes with policy ideas rather than favours. It
marks a decisive push against the old-style backroom deal making that was
taking place in Tokyo at the weekend, in an attempt to form a new
government.
The four bills needed to regulate political fundraising and introduce a mix
of single seat constituencies and proportional representation to replace
Japan's unique multi-seat districts, passed parliament in January. An
independent panel is now at work on the final stage, drawing up new
constituencies, which could be in place by the autumn, unless an early
general election under the old system intervenes.
The shape of the new order struggling to emerge from the chaos depends on
whether Japan can form a government able to stay in office until the new
electoral system is in place. By yesterday afternoon, the signs were that
another unstable coalition could emerge in the next few days.
Leaders of the LDP, New Harbinger Party, a centre-left LDP splinter group
and the SDP said they might form an alliance, which would have a roughly
40-seat majority. This would be a curious turn of events, since the LDP and
SDP were respectively in government and opposition for nearly four decades
until last year. Such a coalition would be just as wobbly as the previous
two, since the SDP's policies are even more distant from the LDP than from
Mr Hata's alliance.
Mr Hata's supporters, meanwhile, hinted that his resignation was a mere
tactical retreat and floated the idea of a new coalition with reform-minded
members of the SDP and LDP. In theory he could become prime minister again,
following the example of former prime minister Mr Ichiro Hatoyama, who
resigned and achieved instant reincarnation in 1955.
Political observers believe several general elections, under the new system,
will be needed before a stable two or three party balance emerges from the
present ever shifting web of alliances between the record 11 parties
represented in the lower house of parliament. Until then, expect the
unexpected from Japan.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Personal View: Design for an environmental agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIETER HELM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent row surrounding Ofgas, the UK gas industry regulator, over
funding for The Energy Saving Trust has highlighted a central tension at the
heart of the government's environmental policy. Having boldly committed the
Conservative government to addressing the environmental agenda in 1988, Mrs
Thatcher's government failed to resolve the problem of who should pay the
bill.
Ofgas's director general, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, rightly pointed out to the
environment select committee that it was not her job to raise taxation from
gas consumers to pay for energy efficiency measures: tax, and therefore
environmental policy, was the government's job, she said.
Such problems are not confined to gas. Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat,
the water industry regulator, sees his job as being to curb the price
escalator in water bills. In a politically brilliant campaign, he has
out-smarted the water quality regulators, particularly the National Rivers
Authority, and manipulated public opinion through his emphasis on the costs
(but not the benefits) of the water industry's environmental spending.
These examples illustrate a core problem: the institutional separation of
environmental and economic regulation has left the balance heavily biased
against the former. For the utilities - which are at the centre of
environmental pollution - the costs of environmental clean-ups conflict with
the objective of holding down consumers' bills.
Fortunately, the government has a good opportunity to sort out the current
muddle. One commitment made as a result of Mrs Thatcher's initiative,
included in the 1990 White Paper, This Common Inheritance, is the creation
of a single environmental agency, to bring together the various strands of
environmental policy under a single umbrella to promote integrated pollution
control. That commitment is finally coming to fruition: the deregulation
bill currently going through parliament paves the way, ahead of primary
legislation.
However good the idea in theory, its practical effect will depend upon its
design and the purposes to which it is put. Initial steps have been dogged
by Whitehall infighting, and a battle over jobs and functions between the
pollution regulators and bodies with pollution responsibilities.
The real issue, however, is not about the precise institutional jigsaw. It
is about the new agency's rationale: what is it for?
To the traditional environmental regulators, the environment agency is
effectively a 'gathered fields' exercise, creating an umbrella under which
technical regulation by experts will be co-ordinated. It is an institutional
tidying-up exercise. To critics, however, the agency provides the
opportunity for thorough-going reforms of environmental policy. Their agenda
includes separation of regulation from productive activities, and adoption
of a more economic approach to setting targets and the use of market
instruments. They see the break-up of the NRA through separation of
flood-defence from water quality regulation, integration of cost-benefit
analysis into the current techniques-driven rules, and introduction of
pollution charges and permits.
The arguments for an environment agency based upon sound economic principles
go beyond institutional purity. They offer real hope for resolving many
current impasses. First, the introduction of cost-benefit analysis would
tackle head-on issues raised by Ms Spottiswoode and Mr Byatt. Cost-benefit
analysis would help identify whether, for example, energy efficiency schemes
were economic in the wider sense, once pollution had been properly
incorporated, rather than on merely private calculations. Broad attacks on
environmental concerns by regulators would no longer be so crudely
effective.
Second, environmental charges would raise revenue. While purists argue about
primacy of the Treasury, recent experience indicates that government funding
for environmental clean-ups is unlikely to be forthcoming. To tackle
pollution, a degree of hypothecation is essential. Charges are the
mechanism.
An environmental agency, soundly based, with a clear answer to those who
focus only on the costs and with a system of pollution charges to support
it, is within the government's grasp. But if traditionalists stick to their
conventional tools, if the Treasury stands in the way of pollution charges
on grounds of its unique responsibilities, and if utility regulators are
allowed pre-eminence of costs over benefits, then the new agency may prove
not only a missed opportunity, but an expensive exercise in rearranging the
institutional jigsaw.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Work and benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The greatest challenge facing the member states of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development is to expand employment opportunities.
In most OECD countries, unemployment has become entrenched at unacceptable
levels which waste human resources and strain the social fabric. Rolling it
back should be the top priority for governments.
Welfare states need to be 're-engineered' so that they do not block the
creation of jobs. Much of the growth in the labour market is in low-paid,
part-time and casual work. Yet welfare states continue to reflect the less
flexible working patterns of earlier decades. They are largely designed to
support male breadwinners during periods of temporary unemployment.
As a result, benefits are often so high that they discourage the unemployed
from taking low-paid work. Any income earned by wives is deducted from the
benefits paid to their husbands. And the rates at which benefits are
withdrawn as income rises leaves those who take part-time work little or no
better off. Welfare benefits thus trap their recipients outside today's more
flexible labour markets, rather than helping them back into work.
The OECD Jobs Study, published earlier this month, set out a menu of options
for reforming welfare states to promote employment. These included widening
the gap between benefit levels and after-tax earnings, linking benefits to
participation in programmes for getting people back into work and earnings
supplements for low-paid jobs.
The UK is among the OECD members that have gone furthest in adopting such
policies. But much more needs to be done, as a recent study from the Labour
party's Commission on Social Justice showed. The bureaucracy involved in the
social security system discourages the unemployed from taking up the jobs on
offer. Those who take low-paid jobs must endure weeks of financial
insecurity before they receive family credit, the in-work income supplement.
And the partners of unemployed men cannot take any sort of work without
losing most of their earnings in reduced benefits.
Better administration of benefits would help reduce these disincentives. But
the benefits system needs to be radically shaken up to support people
through periods of partial employment and low-paid work as well as during
unemployment. The aim should be to ensure that those who take any form of
work enjoy higher incomes.
The UK government's decision to introduce a new jobseeker's allowance for
the unemployed from 1996 provides an opportunity for such re-engineering.
Yet as a result of a turf war between ministers, responsibility for the new
allowance is to be divided between two government agencies. This classic
Whitehall compromise - complemented by the existing three-way split of
training responsibilities - is a missed opportunity for which the unemployed
will pay the price.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Smashing bargain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How much can scientists reasonably expect taxpayers to spend on machines to
investigate the innermost secrets of nature - the fundamental particles and
forces that make up the universe? The US Congress decided last October that
Dollars 11bn was too much; it cancelled the all-American Superconducting
Super Collider under construction in Texas.
Now, an irresistible bargain is on offer: Dollars 1.8bn for a smaller
atom-smasher to be funded by the entire industrialised world. That is the
price tag on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which Cern, the European
particle physics laboratory, proposes to build in a 27 kilometre tunnel
beneath the Jura foothills near Geneva.
Unfortunately the Cern council failed to give full approval to the project
last Friday. In a typical Euro-wrangle, two of the 19 Cern members, Germany
and the UK, blocked agreement in an attempt to extract a larger contribution
from the host countries, France and Switzerland. But all delegates seemed
confident that a compromise could be reached later this summer.
Europe must agree as soon as possible, so that Cern can take advantage of
the SSC's demise to make the LHC a truly international project. American
physicists are particularly keen to negotiate entry, so as to make use of
the scientific skills and experience that had been devoted to the Texan
project. The level of US contribution suggested in informal discussions -
Dollars 400m, including equipment and cash - would substantially improve the
LHC's performance.
Once the US was involved, it would not be difficult for Cern to bring in
Japan, Canada, Russia, India and other non-European nations that have
expressed interest in the LHC. It would then become the world's first global
scientific enterprise and a model for future collaboration in 'big science'
projects that are beyond the means of even the richest country on its own.
The next such facility might be ITER, the proposed international experiment
in fusion power.
The LHC will not match the planned power of the 87km Texan machine. But it
will still smash together atomic particles with enough energy to recreate a
microcosm of the new-born universe a millionth of a millionth of a second
after the Big Bang.
In that primordial fireball, scientists believe the 'Higgs boson' particle
held the secret of why some things came to weigh so much more than others.
The atom smasher may recreate this and other particles predicted by theory
but never yet observed.
These may seem abstruse subjects - and physicists certainly need to make
more effort to explain their importance to non-scientists. But almost
everyone is interested in the origins and future of our universe. So the
world should not hesitate to spend a couple of billion dollars on a machine
that helps us to understand it.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Pragmatism in a rocky relationship: Simon Holberton says
practicalities are becoming more important in Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong
Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely has there been a week in Hong Kong which promises so much as this
one. Britain and China may be close to striking two agreements - on the
financing of the colony's new airport and on the use of military land after
Chinese sovereignty resumes in 1997. These are vital to the welfare of the
colony and its 6m inhabitants.
In addition, on Wednesday Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) debates
Governor Chris Patten's plans to increase democracy ahead of the transfer
and will settle, finally, whether to accept his proposals for the last
elections under British rule, or adopt a watered-down version.
The juxtaposition of these events must be encouraging for Mr Patten. An
agreement on the airport used to be thought by his critics to depend on
Britain capitulating on his political reform package. Yet China, which has
fought hard against the governor's proposals, seems to have confounded the
experts and separated the political and economic issues.
This apparent change of heart - though few would be more optimistic until
the airport and military land deals are actually agreed - suggests that in
the past Britain may have misjudged Beijing's strategy towards Hong Kong. It
would be foolish to believe that all problems dividing the UK and China will
be miraculously solved if agreements over airport finance and military land
are struck. But the official advice British ministers were used to receiving
suggested that such deals would have been impossible: ministers were told
that China would not subordinate political interests to Hong Kong's economic
concerns.
Beijing's leaders have shown themselves to be much more pragmatic than these
advisers expected. They realise that in three years they will take charge of
one of the most highly developed economies which produces the equivalent of
a quarter of China's output in a territory just 0.01 per cent of the
mainland's land mass. Beijing knows that managing the transition will be
considerably more difficult without Britain's co-operation.
It is not surprising, therefore, that China should want to see the
completion of two large, complex civil engineering tasks: the construction
of a new international airport at Chek Lap Kok to replace Hong Kong's
crowded Kai Tak airport; and a naval base on Stonecutters Island, in
Victoria Harbour, whose construction depends on a deal over the future use
of military land.
Beijing's new enthusiasm for agreement has no doubt been helped by the
concessions it has won from Britain.
On the airport project, Beijing has, during two years of negotiations,
persuaded the Hong Kong government to increase the equity it will invest in
the HKDollars 83.3bn airport and connecting railway project from HKDollars
16.4bn to HKDollars 60.3bn. The remain portion, to be financed by long-term
borrowing, has been cut by the corresponding amount to about HKDollars 23bn.
China has been determined to minimise the amount of public debt it will
inherit in 1997 - so the project will be financed with a far higher
proportion of equity than would be considered financially prudent in most
developed countries.
After a bilateral meeting on Friday, the British and Chinese sides
instructed officials to draft a detailed agreement. The main sticking point
is the form of words China will use to reassure bankers that lending to the
airport and railway corporations will be secure. There is optimism that
agreement can be reached though ominously it is the same obstacle that
Britain failed to surmount in secret talks with China three years ago during
an earlier attempt to secure the airport's future.
The gains Beijing has made in its talks with Britain over military land have
not been made as public. But China is believed to have forced the British
into accepting that a larger portion of current military sites should be
transferred to the People's Liberation Army, rather than handed over to the
Hong Kong government for re-development.
In addition, the Hong Kong government will build a 400 square metre port off
Stonecutters island for the PLA navy.
The stalling point has been a apparently technical point: whether Britain
will agree to act as a 'guarantor' of the project in the extremely unlikely
event of LegCo refusing to vote the approximately HKDollars 3.5bn needed to
build the new base and refurbish other military sites that China will
inherit. British and Chinese officials meet again today for further
discussions. The result of a long negotiating session over the weekend
suggested the Chinese may have drawn back from an early settlement.
With their sense of history, the Chinese may anyway wish to postpone a deal
until at least Wednesday when the Black Watch regiment of the British army
'beats the retreat' for the last time in Hong Kong, marking the end of
almost 150 years in which at least one British regiment has been stationed
in the colony.
That could mean a deal on military land coinciding with the LegCo vote on Mr
Patten's democracy legislation. His plans would make LegCo more
representative of the colony's population. Like the airport and defence
territory deals, the outcome of the vote hangs in the balance. Mr Patten's
advisers calculated over the weekend that they had only 26 certain votes,
out of a LegCo membership of 60, for his bill - although they are confident
three or four other legislators can be persuaded to vote with the
government.
But the vote may be determined by the tactics Beijing adopts. The Liberal
Party, which has 15 members in LegCo, has been lobbying independent and
pro-China members to support its 'middle way' - amendments to Mr Patten's
proposals which follow more closely what China is assumed to want. It
suggests, for example, that nine new constituencies to be created for the
1995 LegCo elections should be restricted to a total of 122,000 business
voters, rather than the 2.3m extra voters Mr Patten wishes to enfranchise.
The vote could swing against Mr Patten if the three LegCo representatives
allied to Beijing side with the Liberal Party rather than abstaining. The
signs are that China has yet to decide its strategy.
Mr Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong, hints that members of the Chinese government are
divided. 'Some believe if we adopt the Liberal Party's proposals we can have
a much smoother transfer of power in 1997,' he says. 'The 1995 elections
would fit in better with the Basic Law (Beijing's mini-constitution for the
colony) than Mr Patten's 1992 proposals.
'But others think that if China takes a positive attitude it could be
interpreted that the LegCo decision has validity. If China were to accept
LegCo's vote people would also question the need for Sino-British talks in
the first place.' So far China has seen LegCo as merely an 'advisory body'
to a colonial regime.
Whatever the result of Wednesday's vote it will mark a watershed, finally
setting in concrete the way politics will be conducted in the last three
years of British rule. While rows over Hong Kong's political development may
cloud Anglo-Chinese relations from time to time, they will no longer form a
obstacle to the practical business of transferring sovereignty. That bodes
well for deals on the airport and military land, even if the conjunction of
events this week ultimately proves too much for China to digest at once.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rail men made outdated pay structure
point seven years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR JIMMY KNAPP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is ironic that Robert Taylor should lead his report with a comment
from Railtrack chairman Robert Horton complaining about an 'outdated pay
structure' ('Railtrack takes the route to modernisation', June 22). RMT
(NUR) made this point seven long years ago.
The existing pay structure has developed over decades. BR traditionally
preferred to pay low basic rates of pay and build up earnings by overtime,
supplements and allowances. This was because it was cheaper to employ labour
on this basis.
Incidentally, Robert Taylor misunderstands some elements in the package.
Isolation allowance is paid for isolating current and taking on extra
responsibility in abnormal working conditions, not for working in an
isolated area. But I am surprised that he omits to mention that the original
package of measures (including the 5.7 per cent with strings offer) was a
productivity deal with a clause committing the union to further productivity
measures. The government, with all the ineptness we have now come to expect,
managed to blow the deal out of the water, although I believe it met the
criteria it seems so keen to defend.
Changes in working practices are not being opposed by RMT, although we have
reservations about some elements Railtrack proposes. Job evaluation, for
example, is not a panacea and our experience in other parts of the industry
is that, far from solving problems, it creates new ones.
RMT's objections to the package put by Railtrack at Acas are, first, it does
not address the claim and, second, it is a very poor deal for signalling
grades. Even if we ignore past productivity it does not recognise new
productivity.
At very best it means an average of Pounds 4 per week increase in gross
earnings. The reality is Railtrack cannot guarantee any increase for any
individual because of the way the package has been constructed. Not only is
job evaluation difficult to predict, Railtrack admits it is not ready to
introduce annualised hours. Juggling existing monies from one pocket to
another is not an increase in pay. Furthermore, 30 per cent of signalling
grades will be considerably worse off.
Mr Taylor asserts that RMT should have pressed the claim more resolutely in
the past. Does he mean that we should have taken strike action seven years
ago as the only way we could have forced the issue? That is a strange
argument for the FT to articulate. This dispute has to be resolved by
talking to each other.
As Mr Taylor reveals, the differences behind the rhetoric are not
unbridgeable. If the government leaves negotiators to settle the issues
realistically we have already proved a deal is possible. Transport secretary
John MacGregor's latest intervention raises questions about his sincerity in
seeing this straightforward industrial dispute resolved.

<TEXT>
Sir, If Edward de Bono (Letters, June 23) considers himself a philosopher,
it is odd that he castigates Lucy Kellaway's article ('Put on your thinking
caps', June 17).
I certainly did not feel 'nannied' when reading it; indeed, a sense of
enlightenment. It was good writing because it succinctly clarified de Bono's
latest thinking fashion, with shrewd scepticism.
Surely the essence of philosophy is a creative pursuit of new ideas - which
are then criticised vigorously, to alter our very paradigms of thought. In
such a contest there is no time for personal pride.
Edward de Bono's reactionary tone could imply that he is more concerned to
defend the commercial prospects of his 'Six Hats' approach, than genuinely
advance understanding. This is not good philosophy. Its best thinkers have
usually been absorbed in ideas for their own sake, not marketing potential.
A reason for reading the FT is articles which inform and challenge us to
think - without a need for gurus. Hats off to Lucy Kellaway]

FT  27 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rare opportunity for WTO to seize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR HARRY L FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported that the Mexican foreign ministry is consulting other
governments about the possibility of President Salinas getting the top job
at the incipient World Trade Organisation (WTO) ('Salinas may join race to
head WTO', June 10). On June 15 you reported that Germany has made a formal
bid for the WTO to move to Bonn ('Bonn offered as base for WTO').
What is important is that the WTO be launched as a new and powerful
organisation, albeit with roots in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, but not merely as a revitalised or remodelled Gatt. WTO will commence
with more than 120 countries and will have broad powers to maintain and
enhance the multilateral trading system. Much can be learned from the Gatt
experience over the past decades but that must be balanced against the fact
and perception that the WTO is a vastly different entity, in membership, in
powers, and in responsibilities.
The idea of having a former head of state of a major developing country
which literally bet the future of its economy on throwing open markets,
joining Gatt, and welcoming import competition and foreign investments is a
rare opportunity which should be seized. This is no reflection on the worth
of the announced candidates who are competent.
However, the Salinas candidacy is an opportunity to be seized to re-enforce
the point that the WTO is both new and is to be one of the world's most
important organisations.
As for moving to Bonn, here again there is much to be said for a new
location denoting a new organisation. The German bid should be seen in that
light and weighed against the obvious conveniences of remaining in Geneva
where so many countries have joint missions to the WTO, WIPO, and UNCTAD. It
inevitably raises the question of whether the world needs all of these
overlapping organisations if the WTO becomes near-universal in its
membership.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DAVID MARTIN MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I sympathise with David Gardener's frustration in his attempt to gain
selected voting records of the 12 member states of the European Union ('EU
unable to provide ministers' voting record', June 22). The Council's new
code on public access to information does not address the issue it was
established to deal with; public alienation from the process of European
Union. The public are rightly disenchanted with such a secret and elitist
body.
When Maastricht brought in the new 'co-decision procedure' whereby the
Commission proposals require the approval both of the Council and of the
European parliament to become law, the European parliament was happy to
debate and vote on these issues in public. Not so the Council.
Whereas no one is expecting that all executive discussion should take place
in public, I believe that one of the new measures brought forward at the
review of the Treaties in 1996 should be for the Council to meet in public
when adopting European legislation. The Council should also publish the
results of all its votes. The 340m people in whose name these laws are being
made deserve nothing less.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Why the dollar may be oversold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is right to argue there is something puzzling about
the degree of downward pressure on the dollar. Currency crises usually erupt
when an exchange rate has been held at an artificially high level for too
long or when the economic outlook is clouded by some grave imbalance.
Neither condition applies in the US today, so the dollar may prove more
resilient than some 'gurus' expect.
By most objective criteria the dollar is undervalued rather than overvalued,
absurdly so in the case of the yen. And, as Mr Clinton has stressed, the
economic fundamentals are mostly encouraging. The US economy has been
growing since early 1991. Businesses are expanding industrial capacity:
gross fixed investment rose 12 per cent in the year to the first quarter.
Productivity growth and corporate profitability are impressive. And,
although the prices of some commodities are rising, upward pressure on wages
and consumer prices remains quite subdued.
Some investors believe that growth prospects are better still in Europe and
Japan, which are only just emerging from recession. But recovery in these
regions could easily falter (as happened in the early stages of the US
upturn), especially if the yen and D-mark soar to ridiculous levels.
Currency volatility aside, it is rash to assume that returns on investment
will exceed those in the US, where growth is so much better established.
Pundits in small, open economies such as the UK under-estimate the US's
ability to ride currency storms. The 'failure' of concerted intervention on
Friday has not created a national crisis, as it might have done in Britain.
The front pages of the Sunday Washington Post and New York Times contained
no reference to the dollar. This reflects the instinctive view of most
Americans that their economic futures will be determined mainly by their own
efforts in this hemisphere. There is some concern that a falling dollar may
push up long bond yields and hence mortgage rates. But most observers here
are guessing that, with yields already 4-5 per cent in real terms, the bulk
of the adjustment has already occurred.
Trade (the average of imports and exports) accounts for only about 11 per of
US national income, and much of that is with Canada and Mexico, nations
whose currencies are closely linked to the dollar. The US thus thinks and
acts much as the European Union would do if it ever manages to create a
single currency. Much of the point of a single currency is to prevent Europe
being buffeted by adverse international trends; the US has been in that
happy condition for 200 years.
But surely the US is vulnerable because it is a net international debtor,
having run a trade deficit for many years? This is a small problem. The net
debt is still tiny relative to the size of the US economy. The trade deficit
has expanded sharply since last year but this mainly reflects growth
differentials among the leading economies. This year it will reach only 2
per cent of GDP, far below the 3.5 per cent peak hit in the mid-1980s, and
quite manageable in a world of mobile capital. Since US exports are likely
to grow rapidly as growth accelerates in Japan and Europe, the deficit may
shrink next year.
Markets should also note that the Clinton administration is, finally,
clarifying its policy on the dollar. Until recently traders assumed that if
talks on opening the Japanese market were going badly, the US would favour a
stronger yen as an alternative way of squeezing the Japanese. Sometimes
senior officials directly encouraged such an interpretation: 'I'd like to
see a stronger yen,' Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, told
reporters at an infamous meeting at the National Press Club last year.
That kind of rash talk is now history. The yen has appreciated 18 per cent
since Mr Clinton took office - enough for anybody. Accordingly, in early
May, Mr Bentsen said he saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'. Late
on Friday afternoon, a senior Treasury official (no prizes for guessing
whom) took the new policy one step further. The Clinton administration had
intervened on Friday, he said, 'to demonstrate that it prefers a stronger
dollar'. Underlining the point, he added: 'It is our view and the G7's that
further appreciation of the mark and yen would be counter productive for
global recovery.' It is safe to assume that Mr Bentsen will also soon speak
of 'preferring' a stronger dollar.
The US view is that Friday's intervention did not fail because it was
intended to send a message rather than dramatically alter exchange rates.
The message is that the US and its Group of Seven partners do not want the
dollar to fall further. Markets, of course, are at liberty to ignore this
advice.
But if they do, US officials are unlikely to panic. The US lived through an
extraordinary appreciation of the dollar in the mid-1980s; it is equally
capable of handling an erratic depreciation. Indeed some officials probably
regard depreciation as the lesser evil as it would accelerate the shift in
resources from services to manufacturing.
The Federal Reserve is less worried about dollar depreciation today than in
the 'Carter crisis' of late 1970s because growth is solid and inflation is
under much better control. There is little chance that the Fed will jack up
interest rates sharply in order to 'defend' the currency. That would simply
play into the hands of speculators who would never be satisfied. It is
likely, instead, to focus mainly on the outlook for US inflation and growth.
Rates will rise further, but as part of the measured tightening of monetary
policy underway for domestic reasons.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Arts: Warning, music can damage your health - Muscle strain,
alcoholism and stress-related illnesses are afflicting British orchestras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast, to soften rocks, or bend a
knotted oak, said Congreve. But it can have the opposite effect on the
player. The pressures of finding and keeping work in music, maintaining
tough practice regimes and keeping anti-social hours can have serious
implications for the physical and psychological health of a professional
musician.
Cast an eye over the orchestra at the next concert you go to. Look at the
strings and pity the poor viola player: a questionnaire circulated recently
among the string players in the major orchestras showed that 80 per cent of
viola players suffer from upper limb disorders. Many, because they usually
sit in front of the brass, have damaged hearing from years spent in the
firing line. Brass players have their own serious (and common) problems,
usually to do with the embouchure. Players in their thirties and forties
often experience inexplicable and hard-to-cure muscle control difficulties
which make it hard to reach the higher notes.
Look at the soloist: so severe is stage fright for 15 per cent of orchestral
musicians that they routinely take beta-blockers to steady the hands when
performing. In every symphony orchestra, an average of four members will be
fighting alcohol dependency, acquired in an effort to drown stage fright.
Dr Ian James, a consultant physician and clinical pharmacologist at the
Royal Free Hospital in North London, runs the performing arts clinic there.
He holds one session a month, which is consistently overbooked and currently
has a three month waiting list. Most of the cases he sees, if not directly
related to 'nerves', are exacerbated by the psychological pressures of the
job. Clearly, worries over funding, the threat of mergers and closures and
changing standards of orchestral playing are not helping: 'Musicians can't
afford to wait for treatment. They work in a competitive environment and
will not take the night off for fear of losing their place. They live in a
closed community, practising by day and playing by night.'
A helpline set up earlier this year by the British Performing Arts Medicine
Trust (BPAMT), which Dr James helped found, takes up to half a dozen calls
per day from musicians with occupational health problems. The majority of
these calls are from people suffering from muscle pain in the wrist,
shoulder and fingers. Upper limb pain, sometimes inaccurately referred to as
RSI (repetitive strain injury), is a common problem, especially among string
instrumentalists, guitarists and pianists. Dr James believes the causes of
musculo-skeletal disorders in musicians have as much to do with technique
and anxiety as the repetitive nature of say, violin playing (six hours
practice a day is the average for string players) or the working
environment.
Pit orchestras, such as the English National Opera, have special problems,
elbow room being in short supply. Surprisingly, Dr James does not prescribe
rest and splints for upper limb pain but is more likely to suggest
corrective measures for bad posture - the Alexander technique or the
Feldenkrais method, for example. He will also try to find the cause of
muscle tension: incorrect technique, or anxiety are likely causes. 'But
don't stop playing - play to the point of pain every day,' he advises.
Upper limb pain is not confined to stressed out professionals, however. Alex
Scott, administrator of the BPAMT, is concerned at the number of young
musicians and students who seek counselling through the helpline: 'We
encounter talented teenagers who are forced by parents and teachers to
practise too long without a break. Apart from the direct physical
implications of playing so much, it means that the youngster is not doing
other exercise or satisfying other social needs.'
But it is the professionals who suffer most for their art. And with too many
musicians chasing too few jobs, most are reluctant to take their problems to
management or campaign for better working conditions. 'Concert schedules are
particularly demanding in the UK,' says Dr James, 'Compared to European
orchestras, ours play twice as many concerts but have a quarter of the
rehearsal time to get it right. If a musician can't withstand that kind of
pressure then they're out.'
Often, the anxiety is contagious. Dr James has found instances of a new,
dynamic principal joining an orchestra whereupon the rank and file of the
same section immediately succumb to musculo-skeletal disorders. 'Similarly,
we recently found that a group of young sufferers coming to the clinic had
the same tutor in common - and he himself had a problem with muscle pain
too,' Dr James says.
Patients contacting the BPAMT or attending the performing arts clinic are
assured confidentiality and will benefit from more specialised knowledge and
sympathy than a GP can offer. But Scott says that increasingly health
authorities are refusing to pay for extra-contractual referrals to special
clinics like Dr James's and the trust is examining ways of overcoming this
reluctance. Classical musicians employed by the major orchestras have a
better chance of specialist consultation though.
The trust, backed by the Musicians Union, has recruited a network of 35
volunteer doctors and now each orchestra has two specialising doctors
assigned to it. The trust also takes the lead in promoting better workplace
conditions. Noise induced deafness among brass players and percussionists is
a prime concern, especially in the confines of a pit orchestra. The trust is
undertaking research work to design an ear protector which excludes damaging
frequencies without impairing the ability to play.
But it is stress, and its physiological manifestations, which beset the
majority of professional musicians at some time. 'The pyschological
pressures faced by professional musicians have become enormous,' says Dr
Kenneth Lewis, who is attached to the LSO on a voluntary basis. More secure
than most, the LSO is a happy orchestra he says, but still he attends to a
string of stress-related problems - from asthma and difficulties with
circular breathing to fingers made slippery with anxious perspiration. 'The
question all musicians ask themselves each night, is 'will this be my last
job?'' Dr Lewis says, 'and that affects both their playing and their
health.'

Elijah Moshinsky's new production of Aida, sung in Italian, is broadcast
Live From Covent Garden by Radio 3. Cheryl Studer is in the title role,
Dennis O'Neill sings Radames and Luciano D'Intino is Amneris (7.25 till
10.20). If you watched the first half of Dances With Wolves yesterday then
presumably you will want to see the remainder today (8.00 ITV). Despite the
fuss made about this revisionist western, which, reasonably enough, sees the
'native American' as a tragic figure, it is not as powerful an indictment of
white colonialism as was 'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee'. Soccer fans have a
choice, of sorts. At 8.30 BBC2 begins two and a half hours of World Cup
Grandstand during which Germany plays South Korea and Spain plays Bolivia.
Difficult to believe that any football enthusiast will ignore that in order
to watch a repeat of the notorious documentary Graham Taylor: The Impossible
Job., This is the programme for which the England manager agreed to be
followed by a camera crew and to wear a radio mike (9.00 C4).

FT  27 JUN 94 / Arts: It's a mad, mad, Ken Campbell - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mad world, my masters. Especially when Ken Campbell discourses on it, and
ranges from drinking other people's spinal fluid with vodka to get their
thoughts ('like getting other people's snaps from Boots') to quantum
physics. To judge from Mysterious Bruises at the Almeida Theatre, Islington,
his scavengings through the mind's litter-clogged laybys are, if anything,
madder than ever. But there is a new gentleness about him. Bursts of manic
gargoyle glee are undercut by almost embarrassed throwaway reticence which
is just as funny. As ever, the apparent red herrings, wild geese and shaggy
dogs that roam the moonstruck prairie of his intellect are logically linked
and neatly come full circle, through whatever hoop, U-turn or lateral
flea-leap on to another juicy subject he casually urges them.
Campbell has stepped in, following the premature demise of the Almeida's
previous production. As he gracefully puts it, the theatre rang him to say:
'the bollocks we've got on at the moment have been rumbled.' He speaks about
theatre - the art, the craft, the bollocks - with brief homage to 'tubby and
caring' Peter Brook ('we miss Jess Yates, don't we?', he adds, wickedly
inconsequential); a talking dog that told 'an utterly constructed narrative
of the horror genre' sounding like Sir Herbert Beerbohm-Tree; and,
disregarding theatrical superstition, dwells on productions of Macbeth he
has known. In Stoke-on-Trent (1964) he played the Porter as if suddenly
aware of the audience, with an amazement reserved for time travellers. He
adopted a Method approach for Colchester (1967), deducing from clues in the
text that the character of Angus was a flatulent dwarf, probably opting for
bonsai disguise in Burnham Wood. I fear he may never be a company man as the
term is understood in the Berliner Ensemble.
But the two hours traffic jam of his stage begins and ends with science.
Ejaculating polyfilla canisters are to this set what candelabra were to
Liberace's. Campbell thoughtfully provides the front row with covering in
case the spouting substance gets into the spectators' pores before hammering
a nail into the 'disenfranchised self' of the aerosol and letting it gush.
This leads easily - as easily as anything is led in a Campbell ramble - to
the space-time continuum. He ends the show with physics, his nonsense firmly
researched, unimpeachable authorities quoted (and mocked). 'I'm not making
this up, you know,' as comedian Anna Russell would reproachfully remark when
outlining the plot of Wagner's Ring. Mad world, mad kings, mad composition;
and, thankfully, maddest of all is Ken Campbell.

FT  27 JUN 94 / People: Facilitator, not instigator - Michiyo Nakamoto
assesses Keidanren's new leader, Shoichiro Toyoda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is anything that might give the uninitiated a clue about the new
leader of Japan's business community, it is cleverly hidden behind the
gold-rimmed spectacles, the dull navy suit and blue tie that adorn the
slightly rotund figure of Shoichiro Toyoda, the new leader of Japan's
largest and most powerful business group.
In the spacious reception room of the Keidanren, the Federation of Employers
Associations, the soft-spoken Toyoda, who is also chairman of Toyota, the
car company, comes across as the typical stuffy Japanese businessman.
But as he reads carefully prepared answers to questions, like a Buddhist
monk reciting his chant, Toyoda is twiddling his thumbs.
The image hardly befits the chairman of Japan's most powerful economic
organisation who is charged with steering the Keidanren through one of the
most uncertain periods in its 48-year history.
The old order, in which business, the bureaucracy and politicians worked
hand-in-hand to build Japan into the world's second largest economy, is
crumbling. A huge political realignment is under way with politicians under
pressure to reform their corrupt practices. The bureaucracy, which helped
form many Japanese industries into world leaders, is under attack for its
resistance to the deregulation intended to create a more consumer-oriented
economy.
The Japanese business community is debilitated by one of the most prolonged
economic downturns in recent history. It has been demoralised by the
punishing surge in the value of the yen and frightened by the realisation
that there are few leading lights in industry to guide the economy out of
slump.
Amid the crumbling political and economic order, the Keidanren faces a
decline in its influence over the nation's development and is searching for
a new role better suited to the changing times.
Yet it seems unlikely that Toyoda will provide the leadership people in
Japan expect to come from big business. Almost one month into the job, he
acts like a man who has unexpectedly found himself in the spotlight, playing
a role created for someone else.
The predominant question in the public's mind has been whether he can live
up to the job. Even by his own account, he is not endowed with the stuff of
which leaders are made.
In one of his most revealing remarks, the modest Toyoda once said of his
predecessor Gaishi Hiraiwa, former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power,
'Hiraiwa has the air of the philosopher. It takes a focused person like him
to serve as chairman of Keidanren. I cannot devote myself like that now or
in the future.'
Indeed, until Akio Morita fell ill last November, Sony's chairman was
thought to be the favourite to succeed Hiraiwa.
It is not that Toyoda lacks the formal credentials. As leader of a
corporation with global operations, he has experience of the international
community and the cosmopolitan outlook that his predecessor Hiraiwa felt
were key pre-requisites for the job.
After much agonising, Toyoda took responsibility for starting up
manufacturing operations in the US. That he achieved that task successfully,
to the satisfaction of the extremely cautious Toyoda clan, is to his credit.
His position at Japan's largest vehicle manufacturer makes him particularly
vulnerable to the controversy - especially in the US - over the Japanese
trade deficit and Japanese trading practices.
His family-run automobile company gives him clout in the domestic business
community, but he is also known to be somewhat of a visionary. His idea of
building homes worthy of a leading economy led to the establishment of
Toyota Home which, despite its lacklustre performance, has been allowed to
continue. It built up a decent operation in the Nagoya area where Toyota is
based, but cannot compete with the larger housebuilders with nationwide
networks.
Other relevant experience for leading the Keidanren was gained when, as
president of Toyota Motor Sales, he oversaw the painful merger in 1982 of
that company with Toyota Motor, the manufacturing parent. Bringing the two
companies together entailed overcoming entrenched corporate loyalties which
Toyoda managed by spending a year at the sales company before the merger.
An engineer by training, at Nagoya and later Tohoku University, he won the
prestigious Deming prize in 1980 for his contribution to quality control.
But to make his mark as the Keidanren's chief, Toyoda will need to show more
determination and political skill than he is known for.
As the leader of an industry that is at the centre of US-Japanese trade
tension, his role at Keidanren will also be scrutinised more than usual
overseas.
Toyoda believes deregulation must be the centrepiece to reform in Japan. One
of the first things he did on assuming the Keidanren chairmanship was to ask
Prime Minister Hata to cut the number of bureaucratic regulations by half in
the next five years.
Regulation, he argues, gives politicians and the bureaucracy too much
influence over the private sector, which in turn is partly responsible for
'the inscrutable administrative guidance and incomprehensible practices that
receive so much criticism from abroad'.
Excessive regulation also hurts the Japanese consumer, he says. It is mainly
responsible for the huge price differentials between Japanese and overseas
markets and it stifles the kind of creativity that is needed to give birth
to new ideas and technology which could revitalise the economy.
'Keidanren is very anxious to bring about an environment in which the people
at large can truly enjoy the lifestyle of a more affluent society.'
The Keidanren last year decided to back its words with action; it stopped
its tradition of co-ordinating contributions from corporations to political
parties, in particular the Liberal Democratic Party which, until last year,
had ruled Japan for 38 years.
The battle to reduce the scope for regulation in the Japanese economy,
however, will not be easily won. The automobile industry itself, whose
interests Toyoda will be keen to protect, is under pressure to ease the
rigorous vehicle inspection system which has long been blamed for making it
unnecessarily costly to own a vehicle and which benefited the industry by
encouraging car-owners to replace them regularly.
Toyoda is adamant, however, that the Keidanren is serious about
deregulation. 'It is true that deregulation will cause pain when certain
industries and sectors have to adjust. However, there is a consensus in the
business community that deregulation must be vigorously promoted so that
consumers and other citizens can benefit.'
That position is a dramatic turnround by the organisation that has long been
one of the pillars, together with the politicians and the bureaucracy, that
supported Japan Inc.
'When the economy was still preoccupied with catching up other advanced
countries and perhaps overtaking them, very close relationships between
politicians, the bureaucracy and the business community were necessary to
increase general standards of living,' Toyoda points out.
'But in the future we must establish a relationship between the three which
could be characterised by healthy tension, so that they will be mutually
checking on each other.'
That the Keidanren and Japanese business will be changed by the recession,
the progress of political reform and by pressure from Japan's trading
partners, is beyond doubt. But judging by Toyoda's approach, his role will
be to facilitate rather than instigate, change.

FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): Ashanti adds to its board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the successful Dollars 1.7bn flotation of Ashanti Goldfields of
Ghana on the London and Accra stock exchanges in April, Sam Jonah, chief
executive, has created two new executive positions intended to make his
board look more like the international mining companies it intends to
compete with, writes Kenneth Gooding.
Colin Smith has been appointed chief operating officer and Mark Keatley
becomes chief financial officer.
Smith, 57, was formerly a director of James Askew Associates, a mining
consultancy. He also held a number of other senior appointments during a
30-year career in the mining industry, inter alia with North Broken Hill,
CRA, and Hamersley Iron, all Australian groups.
He is already well-known to Ashanti as he carried out an independent
engineer's audit for the World Bank's International Finance Corporation when
the IFC was poised to back Ashanti's plan to lift its output to more than 1m
troy ounces of gold a year.
Keatley, 36, is also no stranger to Ashanti; he was responsible over some
years for negotiating loan agreements with Ashanti on behalf of the IFC
where he has been divisional manager, treasury and financial policy.

FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): Abdul's golden investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest golden handshake in Malaysian corporate history is being given
to Abdul Khalid Ibrahim, the head of Permodalan Nasional (PNB), the national
investment agency, writes Kieran Cooke. Abdul is leaving his post as head of
PNB to become group chief executive of Kumpulan Guthrie, the plantations and
property company which is 90 per cent PNB-owned.
As a parting gift, Khalid has been allowed to buy 50m shares in Guthrie at
the heavily discounted price of MDollars 2.50 (Dollars 0.97) compared with
the present market price of around MDollars 4. The transaction gives the
Khalid, 47, a 5 per cent stake in Guthrie and an immediate gain on paper of
around MDollars 73m. He has also been given a three-year option to buy a
further 15 per cent of Guthrie at a price to be determined.
The deal has been given the thumbs-up by both Mahathir Mohamad, the
Malaysian prime minister, and Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister.
Market analysts are seeing it as a somewhat lavish reward for Khalid's
achievements during his 16 years at PNB. In 1981 Khalid organised a MDollars
1bn 'dawn raid' on the London Stock Exchange, wresting control of Guthrie
from its British shareholders.
Khalid says he views his shareholding in Guthrie as a long-term investment
and plans to turn the company into a corporation 'that will challenge
multinationals in Malaysia and elsewhere'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always clear that ageing wunderkind Hans Haumer would be the first to
go no matter how the battle over control of Austria's third largest bank,
GiroCredit, was settled, writes Ian Rodger. The question that intrigued
Vienna's banking community after Bank Austria finally took over Giro two
months ago was where to.
Haumer, 57, an accomplished pianist, linguist and economist, came to Giro in
1989 with a mandate to sort out a bizarre problem. Giro's two largest
shareholders, Bank Austria and First Austrian, were also two of its largest
competitors. However, the chief executive's ideas were too clever by half
for most of the modest savings bankers behind Giro, and in the end they
disliked him even more than each other.
Now he is off to Liechtenstein, as a part-time executive director of the big
BIL GT banking group controlled by the principality's royal family. No
problem with squabbling shareholders there. He will also teach a monetary
policy course at the University of Vienna and is setting up a financial
services consultancy - perhaps specialising in how to rub bankers up the
wrong way.

FT  27 JUN 94 / People (Names in the news): The gospel according to Philip
Morris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Marlboro Men have taken over at the top of Philip Morris, the US food
and tobacco giant, following last week's resignation of Michael Miles, the
erstwhile chairman and chief executive, writes Richard Tomkins.
The non-smoking Miles, who came from the food side of the business, seems to
have done himself few favours with his low-profile approach to the job and
even fewer with his support for a plan to hive off the tobacco operations
into a separate company - which plan was subsequently rejected by the board.
Now he has gone, his job has passed to a pair of smokers: Geoffrey Bible,
the new chief executive, who gets through a good few Marlboro a day, and
William Murray, a more occasional puffer, who takes over as chairman.
Coincidentally, both men are Australian, and both - in contrast to Miles -
have a background in the tobacco side of the business, having started their
careers with Philip Morris Europe.
They have known each other for 20 years and seem to get on well. Both, too,
seem determined to take a much more aggressive stance in promoting Philip
Morris's interests. One of the first things they did on taking over was to
tell the press about their plans. They also command considerable loyalty
from the troops; their first appearance before employees at the New York
headquarters last week was reportedly greeted with a standing ovation.
In their new capacity as job-sharers, Murray, 58, will focus on strategy and
ways of increasing shareholder value, while Bible, 56, gets on with running
the business.
Widely regarded as one of the tobacco industry's most able executives, Bible
has a reputation for toughness - something he is going to need amid the wave
of anti-smoking sentiment in the US.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Architecture: Music to the eyes - Colin Amery on the work of
Christian de Portzamparc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To win a Nobel Prize in any field is considered to be the ultimate accolade
for anyone's career. The equivalent award in the field of architecture is
the Pritzker Prize, sponsored by the American Hyatt Foundation.
During the last decade it has honoured the good and the great of the
architectural profession. It came as something of a surprise when it was
awarded last week to the relatively unknown 50-year-old French architect
Christian de Portzamparc. He is the first architect of the post-war
generation to win the prize, and the first Frenchman.
For enthusiasts of the relatively arcane in contemporary architecture,
Christian de Portzamparc is already something of a hero, and it is possible
to bring yourself up to date with his relatively small output of work by
visiting five sites in and around Paris. When Portzamparc spoke at the
prize-giving ceremony in Columbus, Indiana he said that his 'interventions'
in cities are what he regards as his key works. He speaks lovingly of cities
and the need for architects to think urbanistically in ways that can
refashion and civilise our cities.
On the Rue Nationale in south-east Paris he is rehabilitating a series of
blocks of public housing built in the 1960s. These blocks are typical of so
many that were built at that time - 12 to 14 storeys of rigid and dull
concrete frame building - uniform and soulless.
In Britain and the US the current mood would demand that these structures
were demolished. Instead, in Paris, new balconies and white and yellow
awnings have been added, together with some new low-rise buildings to house
a community centre and a school.
Just off the Rue Nationale itself, in the Rue des Hautes-Formes, Portzamparc
has built arches across the street to soften the effect of some housing
built in 1979, to attempt to create an sense of an enclave that is enhanced
by trees and trellis.
But these minor changes are not a lot more significant than a touch of
lipstick on the lined face of an elderly and faded blonde; and scarcely
enough to merit a major international prize.
It is the few completed Portzamparc buildings that justify the prize. The
City of Music - a conservatoire in the far north-east of Paris - is designed
by Portzamparc as part of the Parc de la Villette, one of the last of the
Grands Projets intended to make Paris the cultural and educational centre of
Europe.
This is the best place to see the work of this architect. He has adopted a
hybrid modern style that seems to look back to the 1930s in its curvilinear
language and yet in its random geometry is much influenced by Le Corbusier.
It is a curious and disturbing marriage of styles - the Portzamparc designed
Holiday Inn near the same site is a sinuous green slab that would look at
home in Miami.
It is the second phase of the City of Music that has just been completed. It
comprises an elliptical concert hall which has an amazing spiralling lobby
all round it. The rather tough and angular entrance facade belies the
elegance within - the recital rooms have curved walls and the hall itself is
simple but very stylish.
The large conical recital room that looks like a streamlined ship's funnel
has a quite remarkable interior. The ceiling soars upwards into the
cone-shaped roof and is panelled with timber in a pattern that resembles the
roof of the Pantheon. It is an almost ritualistic space - the concert
platform like the altar and the audience a congregation, drawn together by
the unexpected intimacy of this large space.
A very accessible example of his work is the Cafe Beaubourg which adjoins
the Pompidou Centre. He has installed a sweeping grand staircase - all 1930s
 -and the cafe occupies two large floors decorated with murals of
Portzamparc's actual designs. Another key public building where his work can
be seen is the addition to the Bourdelle Museum which houses a collection of
classical sculpture.
Outside Paris is his School of Dance for the Paris Opera at Nanterre - a
pair of post-modern pavilions. Further afield is his apartment block - a
square tower with a circular roof - in Fukuoha in Japan.
What is apparent from all his buildings is that he is full of architectural
ideas. They have not yet gelled into a coherent Portzamparc language. His
work is very hybrid and is still evolving. He only opened his office in 1970
and 24 years is not long in the life of an architect. Despite this major
prize, I would say the jury is still out on whether he is simply a stylist
or whether his architecture is of such significance that it will change
people's lives.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Media Futures: The all singing, all dancing newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One new local newspaper produced last week has that most traditional of
names - The Gazette &amp; Herald. But that is one of the few traditional things
about a very special paper, created by a collection of editors from the
Westminster Press regional newspaper group, working closely with Digithurst,
the communications research company that specialises in multimedia.
The colour picture of a trans-Atlantic yacht on the front page, for example,
had a rather unusual feature - you could hear the sound of the waves] And
when the reader checked out the latest pop record charts it was possible to
click on to clips of the actual records themselves.
Naturally when you turned to the classified advertising section it was easy
to call up colour pictures of particular cars or houses you were interested
in buying. All this is possible because The Gazette &amp; Herald is delivered
electronicly to personal computers using data broadcast links.
Using the conventions, and to some extent the design of an orthodox
newspaper, the project is probably the most ambitious trial so far for an
electronic newspaper in the UK.
'Anywhere you can receive good quality television you can receive this,'
says Peter Kruger, managing director of Digithurst, who has been working on
digitalisation for more than a decade.
In the experiment, the latest news was transmitted by modem from the
Marlborough offices of the Wiltshire Gazette &amp; Herald and brought together
with information created by pupils at the St John's School in Marlborough.
The electronic newspaper trials, are part of a broader series of advanced
communications projects run by Digithurst. In these programmes the Wiltshire
school is connected by an integrated services digital network (ISDN) link
with the Bookholtzberg School in Ganderkesee, northern Germany.
Apart from swopping electronic newspapers and their own magazines, the two
schools have facilities for video conferencing and on-line language
translation. The experimental electronic newspaper was produced by
Digithurst multimedia software. Called PictureBook, this is already on the
market. The 'authoring' system to put together the sound, pictures and data
costs Pounds 595, while the special card in the PC needed to receive the
service costs Pounds 99.
Kruger's other multimedia creations in the past have ranged from a system
for hairdressers, which allows clients to try out different styles on
pictures of themselves, to car presentations that enables potential
customers to 'explore' a car on screen.
In the wake of the electronic newspaper, Kruger believes that commercial
versions may be no more than three years away.
Meanwhile, he has in his company foyer another way of keeping up with the
news - an instantaneous teletext system. Digithurst has combined the
broadcast teletext service with the PC and anyone waiting to see Kruger can
call up the latest, national and local news, or the performance of a
particular share, simply by touching a special screen.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Coming soon to a tiny disc near you / A look
at new video storage methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the world's top high-technology companies are now working on ways to
put a high-resolution, two-hour film on a 3.5 inch disc that you can pop
into your video Walkman or your multimedia player/computer/TV/game machine.
A key element in future multimedia systems will be the medium itself - the
means by which files containing data and graphics are stored and retrieved.
As any computer user knows, graphic data files can get extremely large. Even
something as simple as a 8 x 10 colour portrait fills up tens of megabytes.
And the same motion picture that fits nicely on a rental tape is far too big
for the largest personal computer hard discs.
The high-tech industries of Japan, battered by the strong yen and devastated
by plummeting consumer sales are looking for their next 'killer' product.
They need something to succeed the VCR. As the chairman of one
high-technology company says: 'Everyone has a VCR . . . and they never wear
out.' What is needed, both as a VCR replacement and a basic element of
multimedia systems, is a data storage method that combines very large size
with the breathtaking data transfer speed demanded by both real-time video
playback and advanced 3D video games.
In the last decade compact discs, using optical recording techniques have
completely supplanted the needle-and-groove recording technology that was
introduced by Edison and survived, admittedly with sophisticated
enhancements, for most of this century. Those same techniques can and have
been applied to video recording. But there are problems. Pioneer's laser
disc format has been on the market for years and still provides the only
alternative to video tape for high-resolution recording. But laser discs are
large, cumbersome and unlike videotape, cannot be erased and re-used.
A consortium of consumer electronics makers in Europe and Japan, last year
developed what they call the video CD. The same sized as a compact disc, it
can play back pre-recorded movies on equipment designed for it. But video
CDs have their own problems. They sacrifice resolution and picture quality
and require two or three discs for a single feature film. Unlike videotape,
they are not rewritable.
The not-yet-developed, next generation video storage medium must meet
several requirements. In addition, there are features that, while not
absolutely essential from a technical point of view, may be very important
from the standpoint of market success.
High resolution. The closer we get to the time when current video standards
will be supplanted by high-definition TV, the less likely that the market
will be satisfied with present standards of quality.
High capacity. The largest hard disc drives currently available for personal
computers can only store about 15 or 20 minutes of high quality video even
using the latest compression methods.
High speed. To play back full motion video in real time requires more than
just the capacity to store the data. The recorded data must be transferred a
sufficiently high rate of speed. MPEG-2, currently the most advanced
compression standard requires a data transfer rate of nearly 10 megabits per
second.
Record capability. A major reason for the success of video tape cassettes is
the ability to record as well as play back. Most industry watchers agree
that laser discs would have a much larger market share if users could record
material on them. Compact discs replaced records, but have not replaced
audio tape cassettes for just this reason. And when Sony Corporation
launched its mini disc (MD) format, it found a way to provide the ability to
record as well as play back pre-recorded material.
There are currently three basic types of optical disc recording
technologies. The first method, used for CDs, pre-recorded MDs and laser
discs, impresses information on to a disc by burning pits into the recording
surface. To get an idea of the size of these pits, imagine a CD blown up to
the size of a football field. Each pit would then be about as large as a
grain of sand. This type of disc has several advantages. Duplicates can be
stamped out at low cost, much as records used to be pressed. The discs are
durable and can stand up to relatively careless handling. Capacity is
comparable to a large hard disc drive. CD-ROMs (compact discs used as
read-only memory) are becoming quite popular with computer users and
software vendors. But CDs can only be written once; they cannot be
re-recorded and while more than adequate for audio applications, they lack
the capacity to store and play-back full-length motion pictures on a single
disc.
Magneto Optical (MO) discs, the second type, use both optical and magnetic
recording techniques. Erasable and rewritable, they offer relatively high
capacity up to about one-third that of a CD. To produce MD recorders, Sony
fell back on this technology. Pre-recorded MDs use the same basic technology
as CDs. The smaller size is achieved by using different standards and
methods for compressing the data on the disc. But you cannot erase a
pre-recorded MD. Recordable MDs, even though they can be played back on the
same equipment, use MO technology.
The third type is the phase-change optical disc which uses a laser at
varying levels of power to alter the structure of the recording surface from
an amorphous state to a crystalline state and vice versa. Phase change discs
are fast and recordable, but current phase-change disc drives cost about
five times as much as MO drives.
Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp. has been supplying drives of this type
to commercial customers for several years and recently announced technical
improvements that could make it possible to put 6 gigabytes of data on a
single 5.25 inch disc. Toshiba Corp. has no drives of this type on the
market but last month demonstrated a prototype that had the capacity of a
CD, was recordable and erasable and could record and play back 20 minutes of
full-motion video with MPEG-2 compression in real time.
Other companies have been extending the optical disc state of the art in the
last few weeks. IBM Corp. in the US, demonstrated in May an optical disc
recording system that increased capacity tenfold. IBM's approach was direct,
it simply combined ten discs into a composite sandwich. To write to or read
from a particular disc in the sandwich the laser's point of focus is
changed.
Which technology is going to emerge on top of the heap in a few years is
hard to say. In addition to the basic types outlined above there are likely
to be advances in technology that cut across several categories. A number of
corporate and university laboratories around the world are in a race to
develop a low-cost, low-power semiconductor laser that emits a blue-violet
beam. Because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red, a blue laser
could burn smaller pits into the surface of a CD. Smaller pits spaced closer
together take up less space. More pits equals more capacity, equals longer
recording time. All optical recording systems use lasers so a commercially
successful blue laser could increase the capacity of almost any optical
recording system four fold.
Hitachi researchers just reported the results of an experiment designed to
get blue laser results using conventional red lasers. What the experimenters
did was force light from a red laser through an optical fiber with a
diameter that was only a tenth of the wavelength of the light beam. A
high-tech version of passing a camel through the eye of a needle, the feat
is admittedly many years from any practical application. But if successful,
the method could be used to carve out pits from the recording surface of an
optical disc that are even smaller than pits produced by a blue laser.
In May, Sony announced a breakthrough that could increase the capacity of
any optical disc that stores information in the form of pits. In principle,
what Sony researchers did is simple. Where conventional CDs vary the size
and spacing of pits to record information, Sony's experimental makes the
centre-to-centre distance between pits constant, then varies both the left
and right edges independently. Because the new scheme allows a greater
number of variations for each pit, it allows more information to be placed
on a disc - at least twice as much.
Another significant element of future optical storage systems for video
applications is data compression. Although data compression algorithms - the
precise mathematical expression of the compression scheme - are quite
complex, the underlying principle is simple. Both motion pictures and video
recordings produce the illusion of motion by presenting a series of still
pictures (frames) so fast that the human eye cannot detect the difference.
But the difference between successive frames may not be large. Just as
animated sequences do not require a new drawing for each frame, compression
systems allow the recording of frame-to-frame changes. The idea is not to
waste disc space on picture elements that have not changed from one frame to
the next. MPEG-2 is the most advanced current standard, but newer methods
will soon be coming. Stay tuned.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Superhighway push by Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of leading Europe-based electronics manufacturers and institutions
have formed an association to promote the development of multimedia
technologies and services. The European Multimedia Forum, launched late last
week, brings together computer manufacturers, telecommunications companies
and publishers in a bid to facilitate the exchange of information and the
development of business partnerships.
The members include the Association of Commercial Television in Europe,
British Telecom, Compaq, France Telecom, Hewlett Packard, ICL, Mercury,
Philips, Sema, Silicon Graphics and Sony.
It said: 'The forum will encourage cross-industry synergies and function as
an interface between business and government. In particular, the forum will
concentrate on the implementation of a European Information Infrastructure
(the Europrean 'superhighway').
Formation of the forum follows quickly on publication of the Bangemann
Report, which urged European companies to seize the opportunities offered by
multimedia. Membership is open to any size of organisation interested in
multimedia. The annual fee is ecu500 for small companies and ecu1000 for
large companies and organisations.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Variety of voyages to Vietnam - The choice
of carriers is increasing rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways has become the latest international airline to begin
negotiations for flights to Vietnam. The fast-growing Vietnamese economy and
expanding tourism industry are making it an increasingly attractive
destination for air freight and passenger services.
BA hopes to start flying twice a week between London and Ho Chi Minh City,
the southern commercial centre, in the first half of next year. The flights
may go via Hong Kong, rather than more directly through Bangkok, to fit in
with BA's other flight schedules.
Air France, Lufthansa and KLM (all using combination Boeing-747s for both
passengers and cargo) already fly between western Europe and Vietnam, while
Vietnam Airlines, the national carrier, begins flights to Berlin and Paris
via Dubai in July. Several Asian airlines fly to Vietnam, while Gulf Air and
Emirates from Abu Dhabi and Dubai are expected to start flying there soon.
US airlines are also negotiating with Vietnamese and US authorities for
traffic rights. There are 1m ethnic Vietnamese living in the US, and travel
between the two countries is increasing following President Bill Clinton's
decision in February to lift the US economic embargo against Vietnam.
Vietnam's communist government is liberalising its air transport system,
along with the rest of the economy. Foreign airlines will be able to issue
their own tickets in Vietnam - previously only three airlines were allowed
to do so, and the rest had to refer customers to Vietnam Airlines. The
government also plans to end subsidies for Vietnamese citizens on domestic
flights - locals pay less than half the fare charged to foreigners.
Other opportunities have also arisen for airlines. Air France is leasing,
with crews, Airbuses and ATR propeller aircraft to Vietnam Airlines for
domestic and international flights. And there are plans to improve the main
airports. The government says Tan Son Nhat, the busiest airport, needs
Dollars 1.8bn worth of upgrading in the next two decades.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel: All the fun of low fares - Richard Tomkins
explains how to track down cheap US flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity the US airline industry. Hardly a day seems to pass without news of
another US carrier slashing fares on short-haul domestic routes in an
attempt to preserve market share from low-cost competitors. For most
airlines, the prospect of a decent profit looks as far away as ever.
But what is bad news for the industry is good news for the cost-conscious
business traveller. Although air fares in the US may not have sunk to the
depths they plumbed in the fare war of summer 1992, they still represent a
bargain.
How, though, to take advantage of them? Many must have heard about the
inroads being made into the big US airlines' markets by upstart, low-fare
carriers with names like Kiwi International, UltrAir or Republic Air, and
wondered how to book with them.
Cut-price fares in the US fall into two main categories. The seasonal
promotions frequently offered by big carriers on selected routes are almost
useless to business travellers, because they commonly require advance
booking and Saturday night stay-overs, they are ineligible for exchanges or
refunds, and the number of tickets is rationed. But on the routes where
low-cost carriers are in operation, rock-bottom fares are a permanent
fixture on all flights, and rarely carry any restrictions. Booking with
these low-cost carriers should be easy. Unlike People Express, the low-cost
US airline of the 1980s that tried to save money by cutting out the travel
agents, nearly all today's low-cost carriers are on the travel agents'
computer reservations systems. So theoretically, once inside the US, it is
just a matter of finding the nearest agent and asking.
Predictably, though, things are not always quite that simple. So here are a
few tips:
Travel agents work on commission, so obviously they earn less by selling you
a cheap ticket than an expensive one. The American Society of Travel Agents
bristles at suggestions that any of its members would be swayed by such
considerations but, to be on the safe side, deal with a reputable agent and
make it clear that you are looking for the lowest-cost option.
The biggest low-cost carrier - Southwest Airlines, the one that started it
all - is not on three of the four big computer reservation systems, so some
travel agents may not automatically quote its rates. Ask whether Southwest
flies the route you want and, if you run into difficulties, dial Southwest
direct on 1-800-435-9792.
Do not be too surprised if there is no low-cost option on your chosen route,
particularly if you are flying in the east. The really low fares have still
reached only about 20 per cent of domestic routes and most of these are in
the south and west - though they have begun to spread in the east this year.
If you know your itinerary in advance, check out the bargains to be had
before you leave. American Express's air fare management unit in New York
says packages available from some US airlines could end up much cheaper than
getting a transatlantic flight on a big carrier and switching to low-cost
airlines. It recommends you consult an experienced travel agent - like, er,
American Express.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Regional savings - A UK airline's
initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Midland, the UK's second largest scheduled airline, is offering
business travellers flying from UK regional airports to Europe average
savings of 16 per cent on full club class fares. It has negotiated a
marketing deal with three European airlines: Alitalia, Austrian Airlines and
Iberia of Spain.
The new initiative, which in some cases offers savings of up to 22 per cent,
allows passengers to buy special 'through fares' to 15 European destinations
 -including Alicante, Barcelona, Bilbao, Bologna, Madrid, Malaga, Milan,
Palma, Pisa, Rome, Seville, Turin, Valencia, Venice and Vienna - from five
UK regional airports. These are Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Leeds/Bradford
and Teesside.
The only restriction on the new 'through fares' is that journeys must be
completed within three days of departure. Normally, a journey from a
regional UK airport connecting in London with a flight on another airline to
a destination in Europe would have two separate fares for the different legs
of the journey.
These three-day executive return fares were introduced on British Midland's
London Heathrow services to Europe last year, when the airline launched its
Euroclass, offering a flexible range of business class fares. They have now
been extended to British Midland UK regional services in conjunction with
the three European airlines. British Midland recently formed a ticket
code-sharing alliance with Austrian Airlines, and is expected to forge
similar code-sharing agreements with Alitalia and Iberia.

<TEXT>
The Russian government has issued a 'survival guide' for foreigners on how
to avoid crime, warning them not to deal with shady businessmen and not to
accept lifts or drinks from strangers.
The interior ministry said in a pocket-sized guide, which will be sent to
embassies, that almost half the 5,000 offences against foreigners uncovered
over the last year were the result of carelessness.
Last year, 63 foreigners were murdered. In the first five months of this
year, when citizens of former Soviet republics were included, 65 were
killed.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Headaches, a pill popper's guide - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is the difference between Doan's Backache Pills and Nurse Sykes'
Powders?
At first sight, everything. Mr Doan brings you khaki brown tablets to deal
with 'sprains, lumbago and fibrositis'. Nurse Sykes offers a white powder
with a faint vinegary odour suitable for treating 'influenza, feverishness
and feverish colds'.
But the ingredients are almost identical, essentially paracetamol and
aspirin. The only real difference is Nurse Sykes is more stimulating: she
administers half a mug of coffee's worth of caffeine with her painkillers.
Both medications are available in UK pharmacies, along with another 70-plus
branded headache treatments. Hundreds more fill drug store shelves in other
countries.
The fuzzy-headed can simplify the buying decision by staying loyal to one
brand. Alternatively they can read the side of the pack to find out which of
the four or five possible active ingredients is used.
The intelligent pill popper looks out for:
Aspirin which, after almost a century of commercialisation, is still the
number one choice for many. There are three related compounds in the aspirin
family. Acetylsalicylic acid, the official aspirin, salicylic acid and
sodium salicylate. Each works in the same way, but acetylsalicylic acid is
often preferred by drugs manufacturers because there may be a slightly lower
chance of irritating the stomach.
Paracetamol, called acetominophen or branded Tylenol in the US, is as
effective as aspirin but without the tendency to irritate the stomach.
Ibuprofen is a more powerful drug that began to be available
over-the-counter (OTC) in the early 1980s and can be used to relieve
menstrual and post-operative pain. Its newness means that it is not
available in Greece, Portugal or Norway and a handful of other countries.
Codeine and dihydrocodeine are stronger still. These powerful drugs are
mildly addictive and so not available OTC without a prescription in a pure
form. Even in mixtures with aspirin or paracetamol they are only available
OTC in a some countries such as the UK, France, Denmark and Canada. They
were once used in cough medicines in the US, 'but people used to drink it
all at once', says one drugs industry executive.
Naproxen. A new name , available from this month in the US, is Aleve, a
tablet containing naproxen which was one of the world's biggest selling
rheumatism treatments until its patent expired last year. The manufacturers
say the price per dose is 'comparable' to existing analgesics and the effect
lasts for eight to 12 hours.
Other ingredients, such as caffeine, do not ease pain.
More headache products are likely to come on to the OTC market in the next
few years as governments try to shift some of the costs of healthcare to the
consumer. This is likely lead to a further proliferation of brand names. The
clear-headed will stick to reading the list of ingredients.

To sunny Rome from drizzly Heathrow. In these days of Euro-travel, such a
hop for a day's business is a regular possibility. The destinations may vary
but the flexible, user-friendly wardrobe, which doesn't involve a suitcase
of changes, is an important consideration.
This is where the cashmere investment makes the soundest sense. Warm when
you leave from a chilly airport in early morning, appropriate for a
strategic meeting and glamorous enough for an evening date. The right
cashmere sweater even looks good thrown carelessly round the shoulders as a
shawl.
This season the choice of colour is simple. Cashmere is at its most
luxurious in shades of beige, ecru, cream or biscuit. All these work with
the basics - navy, black, brown or grey - or even with more beige, white or
cream if the film star entrance is what you're after.
The shape to choose? Try the re-vamped twinset last seen in Audrey Hepburn
films with its prim little cardigan over a matching round-necked shape.
Fashion buffs will wear them short and small, like the one by TSE
(pronounced SAl) in silk and cashmere mix at Pounds 139 for the cardigan and
Pounds 105 for the cutaway-sleeved top underneath (Harvey Nichols,
Liberty's, Selfridges and Harrods).
At Scotch House you will find a more conventional design at Pounds 235 for
100 per cent cream cashmere. But they do have a sweet cropped version in
lambswool in their Hopscotch range.
Easier on the silhouette is the loose, fingertip-length tunic-shape
available at Pringle (in Hebridean cashmere for Pounds 190) and at
Ballantyne (in two-ply, ribbed cotton/cashmere for Pounds 160), 153a New
Bond Street.
The single-ply cashmere tunic with side slits, at Pounds 235, is a
bestseller at N. Peal in Burlington Arcade and the more expensive ribbed
equivalent had to be brought back into the range due to its popularity.
Women have discovered that the tunic shape works equally effectively with a
skirt (whatever length you're wearing) or trousers. Cut like fabric, it is a
sweater with none of the breakfast TV presenter connotations.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Fine food in an awkward shape - Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilaire, London SW7, currently embodies a lot of what is good and a little
of what is awkward about London restaurants today.
The good stems directly from Bryan Webb, an extremely talented Welsh chef,
and his enthusiastic young staff. This is obvious from a quick glance at the
menu.
The tempting list for lunch (Pounds 12.50 for two courses) included choriso
and chick pea broth, char-grilled tuna with French beans and black olives or
a pigeon breast with wild mushrooms as first courses. Breast of free-range
chicken with potato pancake and tarragon, grilled fillets of Dover sole with
a beurre blanc and braised pork cheeks with mashed potato were three of the
nine main courses on offer.
Dinner is more expensive. Three such intricate dishes as griddled scallops
with a vegetable relish, a rib eye of beef with shallot and tarragon butter
and a white and dark chocolate terrine may add up to over Pounds 30.
Hilaire has managed to stay busy in the evenings with a keenly priced four
course fixed menu at Pounds 25.50 and, after 9.30 in the evening, a two
course post-theatre supper menu at Pounds 16 (the Albert Hall is within
walking distance). The wine list is well chosen, fairly priced and includes
three pages of half bottles.
When Hilaire does disappoint it is entirely due to its physical structure.
Many London restaurants do not have the advantage, like their counterparts
in New York or Paris, of being situated on the ground floor of buildings
along wide boulevards or avenues. Instead they are in narrow buildings,
former townhouses, with small frontages (Hilaire's is only 4 metres wide but
it can seat 50). Tables are of necessity quite close together and kitchens
are situated on a different floor.
At Hilaire try to book for the ground floor but not too close to the door if
there is a strong wind blowing. Downstairs can be claustrophic with two
tables in what were coal holes - but it is a particularly useful size for a
small corporate dinner party. Webb's cooking is equally impressive on either
floor.
Hilaire, 68, Old Brompton Road, London SW7 3LQ, tel 071 584 8993. Open
Mon-Fri for lunch and dinner, Saturday dinner. Nearest Tube South
Kensington. Opposite Christie's, South Kensington and close to the Victoria
and Albert, National History and Science Museums.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Lessons from within Toshiba - Reading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alchemy of a Leader, John E. Rehfeld, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Dollars 22.95.
Fashionable as it has become for authors to point to Japanese tradition and
the Bushido, the 'way of the warrior', for handy, if vague, tips on crisis
management in the modern Western office, lessons are better learned from the
manoeuvring in the trenches of Toshiba.
The borrowing of Japanese techniques is a modern role reversal, given that
the art of borrowing, whether it be Chinese as a written language or a US
production line, has been been central to Japan's development. For western
managers, the challenge is learning from Japanese companies without
transplanting a corporate culture that has a worker introduced by company
name first, family name second.
Given that he is fond of the 'strategic silences' that punctuate Japanese
management, Rehfeld's exercise in alchemy begins without the characteristic
humility of a Japanese student before his sensei (master). He opens the book
with talk of 'unique' experiences in management and his skills of synthesis.
But a touch boastful begining becomes a book that does get down into the
Toshiba trenches to sift techniques. Having worked at that company in the
US, the author is aware that with the transplant comes the likelihood of
rejection, and that the style at headquarters is not necessarily common to
the large Japanese family of sub-contractors providing the components.
The most useful suggestions are of the 'getting to know your customer' type.
Japanese companies are relentless cultivators. If you have taken advantage
of the new-found freedoms in the Tokyo telecoms market to use other than
KDD, the old long-distance telephone monopoly, the folks at KDD will
persistently come a knocking, offering discounts, note pads and good reasons
why you should rejoin their phone fold.
And there are lessons, as Rehfeld suggests, in avoiding the 'hero' culture
of the west. The victories should be shared, and the corporate wins should
be 'celebrated on a frequent and modest basis'. While suggesting that
'silence' does have benefits, he also points to the need for positive
feedback often lacking in a Japanese office.
Japanese companies are being forced to reassess their own management styles.
Apparently conservative companies turned speculative in the late 1980s,
showing the lack of restraint generally seen late at night on Tokyo station
platforms when well-watered managers are stumbling home after an evening of
cultivation in the corporate interest.
And when these Japanese managers finally make it home, they will find a
family less tolerant of late-night commitment to the company that was
justifiable when the nation was devoted to 'building a strong Japan'. The
executive cited as saying that the company 'is what allows me to enjoy my
family . . . and to maintain the respect of my family' is in danger of being
fired by his family.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Once the company car is gone - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thinking of becoming an ex-company car driver? You are not alone. The new
tax regime is prompting growing numbers of drivers to consider going
private, particularly if their company car is a perk, rather than a tool, of
the job. But remember that it is not just the cost of the car but all the
peripherals - like insurance - that you need to take into account when
weighing up your options.
Young, accident-prone, inner-city dwelling drivers of sporty cars might find
it cost-effective to stick with a company car, because their insurance
premiums could be well over Pounds 1,000 a year.
Even more mature drivers of standard cars with an unblemished driving
history can face unexpected problems when buying their own insurance for the
first time. Many insurers refuse to accept a clean company car driving
record as qualification for a no-claims bonus, but they normally accept
discounts transferred from other insurers.
Others only take your record into account if you are over a certain age  -
which can be as high as 55. And of those offering discounts, very few give
new ex-company car drivers a full no-claims bonus, which can cut premiums by
up to 65 per cent if you have been accident-free for four or five years.
For example, Direct Line, the largest direct insurer, earlier this year
introduced a no-claims discount for ex-company car drivers - but only over
the age of 30, and only up to a maximum of 50 per cent, rather than the
company's usual 65 per cent maximum.
Although the recent trend in motor insurance has been towards direct,
telephone-based insurers, drivers going it alone for the first time could be
well advised to talk to a broker, who may know which insurers are
sympathetic, as well as calling a few insurers direct.
As proof of your driving record, you will usually need an official letter
from your employer, though a few insurers ask for a declaration from the
company's insurer.
Of course, a no-claims bonus is only worth having if it makes the eventual
premium cheaper than the alternatives. Simon Ward, of telephone broker
Telesure, says that insurers who do not give ex-company car drivers
immediate no-claims discounts can sometimes still be cheaper - but this is
not likely in the majority of cases.
So before launching into a recital of all your details over the phone to an
insurer, it is worth asking at the outset what their attitude is to
accident-free former company car drivers.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Sport: It's not tennis that's at fault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new think tank has been formed, which will discuss not how to combat
federalism or how to house the homeless, but the more immediately pressing
problem of how to make tennis more exciting.
Those who follow Wimbledon have become possessed with the idea that
contemporary players are less interesting than their predecessors. Instead
of dismissing this notion with a smart cross-court volley, the tennis
authorities have been tossing it back and forth in a pointless, feeble
rally.
Very few tennis players are regarded as charismatic when they are at the
height of their powers. This is true today and has always been true. Only
when their talent is in decline, and they start playing in a more
'entertaining' manner, because they have less to lose by doing so; or when
they stop playing altogether, and memory makes of them symbols of antique
charm - only then do most tennis players acquire charisma.
The truth is that when they were playing, Nastase was a petulant pain and
McEnroe a hysterical bully; that Borg was regarded as a bore and Connors as
a boor. Nostalgia is as strong a force at Wimbledon as a Croatian serve, and
it is now creating discontent where none should exist. Who were these great
characters who once enthralled us with their charm and style? More to the
point, why should they have done so then, and why should they do so now?
It is hard to understand this idea that athletes who play tennis should also
have to play to the gallery. Last week, at Wimbledon, I watched a match
between Patrick Rafter and Sergei Bruguera which surely contained everything
that a tennis fan would want: five sets and four hours of toughness and
brilliance. But no - this was not enough. The crowd had to care who won, and
so from these two apparently equally personable men they painstakingly
fashioned for themselves a favourite, turning Rafter's gauche looks into
those of a sex symbol, his intense tennis into that of a showman and his
every instinctive gesture into an expression of great personality.
Incidentally, I think that they have picked a non-starter with Rafter, who
at his post-match press conference revealed a personality which could rival
Michael Stich's for charmlessness. Perhaps people don't mind that, as long
as he is not boring.
I, however, ask nothing of my tennis players except that they don't behave
badly. I would not have minded if, on court, John McEnroe had failed to
shout funny little asides, or perform little jigs, or jump the net, or hug
the line judge, as long as he had kept his abysmal temper to himself. I
don't expect Alan Shearer to give me a quick tapdance after scoring, or
Brian Moore to parade newly-shaved legs before a line-out, and I am quite
happy for Pete Sampras to carry on playing without trying at the same time
to get himself an Equity card.
However, the phenomenon of Wimbledon is embraced by people who don't really
like sport, but who simply like Wimbledon. Most of them are women. Wimbledon
takes its cue from the flocks of schoolgirls who moon around its sumptuous
courts looking for someone to fancy, and from the neat, flowery middle-aged
women who sit primly in tea rooms and revel in the tournament's affirmation
of Englishness. If sport is, on the whole, a man's world, Wimbledon is a
woman's. For two weeks, women are in charge. The men who follow them around
those green and sunny alleys look as quenched as the cuckolds in a
Restoration comedy.
And it is because Wimbledon is a sporting event for people who don't like
sport that the entertainment factor carries so much weight. Unless the
crowds have someone to prefer, someone to find attractive, someone to amuse
them, they are not sufficiently interested in tennis to restrain themselves
from nipping off for a cup of tea with every change of ends.
But it is quite wrong to take this incipient boredom seriously, and even
more wrong to invite suggestions on the non-subject, which incidentally
included the ideas that spectators might be allowed to applaud during
rallies and to leave their seats whenever they wished. Why should they do
so? They are not children, to be given a lollipop to suck when they don't
get their own way. There is something irritating and destructive about a
sporting crowd which has constantly to be reminded of how grateful the event
is for its participation; and something misguidedly humble about a sporting
event which thinks its crowd has the right to behave like this. Spectators
are important, but they are never more important than the thing they are
watching.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Management: In search of wages that work - A subdued and
realistic approach to reward management is emerging as new pay systems prove
more complex than predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies continue to be obsessed with their pay systems. No fewer
than one quarter of all companies changed their reward management structures
during the past year, according to a recent survey of 1,000 companies. Many
large companies are settling into their third-generation performance-related
model since the early 1980s, with bonus schemes and share options for senior
executives in a bewildering state of permanent revolution.
Yet there is a more subdued and realistic mood among the high priests of
reward management than in the heady days of the 1980s. The belief that a
company's success depends primarily on adopting state-of-the-art pay systems
is now regarded as naive. Motivation is a complex thing, and designing pay
systems is fraught with difficulty.
'The most ardent supporters of performance-related pay recognise that it is
extraordinarily difficult to manage well,' says Vicky Wright, a director of
Hay Management Consultants.
Counted among learning experiences is a clearing bank which based the pay of
branch managers on the branch performance only to discover that
cross-referrals to other parts of the bank - such as investment management -
dried up because they were not included in the performance targets.
Recent evidence of inappropriate insurance policies sold by
commission-hungry staff is another reminder of the hazards of narrowly
drawn, individualistic reward systems.
But is the new realism in reward management delivering useful incremental
reform? It has been doing so for some time in performance-related pay, where
the tension between individual performance and group commitment is being
grappled with. So is the sensitive link between performance pay and
appraisal reviews, with assessment by colleagues and other such innovations
being tried.
Some companies are even recognising that the reason they want performance
pay is not to distinguish between the good and the adequate but to stop
giving pay rises to the inadequate. Useful advances are also being made in
skill-based pay and in 'gain-sharing', incentive pay schemes that return the
value of specific improvements to the employees responsible.
In the more sensitive field of executive pay, and especially share options,
many financial institutions have made clear that they want more rigour, but
as yet there is little to show for it.
Herein lies the unresolved tension at the heart of the pay revolution of the
past decade. Central to that revolution has been the tearing down of
national going rates for workers, and complex grading systems for managers
that rewarded inertia and length of service as much as performance. In their
place the 'internal labour market' has grown in importance, based on the
premise that employers should seek the loyalty of employees by rewarding
them according to individual performance and company performance.
To the apostles of reform in the 1980s the rise of the internal labour
market was not just about improving incentives but about transcending the
historic divide between labour and capital. With more variable pay, it was
argued, the wages bill rather than the number of employees would move up and
down with the business cycle, allowing for a more stable, committed
employer-employee relationship.
Similarly, profit-related pay and share ownership would spread risk-sharing
among all employees and even between employees and owners. Company
performance might be an unpredictable thing but at least everyone would be
affected in a similar way.
The trouble is that progress towards the high commitment company has been
linked to a large increase in income inequality within the company.
Loosening the ties with national bargaining systems has handed more power to
groups at the top of companies who have helped themselves to a larger share
of the cake and undermined the belief that everyone is in the same boat.
The most outrageous pay rises for top executives, running into tens of
millions of pounds, have been the exception. But, according to Robin
Harrison of pay analysts Incomes Data Services, gross pay for chief
executives has risen on average nearly 600 per cent since 1979, while
average earnings rose by half that.
This appears to be more than a one-off change in differentials for top
executives, whose pay was badly squeezed in the 1960s and 1970s. A typical
story in last Monday's Financial Times revealed that John Clarke, chief
executive of BET, the business services group, has received a 30 per cent
increase in total remuneration, while Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA,
the airports group, enjoyed a 33 per cent rise. Average earnings are now
rising at 3.75 per cent.
Countless reports have highlighted the tenuous link between executive pay
rises and medium-term company performance. But some argue that this misses
the point. Executives of the largest British companies are now acquiring
US-style pay levels (although managers in general are still at more modest
European levels) and the justification for such extravagance is not
motivation of the top executive but the healthy scramble it creates lower
down for the top job.
Evidently, many of the reward management gurus recognise this is a weak
argument. In their book on reward management by Helen Murlis and Michael
Armstrong, one of the 'key issues' listed at the end is: 'How do we justify
paying vast (and, some people may feel, obscene) bonuses to our chief
executives and directors and at the same time clamp down on pay increases
for the rest of our employees (who also contribute)?'
No one advocates a return to incomes policies and leased handmade shirts for
senior managers. But market forces will not curb the excesses. Companies do
not simply pay what they can afford. In a free labour market they must
roughly match what other companies pay, whether for clerical workers or
chief executives. But that does not mean that the pay levels set by the
market are immutable. Behind the market are a host of cultural factors. How
otherwise to explain well-known anomalies such as, for instance, the fact
that engineers earn so much less than accountants?
Executive pay is set by executives and approved by their boards and
remuneration committees. When political and institutional pressures become
great enough they will pay themselves less. That pressure has been rising
and will continue to rise as recovery brings the usual worries about pay
rises in general.
The pay revolution has not delivered pay discipline or a better trade-off
between pay and jobs at the macro level. Indeed, the re-emergence of 'pay
drift', the gap between settlements and average earnings, is often
attributed to over-generous performance pay.
However, pay researchers have detected links between the new pay systems and
rising productivity. Saul Estrin of the London Business School has noted a
positive link between profit-related pay and both productivity and job
creation. He also defends the government's tax breaks for profit pay, which
now cover more than one million workers, pointing out that most companies
were using profit pay before joining the scheme.
Supporters of the pay revolution might argue that it has not yet been
properly tried. Performance-linked pay is said to cover half the workforce
but usually represents only part of the annual pay rise. The official New
Earnings Survey for 1993 found only 3 per cent of gross earnings for
non-manual workers came from incentive pay. And Paul Gregg of the National
Institute for Economic and Social Research argues that the performance
element for top executives is no greater than 20 years ago.
Indeed, with a pay policy in the public sector, 80 per cent of pay deals
coming in at inflation or above, and a differentials dispute on the
railways, continuity in pay setting seems as evident as change.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Management: Sir John Egan - Desert Island Manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airport operator, would like a
theatrical accompaniment to life on a desert island.
What would you need for your business ?
'I am not big on high-tech business aids. My desk doesn't have a single
electronic device on it. I am not great on the telephone even. I like to
talk to people face to face, to see the whites of their eyes. People are the
essence of my job. I am good at getting plans into place and then getting
the right people to implement them.'
How would you keep your sanity ?
'By playing a church organ. My grandfather was the organist at our local
parish church. He taught me to play the piano. I used to go into the organ
loft to watch him play and since then I have promised myself I would learn.
If I couldn't have an organ it would be a squash
court.'
Who would accompany you ?
'I would have to have the family; I couldn't imagine life without them. Then
we would like to have Will Shakespeare but not to entertain us. I would like
to find out if he really understood all the psychology behind those words.
He shaped the agenda for our language for centuries and it would be
fascinating to delve into his genius.'
Would you turn into a beach bum ?
'No, I would have to stay out of the sun.'
What about a book ?
'Stephen Hawkins' A Brief History of Time. I would like some brain work. I
read his book a couple of years ago and I would like to fathom it out, so I
would need some books on similar themes to cross reference it against. I
read a lot, 20 minutes when I get up in the morning and before going to bed.
I always have a novel on the go.'
Would you cope being on your own ?
'I would not be good at being on my own, I think. But I would not become
introspective or worry about myself. People start to worry about themselves
only in relation to other people. If there are no other people to worry
about, you will not worry about yourself either. So it would be quite
calming. The least rewarding part of the day is when you think about
yourself, how you look, your performance and your ability. It is much better
to be off doing things.'
What about food and drink?
'It would have to be Italian for both. I lived for a while in Italy. My
favourite meal is pasta alla vongole in a restaurant in Rome and I would
have to have lots of veal.'
Any frustrations ?
'Yes we have a holiday every three months, just a week or a few days here or
there. We would have to have the occasional holiday.'

Have you received a hand-written note of appreciation from your boss
recently? I haven't; and I am prepared to bet neither have you.
The question was put to several hundred managers at the Institute of
Directors the other day by motivational guru Stuart Levine. It met a sea of
blank faces.
Most executives are too insecure themselves to offer genuine praise to
others. Those who have been told to praise their underlings usually mutter a
few clumsy words, or send an E-mail message. According to Levine, who runs
the mighty self-improvement company Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates in the US, a
note is better than the spoken or the electronic word. You can put it on
your mantelpiece or show it to your family.
I see his point. I can just imagine how nice it would be to receive such a
letter, how hard it would make me work, and how fine it would look in my
sitting room.
Yet on closer inspection, these notes may not be such a good idea. Levine
never leaves home without a stack of cards in his pocket ready to dash off
one to anyone who does something right. I fear he may be in danger of
devaluing his own currency: there is only room for so many sincere notes of
appreciation on the mantelpiece.
Moreover, herograms suffer from the same short-comings as other rewards. If
you do not get one you may feel as though you've been punished, and if some
people are being singled out for gold stars the others may feel mutinous.
In any case praise is only glorious if the person it comes from is suitably
senior and well respected. There are some people from whom a letter of
congratulation might be more likely to find its way into the dustbin than on
to the mantelpiece.
Whatever the shortcomings of herograms, they are better - and a lot cheaper
 -than letting money do all the talking.
Nearly every company in the western world believes that money motivates
people, despite a growing weight of evidence to the contrary. They feel that
if only they can come up with the perfect performance-related pay scheme and
share bonuses, they will have a tip-top management team, and a gung-ho
workforce.
But take that argument to its extreme, and you get the kind of sum that has
just been awarded to Jim Fifield, Thorn EMI's music chief. His recently
announced Pounds 13.5m package is made up of every kind of bonus, option,
free share deal and all the other gimmicks so highly recommended by pay
consultants.
I wonder how many millions the company could have saved by simply writing to
this man and telling him he was doing a great job.
Which brings me to the perfect solution to the rail strike.
The cost of settling it is about Pounds 3.4m a year (based on a 5.7 per cent
rise for 4,600 signalmen now earning about Pounds 13,000). As neither
Railtrack nor the government feel like paying that, Britain seems destined
to more commuting nightmares. Unless, that is, another source can be found
for the money.
I would like to volunteer Fifield as the answer to a prayer. He could foot
the whole bill, become a national hero, and still have Pounds 10m left over
for himself.
The Financial Times, like other go-ahead 1990s organisations, has introduced
a suggestions box scheme to tap the latent creativity of its staff.
Here is my idea for making the newspaper more profitable - ration it. Let it
be known that newsagents can sell no more than one copy per buyer. The fact
that nobody in their right mind would want more than one copy is beside the
point: the scarcity is bound to cause a stampede.
The idea is not as fanciful as it sounds: it is exactly what Louis Vuitton
is doing with its handbags. Last week it casually let slip that demand for
its products was so strong that customers were being restricted to one or at
most two items each.
I find it hard to imagine why anyone, even the most label-conscious Japanese
tourist, would want to make multiple purchases of Pounds 400 handbags.
However, if there really is a shortage, I can't understand why Louis Vuitton
does not go for the classic free market solution and raise its prices.
Almost as clever is Vauxhall's latest marketing wheeze. The car company is
promising to hand over a cheque for Pounds 500 to every buyer of a new
Vauxhall Cavalier. I consider myself financially literate, I know what a
discounted cash flow is, and am not frightened of derivatives.
But I am as silly about money as the next person: I would rather have a
cheque for Pounds 500 having paid full price for the car, than pay Pounds
500 less in the first place.
There must be another idea for the FT suggestions box. While other
newspapers are dropping their prices, we should raise ours to Pounds 1, and
offer readers 35p cash back with every purchase.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Merchant stirs up wool market: Large foreign purchases
increase pressure for regulation reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Aidan Walsh, an agricultural merchant from Naas, County Dublin, is
causing waves in the British wool market for the second successive year.
Last year he bought 100,000 kilos of clip wool - fleeces - directly from
farmers. This year he intends to buy 1m kilos, which is about 10 per cent of
the total sale in Scotland, where he buys most of his wool.
His actions seem certain to increase pressure for the abolition or reform of
the marketing arrangements for wool, the last of the commodity markets in
the UK to be regulated under laws introduced soon after the second world war
to protect food supplies.
UK-based dealers are still obliged to buy from the British Wool Marketing
Board and are forbidden to buy direct from farmers.
Buyers from outside the UK had always been exempt from the marketing board's
monopoly. There used to be no point in entering the market, however, because
the board controlled prices. But in May last year the Ministry of
Agriculture abolished the system of guaranteed prices for farmers.
The board nevertheless charges 18p a kilo for sorting, grading, and selling
 -and a further 3.5p to collect fleeces from farms. The board's costs have
come down sharply since the ending of the guarantee, but they are still
substantial.
Moreover, the marketing board pays over two years. The farmer, if he drives
his fleece to market, is offered a notional 94p a kilo by the board. He
pockets 47p immediately, but the second half of the payment depends on next
year's price.
If the prices rise during the year he may get more than 47p for the second
instalment. If prices fall he may get less.
Mr Walsh is offering up to 90p a kilo immediately with no risk to the farmer
of getting less if the price falls while waiting a year for half the
payment.
Earlier this year the board was offering cheviot, a top grade, for sale at
112p a kilo - this was the 94p plus its own 18p handling charge.
Last year Mr John King, of wool merchants J. &amp; W. Greig of Alexandria,
Dunbartonshire, also tried to buy directly from farmers.
In July the board won an interdict (injunction) in the Court of Session in
Edinburgh preventing him from buying directly. He is trying to get the
interdict relaxed, so that his company can act for a Portuguese agent.
He said: 'We are sitting here handcuffed and frustrated. You work it out. I
buy from the board at 112p a kilo. Mr Walsh buys directly from farmers at
90p. Let's say his transport costs to Ireland then back to Britain for sale
to a carpet manufacturer in the Midlands amount to 10p a kilo. He can still
undercut me by 12p a kilo - and that is before my costs.
'There is nothing I can do as the law stands.'
The ministry and the British Wool Marketing Board believe some form of
marketing structure is necessary. Wool, they say, is a by-product of
sheep-farming for meat. Unlike milk or eggs, in which the markets have been
or are being liberalised, it is produced only once a year, but is sold over
12 months, during which time prices can move substantially.
More than half the 93,000 sheep farms in Britain are small and many are in
remote areas. The average wool clip is 500 kilos. Small farmers do not have
the facilities to grade and sort small clips of mixed wool. Often, they
cannot afford to transport it.
Mr Ian Hartley, the managing director of the board, has said that if it did
not exist many farmers would not bother to bring the wool to market.
But in going for 10 per cent of the Scottish market Mr Walsh has clearly
raised the stakes. They would be raised even further if other foreign
merchants started buying directly in the south of England.
Ms Liz Ambler of the marketing board said: 'Obviously there is no room for
complacency. But most of the farmers and dealers are happy with the
arrangements.
'We have been trying to educate small farmers about costs. They can go up
over the year and it is not always wise to sell the entire fleece on day
one. It is by no means certain that Mr Walsh will be able to buy as much
wool as he wants or to sell it.'
The Ministry of Agriculture said there were no plans to change marketing
arrangements.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Ashdown attacks 'fuzzy words' of Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday launched an
attack on the 'warm fuzzy words and soft-focus policies' of Mr Tony Blair,
the front-runner for the Labour leadership.
In a speech to the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors Mr Ashdown
attempted to head off the threat of a Blair-led Labour party by emphasising
the differences between the two main opposition parties.
Mr Ashdown said there was a clear distinction between the Liberal Democrats
and socialism - 'even the socialism of Tony Blair'.
He said Mr Blair's starting point was society, the collective, while the
Liberal Democrats stressed the role of the individual.
Mr Ashdown accused Labour of centralising power and serving its 'client
groups' in the public sector and trade unions. In contrast, Liberal
Democrats decentralised and handed back power to 'a community of
individuals'.
When asked during the Eastleigh by-election campaign earlier this month
about the threat posed by Labour's shadow home secretary, Mr Ashdown said he
never gave it 'a second thought'.
It is clear from his speech that Mr Ashdown shares the growing concern among
Liberal Democrats that Mr Blair poses a serious threat of winning over
centrist voters without making any policy statements.
Mr Ashdown said: 'I have this warning for Labour - you cannot win the next
election by warm fuzzy words and soft-focus policies. You cannot win by
attacking the government and putting nothing in its place. Governing Britain
is a serious business and it demands serious ideas.'
Mr Blair sought to set out his policy themes yesterday by calling for a
fairer taxation system. He cited the example of some utility companies that
pay their directors 'large sums of money' and pay big dividends while
'paying very little tax at all'.
In an interview with BBC Television's On the Record, Mr Blair said he
believed that parents should be given as wide a choice as possible - which
meant they should know how schools ranked against one another and how well
their children were performing. 'I have no problem at all in comparing
schools, I think it is entirely sensible and natural - where I disagree and
where the party disagrees is with the notion of the government's rather
simplistic league tables. In relation to this and testing, of course you
have to have proper appraisal systems.'
Mr Blair said opted-out schools, which are currently answerable directly to
Mr John Patten, education secretary, should be redirected to local education
authorities.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Rotterdam and Humber ports in trade drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ports of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and the Humber in northern England
are to jointly promote their growing shipping links to try to attract more
trade from UK and other European competitors.
The first of a series of presentations to manufacturers and distribution
companies will be held tomorrow in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.
The ports used to promote separately but started talking last year about
trying to make Humber-Rotterdam the principal trade route between Britain
and the European mainland.
Although the ports compete for deep-sea traffic they believe there is scope
to co-operate on roadborne freight needing North Sea passage.
The Humber is Britain's busiest estuary. It carried 60m tonnes of cargo last
year - surpassing the Thames for the first time, with about 40,000 shipping
movements. Its main ports of Hull, Immingham, Goole and Grimsby are
supplemented by 10 river wharves and about 100 other berths. It accounts for
17 per cent of the UK's seaborne trade and this share is expected to rise to
25 per cent in six years. Humber traffic has increased by 50 per cent in the
past 10 years.
A principal attraction is the UK's motorway network, which puts 40m people -
most of Britain north of London and the south-east - within a day's return
lorry drive.
Rotterdam handles 300m tonnes of cargo a year and offers direct links into
European markets of 320m people within 24 hours' drive.
The advent of the Channel tunnel has spurred co-operation. Both Rotterdam
and Humberside authorities say the tunnel will have little impact on their
operations because it will initially handle only about 8m tonnes of freight.
This compares with about 15m tonnes of container traffic through the Humber
and 60m tonnes through Rotterdam - the market where the tunnel is hoping to
compete.
The tunnel is, however, making shippers think afresh about North Sea trade
and evaluate alternatives. The Humberside Partnership - a joint venture of
local public and private sectors - is emphasising Britain's London
transportation bottleneck and the convenience of Humber-Rotterdam for
roadborne freight to and from continental Europe for Scotland, northern
England, the Midlands and Ireland.
Rotterdam Port Promotion Council, the partnership's Netherlands equivalent,
says the ports can offer 'considerable' economic benefits to businesses.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Dealing with a Welsh Pandora's box: Roland Adburgham reports
on a turbulent year for the chairman of the WDA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the National Audit Office last week praised the Welsh Development
Agency's programme of land reclamation Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the agency's
chairman, was visibly relieved that at last someone had said a kind word.
He ruefully noted that in the turbulent 12 months since he took over as
chairman on July 1 last year the media have almost invariably described the
WDA as 'much-troubled' or 'scandal-ridden'.
A Cardiff-born international businessman, he was aware at the time of his
appointment by the Welsh secretary that the WDA 'had a very successful
reputation and was the positive envy of much of the UK, and of similar
development agencies overseas'. He also knew that there had been 'an
auditing problem' and that a report by the Commons public accounts committee
was imminent.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe did not realise that what he called 'a Pandora's box' was
about to open. The MPs' report on the 1990-91 accounts said standards at the
agency had been 'well below' what parliament had a right to expect. It
unleashed a series of damaging stories with the agency depicted as an
example of the lack of accountability of quangos.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe said: 'My immediate response to the public accounts committee
report was that we would accept it in its entirety.' An external inquiry was
set up and its recommendations adopted. Mr Philip Head, the chief executive,
resigned. The chairman said that the problems shown by the report had been
cured. But it remains his task to rebuild the agency's reputation, while
proving that 'we are committed to maintaining the highest probity in the
management of the taxpayers' funds in this agency'.
Since he arrived - taking over from Dr Gwyn Jones, who headed the agency for
five years - there have been new board members and senior managers have been
recruited from outside. The agency itself is in the throes of being reshaped
into a slimmer structure with a smaller head office in Cardiff and more
staff in the regions. About 60 of the 400 employees are being made
redundant, adding to staff demoralisation. The chairman described it as a
'painful time'.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe was adamant that the reorganisation was in response to a
changing business environment and not the PAC report. 'My own thinking would
have been crystallised without any PAC frame in which to be operating - just
from the natural consequences of going out and talking to our marketplace.
'I set out last year to visit as many parts of Wales as possible and meet
with the people who really represented our customer base. A popular
perception was that all the agency did was to market inward investment,
whereas the reality is that a substantial majority of our budget (Pounds
170m) is spent in Wales. There were such comments as all roads appeared to
begin and end in Cardiff, and the further away from the centre, the longer
for any decision to be taken.'
What was clear, he said, was that the agency's focus needed to be sharpened
towards the delivery of services. Three domestic divisions were being
created in the north, south and west, with more delegated authority.
The agency's effectiveness, he said, had to be measured by the creation of
jobs. Of the means to achieve that, 'inward investment is clearly a vitally
important aspect of continuing economic growth'. He emphasised the amount of
expansion by existing inward investors, with some Japanese companies
re-investing five times or more.
While land reclamation and urban renewal continued to be priorities, a shift
of emphasis was to provide more support for indigenous companies. 'They have
felt in the past that because they weren't Japanese or American they weren't
getting attention. That is being rectified. The small and medium-size
enterprises are our greatest potential strength for the future,' he said.
The question remains however: how long will the WDA be haunted by the past?
This month Mr Barry Hartop, appointed chief executive in March, notified the
public accounts committee of apparently unauthorised redundancy payments in
the 1980s. Mr Rowe-Beddoe did not dispute that further matters could come to
light.
'But if you think we are spending our life in a witch-hunt, forget it. That
isn't what we are doing,' he said. 'What we are committed to ensure is that
the housekeeping of today is beyond reproach.'
Mr Rowe-Beddoe denied being dispirited by the criticism. 'A few months ago I
would probably have been dispirited. I think one's skin has grown a little
thicker, and I realise very clearly the accountability of being in the
public sector.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / 'Greener' farming funds trebled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government funds for 'sustainable farming' have been trebled to Pounds 12m
to try to reduce the use of agro-chemicals and fertilisers.
Industry is providing a further Pounds 12m for a scheme which is backed by
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. She said: 'Farming needs to find
ways of reducing its use of scarce resources, both to save the farmer money,
encourage plant and bird life and protect the rural environment and the
welfare of animals.'
Sustainable farming is becoming a buzzword in agriculture. The concept has
grown out of pressure from the 'green' lobby to halt spiralling use of
agro-chemicals.
Sustainable methods involve farmers cutting the use of chemicals while
maintaining profitability, rather than giving up the use of artificial
fertilisers and chemicals by turning to organic production.
Projects backed by a government scheme to introduce sustainable methods show
how use of weedkillers can be cut by using spraying machines that recognise
weeds.
Some of the projects show how producers can encourage natural predators to
eat harmful crop pests. Another research initiative is aimed at showing
farmers how to control nitrogen leaching into the soil when spreading
manure.
The scheme has attracted growing interest from producers since it was set up
two years ago.
Mr Rex Chester, a farmer from Hampshire who chairs the management committee
for the projects, said: 'Farmers need to respond to the growing public
consciousness and concern for wildlife and the environment.'
But he pointed to the dilemma for farmers as environmentalists became more
strident: 'We can't compete with people who think eating meat is a sin. At
the extreme end, the demands become irrational.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / Accountancy dips its toe in corporate water: KPMG's look at
restructuring could be part of a trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK's largest accountancy firms announced their latest fee-income
results earlier this month Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price
Waterhouse, predicted that incorporation was eventually inevitable in the
profession.
Little was he to know how quickly his thoughts might come true, as a group
in rival KPMG Peat Marwick's top management was already considering that
option.
This Friday the most senior partners in KPMG are set to debate options for
the future structure of their firm, which may lead to one of the most
radical restructurings of the profession since its historical roots in the
last century.
If it goes through, the firm would for the first time be able to gain some
protection of partners' personal assets. In exchange there would be both tax
implications and the requirement for public filing of information -
including financial results.
The main reason for incorporation is seen to be an attempt to protect the
firms from the growing number of legal actions seeking redress for alleged
negligent advice.
Although it has never happened a claim can theoretically lead to the
forfeiture of both the property, cash and other assets of the firm, and of
all the individual assets of each of its partners - as its owners, all of
them have unlimited liability. In a company the shareholders have no such
commitment.
Some have also argued that a significant driving force towards change is the
tax system. In the next three years changes instituted by the Inland Revenue
will mean that partnerships will have to move towards paying taxes on a
'current-year' basis - they would no longer be able to defer their payments
to future years. At the very least, this change removes one of the
attractions of partnership.
Incorporation is not simply being considered in the UK. In the US, where the
liability crisis facing accountants is much more serious, all the larger
firms are at an advance stage of preparation for change.
Most are expected to take advantage of laws in Delaware, which will allow
them to register as limited partnerships, protecting their assets across the
country - at least as far as this state's rules are accepted by the courts
in other states.
Yet in the UK there has been little sign so far of incorporation. Under
by-laws issued by the ethical committee of the chartered accountancy
institutes, firms have for many years been able to provide certain services
through companies, notably data processing and management consultancy.
More recently changes introduced in the 1989 Companies Act and in
professional ethical rules amended in late 1991 have meant that all services
provided by accountancy firms - including the core audit function - can be
provided through companies.
Firms that are incorporated can exploit laxer regulation. For example, to
use the title 'chartered accountants' they need only ensure that
three-quarters of the voting rights of the firm are held by chartered
accountants. For partnerships, chartered accountants must also comprise
three-quarters by number of those in charge.
Yet the up-take remains small. Figures from the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales show that of 19,409 practitioner firms and
individuals, 192 operate through companies.
One reason may be a reluctance by the firms to disclose their fee income -
something they have always been able to keep secret in spite of growing
calls for greater accountability.
Another is tax. Partners in a company would be required to pay at least an
additional 10 per cent in National Insurance contributions on top of their
existing income taxes.
They could avoid this if they received their income in dividends rather than
salary. But some fear a future Labour government might introduce a new
dividend tax which would prove at least as costly.
An internal briefing paper prepared last year by the largest eight UK firms
in response to the audit liability crisis said that incorporation was no
solution, because partners could still be sued in their personal capacity.
KPMG is nevertheless looking at options involving a more complex structure
than pure incorporation. By having a series of subsidiaries with a range of
legal structures, and most partners as shareholders rather than directors,
most may be able to protect personal assets.
Those directly involved in work for which they are subsequently sued could
still be sued personally.
One thing is certain. KPMG's rivals will be watching its actions over the
next few weeks with considerable interest. They all have a personal stake in
the outcome.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Magazines launch at service stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An international consortium plans to publish 30 new magazines next month,
the largest number of titles launched simultaneously by a single publisher
in the UK.
The consortium, called Retail Revolution, will distribute the titles through
TPS, a Windsor-based newspaper and magazine distribution group which will
deliver the products to an initial 4,500 petrol service stations.
Mr Keith Eden, Retail Revolution's managing director, hopes to sell the
magazines through 9,000 service stations by the end of the year. There are
no plans to distribute the titles through newsagents.
Mr Eden said: 'We aim to create a revolution in magazine distribution,
by-passing the wholesalers completely. That gives us an additional margin of
about 15 per cent, some of which we can pass on to the retailer.'
The group expects to achieve 2m sales a month. Each title will have a
cover-price of Pounds 1.95.
Retail Revolution's largest shareholder is the London-based Richbell group,
a private company that owns the Egon Ronay food guides, and Service Station,
a magazine for garage owners.
The company also owns Overdrive and Dial, the fuel credit cards businesses,
which will provide the accounting software for Retail Revolution. Other
shareholders include a company based in the British Virgin Islands which Mr
Eden declined to name.
The periodicals include women's titles, as well as specialist interest
journals for computing, trucking and puzzles, and top-shelf adult titles.
All but one magazine, OK], have been specially developed by Retail
Revolution. Mr Eden said additional magazines would be added.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Coopers faces conflict of interest issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partners from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, have
become receivers to a property company in spite of a potential conflict of
interest with other insolvency appointments they have undertaken.
They have accepted appointment to Worldcatch in a move which has complex
implications for their existing work as receivers to Astra Holdings, the
failed arms manufacturer, and as administrators to Polly Peck International,
the conglomerate formerly controlled by Mr Asil Nadir.
Mr Chris Barlow and Mr Ian Barker-Bond of Coopers were appointed receivers
to Worldcatch earlier this year because of the company's guarantee to
another property company - Basic Bureau - which had defaulted on bank
repayments.
Worldcatch is the landlord of buildings including 8 Baker Street in London,
the headquarters of Stoy Hayward, the UK's tenth largest accountancy firm.
Stoy was the principal auditor to both Astra, which was subject to a highly
critical Department of Trade and Industry inspector's report last year, and
Polly Peck.
Mr Barlow is named as a receiver to Astra, and also recently replaced his
fellow partner Mr Michael Jordan of Coopers as one of the joint
administrators to Polly Peck.
It is believed that Coopers, in its role as Astra's receiver, is seriously
considering launching legal action imminently against Stoy in connection
with its audit of Astra. It is receiver to Astra.
Mr Christopher Morris of accountants Touche Ross, the Polly Peck
administrator who deals with matters relating to Stoy Hayward, has said
publicly that litigation against Stoy is highly likely for this audit.
But the two lawsuits against Stoy may significantly reduce the firm's
ability to pay its rent to Worldcatch, which would in turn substantially
affect the value of the property at a time when the receivers are trying to
sell to recover creditors' money.
If they decide not to launch legal action against Stoy, the creditors to
Polly Peck and Astra are less likely to recover as much money. If the
litigation takes place, Worldcatch's creditors may suffer.
Mr Barlow said: 'The firm has carefully looked at the Worldcatch appointment
and is satisfied that there was and is still no conflict.'
Coopers is understood to believe that the existing knowledge of potential
litigation, the lengthy timescales involved and the way in which any claims
would be settled means lawsuits against Stoy would not diminish the value of
the Worldcatch property.
Mr Julian Osborne, secretary to the professional ethics committee of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, commenting on the
general principle of the position without knowledge of the specific case,
said there appeared to be a conflict if there was substantial litigation
involved.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Work training onus is urged on employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax-free savings accounts for individuals to fund their learning should be
permitted in order to stimulate the development of new skills in the UK, a
training and enterprise council report has recommended to the government.
The vehicle for savings, which might be jointly funded with employers, could
be on the line of an educational Tessa, to which parents, individuals and
employers could contribute, says the report from a working group chaired by
Mr Colin Harris, chairman of Surrey Tec and managing director of Legal and
General Financial Services.
The report, etitled Individuals' Commitment to Lifetime Learning, comes as
both Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, and the Labour party are
looking at ways in which individuals can be encouraged to take more control
of their own learning. The government prefers voluntary incentives while
Labour, which is developing its training policies, is examing whether it
should be obligatory for employers to open an individual training account
for employees requesting one.
The report from the Tec working group, which has been submitted to Mr Hunt,
concludes that individuals play only a minor role in managing their own
learning and that without increased commitment from individuals the UK will
not improve its skills levels sufficiently quickly to meet international
competition.
At present most learning is carried out within the formal educational system
and is undertaken when people are below the age of 22.
The report recommends:
An awareness-raising campaign to highlight the importance of lifetime
learning and the benefits it can bring in terms of job security, career
opportunities and pay.
Tax-free savings accounts for individuals.
Better access for high quality information and advice. Educational providers
to be more flexible in offering training which meets an individual's work
and social needs.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Executives 'prefer more pay to perks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most executives value salary increases far more than perks when changing
jobs, says a survey carried out by a leading recruitment company.
Responses from 146 job applicants canvassed in a survey of recruitment
trends carried out by KPMG Search and Selection, a recruitment services
company, found that 63 per cent of them said they would prefer to have the
equivalent increase in salary instead of some or all of the perks on offer.
The benefits they considered most important were non-contributory pensions,
company cars and healthcare. Those they thought least important were longer
holidays.
Subsidised mortgages, once considered an important benefit among banking
employers, were considered of no great value, reflecting the lower mortgage
interest rates.
Mr Tony Saw, a search and selection specialist and author of the report,
said: 'Perceived changes in the taxation of benefits have meant that perks
have lost some of their appeal. Where once the company car was considered
all important, there has now been a shift to pensions.'
The survey also found that 82 per cent of the respon-dents believed that
their sector was still suffering from the recession.
Just over half of them did not have private pension schemes and most thought
legislation should be introduced to ensure that companies contributed to
personal plans if they were offering non-contributing schemes.
Two-thirds of the respondents said that they had received unsolicited
approaches from search consultancies and on average each had received four
approaches.
The most important factor influencing decisions by people to join a company
was its prospects.

Directors of some of Britain's largest quoted companies are facing the
embarrassing prospect of PosTel, the investment management group, voting
against them at annual meetings this summer.
Inquiries by the Financial Times show that directors of at least four
companies in the FT-SE 100 will have PosTel voting against their election or
re-election at AGMs next month.
The first high-profile case is likely to be Mr Sipko Huismans, chief
executive of Courtaulds, who is up for re-election on July 19.
Last week PosTel's chief executive, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, said that the
fund management group would be voting against the election and re-election
of directors who had rolling employment contracts longer than two years.
The announcement followed mounting frustration among institutional
shareholders over pay outs of up to three times basic salary to directors on
three-year rolling contracts who are forced to resign.
A fund manager said yesterday: 'It is going to be a long hot summer for some
of the City's biggest names.'
There are at least 133 directors from 29 companies in the FT-SE 100 who are
on three-year rolling contracts. These include 13 executive directors at
Unilever and seven at Tesco, where chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin faces
opposition to his contract from PosTel.
There are seven directors on three-year contracts at Glaxo, including Sir
Richard Sykes, chief executive. The company was yesterday unable to say
which of the directors would be standing for re-election at this year's AGM.
PosTel says that in the past year several large companies have moved from
three-year contracts to two years.
At National Westminster Bank the three-year rolling contracts of Mr Derek
Wanless, chief executive, and five other directors will end in two years'
time and be replaced by one-year rolling contracts.
Of 51 FT-SE 100 companies approached, at least 12 do not have any directors
on three-year contracts.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Employers warned on attendance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers may be breaking the law if they force workers to take holiday or
unpaid leave because of travel disruption caused by the rail dispute, the
Industrial Society warned today.
The society, an independent advisory and training body and an authority on
employment practice, urged employers to be 'firm, but fair' about
absenteeism caused by the strikes.
It said it had heard of several cases where workers had been told that they
should take a day's holiday or unpaid leave if they could not get to work
because of the strikes.
Ms Sonia Pearson, personnel expert at the society, said: 'Bosses who are
forcing workers to take holiday, or even unpaid leave, on days when they
genuinely cannot travel to the office could be breaking the law if this
power is not included in their employment contracts. As well as creating
ill-will they are not solving the immediate absence problem.'
She added: 'But that does not mean they should tolerate absences from people
who could make it to work with reasonable effort - and employees have a duty
to make every effort to come to work, which includes finding alternative
routes.'
The society suggested ways that absence could be reduced, including
contributing to extra expenses incurred by staff who made the journey into
work, such as parking fees or taxi fares, so long as they had been agreed in
advance.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Rail talks possible today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks on the rail dispute are likely to resume today at the offices of Acas,
the conciliation service. A further 24-hour shutdown of the network is due
on Wednesday.
Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for the railway
infrastructure, told Acas officials yesterday that it was ready to restart
negotiations with the RMT, the transport union. The signalmen's dispute has
already cost taxpayers Pounds 24m. The company said it was keen to discuss
the restructuring pay offer for signalmen that was presented at Acas last
Monday, even though it was rejected as 'derisory' by union officials. The
company said: 'We want to discuss our offer in more detail.'
The RMT, which starts its annual conference in Liverpool today, was cautious
last night. It said delegates would decide this morning whether the union's
negotiators should return to Acas.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the situation was 'difficult and
delicate'. Union officials remain pessimistic about an early breakthrough in
a conflict that has brought two one-day rail stoppages.
They believe that there cannot be any basis for settlement until Railtrack
addresses the need for an interim pay rise for signalmen for past
productivity improvements.
Railtrack, which is chaired by Mr Robert Horton, still appears to insist
that any increase for the signalling workers above the 2.5 per cent general
pay rise offered must come through a negotiated package of restructuring
measures including job evaluation, more flexible hours and changes in
working conditions.
Railtrack denied suggestions at the weekend that it made the wrong pay offer
to RMT negotiators last Monday. The company said the view that it had made a
mistake was 'taken out of context'. It added that the only pay figures at
the negotiations which had not been revealed in detail were for relief
signalmen, and RMT officials had been told that these would result in
increases of up to 15 per cent.
However, the continuing confusion over details of Railtrack's offer is bound
to increase criticisms of what many believe to be the incompetent way in
which it has handled the issue.
The RMT is threatening to take legal action against Railtrack over the use
of untrained managers to operate signals during the previous one-day
strikes.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Investors scheme set to appeal on court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An emergency board meeting of the Investors Compensation Scheme is expected
to take place this week, amid concern that a Court of Appeal ruling last
Friday could put the scheme's future at risk.
The ICS is likely to decide soon to seek leave to appeal to the Lords
against the terms of the judgment that it was wrong to use its discretion to
limit the amount of compensation paid to investors in home income plans.
What particularly concerns the ICS are the wider implications of the ruling,
which requires the scheme to take all relevant factors into account for each
case, in the same way that a court would.
If the implications of the judgment stand, then the scheme might be
vulnerable to challenge on all the awards it has made - about 6,700.
An ability to exercise discretion in determining a formula for awarding
compensation - for example, in deciding the dates from which claims would be
payable - was written into the ICS rules. The scheme, which is funded by a
levy on the financial services industry, was set up in 1988 to provide a
safety net for investors who are entitled to redress but find that the firm
responsible for their predicament has gone out of business.
Last week's judgment could mean that the scheme has to pay a further Pounds
20m compensation on top of the Pounds 22.5m it has paid to almost 2,000 home
income plan investors. The ICS believes that as well as the potential costs
resulting from a review of other awards, higher administration costs would
be incurred in moving to a more legalistic scheme as a result of the
judgment.
New funding arrangements for the scheme are due to come into effect from
mid-July following a review by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog. Financial services companies will no longer have to
bail out companies in other sectors of the industry that are unable to meet
their liabilities to investors.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Tighter absence controls revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have tightened absence controls because of government moves to
shift the cost of sickness benefit from the state to employers, says an
independent employment agency.
Incomes Data Services has found that in spite of government assurances that
lower National Insurance contributions would compensate for the higher
burden on employers of sick pay, many employers still feared that they would
be be inadequately re-imbursed.
The report adds that while a Confederation of British Industry report found
that the cost of absence to UK businesses was Pounds 11bn last year,
equivalent to eight days per employee, companies believe that fear of
redundancy is maintaining a downward pressure on absences.
The report recommends that companies establish formal absence policies
alongside the compilation of regular absence statistics.
Some companies, such as Kodak and Yorkshire Chemicals, have introduced
attendance bonuses for their workforce. Employees at Yorkshire Chemicals can
receive an attendence bonus of up to Pounds 210 a year.

FT  27 JUN 94 / CSA slow in responses to MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy over the operations of the Child Support Agency deepened at the
weekend when it was disclosed that the organisation had recorded the worst
performance of any Whitehall organisation in providing punctual answers to
MPs' questions.
According to official figures Ms Ros Hepplewhite, CSA chief executive,
received more than 2,000 letters from MPs in the eight months after the
agency was set up in April last year. She replied to only 13 per cent of
those letters within the 20-day target which had been set for her by the
government.
Ms Hepplewhite's rate for answering correspondence, which was revealed in a
written parliamentary answer from the Office of Public Service last week,
was well below the performance of any other government department or agency.
The Home Office recorded the next worst rate, completing 25 per cent of its
replies last year within a tougher target of 15 days. But most other
organisations - such as the Ministry of Defence, the Benefits Agency or the
Department for Education - managed to deliver more than 70 per cent of
replies within the time allowed.
The CSA, which is responsible for ensuring that absent fathers provide
maintenance payments to their former wives, has been the subject of more
complaints in MPs' postbags than any other issue.
Its poor record in collating and providing information has forced MPs to
call for a 'root and branch' examination of the way the agency conducts its
operations. There is particular concern that the organisation failed to meet
its deadline three months ago for the publication of an annual report.
The Commons social security committee has already started a new
investigation into the agency's performance, and plans to publish a report
in the autumn.
The government has not ruled out the possibility of introducing primary
legislation to reform the CSA.

Women may have to wait until the year 2025 before they earn the same pay as

FT  27 JUN 94 / Labour has slight Monklands lead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is fractionally ahead of the Scottish National party in the Monklands
East by-election, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The
by-election in the constituency near Glasgow, caused by the death in May of
John Smith, takes place on Thursday.
The poll for the Sunday Mail put support for Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour
candidate, at 45.1 per cent, with that for Mrs Kay Ullrich of the SNP on
43.2 per cent. Support for the Conservatives was 4.3 per cent, and that for
the Liberal Democrats on 0.6 per cent.
Last week a poll in the Scottish Daily Express put the SNP in the lead with
42 per cent and Labour 38.7 per cent, although the candidates discounted it
as its sample size was 400. The Sunday Mail's opinion survey was conducted
by telephone among 1,000 people on Thursday and Friday.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary and front runner for the Labour
leadership, will visit the constituency today.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Economy to grow 'steadily' to 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steady economic growth in the next few years, driven by stronger commercial
investment, is envisaged by Cambridge Econometrics, an economic consultancy,
in its latest set of forecasts issued today, Peter Marsh writes.
Consumer spending will remain restrained partly because of the tax rises
announced last year. Export growth will be fairly high as a result of
general economic expansion across much of the developed world.
Cambridge Econometrics expects gross domestic product to increase 2.8 per
cent this year, stabilising at 2.5 per cent in 1995 and 1996. Investment
growth will average 4 per cent a year between this year and 1996, while
consumer spending will slow by the end of this year as the tax increases
bite.
The consultancy says inflationary pressures will increase as the economy
expands, with the retail prices index increasing to 4.4 per cent next year
after 2.9 per cent this year.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Different keys to
Eurovision theme songs - Peter Martin on national views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What are the corporate qualities that Europe's business leaders most admire?
The Financial Times/Price Waterhouse survey asked top managers to name the
competitors they most respected on seven factors of business performance,
and to list the qualities that contributed to this excellence.
Their responses give a unique snapshot of the qualities important to
business success in the 1990s. Each category has its own surprises.
Companies best show they are focused upon their customers for example, by
demonstrating that their customers are loyal. At least, that is so for
British managers. Their response is enough to take customer loyalty to the
top of the ranking on this issue, overall and in those industry sectors in
which British companies are strongly represented.
But managers from other countries placed less emphasis on customer loyalty:
only in Sweden was the British view shared.
Germany and Switzerland plumped for customer service, which was the
top-ranked quality in nearly half the industry sectors; France and the
Netherlands went for good communications with customers. Managers in Italy
put good use of technology at the top of their list of qualities, a view
shared by the electricity, media, oil and gas industries.
There was less national polarisation on the second category: people. In
France and the Netherlands, satisfied, loyal staff was most important; in
Britain and Italy, this lagged behind giving people the means and facilities
to deliver results.
In Germany training was the most important people factor, a view shared by
many industry sectors. But all respondents believed that progressive
childcare policies and demonstrating 'real' equal opportunities mattered
least.
The answers in the third category, which asked for the company with the best
products and services, produced one very surprising result. In almost every
country, investing heavily in R&amp;D was seen as making little contribution to
product excellence; quality also made little impact. The most important
issue, in most countries, was meeting real market needs.
In Britain, perhaps reflecting industry's traditionally concentrated
structure, market leadership was seen as most important. This view was also
shared in industries in which volume is critical (such as food processing
and commercial banking).
Despite the negative attitude to R&amp;D, technology was not ignored: making
innovative use of technology was seen as the most important product issue in
Germany and Switzerland, and it also scored well in Italy.
Unanimity reigned on the factors contributing to outstanding business
performance. In almost every country and industry sector, consistent growth
and long-term profitability was the best definition of performance. More
unexpected, was the general view that being a low-cost producer was not a
particularly important contributor to outstanding business performance.
Among industrial sectors, only cars and beverages put low costs as a high
contributory factor to business performance. Perhaps Europe's top companies
are more vulnerable to low-cost competition than they realise.
There was also clear agreement on qualities that make the most important
contribution to leadership: displaying a positive management style.
Germany and the Netherlands, perhaps reflecting the way business works in
these two countries, gave equal weight to communicating the company's aims
and making sure they were shared by everyone from the top down.
Taking a strong position on social issues came bottom, almost everywhere.
What is the most important element in giving a company an effective
strategy? As in the leadership category, clear policy and objectives came
top in almost every country and industry; responding to the market needs of
the 1990s came next.
There was much emphasis on seizing opportunities in the emerging European
market. But, perhaps worryingly, the rest of the world seemed less
important. Only British managers seemed to care about doing business on
several continents, though a handful of industries across national
boundaries from insurance to engineering shared the view.
Only in Italy (and in the oil and gas sector) were managers expected to have
knowledge of international markets.
There was little enthusiasm for the seventh category, in which managers were
asked to nominate the company which cared most about the environment.
However, a clear trend was evident: managers think of good environmental
behaviour primarily in terms of production processes, not packaging or
product design.
Thus, investing in pollution control measures came top in most countries,
while reflecting environmental policy in products, packaging and the like
came bottom.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: The inside story of a
model multinational - Ian Rodger explains how ABB has grown into the largest
power engineering group in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardly a week goes by without ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss
international engineering group, being cited as the model multinational
industrial enterprise of our age.
Management consultants, economists and social scientists swarm around it,
studying it, testing their hypotheses and searching for clues to emerging
trends in company development. Journalists besiege it for interviews,
knowing that anything ABB says will be read eagerly throughout the world.
In many respects, ABB is the model multinational. It operates in 140
countries and carries out core product development, as well as
manufacturing, in at least a dozen countries. Its ownership and top
management are increasingly international.
Earlier this year Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, wrote in the FT about
the need to build multinational teams for a global company. 'As business
gets more globalised, the competitive advantages of multinational teams
increase. Any single-nationality corporate culture will run into problems as
soon as it aims to integrate larger operations from other countries,' he
said.
'At the same time, we strive to develop a global corporate culture for all
members of our multinational teams. One key element is having a common
language. English was chosen at the outset, although a minority of the
present 218,000 employees have English as their mother language.
'Today, all executives use English as their common language and ABB's
currency for global reporting and consolidation is the US dollar. Most
importantly, from the very beginning ABB established a common set of values,
policies and operational guidelines to safeguard and promote a group-wide
umbrella culture.'
Even ABB's choice of Zurich as a headquarters, only a short flight from
every major centre in Europe and with efficient access to every continent,
reflects the company's multinational thinking.
ABB was formed in January 1988 from the 50/50 merger of Asea, the Swedish
electrical engineering and robotics group, and Brown Boveri, the Swiss power
engineering and railway equipment makers.
The main shareholders of both groups recognised that moves to privatisation
and deregulation in many countries would mean an international restructuring
of their main businesses was inevitable.
Only the biggest and strongest would survive the shakeout and Asea and Brown
Boveri recognised they had little chance alone. Together their chances would
be greatly enhanced, with Mr Barnevik, who had already established an
international reputation at Asea, as chief executive.
Mr Barnevik recently divided the development of ABB to date into two phases.
The first, from 1987 to 1990, he said, was dominated by acquisitions to give
the group critical scale in the biggest markets while taking out excess
capacity.
By far the most important were the 1989 acquisition of the power
transmission and distribution operations of Westinghouse Electric and the
takeover of Combustion Engineering.
Through these operations, the group acquired a US base with sales of Dollars
5bn and a competitive nuclear power generation technology.
Since 1991, the group has been in a consolidation phase, although
acquisitions have continued to figure prominently, with a special emphasis
on central and eastern European countries. Also, a new business development
thrust in the fast growing Asian countries was launched.
Overall group employment has stabilised at just above 200,000, although this
has been the net result of massive acquisitions offset by redundancies
averaging 1,000 people a month last year.
This and an annual turnover of Dollars 28.3bn last year makes ABB the
largest power engineering group in the world, and one of the most widely
spread. A little over half of 1993 group revenues came from western Europe,
nearly a quarter from Asia and a fifth from the Americas.
Profits, after doubling in the two years following the merger, stagnated at
the beginning of the 1990s, last year reaching Dollars 1.19bn before taxes
and extraordinary items. However, through rationalisation, ABB has managed
to turn a Dollars 2.1bn net debt at the end of 1990 into a Dollars 242m net
liquid position at the end of last year.
Mr Barnevik's initial management approach was to push operating
responsibility down to the operating units and eliminate intermediate layers
of control. In doing so, the group created some 5,000 profit centres.
Executive board members carried both divisional and regional
responsibilities in the now conventional matrix structure.
However, last year he modified this structure significantly, reducing the
number of divisions, or segments as ABB calls them, from seven to five and
undoing the matrix at executive board level.
The idea, he said, was to improve the group's ability to respond with all
its resources to customer demands for large, complex system projects.
Although still a young group, ABB has already developed a unique corporate
culture, where nationality no longer determines an employee's prospects.
The one glaring deficiency in the structure is its capital. ABB is still
owned entirely by Asea and BBC. While both the Asea and BBC shares are
quoted and are much more widely held than they used to be, group executives
believe that its credibility as a multinational would be greatly enhanced by
a conversion of these into ABB shares.
There are significant technical and legal difficulties in achieving this,
largely because there is no ideal jurisdiction in which to base a
multinational entity like ABB, and the dominant Swedish and Swiss
shareholders of Asea and BBC do not want to lose their influence.
But Mr Barnevik believes it will happen in the next few years, a period he
calls the 'the expansion phase'. This phase seems to have got under way in
the first quarter of this year, with a 20 per cent surge in pre-tax profits
to Dollars 246m.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Some kind of
misunderstanding . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surprisingly few companies actually declined to take part in the survey.
There were, however, one or two notable replies, writes Paul Taylor.
For example, the chairman of one large British building materials group said
he could not complete the questionnaire because he did not know enough about
his competitors across Europe.
Meanwhile, the chief executive of another British-based company said it was
group policy not to take part in such surveys. Nevertheless, a completed
questionnaire was received from the same group's finance director.
Response rates, both positive and negative, also varied quite markedly
between sectors.
The highest response rates - of up to 50 per cent - came in the beverages &amp;
tobacco and automobiles/auto trucks &amp; parts categories. But response rates
in the steel &amp; metals processing and household, textiles &amp; clothing sectors
only made it into the mid-teens.
In addition, with almost 2,000 senior executives from Europe's largest
companies asked to 'vote' on their peers, there were a few
misunderstandings. For example, several returned questionnaires were ruled
invalid because respondents voted for their own companies.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: 637 companies judge their
competitors - Peter Martin outlines how the survey was conducted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The survey was conducted by selecting the largest companies in Europe. To do
this, we started with the FT 500 list of Europe's 500 largest publicly
quoted companies (measured by market capitalisation), then searched other
databases to add large privately-owned and state-owned companies.
To ensure that the exercise was a true pan-European survey, we compared each
country's number of companies with its share of European gdp. Where
countries were under represented, we searched out and added more companies.
The final list - 637 companies - strikes a balance between representing
countries fairly and ensuring that all participants are large, well-known
companies.
The companies were then divided into industry sectors, starting with the
classification used for the FT 500, but amending it to amalgamate some of
the smaller sectors. The aim was to produce sectors in which all the members
would see each other as competitors. In most, though not all, cases this aim
was achieved.
Some companies are significant players in a number of fields - this was
found particularly in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sectors. In this
first year of the survey, it proved too complex a task to include companies
in more than one sector, although a small number of exceptions were made -
in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and household sectors, where some
duplicate listings were allowed.
Once the sectors were chosen, we wrote to the chairman, chief executive and
finance director of each company, asking them to name their most respected
competitors from the list we provided of companies in their sector. The
letters and accompanying questionnaires were in the main European languages.
The questionnaires asked executives to vote for their best (and, if they
wished, the second-best) company/competitor from the list, judged on seven
factors of excellence: customer focus, people, products and services,
business performance, leadership and management, strategy, and environmental
issues.
We encouraged them to indicate the qualities which contributed to these
judgments. We also asked them to nominate the European company they most
respected, regardless of industry sector.
To improve response, we followed up with reminder letters and phone calls.
At the end of the exercise, we were confident that the letters had reached
the appropriate people, and that where no reply had been received it was
because it was not company policy to reply, or because, as one executive put
it 'I don't know enough about my competitors to answer'.
Once answers had been received, we entered them into a database and carried
out a number of analyses, of which some of the results are shown on these
pages. A few industry sectors produced relatively poor responses, and were
omitted from the detailed analyses.
The selection of the two winning companies was based on their clear lead
over their rivals in the overall voting, within their sectors, and on each
of the seven dimensions of excellence.
Though both companies won votes from outside their home countries, Marks and
Spencer had particularly strong support in the UK. ABB attracted a diverse
spread of voters.
As the table shows, most of the top 25 companies were able to draw on
substantial cross-border support.
The top 25 companies, almost all of them household names, are drawn from
nearly every country in western Europe, and represent a wide range of
industry, management styles, and approaches to business.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Customer loyalty and
clear policy top agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's most respected companies include a retailer which has stuck to its
core business and an international engineering group largely created over
the past six years.
Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer, almost a national institution
in Britain, and ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the pioneering Swedish-Swiss
multinational industrial group, emerged as clear winners when top executives
were asked to identify their most respected European companies, regardless
of sector.
Both companies won the praise of their peers, in particular for their
leadership and management qualities. ABB's supporters highlighted the
group's strategy, while M&amp;S's customer focus attracted much support.
M&amp;S received particularly strong backing from UK-based respondents, while
ABB won more broad-based support from executives across Europe. Both
companies obtained the most votes from companies in their respective
sectors.
The survey asked senior executives in each sector - chairmen, chief
executives and finance directors - to identify their most respected
competitors on seven dimensions of excellence: customer focus, staff,
products and services, business performance, leadership and management,
strategy, and environmental issues.
Respondents were invited to identify the qualities behind these judgments
and to nominate the European company they most respected overall.
Because this is the first peer group survey of its kind in Europe,
year-on-year comparisons are not possible. In addition, response rates in
some sectors, for example steel, property and entertainment sectors, were
low and have been excluded from the sector results.
The questionnaire was sent to 637 companies, achieving a response rate of
around 30 per cent, relatively high for a postal survey. There was a
slightly higher response from the UK. Since the results are based on the
views of those executives who did respond, they are impressionistic rather
than scientific.
Nevertheless the results, which span 17 different sectors and nine countries
across Europe, provide a unique snapshot of senior management attitudes and
current thinking, providing some important insights into which qualities
Europe's business leaders most admire.
In particular the results highlight the willingness of many senior
executives to vote for companies outside their countries.
Italian and French executives tended to vote for international companies,
suggesting a more pan-European focus. British and German executives were
more inclined to vote for their domestic counterparts.
A wide range of companies qualified for accolades. The overall top 25
companies irrespective of sector, include world-class competitors from most
industry sectors and eight nations.
Nine of the top 25 are based in Britain, four each are French and German,
three are Swiss, two are Belgian and two of the top five, Royal Dutch/Shell
and Unilever, are Anglo-Dutch.
Only one of the top rated companies - Virgin, the UK-based airline and
entertainment group run by Mr Richard Branson - is not a quoted company.
Another, L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, is quoted but
majority controlled by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of the group's
founder.
Some, like British Telecom, the UK-based global telecommunications group,
have made the transition from government ownership to the private sector
quite recently.
Forty per cent of the top 25, including three financial stalwarts - Deutsche
Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland and Zurich Insurance - are in service
sectors, but the top 25 also includes heavyweight industrial players such as
Rolls- Royce, Bayerische Motoren Werke, GEC and Siemens. Significantly most
of the top 25 companies also headed the lists for executives' most respected
companies in their own sectors, often by a large margin. For example, Royal
Dutch/Shell, Unilever and Roche were all clear winners in their respective
sectors.
There were, however, surprises. For example, Reuters topped the media sector
by a large margin, but did not appear in the top 25. Neither did Philipp
Holzmann, which won the construction, homebuilding and building material
group, or Muenchener Ruckversicherungs Gesellschaft which led the insurance
sector.
In general, respondents indicated the winning companies showed a commitment
to their shareholders, customers, and employees.
The most frequently cited qualities across all sectors were consistent
growth and long-term profitability, clear business objectives and high
customer loyalty.
At the other end of the scale, demonstrations of commitment to equal
opportunities, progressive qualities regarding childcare and taking a strong
position on social issues earned little praise. Perhaps more surprisingly
investing heavily in research and development also came low down the scale
of respected qualities.
Some cited characteristics stand out at country level. Customer loyalty was
the most valued quality in the UK, but came lower down the scale of
priorities for respondents from the other large European countries. Growth
and profitability was the most important attribute for respondents from
Germany and France, and ranked second in the UK and Italy, but came eleventh
in Spain.
A satisfied staff was rated the most important in the Netherlands and was
high on most other country lists. But it was not regarded as being
particularly important in either the UK or Italy.
Training and development was rated as the third most important quality in
Germany, but was only tenth for UK respondents. Providing staff with the
resources to deliver high quality services and products was the top
attribute in Italy, and fourth in the UK, but was less important in France
and Germany.
At sector level it was harder to draw firm conclusions. Nevertheless the
survey produced some surprising and some predictable results.
For example, it was predictable that customer loyalty was the most highly
valued attribute in the retail sector and came first or second in
construction, engineering and food processing industries. Customer service
ranked as the most important or second most important attribute in the
banking, chemicals, electronics and telecommunications.
However, although research and development was rated the joint top attribute
in pharmaceuticals it hardly received a mention in other sectors. The use of
technology was the number one attribute for the media sector and ranked
number three for telecommunications, but was lower ranked in other
industries.
More predictably pollution reduction was judged to be the most important
factor for companies in the construction, electricity and water, and oil and
gas sectors.
Significantly in those sectors which are undergoing substantial regulatory
change or technological development - for example electricity, water, and
telecommunications - adapting to the needs of the 1990s was the top rated
quality.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Value added policies
bring big benefits - Glen Peters on the key messages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GLEN PETERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The theme which unites the winning companies in our survey and earns them
the respect of their European peers is a commitment to their shareholders,
customers and employees.
The message which emerges is clear - if you can enhance value for each of
these 'stakeholder' groups you will earn a prize. But if you can use the
principle of value enhancement to drive all your operational, investment,
and financial decisions then you will earn the glittering prize.
Enhancing value for its stakeholders is one principle that drives M&amp;S.
'Value for money' is delivered to the customer by a business strategy that
creates the greatest cash value for the shareholder. The recent 'outstanding
value' sales campaign exemplifies M&amp;S's ability to meet the needs of both
customers and stakeholders: it raised turnover by 10 per cent, year-on-year,
without an apparent reduction in margins.
Higher returns, lower risk and more rapid growth are used by Percy Barnevik
and his team at ABB to create value for their stakeholders. Shareholders
benefit from a continuous push into growth markets, a focus on reducing
fixed costs and reductions in net debt.
Customers receive an unusually high level of customer service; and employees
benefit from the devolution of responsibility which is a hallmark of
Barnevik's strategy.
M&amp;S and ABB have distinctive leadership and management styles which receive
much praise from their peers. Their success highlights the message that
delivering value to stakeholders is intrinsically linked to sound
management.
In ABB's case, this is a decisive vote for the company's 'matrix' management
structure, which allows Barnevik to manage a business with 200,000 employees
from a head office of only 150 people. Top management must not only allocate
resources and resolve conflicts, but also create a common purpose, challenge
the status quo and stimulate corporate renewal.
Elsewhere in the rankings, information technology has propelled Reuters into
the 'most admired' category. Some 90 per cent of the group's revenue now
comes from financial information and transaction products. Reuters' dominant
position in the dealing rooms of the world's financial centres has been
gained through aggressive acquisitions, strong market positioning, advanced
products and buoyant cash generation. It is a recipe for gaining and
retaining the commitment of the company's stakeholders.
Shell's positive attitude to its stakeholders has also received strong
endorsement in the survey. The company's position is strengthened by strict
debt control and commitment to targets of 14 per cent return on capital
employed and and 12 per cent return on investment.
British Airways' customer service record helped make it the overall winner
in the transport sector. BA is also committed to its employees: mechanisms
such as regular employee surveys give staff a say in how the business is
run.
At Unilever, co-chairman Sir Michael Perry says shareholder value is high on
his list of priorities. The group's strategy - attacking the cost base,
focusing corporate resources more tightly, and innovating in brands - earns
it strong endorsement from its peers in the food and drinks sector.
Brands are also essential to BMW, which tops the automotive sector. Its
brand image of high quality and high performance is a symbol of its
commitment to its customers. Brand strategy will be the key to its
relationship with newly-acquired Rover - the two brands will be kept
distinct and will be developed independently.
BMW may be a better-known brand, but Siemens is German industry's
bellweather. Many of its divisions operate in depressed markets, and the
growth rate of its biggest market, telecoms, will slacken as the initial
stages of wiring up East Germany are completed. But the company retains the
admiration of its competitors in the electronics sector.
In the banking sector Deutsche Bank is most respected by its peers for its
overall business performance and market leadership. With over half its
shareholders outside Germany, and with strong local subsidiaries in in
Spain, the UK and Italy, Deutsche Bank must successfully address the
interests of a wide-spread group of European stakeholders.
The message of the survey is that the most successful top managements now
judge their business decisions by the value that they create, and that they
are judged in turn by their ability to deliver value to their stakeholders.
For those who wish to join the select ranks of Europe's most respected
companies, the message is equally clear: to aspire to this list, you must
identify the key factors that add value to your business, and make them work
for you.

<TEXT>
Europe's business leaders choose the competitors they most respect, in a
survey by the Financial Times and Price Waterhouse. This two page special
report reveals the top 25 companies, from six countries and 17 sectors. The
survey throws up some intriguing themes. Europe's top business people are
increasingly prepared to look across borders in search of competitors to
emulate - and rivals to fear. But national business cultures still vary in
the emphasis they place on different qualities. German companies place more
emphasis on training, for example, British companies on market leadership
and France on keeping staff happy. Overall, the survey offers, perhaps, the
first clear snapshot of Europe's new business pecking order. And the winners
are . . .

FT  27 JUN 94 / Europe's most respected companies: Three-P principles pull
M&amp;S through - People, property and product have proved their worth over the
decades for the British retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer's chairman Sir Richard Greenbury does not have much time
for modern management gurus. He is more likely to turn for inspiration in
running his company to one of his heroes, former US president Harry S
Truman.
Part of the reason could be that Truman was a man after the spirited M&amp;S
chairman's own heart: 'He was feisty. He said what he thought.'
Perhaps more importantly, Sir Richard regards a passage in Truman's memoirs
summarising his thoughts on running large organisations as one of the best
management texts ever written. Truman, like Sir Richard, thought management
was largely a matter of good sense. Running a country was little different
from running any large body.
Marks and Spencer has had a century to shape its philosophy and style. It
has stayed close to its founders' principles.
The company grew out of a market stall in Leeds, northern England, set up in
1884 by a Polish-Jewish immigrant, Michael Marks. Ten years later Marks
moved to Manchester and went into partnership with a Yorkshireman, Tom
Spencer. They founded a string of Marks and Spencer's 'penny bazaars', with
the slogan: 'Don't ask the price, it's a penny'.
From market stalls to shopping arcade stores, the business evolved into a
chain of department stores and later into the familiar format offering
clothing and food.
The business was driven forward by a partnership between Michael Marks' son
Simon and Israel Sieff in 1915. They ran the company as a chain of stores
until the 1960s and laid the foundations underpinning today's success.
One was a policy of acquiring freehold and long leasehold properties.
Another was cutting out wholesalers and middlemen to buy goods in bulk
direct from manufacturers. A third was an emphasis on quality and
innovation.
As Simon Marks said in 1936: 'Efficient distribution is not a static
conception. It involves constant alertness and study of the changing habits,
desires and tastes of the consumer.' He might have had difficulty grasping
the scale of the company today. It has 354 stores, 72 of them in seven
countries outside the UK, as well as owning Brooks Brothers in the US and
Japan, Kings supermarkets in the US, and the D'Allaird's chain in Canada. It
also has 76 franchise stores in 18 countries. M&amp;S employs 62,000 people, and
made profits last year of Pounds 851m on sales of Pounds 6.54bn.
The guiding philosophy has changed little from Marks' time. Sir Richard sums
this up as 'giving customers the best value for money - that is the price
paid in relation to the (quality of) the good - and the best service.'
Sir Richard acknowledges his debt to his predecessors. He summarises the
strengths of Marks and Spencer as 'the three Ps' - people, property and
product.
M&amp;S has a reputation for taking on young people, training them, and keeping
them. Sir Richard joined at 16 and many of its senior executives are
career-long employees.
Staff are wrapped into a corporate welfare and benefits system which
includes competitive pay, and a non-contributory pension scheme which costs
the company Pounds 50m a year.
Sir Richard says M&amp;S promotes young talent and attempts to nurture
'mavericks and entrepreneurs'.
One of the company's most valuable legacies is a property portfolio of which
93 per cent is freehold or long leasehold - a great asset when many
retailers are struggling to pay rent.
The policy of buying freeholds continues today.
'Buy a prime freehold site and get the business right,' says Sir Richard.
'If you don't get it right, it's still a prime freehold site, and you can
sell it and kiss it goodbye.'
The third 'P' - product quality - is inextricably linked to Marks and
Spencer's relationship with its suppliers, regarded by many as the most
important feature setting it apart from its rivals.
M&amp;S was one of the first retailers, in 1935, to set up its own
quality-control and research laboratories. It specifies stringent standards
to its suppliers, many of which it has been dealing with for decades.
At the same time, by buying early in large quantities, it can get very good
prices. M&amp;S has a reputation for being a tough negotiator; Sir Richard says
it is hard, but fair.
Fairness, he adds, is another guiding principle. 'If I was asked the two
qualities that mean most to me, I would say integrity and fair dealing were
number one. Number two is courage, not physical courage, but courage to make
decisions and get on with things.'
The company's reputation for integrity - exemplified by its policy of paying
suppliers within 20 days and food suppliers within 10 days - is one of the
factors that has enabled it to expand into other areas such as financial
services.
As for courage to get on with things, M&amp;S is planning a Pounds 1bn
investment programme over the next three years to increase its UK floorspace
and expand its overseas operations. Its main targets are France and Spain,
south-east Asia where pilot stores have proved successful and, eventually,
Japan and China.
The pace of expansion will, however, be measured and will be through organic
growth and franchising, not through acquisition. Marks and Spencer has had
less than happy experiences with acquisitions. Its acquisition of Brooks
Bros in the US and Japan is regarded as a rare mistake. Many retail analysts
believe M&amp;S paid too much (Dollars 750m) for a business which is yet to
match the performance of the rest of the group.
As the business expands, Sir Richard says another principle will guide his
strategy. It is a principle he illustrates by reference to another of his
passions - football. 'I used to love the Brazilians, and I still love my own
team Manchester United, because they have a belief that winning is very,
important . . . but if you win with a bit of style it helps.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / Political turmoil averted in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico averted a political crisis yesterday when Mr Jorge Carpizo, Mexico's
interior minister, agreed to withdraw his resignation that was submitted on
Friday.
Mr Carpizo had resigned after denouncing the 'most diverse sectors' in
politics who opposed democratic reforms. But President Salinas rejected his
resignation, and after two days of talks, persuaded him to stay. Most of
Mexico's political parties and scores of non-partisan groups had urged Mr
Carpizo to change his mind.
As interior minister, Mr Car-pizo heads the Federal Electoral Institute, and
has had a key role in government efforts to persuade the opposition and
public the presidential vote would be fair and credible.
Officials argued the wide backing given to Mr Carpizo has led to an
strengthening of his authority, which will make it more difficult for
hardline factions in both the governing and opposition parties to sabotage
the August election.
However the resignation calls attention to the fragile unity in the ruling
party, and potential for further upsets before or after the election. Mr
Carpizo is allied with the party's reformist wing, and there seems little
doubt that his frustration with conservative elements in the party played a
part in his decision to quit.
Mr Carpizo blamed a particular party for failure to co-operate, but did not
name it. The government has insisted he was referring to the leftist Party
of Democratic Revolution, but the opposition and many analysts argue he was
alluding to the governing party.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Hebron report urges segregation at prayers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jews and Moslems should be completely segregated at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs in Hebron, where 29 Palestinian worshippers were murdered by a
Jewish fanatic four months ago, and Jewish worshippers should be banned from
carrying weapons at the site, an Israeli inquiry into the massacre
recommended yesterday.
The Commission of Inquiry, which investigated the February 25 slaughter at
the Hebron mosque, cleared the government and senior military and police
officers of any personal blame for the incident, which inflamed Arab-Israeli
tension and delayed implementation of the peace process.
The inquiry said Dr Baruch Goldstein, the man who fired 111 bullets into
Palestinians kneeling in early morning prayers and was then beaten to death
by survivors, acted alone - contrary to the testimony and allegations of
several Palestinian witnesses. The five-man commission blamed insufficient
security precautions, indiscipline of Israeli guards at the mosque and poor
co-ordination between police, border police and the Israeli army.
The Ibrahimi mosque, once a gothic crusader church, was built on the site on
the Tomb of the Patriarchs or Cave of Machpelah - the traditional burial
place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham (Ibrahim), Isaac and Jacob and is
intensely holy to both Arab and Jew.
The report was welcomed by the cabinet, minister of police and army chief of
staff but condemned by the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
'I don't think that the act in the Hebron mosque was an individual act,'
said Mr Nabil Shaath, Palestinian 'minister' for international co-operation.
'The Israeli government and the policy of (Jewish) settlement carry complete
responsibility for this ugly crime.'
Hebron municipality, which described the report as a 'whitewash' also
accused the Israeli government of continuing to 'oppress' Palestinians by
refusing to re-open the mosque and the central market.
Col Moshe Givati, former army commander of Hebron, also questioned the
report. 'The commission points at a series of faults but finds no-one
responsible - this is impossible,' he told Israel radio.
However, by recommending segregated prayers and prohibiting Jews carrying
weapons the commission clearly points to the fallacy which underlined
Israeli security operations at Hebron: that Jews were at risk from Arab
attacks and not vice-versa.
'It was never expected that a Jew coming to pray at the mosque would open
fire on Palestinians,' said Gen Shlomo Gazit, former military co-ordinator
in the occupied territories. Gen Gazit said the military and police had
never made contingency plans for such an event because it could not have
been foreseen.
However Gen Gazit, who was in charge of Hebron when Jews first re-settled
there after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, said: 'The writing was on the wall
for a long time. If you allow two different religions to pray in the same
place and these two religions are in a political, ideological and religious
conflict then this calls for trouble.' Gen Gazit said he personally
recommended that new security precautions be taken at other religious sites
where Jews and Moslems mingle such as the Temple Mount in Jerusalem; the
ancient synagogue in Jericho and the tomb of the prophet Samuel.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Hutus see France as their saviour: The intervention force's
arrival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A notice at the border post between Bakavu in eastern Zaire and Cyangugu in
south-western Rwanda, one of the last remaining bastions of the country's
Hutu government and army, reads:
'Attention Zaireans and Bantu people] The Tutsi assassins are out to
exterminate us. For centuries the ungrateful and unmerciful Tutsi have used
their powers, daughters and corruption to subject the Bantu. But we know the
Tutsi, that race of vipers, drinkers of untrue blood. We will never allow
them to fulfil their dreams in Kivuland.'
Those crowding around the border post nod their heads in agreement. They
have welcomed with open arms the French intervention force which began
deploying last week. Red, white and blue bunting festoon the dusty town of
Cyangugu. French flags flutter from cars and mopeds.
'The French have come to save us from the (Tutsi-led rebel) Rwandan
Patriotic Front,' says a local craftsman. 'The RPF is the army of the
Tutsis. They kill their president and now they want to kill all Hutus who
wield power.'
Less than 10 miles away, French troops guard the last 8,000 Tutsis who
remain in the locality. It is not known how many were killed in the 10 weeks
of slaughter that followed President Juvenal Habyarimana's death in an air
crash in April. The first French forays into western Rwanda have uncovered
mass graves. In the village of Shangui, women were washing blood stains off
the walls of a parish church.
The refugee camp at Nyarushishi sits among tea plantations. The makeshift
shelters cling to the steep slopes like rows of terraced tea bushes.
'When the killings began,' says Mr Claude Bavugameshi, who is tall and
desperately thin. 'We took refuge in Cyangugu parish. The mayor said he
could protect us here, so we were taken to the stadium. Later, the mayor
came with soldiers and a list of people, who were taken away. The mayor and
the soldiers came three more times. Always they took people away. The last
time we rioted, that is why we are in this camp.'
Despite the French presence, Hutu government soldiers and gendarmes still
patrol the camp. Voices drop to a hush when they approach. The refugees fear
the would-be Hutu protectors, who, until last week, would turn a blind eye
when Hutu militia raided the camp.
Since the arrival of the French five days ago, the militias have melted into
the background. Road blocks and the menacing guards have disappeared.
The classification of western Rwanda has made the intervention of a few
hundred French troops appear devastatingly simple. But the change is
deceptive.
The French presence may act as a deterrent to further killings, but the gulf
that separates the Hutus in Cyangugu from the Tutsis at the refugee camp
cannot be bridged by a foreign intervention force alone.
The Hutus' welcome is based on a misunderstanding: they regard the French as
their allies, not as the neutral humanitarian force they profess to be.
Having propped up General Habyarimana's military government for years, the
Hutus clearly expect the French to push the rebels, who control two thirds
of the country, back into Uganda.
Even if the French expedition avoids taking sides in the conflict, their
presence in western Rwanda may act as a buffer force between retreating
government troops and the rebel advance.
At the camp, the refugees worry about what will happen to them when the
French leave. Rather than salvation, the Tutsis fear they have only a brief
reprieve.

FT  27 JUN 94 / US 'blacklist' worries world shipowners: Dangers and
confusion arising from listing sub-standard ships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A crackdown on substandard shipping by the US Coast Guard is provoking
concern among the world's shipowners.
Some are worried that the 'blacklist' of companies whose vessels have been
targeted for special safety checks when they enter US waters does not
distinguish between serious offenders and those caught for minor problems.
They are also concerned that the list, compiled for internal use by the
coast guard but available to any inquirer under the US Freedom of
Information Act, could be commercially damaging. Shipowners not on the list
see it as a means of gaining competitive advantage.
The International Chamber of Shipping, based in London, said that the
principle of targeting substandard ships had been accepted in many countries
but that publicly naming offenders had to be undertaken carefully when it
could have commercial repercussions. 'It's a bit like reporting a road
transport company because one of its lorries had a puncture,' said Captain
John Joyce, marine manager.
The coast guard's initial list was compiled in May and comprised 120
companies whose ships were to be targeted for special checks. A revised
list, which with 137 names, became available last week.
Fears about the threat to the marine environment following the grounding of
the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989 prompted the
tougher action by the US authorities, and a number of other countries have
plans to introduce 'blacklists'.
The coast guard's current list includes several well-known shipping
companies as well as many smaller owners, managers or operators. One of the
companies to appear on the list is Shell International Shipping, which has a
fleet of about 70 gas carriers and oil tankers.
Shell was put on the list because one of its gas carriers was found to have
two four-inch cracks in its deck after a rough Atlantic crossing. 'This was
very minor stuff,' said a spokesman. 'It was not structural and we repaired
it in situ. Our vessels are maint-ained to a very high standard and we would
say we are extremely responsible owners.'
The similarity of many names in the shipping industry has also led to
confusion with Worldwide Ship Management, a South American company which
appears on the list, being mistaken by some readers of the list for
World-Wide Shipping Agency, a Hong Kong group, which does not.
The coast guard uses a unique identifying number for every company but this
does not appear on the published lists.
'This was intended to be an internal document to help our marine safety
officers use their resources better,' said Commander Peter Popko, a senior
US coast guard official. 'We should not be boarding vessels with a good
history. Because of the Freedom of Information Act the list is available to
the public.'
The coast guard believed its list was based on sound information but, if new
evidence emerged, it would be willing to adjust its programme, he said.
'This has been running for less than two months and we are getting more
information and feed-back from the industry.'
Some companies on the first list had been taken off the second if they had
been able to show they were not the owner or manager of the vessel when the
infringement occurred.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Police facing crutch dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Security precautions have been intense at each of the nine World Cup venues.
There have been no reports of hooliganism - feared by officials - but a ban
on taking flag-poles and other sharp objects into the
stadiums has not proved successful. New Jersey police have noticed a rise in
leg injuries among spectators.
'People are coming through the gates on crutches, then pulling their flags
from their underwear and flying them from a crutch,' said police spokesman
John Hagerty. 'And we can't do anything,' he said. 'You can't take a guy's
crutches away from him. He might really be injured or disabled.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: S American giants on target for final
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil and Argentina have never met in a World Cup final, but their form
indicates that they may be on course for a meeting in Pasadena on July 17.
Both won their first two games convincingly. If they continue to win, they
will avoid each other during the three knock-out stages that stand between
first-round qualifiers and the final.
Diego Maradona, Argentina's born-again star, is producing his best form
since guiding Argentina to World Cup victory eight years ago. Argentina meet
Bulgaria in their final Group D game on Thursday.
Tomorrow, Brazil - who have already thumped Russia (2-0) and Cameroon (3-0)
 -play Sweden in Group B.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Charlton set for a seat in the stands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's soccer association announced it would not appeal the decision to
ban coach Jack Charlton from tomorrow's make-or-break Group E clash with
Norway.
Charlton has battled officialdom for most of his career, but has always had
a reputation for fairness. But Fifa, soccer's governing body, was becoming
more and more irritated by his whingeing and his behaviour at the World Cup.
Result: banishment from tomorrow's game - Charlton is free to watch it from
the stands - for shouting at officials.
He was also fined 20,000 Swiss Francs (nearly Pounds 10,000) as was the
Irish FA. Ireland player John Aldridge was fined 2,500 Swiss Francs for what
Fifa called 'ill-mannered behaviour' during last Friday's 2-1 defeat by
Mexico in Orlando.

FT  27 JUN 94 / G7 faces hard time to keep the lid on the Dollars: FT
reporters look at the likelihood of upsets this week in world currency
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PETER JOHN and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Group of Seven leading industrial nations has 11 days to stop the dollar
drama turning into a crisis.
As G7 leaders approach their annual summit in Naples at the end of next
week, they want to avoid any perception in financial markets they are unable
to arrest the fall against the D-Mark and Japanese yen of the world's
leading trading currency. But on the evidence of last week the G7 - US,
Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada - will have its work cut
out.
Heavy intervention on Friday by most of the G7 central banks, backed by
central banks in other European countries, failed to lift the dollar from
its lacklustre position against other main currencies.
On Friday night in New York the dollar closed at Y100.525 against the yen
and DM1.584 against the D-Mark, below the levels at which the central banks
first intervened earlier that day. Since the first week of June, the dollar
has slipped about 5 yen - last week briefly passing under Y100 - and 8
pfennigs.
Many investors believe Friday's efforts to buy dollars led by the US Federal
Reserve will have to be repeated early this week, perhaps today, in a
further show of strength to prop the ailing currency.
But in both the US and Europe, currency analysts said negative sentiment
toward the dollar had taken root. 'I don't think anyone wants to hold a buck
right now,' said a dealer at a Japanese bank in New York. Mr Stephen Lewis,
research director at London Bond Broking, a securities dealer, said: 'The
dominant mood in the market is that the dollar has further to fall.'
Behind these thoughts is that the Fed is judged unwilling to consider a rise
in short-term interest rates to defend the dollar. Such a move could
jeopardise the US recovery, the main drive behind signs of stronger economic
conditions throughout the industrialised world.
Meanwhile, the perception has grown that the Bundesbank is unlikely to
continue cutting short-term borrowing rates, because of signs of economic
pick-up in Germany.
As a result, many think the gap between short-term interest rates in Germany
and the US is about to widen, after months of general narrowing. At present
three-month interbank rates in Germany are about 4.9 per cent and in the US
about 4.6 per cent - the further they move apart the more incentive
investors have to hold D-Marks.
Also holding back the dollar against the yen is the large Japanese current
account surplus with the US and lack of progress in trade talks between the
two countries.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank,
said last Friday's intervention had at least succeeded in dispelling doubts
about the intention of US authorities and G7 partners to quell currency
instability. 'It's hardly the last word: there is likely more action to
come,' Mr Lipsky said.
But the chances of success of further rounds of intervention are open to
question. One European monetary official said much Friday's support for the
dollar was 'pretty much token', coming after years of general lack of
concern in the US about dollar weakness. 'Unless the Americans back up
intervention with a policy action (an increase in interest rates) the moves
won't have much impact,' he said.
A further question mark can be raised over the willingness of the Bundesbank
to join large-scale operations to boost the dollar. Any action by the German
central bank to buy dollars for D-Marks risks an increase in the German
money supply, playing havoc with the M3 money-supply calculations the bank
uses to judge economic conditions. For this reason there is 'general
scepticism about the Bundesbank's willingness' to intervene, according to Mr
Gerry Holtham, chief European economist at Lehman Brothers.
Nervousness over the dollar is expected to continue to spill over to world
bond and equity markets, which were fragile last week on fears about how an
increase in US interest rates could endanger signs of global economic
recovery.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said even if US
borrowing rates went up, the same would not necessarily have to happen in
Europe. But he added: 'In 13 years I have never seen a situation where the
bond markets were more lacking in confidence than they are now.'
He said pressure on the dollar was exaggerated by many investors'
over-enthusiasm for the US currency last year. They had built up large
stocks of dollars and were now keen to sell. And he believed that although
Japanese institutional investors had cash to invest, many had seen the value
of their overseas holdings whittled away by currency shifts and were no
longer prepared to buy foreign exchange assets. 'The Japanese are the buyers
of last resort and if they don't come in (to support currencies) this can
cause problems,' Mr Bootle said.

FT  27 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Still hot, but with dull patches - Jurek
Martin in Washington forecasts some tighter games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Cup is now 10 days old, and still it beguiles. In fact it beguiles
so much that it is only right and proper to make the case that it is far too
good to last.
The beginning of the downhill slide appeared to have come last Thursday
night when, after 16 matches, a goal-less draw finally took place. The fact
that it was between South Korea and Bolivia, loved only by their mothers,
and that there has not been one since, might seem to suggest an aberration,
but there are other bits and pieces of evidence, m'lud.
The earlier game that day - Italy vs Norway - was pretty dour stuff, too,
obscured by the fact that the Azzurri eked out a 1-0 win while playing
three-quarters of the game with only 10 men and without Roberto Baggio,
withdrawn from the field in either the bravest or dumbest coaching decision
of the World Cup. Norway's lack of imagination was conspicuous.
A day later, Mexico (two) and Ireland (one) managed to double the goals
(three) previously scored in Group E. But, allowing for the unquenchable
enthusiasm of Irish and Mexican fans in the Florida heat, there was simply
not enough in the match to dissuade the neutral observer from going for a
beer or checking out Wimbledon on the cable channel. (Brazil, on present
form, would never drive anyone to drink - except Champagne).
The battle of the European flatlands - Belgium vs Holland - on Saturday only
produced one goal. As such games go it was pretty good, but you could sense
that the two sides would probably have settled for neutralising each other
if they had not been neighbours in competition for the next presidency of
the European Union.
The first-round matches, when one loss does not necessarily mean
elimination, have enabled some sides, especially those with everything to
gain by holding nothing back, to play out of their socks. The prime example
has been Switzerland, with a World Cup history as memorable as its national
political system (favourite trivia question: name any Swiss politician). But
several other teams, including the US and Saudi Arabia, have exceeded all
reasonable expectations.
As the tournament progresses, however, playing to entertain may take second
place to playing not to lose or to win by the necessary minimum, especially
if the heat does not abate. Germany have already done this twice while
Argentina, looking better all the time, came out for the second half against
Nigeria determined mostly to sit on a one-goal lead.
Admittedly, the number of red and yellow cards handed out so far - an
average of 3.8 per game for a mere felony, plus seven capital offences, and
almost all to defenders - ought to give offensive teams an edge, which was
doubtless the intention of Fifa, soccer's governing body, in its
instructions to referees.
But most of the 22-man squads are loaded with interchangeable midfield and
defensive parts, which is why Baggio was considered expendable when his team
fell a man short.
Nor has the World Cup yet produced great contrasts in styles. Most teams now
play a similar sort of game, chasing everything, mixing long and short
balls, trying to get out wide for the cross, bringing up tall defenders for
corners and free kicks. Even Brazil's methodology conforms to type, though
they play it better, while Nigeria's variation is only that, when allowed,
they counter-attack at warp speed.
Virtually no tactical innovation has been unveiled here. Even Maradona's
dead-ball artistry, especially with the quickly-taken free kick, has been
seen before, though perhaps not in Greece or Nigeria.
This may mean that, as the competition gets tighter and as teams lose the
capacity to surprise that comes with unfamiliarity, conservatism will
prevail. And that implies duller matches.
After all, at this level, soccer is a game played by professionals who are
not in the business of being embarrassed or outwitted. The same applies to
US sports. Baseball regularly introduces young phenoms who start out
blasting home runs or striking out batters by the dozens.
But the old pros sooner or later sort most of them out, discovering their
weaknesses: that they cannot hit breaking balls or that they fall into a
predictable pitch pattern. There are enough good soccer brains around to
apply similar lessons, as the Swiss did to Gheorghe Hagi of Romania, for
example, simply denying him the ball in forward positions in the second
half.
Exceptional performers can rise above all this, and it may help if a player
or three imposes himself on the tournament - as Moore and Charlton, Pele,
Beckenbauer and Maradona have in the past. Romario, Bebeto, Dunga, Rai and
Leonardo have all shown this ability to transcend but unfortunately, for all
except Brazilians, they play for the same team.
Even the poor Russians solved most of the problems posed by Romario by
clutching his shorts, shirt, neck and ankles and assuming the wall would be
enough to block the subsequent free kick. It may not have been edifying but
only twice, when Romario escaped to score himself and when he was fouled
inside the penalty area, did the tactic fail.
So, unpopular as the proposition may be, m'lud, it could be that the World
Cup has passed its high-water mark. The US team might not progress much
further, thus diminishing domestic interest, as might not the Irish, thus
lessening brewers' interest. The fans could start getting antsy, too, as
they did in Los Angeles after Mexico-Ireland (luckily the game was played in
Florida).
And here is an heretical thought: the World Cup has been great so far in
mostly awful hot weather, but relatively cooler fronts are rolling in. What
if it turns out that soccer is only played at its best in extreme heat? The
prosecution rests.

FT  27 JUN 94 / US court backs property rights
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court has given new weight to the rights of property with a
ground-breaking decision to limit local governments' power over private
landowners.
In upholding shop-owner Mrs Florence Dolan's lawsuit against the town of
Tigard, Oregon, the court ruled that governments must prove that the
planning requirements they impose on landowners must not only be related in
nature to some legitimate public purpose but that also must be 'roughly
proportional' in their impact.
Mrs Dolan had challenged Tigard's demand that, in return for permission to
double the size of her plumbing and electrical supply store, she set aside
roughly 10 per cent of her property to building a storm drainage system and
a bicycle path.
The 5-4 vote revealed one of the principal fault lines between the court's
right and left wings, and greatly increases the importance the justices
attach to the 'takings clause' of the constitution, which prohibits the
taking of private property for pub-lic use without just compensation.
'We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a
part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment,
should be relegated to the status of a poor relation,' wrote Chief Justice
William Rehnquist in the majority opinion.
The First Amendment's right to freedom of religion, speech and association
and the Fourth's right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures
have generally ranked higher in the court's priorities.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing in dissent, said the court's right-wing
majority had broken 'considerable and unpropitious new ground'.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Diary of Japan's descent to chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sequence of events in which Japan's politics have slipped from stability
into chaos, and which culminated in Saturday's resignation of Mr Tsutomu
Hata's minority coalition, began in the late 1980s.
A series of scandals caused the splintering of the Liberal Democratic party
(LDP). Following defeat in a no- confidence motion the LDP lost its overall
majority in elections last July, bringing to an end its 38-year rule.
Since then, coalition governments have grappled with the problems of
political reform, foreign relations, and the longest recession since the
second world war in a climate of almost perpetual crisis.
1993
August - Japan New party leader Morihiro Hosokawa, committed to political
reform, chosen as prime minister at the head of a seven-party coalition,
including the socialists.
November 18 - Bills aimed at reforming Japan's corrupt political system
passed by Lower House of the Diet and sent to Upper House, where they are
bogged down in controversies over budget and foreign calls for the opening
of Japan's rice market.
1994
January 20 - Reform measures passed by Upper House committee, and sent to
full session.
January 21 - Full Upper House votes down reforms, watered-down version later
passed with LDP backing
February 4 - Hosokawa suddenly announces new 7 per cent consumption tax to
finance proposed income tax cuts designed to lift economy out of recession.
Forced to withdraw plan five days later.
February 11 - Trade summit with US President Bill Clinton ends in failure
after Hosokawa rejects US demands to set numerical targets for opening up
Japanese markets.
March - LDP blocks tax-cutting budget in attempt to force Hosokawa to clear
doubts over a shady 1982 loan he is alleged to have used for a political
campaign.
April 8 - Hosokawa resigns abruptly to take responsibility for parliamentary
deadlock and for questionable management of his personal funds in the 1980s.
April 25 - Tsutomu Hata of the Japan Renewal party elected prime minister
with Socialists' help. Later that day they leave coalition in protest at
what they see as efforts to marginalise them.
April 28 - Hata forms Japan's first minority government since 1948.
June 23 - With tacit backing of LDP and Socialists, budget is passed. LDP
immediately submits no-confidence motion.
June 25 - Hata announces resignation of cabinet.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Peking to speed up HK port dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has told Britain that it will give urgent attention to proposals made
at last week's Sino-British talks for a HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 857m)
extension to Hong Kong's container port.
The colony possesses one of the world's busiest container ports, but the
construction of the ninth terminal (CT9) has been delayed because of the
poor atmosphere surrounding Sino-British relations. The consortium building
CT9 has also been engaged in negotiations with the Hong Kong government over
the price and terms of land acquisition.
The consortium, which includes the trading houses Jardine Matheson and
Hutchison Whampoa, was locked in dispute with the government over who would
be responsible for access roads and bridges to CT9. Both sides were trying
to get the other to shoulder the cost.
However, company executives said that signs of improvement in Sino-British
ties, which have been evident since the spring, encouraged the consortium to
reach agreement with the government so that an agreed position could be
presented to China for approval. Details of this agreement are not available
but one company executive said details of the land grant had 'substantially
been agreed'.
China's undertaking to deal expeditiously with CT9 might emerge as the only
real progress made during the 29th meeting of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
Its meeting was dramatically suspended on Thursday until today to allow the
two sides to reach an agreement on the transfer of military land.
However, it is unclear whether a marathon session of talks at the weekend
narrowed the differences between the two sufficiently. Officials said talks
would continue this morning.
A failure to agree will inevitably raise doubts about China's recent
overture to Britain to improve relations. But whatever the result of the JLG
talks there remains a general expectation that Sino-British ties will
improve after the Legislative Council (LegCo) votes this Wednesday on
Governor Chris Patten's democracy proposals for the conduct of the colony's
1995 elections.
The vote by members of the 60-strong assembly is expected to be very close.
Over the weekend an aide to Mr Patten said the government was certain of 26
votes and was confident of three or four others.
But the governor is taking no chances. He has been actively lobbying LegCo
members for support and will do so right up to the vote. Senior members of
the Liberal party, a conservative group which wants to water down his
proposals, have also been trying to win support. Mr Patten attacked the
Liberals' proposed amendments, suggesting they would lead to elections which
could be rigged.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Afghans exchange one hell for another: The fighting has
created thousands of refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kutub Khan, his wife and their four small children have spent the last
month in a shelter made of sheets in a refugee camp in the sweltering heat
of eastern Afghanistan.
Around them are hundreds of other make-shift shelters and thousands of
tents. The rocky ground is so hard it takes five men a week to dig a
latrine. Nothing thrives in this desert except scorpions; there are no
trees, no shade from the sun and no escape from the wind. Children die daily
from dysentery and malaria.
'It's very hard to live in the open,' says Mr Khan, who cannot find space
for his family in a tent. 'But we don't see any hope of going back home.'
Relief agencies estimate there are about 150,000 refugees in and around the
town of Jalabad. Most have fled the latest outbreak of fighting in Kabul,
the capital, which began on January 1. The rest have come from other parts
of Afghanistan. As Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the UN secretary general's
personal representative for Afghanistan, says: 'You can imagine how hellish
conditions must be, if people are ready to come to these camps to escape the
fighting and to get food.'
Hard as life is in the battle zones of Kabul and elsewhere, it could soon
get worse. Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, the president whose writ does not extend
much beyond his ruined capital, is due to step down tomorrow under the terms
of a power-sharing accord reached two years ago with rival mujihadeen
leaders. But he is refusing to go - to the intense anger of Mr Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, the nominal prime minister and head of mujihadeen forces trying
to wrest Kabul from the control of Mr Rabbani and his military chief, Mr
Ahmad Shah Masood.
Mr Hekmatyar told journalists in Jalabad this month that he still wants a
peaceful settlement. 'But if the other side insists on staying in power that
will mean war.' Mr Rabbani has said he cannot quit until there is peace and
has condemned Mr Hekmatyar as a 'warmonger'.
Anxious to avoid further destruction, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN
secretary general, is trying to bring Afghan leaders together for talks
through a mission headed by Mr Mahmood Mestiri, the former Tunisian foreign
minister, who visited Afghanistan last month. But he has yet to find a
formula acceptable to the rival warlords and Mr Hekmatyar, for one, views
the initiative with deep suspicion.
Only five years ago, Afghanistan was the focus of world attention. But after
the Soviet invaders marched home in 1989 and the communist government they
left behind collapsed in early 1992, international interest has waned. But
the fighting has not. About 4m out of a population of 20m are still living
outside the country, principally as refugees in Pakistan and Iran. Three
accords between the nine warring mujihadeen factions - Peshawar 1992,
Islamabad 1993 and Jalalabad also 1993 - have failed to end the civil war.
While Soviet troops were in Afghanistan, the fighting was mostly in the
mountains and the villages. But after they pulled out the mujihadeen pushed
into the cities, dividing up territory between them, according to their
regional strengths. The main issue their bloody battles have been unable to
resolve is control of Kabul, a pleasant city of 1.5m which was mostly intact
when the Soviets left. Today it is a collection of battered ruins - at least
10,000 of its inhabitants have been killed since 1992, including over 2,500
this year. About 500,000 have fled their homes, 300,000 hiding in the city
and the rest mostly in the camps around Jalabad.
The city is being defended in Mr Rabbani's name by Mr Masood, the defence
minister, who inherited much of the Communist army's supplies. They are
financed principally by shipments of Afghan currency from Russia, where it
is still printed - much to the annoyance of Mr Rabbani's enemies.
The chief attacker is Mr Hekmatyar, the leader of the Hezb-i-Islami
guerrillas, the favourites of Pakistan and the US in the war against the
Soviet forces. Late last year, Mr Hekmatyar scored a coup by persuading
General Rashid Dostum, master of the Uzbek minority in northern Afghanistan
and a former ally of President Rabbani, to change sides and bring his troops
into the battle for Kabul. But the tactical advantage was eroded earlier
this year when Gen Dostum's forces lost control of Kabul airport in fierce
fighting with Mr Masood's men.
Outside Kabul, power is largely in the hands of local warlords such as Mr
Ismail Khan, an ally of Mr Masood, who has brought a measure of peace to the
western oasis of Herat, and Mr Abdul Qadir, governor of Jalalabad in the
east, which lies across the main road from Kabul to Pakistan. In the
countryside, particularly in the mountains, power is fragmented even further
 -a few villages can make a man important, as long as he has guns. These men
take money from wherever they can, notably from the fast-growing heroin
trade.
It is hard to see what can bring an end to this anarchy. With its complex
mix of tribal and ethnic groups, Afghanistan has never been a strongly
united country and Afghan leaders have often been quick to settle their
disputes by fighting. The involvement of the Soviet Union and the US in
their wars has left them with an enormous arsenal with which to pursue their
quarrels at the expense of people like Mr Khan and his family.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Bureaucrats cling to power: Tokyo civil servants believe
reform will fail to curb their role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
At a meeting with journalists earlier this month, a senior bureaucrat at one
of the more influential ministries was asked whether the current political
uncertainty in Japan was adversely affecting the execution of policy.
The facial expression of pained bewilderment at the naivete of the
questioner was more eloquent than the answer itself: 'The government may
change,' responded the nation's servant, 'but the policy remains the same.'
It was a disarmingly candid admission, even from a Japanese bureaucrat. But
in the current crisis, it neatly highlights the largely unchanged
distribution of power in the Japanese political system.
The collapse of 38 years of Liberal Democratic party rule last summer was
thought by many to herald also the end of civil service power. The new prime
minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, pledged to redress the balance between the
bureaucrats and elected politicians. In the years of LDP rule a cosy
proximity had built up between the ministers and the functionaries who
nominally served them.
With ministers moving rapidly between jobs, often in place as a result of
political favours rather than talent or experience, the scope to dominate
was considerable for the bureaucrats - a highly educated cadre.
But the end of the LDP hegemony has not brought with it a substantial
decline in the bureaucrats' power. Some even argue that it has been
enhanced. In the words of one political analyst: 'The political crisis has
distracted the politicians from the business of governing; the bureaucracy
has been left to get on with its own business of running the country.'
The Ministry of Finance sits at the pinnacle of the country's power
structure. Mr Jiro Saito, the respected vice-minister (the top civil
servant), at the ministry has spent most of the last year fighting for an
increase in consumption tax to offset the fiscal effect of the large income
tax cuts that take effect this summer.
His attempts to secure the tax increase were rebuffed in February when the
socialists (then members of the coalition) resisted it.
But Mr Saito continued the battle, and last week he was reappointed for a
rare second year in his post. Few of his colleagues expect the ministry to
lose.
But bureaucrats do not enjoy untrammeled power, as Mr Saito's earlier
setback suggests, and some analysts believe their role is about to diminish.
Mr Douglas Ostrom, at the Japan Economic Institute, points out: 'Bureaucrats
disagree with one another and are reluctant to initiate substantial policy
shifts on their own - politicians need to do the dirty work of brokering
agreements and selling proposals.'
And the long-awaited deregulation of Japan's economy will take away many of
the bureaucrats' functions. So far, however, there has been little
substantive progress in translating the widespread desire for deregulation
into action. And only those measures with the bureaucrats' blessing have
been enacted.
The political reforms enacted in the last year may yet also bring about a
decline in the ministries' power. When an election is held under the new
rules the current instability may give way to a government, legitimised by a
majority, and committed to reform.
But the bureaucrats are, as yet, untroubled. They accept the arguments for
political and institutional reform, but they do not believe it will
seriously diminish their role. Their justification is simple: the system
works. They played a big part in bringing about the Japanese economic
miracle and, though tarnished of late, they argue the miracle is still
intact.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Pakistan business strikes over budget's tougher tax regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A patchy two-day business strike began yesterday in Pakistan with many
stores, offices and factories shut down but public transport and most small
shops staying open.
The FPCCI (Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry) -
Pakistan's largest business organisation made up of some 120 trade
associations and 30 business chambers, called the strike to protest against
the budget, announced earlier this month. Businessmen oppose the
government's plans to introduce a general sales tax, new excise duties on an
ad valorem basis to be collected by tax officials with the powers to search,
and other measures making stringent demands on those who query their tax
assessments.
In Karachi, Pakistan's business capital and Lahore, the country's second
city, factories and large offices were closed, but small shops ignored the
call to strike. The Karachi Stock Exchange, which had announced business as
usual, closed for an hour because of the absence of jobbers but then
officially reopened despite lack of business. The smaller Lahore and
Islamabad bourses remained officially open but trade was negligible.
The FPCCI warned it would consider further measures to press its case, later
this week. 'We will continue our protest. . . We will not sleep after these
two days,' said Mr SM Muneer, federation president.
The Pakistani government has taken a tough stand against the FPCCI and Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto suggested over the weekend that the strike was in
part politically motivated. Some senior government officials accuse Mr Nawaz
Sharif, the former prime minister, to have encouraged the business reaction.
'I appeal to professional businessmen who have no political affiliations to
think of the national interest' said Ms Bhutto. She defended the budget
measures and said: 'We cannot allow people to live in huge palaces and not
pay taxes.'
The new measures include a requirement that anyone appealing against their
tax assessment deposit 25 per cent of the assessed tax demand before court
proceedings begin. Senior officials justify the move on the grounds that in
order to restrain the growing budget deficit, the government must confront
the chronic problem of tax collection falling behind target. In the past,
taxpayers have been able to appeal against their tax assessment by paying a
nominal court fee. As a result, over 50,000 cases are awaiting verdicts and
the taxpayers involved owe some Rs10bn (Pounds 215m).

<TEXT>
An artillery barrage and air raids swept opponents of Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani from their last main position in Kabul yesterday, but
the opposition retaliated with bombing strikes on a western city, writes
Reuter from Kabul.
Officials and hospitals reported at least 28 dead and more than 210 injured,
most of them civilians, in two days of fierce battles in the capital, Kabul,
and the western city of Herat.
President Rabbani's fighters launched a relentless artillery and rocket
bombardment on bases of ex-communist Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum on Tapae
Maranjan mountain. Sporadic artillery fire continued to hit areas still
controlled by Dostum and Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami
forces on the southern and eastern outskirts.
Dostum retaliated, and two jets from his bases in northern Afghanistan
dropped eight bombs on the centre of Herat, 630 km west of Kabul. 'All
targets and casualties were civilians,' a UN official said.
Rabbani's government decided to launch its assault after reports that
Hekmatyar and his allies were preparing a similar offensive in the run-up to
the scheduled expiry of Rabbani's term in office tomorrow.

FT  27 JUN 94 / China opens shipping industry to foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is opening its shipping industry to foreign investors and is
liberalising access to ports as part of attempts to meet requirements for
entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Huang Zhendong, communication minister, said Chinese partners must hold a
majority stake in newly-formed ventures serving local waterways, and senior
posts must be held by Chinese.
Conditions for foreign investors seeking partnership in Chinese shipping are
similar to those being offered for civil aviation. Beijing announced earlier
this month that it would welcome foreign involvement with local airlines.
Mr Huang, quoted by the official China Daily, said foreign companies would
be allowed to become involved in cargo-handling at Chinese ports and would
also be permitted to operate some inland and coastal shipping routes.
Foreign companies could also set up wholly-owned agencies to canvas cargo,
issue documents and negotiate contracts for their ships. However wholly
foreign-owned businesses would be excluded from China's domestic waterways.
Foreign shippers and shipping agencies have long complained about China's
highly restrictive policies, including barriers to fair access to Chinese
ports.
China has also made it very difficult for foreign shippers to secure
contracts for mainland-sourced cargo. This has been the subject of repeated
representations by large shipping lines.
Mr Huang promised a 'favourable environment' for foreign investors seeking
opportunities in the development of China's wharves. But these ventures
which are vital to the national economy must have Chinese majority share.
China, which is seeking to become a founder member of the World Trade
Organisation when it comes into being next year. will this week step up its
efforts to meet Gatt requirements.
The Gatt special working group on China is due to convene in Geneva tomorrow
and Chinese officials hope these discussions will help expedite entry
negotiations.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Crime action splits Russians: Crisis decree could revive the
KGB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decree empowering Russian police to launch open warfare on organised
crime, which is due to come into effect today, is causing divisions among
politicians and intellectuals and raising fears that combating criminality
may lead to authoritarian rule.
The campaign was authorised by a decree from President Boris Yeltsin two
weeks ago and was deemed by the parliament last week to be unconstitutional.
However, General Mikhail Yegorov, the first deputy interior minister and
Russia's top official on organised crime, brushed aside deputies'
objections, saying they were acting out of self-interest.
'Checks on bank accounts will show what financial support certain
politicians have. It's only natural; they don't want this information made
public,' he said.
Mr Victor Stepashin, head of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service (FCS)
 -successor to the KGB - said last week: 'I'm all for the violation of human
rights if the human is a bandit or a criminal.' This view may be popular:
crime has long since topped the opinion polls as the issue of greatest
public concern.
The decree allows suspects to be held incommunicado for up to 30 days;
authorises searches of offices, flats and hotel rooms without warrants; and
gives police the right to look at bank accounts.
Even Mr Yeltsin has not tried to claim that it is constitutional - the
constitution, for example, allows a period of only 48 hours for being held
without charge. He argues that the clampdown is justified by the crisis into
which crime is plunging the country.
Its scale, in Russia and the other former Soviet states, is attracting great
international concern. Mr Louis Freeh, director of the US FBI, leaves today
for a 10-day trip to Russia and other east and central European nations for
talks on how to control the spread of crime - particularly theft of nuclear
material and drugs.
Commenting on Mr Yeltsin's decree, Mr Freeh said it attempted to hold back
'an avalanche of violent crime threatening the very structure of
government'.
US officials estimate Russian gangs have 100,000 members and are linked with
US, Sicilian and Colombian drug traffickers.
Mr Stepashin has claimed that foreign intelligence services - especially
those of the Baltic states - are using Russian gangs to destabilise the
Russian state. He claims that a decree, re-establishing the formerly banned
investigation department in the FCS, is awaiting presidential signature.
This would give the former KGB back many of its former powers.
Figures published by the Russian authorities over the weekend point to huge
rises in drug use and crimes. The figures show 1.5m addicts in Russia as
against 800,000 in 1992, almost a doubling in two years, and claim that 1m
hectares are now growing the hemp from which opium is made, while 400 farms
have been turned over to narcotic production.
While the decree and the activity are likely to be popular among people who
now witness both greatly increased violence and conspicuous luxury on the
part of criminals it is tearing politicians apart.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the reformist Yabloko faction in the lower
house, clashed angrily and publicly with Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St
Petersburg, at a World Economic Forum conference in Moscow last week on the
issue. The former claimed the president was tearing up his own constitution
and the latter defended the need for it before crime engulfed society.
Though Mr Yavlinsky claimed the prosector's office was 'in chaos' under the
twin pressures of a presidential decree on the one hand and a constitution
on the other, Mr Alexei Ilyushenko, the acting public prosecutor, appears to
support the decree.
'It is a question of whether the state can bring the Mafia to its knees  -
or vice versa,' he told Interfax news agency.

FT  27 JUN 94 / International Press Review: An event of less than summit
importance - Greece
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So thin was the Greek coverage of the Corfu summit that a reader flipping
the pages of an Athens tabloid could have missed it completely, despite
Greece's role as host. Even heavyweight newspapers were reluctant to let it
overshadow the weekend's main preoccupations: an imminent reshuffle of Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou's cabinet after the governing Socialists' poor
showing in the European elections; and a list issued by the Finance
Ministry, naming for the first time Greece's 200 worst tax offenders.
'All's well on Corfu - except for the succession,' headlined Kathimerini,
the heavyweight daily, adding that the European leaders' failure to agree on
a new Commission president was 'a blow to the already low stature of the
European Union'.
To Vima, the other sober Greek newspaper, focused on what it called Friday
night's 'political thriller' as Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's European
affairs minister, attempted in the early hours to steer through the
candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister.
The UK veto on Mr Dehaene provoked little comment. Only Kathimerini gave it
front-page coverage, saying that 'Britain torpedoed Mr Dehaene's election'.
Avgi, the left-wing daily, concluded: 'The complications in electing a new
Commission president indicate that the process of European unification will
be slowed down, and there could be a period of stagnation in EU activities.'
For the Greek tabloids, there was only one story from the summit: Mr
Pangalos's refusal to greet Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, at the signing ceremony for the EU's pact with Russia.
Ethnos, along with half a dozen other papers, gave a colourful account of
the 'the vendetta between Pangalos and Berlusconi'.
Eleftheros Typos described at length the efforts by Greek government
officials to cover up an embarrassing moment between the Greek Socialist,
who refused to greet the Italian right-winger, including the Foreign
Ministry spokesman's assertion that 'nothing like that happened'.
Several papers printed a picture, taken at the previous night's official
dinner and produced later by the Italian government spokesman. It showed the
burly Mr Pangalos gripping Mr Berlusconi's hand.
Mr Pangalos's gesture in refusing to greet Mr Berlusconi won approval from
most newspapers, which have given widespread coverage to the Greek
minister's criticism of Italy's neo-fascists.
But Eleftheros Typos's political column noted disapprovingly: 'Greece is
traditionally a hospitable country and Mr Pangalos should have been aware of
that. It's not a question of culture but of Greek social custom.'
However, opinions were mixed on whether Greece's six-month EU presidency had
proved successful.
Kathimerini concluded that 'in general, Greece not only responded to the
challenge of the presidency, but succeeded in changing the exceptionally
negative image that prevailed at the start of this six months.'
Concluding both the EU enlargement talks and the agreements with Russia and
Ukraine 'gave a boost to Greece's role on the European and international
scene at a time when the country was getting worryingly low ratings'.
But Apogevmatini, the conservative evening newspaper, maintained that the
summit 'revealed the nakedness of the Greek presidency, which was unprepared
on everything and made no attempt to promote issues of broader Greek
interest which are also of European interest. It has been a lost
opportunity.'
Kathimerini's opinion column added some advice for politicians and diplomats
handling Greece's disputes with its Balkan neighbours and Turkey, based on
watching the EU at work: 'Greece's foreign policy problems have to be
presented to international organisations on the basis of study, specific
plans and modern diplomacy. Our arguments must be realistic to presuade our
allies. A disjointed presentation of unyielding positions leads to failure.'
One achievement at the summit, hailed mainly on the econmic pages, was
Greece's inclusion in three projects in the EU's plan for trans-European
transport and energy networks. But several newspapers also ran gloomy
commentaries on Greece's revised plan for economic convergence with the rest
of the EU, announced just before the summit. Eleftheros Typos said: 'The
tragedy of the convergence plan is not just that it won't lead us to Europe
but that there will be four years of austerity in the meantime.'

FT  27 JUN 94 / Pressure on Spain to allow ferry line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Spain must this week respond to formal complaints by the European Commission
that it has disobeyed the rules and spirit enshrined in the EU's single
market in refusing a UK shipping company access to the ferry route between
Spain and Morocco.
The Commission has launched the first stage of infringement proceedings
against Spain following the country's refusal to allow Cenargo, the UK
shipping line, to start a car ferry service between ports on the southern
coast of Spain and Nador in Morocco.
Spain has until Thursday to respond to a letter sent by the Commission three
weeks ago, although the Spanish authorities were saying before the weekend
they had not yet heard from the Commission.
The case has been compared to the recent and much publicised British Airways
dispute with France over access to Orly airport in Paris.
Under single market regulations that came into force on January 1 1993, a
ship owner in one EU member state is allowed to start a service between any
other member state and a non-EU country.
But the Spanish Interior Ministry has blocked efforts by Cenargo to start a
service between Spain and Morocco since the UK shipping line - its arguments
now backed by the UK government - identified a gap in the North Africa
route, used regularly by thousands of EU-based Moroccans.
When Cenargo tried to sail from Nador to Almeria in May last year, it was
prevented from docking by armed Spanish militia and naval craft. Subsequent
attempts by Cenargo to start the service to the alternative Spanish ports of
Malaga and Alicante were also frustrated.
The Interior Ministry says neither Almeria, Malaga nor Alicante has
international port status and it is up to Spain to decide where its entry
points should be. It argues that none of the ports has the necessary
facilities for customs and immigration.
Cenargo points out that as late as summer 1992, a service operated between
Malaga and Tangier in Morocco, and Malaga remains a destination for a number
of international cruise lines.
The Spanish state-owned company Transmediterranea - now being prepared for
privatisation - has a monopoly on car passenger ferry services between Spain
and Morocco east of the straits of Gibraltar. All existing ferry services
dock at Melilla, the Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco, just 5km
north of Nador. A new service to Nador could deprive Melilla of much of its
trade.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Hungary parties agree coalition
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's new government of former communists and liberals passed its final
hurdle yesterday when assemblies of the Socialist party and Alliance of Free
Democrats approved a coalition.
In last month's parliamentary elections the Socialists gained an absolute
majority of seats. But the Socialists were aware of the concern aroused,
both internationally and domestically, by the prospect of one-party rule by
former communists, however reformed. The Free Democrats' nominal veto right
over government decisions acts as a safeguard of sorts that Hungary will
stick to its free market and western orientation.
The alliance gives the new government the broad support and legitimacy it
needs to implement austerity measures to deal with large budget and current
account deficits. The way is now clear for Mr Gyula Horn, 61-year-old leader
of the Socialists and former foreign minister, to be sworn in as Hungary's
prime minister and to appoint his cabinet in mid-July.
As expected, Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister in the last communist
government, will return to the post. With another Socialist nominated to the
Industry and Trade Ministry, the former communists are set to dominate
economic policy.
The new government plans to introduce protectionist measures to curb
imports. It promises bankruptcy law reform to keep companies alive if it
would cost more to close them, and rapid privatisation of banks and
utilities. That and the forewarning of energy price increases add to the
likelihood that the Dollars 1bn-plus sell-off of the power industry will go
ahead soon.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Any other business? Wider and deeper Union on the cards:
European leaders did make progress on non-Dehaene matters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the Corfu summit ended in ill-tempered chaos because of EU leaders'
failure to agree on a successor to Mr Jacques Delors, they did, amid the
Ionian splendour and balmy weather, get some work done.
The summit set an agenda for further 'widening' of the EU to east and south,
and set in train preparations for 'deepening' integration at the 1996
Maastricht review conference.
In the follow-up to the Delors White Paper on jobs, competitiveness and
growth, endorsed by last December's Brussels summit, the heads of government
signed up to a balanced package of 'an open economy. . . geared to
solidarity': flexible labour markets and deregulation on the one hand but,
on the other, assured finance for trans-European infrastructure and a 10-gun
salute for the elected works councils in pan-European companies that all
member states except the UK agreed to set up last week.
The summit began by putting in place four more building blocks in the
construction of post-communist Europe.
The leaders of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway signed their accession
treaties to the Union, aimed at bringing them in next year. Austrians this
month approved entry in a referendum, but the three Nordic countries still
face difficult plebiscites on membership this autumn.
The summit conclusions therefore devoted praise to the newcomers, 'in the
vanguard of the efforts to promote environmental and social protection,
transparency and open government, areas considered essential by a large part
of the Union's citizens' in this month's Euro-elections. The EU was
self-critical of its own feeble measures on open government, stating that
these 'require further elaboration'.
The partnership and free trade agreement with Russia signed at Corfu,
described by British Prime Minister John Major as 'the most comprehensive
agreement ever concluded between the Union and any other country', followed
the similar agreement signed with Ukraine in Luxembourg last week.
Unexpectedly, the 12 put a figure, of Ecu500m (Pounds 385m), on the aid they
are willing to provide Ukraine to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear plant and
replace them through the completion of three (rather than, as expected,
five) nuclear reactors already under construction. The controversial plan is
placed in the framework of 'adequate safety standards', effective measures
on electricity pricing, energy saving and alternative energy sources, and
the ratification of the Vienna convention on nuclear liability.
The Ecu500m looks like the opening EU bid, to encourage the US and Japan to
stump up serious funding for the plan at next month's Group of Seven summit
in Naples.
Third, the summit welcomed the membership applications this spring from
Hungary and Poland, and affirmed that the association agreements with these
two countries and the Czech and Slovak republics would be used to propel
them towards entry. The summit approved a similar agreement with Slovenia,
and set itself the goal of extending this umbrella eventually to the Baltic
states.
Fourth, and to the satisfaction of the EU's Greek hosts, the summit stated
that 'the next phase of enlargement of the Union will involve Cyprus and
Malta', subject to the resolution of the Cyprus conflict.
This is also subject to success in the 1996 constitutional review of EU
decision-making, presented at Corfu as a precondition for further
enlargement. To this end, the summit created a 'reflection group' to begin
work in June next year on 'the weighting of votes, the threshold for
qualified majority decisions, number of members of the Commission' and any
other reform 'deemed necessary to facilitate the work of the (EU)
institutions and guarantee their effective operation in the perspective of
enlargement'.
The main participants in this group will be named by foreign ministers of
the 12 and the Commission president. But Germany and the Benelux countries
overcame British and French objections to letting in the European
Parliament, two representatives of which 'will participate in'  - rather
than merely 'be associated with' - the group's work. Mr Kohl wants Mr Delors
to chair the group, a move likely to be resisted by the UK should the
outgoing Brussels chief assent.
In the White Paper discussion, the summit called for all increases in
productivity to the end of the century to be ploughed back into investment
and jobs, and more effort to reduce non-wage labour costs. Shifting some of
these costs on to the environment reappeared on the EU wish-list, with the
summit 'taking note' of the still stalled EU discussion on carbon and energy
taxes.
The conclusions endorsed a fast-track approach to liberalising energy and
telecommunications networks. It also agreed on a priority list of 11
trans-European transport links, including high-speed train links across the
channel, through Austria's Brenner pass, and from France south to Spain and
Italy and north to Germany. A list of energy projects will be studied
further.
The controversy over raising additional EU funding for these predominantly
privately or nationally funded projects appears more or less resolved. The
summit 'confirms that measures will be taken - if proved necessary - in
order that priority projects do not run into financial obstacles that would
jeopardise their implementation'.
This victory for Mr Delors was followed by two others: the reaffirmation of
the EU 'social dimension' as an indispensable corollary to the single
market; and the deal to name a minister in each member state responsible for
co-ordinating all aspects of information technology development, a main
theme of the white paper.
The deregulators, led by Germany and the UK, got their task force as well.
This will do a cost-benefit analysis of not only EU but national legislation
to weed out obstacles to jobs and competitiveness. But it will be run by the
Commission and can be expected to focus strongly on national red tape.
Looking forward to the successive German and French EU presidencies, the
summit endorsed the Franco-German call for a global strategy to combat
racism and xenophobia in Europe, with a timetable running up to next June's
summit.
The conclusions draw a veil over the Delors succession crisis, but note that
the recent Euro-elections gave clear warning that 'the Union will be judged
by its citizens' on the strength of the measures it takes to defend their
jobs and security.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Euro-sceptics warn PM to hold out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was unmistakeable euphoria among Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday over Mr
John Major's blocking of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the new EU president. But
there was also a warning for the British prime minister: he must be prepared
to use the veto again or risk losing their support.
Britain's Euro-sceptics, who outnumber Euro-enthusiasts in the Conservative
party, are delighted but could quickly turn on Mr Major if he allows another
federalist to take Mr Dehaene's place at next month's European summit.
Mr Michael Carttiss, a leading Euro-sceptic summed up: 'If in July the prime
minister gives way to another federalist he will be finished.'
It is a view also shared by some centrist backbenchers. 'If by standing firm
Mr Major secures the appointment of a president who is acceptable to both
wings of the party he will have done himself enormous good,' said another
Tory MP. 'But if the prime minister caves in to another federalist he will
be in a worse position.'
Sir John Hannam, secretary of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs,
said: 'If the use of Britain's veto leads to the appointment of a compromise
candidate, as appears to be the case, then this should satisfy the
Euro-sceptics and pro-Europeans.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, remains confident that the issue of a
replacement for Mr Jacques Delors, EU president, will be quickly resolved,
and that a candidate acceptable to all 12 EU states can be found.
Speaking on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost he said there was no
question of Britain accepting a renewed bid by Mr Dehaene, who stood for the
'out-of-date' ideas of government intervention and centralising power in
Europe.
By making it clear he will not accept Mr Dehaene as EU president,
irrespective of whether Belgium puts his name forward again, Mr Hurd hopes
the Euro-Sceptics will continue to be pacified.
Downing Street was pleased that Mr Major's stance was praised yesterday by
so many leading Euro-sceptics.
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor and a critic of the government,
said: 'The prime minister's insistence that the next president of the
European Commission should be acceptable to all member states will have the
support of all Conservatives.'
Mr James Cran, another Euro-sceptic, predicted backbenchers would be
'humming the government's tune'. He said: 'The prime minister listened to
his members, most of whom will applaud what he has done. The role of the UK
is to act as a sceptic.'
But the Euro-enthusiasts of the Tory Positive European group had a warning
of their own: 'The Euro-sceptics are a fickle group' said one pro-European
Tory MP.
'They have backed him before only to castigate him once he backs down. And
Mr Major will have to accept a federalist of some sorts at the next summit'.
The government climbdown earlier this year over qualified majority voting
enraged the Euro-sceptics who were led to believe that the prime minister
would resist the new voting procedure.
A number of backbenchers believed that the prime minister had little option
but to use the veto since the Conservatives had made it an issue in the
European elections.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, yesterday said the Corfu summit showed
that the Tories were the only party prepared to use the UK's veto. But
having used it once, the prime minister may be under pressure to use the
veto again as the price for the continued support of the Euro-sceptics.

<TEXT>
Viscount Etienne Davignon:
Could enter the race after the Corfu stalemate. Leading EU industry
commissioner in the early 1980s. Dreamt up pan-European approaches to steel
crisis and high-tech research. Not quite so successful in role as head of
Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian conglomerate. Great conceptual
thinker and ruthless negotiator, his appointment would signal a strong
European Commission. Biggest disadvantages: too old to represent New Europe.
Whether he wins or loses: still more invitations to act as Commission's
unofficial Brains Trust.
* * *
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian PM: John Major's de facto veto seems to have
wrecked Mr Dehaene's chances. The 'Carthorse' could face calls to pull out
of race with dignity once Corfu dust settles. Belgian public still surprised
how close he came to succeeding Jacques Delors. Can console himself that he
is still young enough for a top European post. Has an important job holding
together a fragile coalition government. Whether he wins or loses: fewer
references to his poor table manners and more recognition that he is a
top-rank politician.
* * *
Ruud Lubbers, outgoing Dutch prime minister:
Could rejoin race if the Netherlands, the only founder member of the
Euro-club never to have held the top Brussels job, conforms to Dutch
reputation for obstinacy. Trouble is, he and Chancellor Kohl are almost
spitting tacks at each other, so the Dutch might field another runner.
Whether he wins or loses: dignified but pungent remarks at summit suggest
he's not as boring as everyone makes out. After burnt bridges of Corfu,
unlikely to be going back into family bridge-building business.
* * *
Wilfried Martens:
Belgian PM 1979-92 and bete noire of Mrs Thatcher. Unabashed federalist.
Irritated the UK during the Gulf crisis by holding up release of Belgian
ammunition for British troops. But he is shrewd and is liked by Chancellor
Kohl. Was a candidate but could not get Belgian government backing; this
time he might. Three credentials: a Christian Democrat, from the Low
Countries, and a former PM. But has pledged to take up his seat in new
Euro-Parliament. Whether he wins or loses: proof you cannot keep Belgians
away from top jobs in Brussels.
* * *
Peter Sutherland, Irish director general of Gatt:
Consummate self-publicist with an outside chance after deadlock. Knows
Brussels after admired stint as competition commissioner 1985-88. Must
quickly confect anti-British credentials and be obsequious to French, whom
he accused of lack of leadership during last year's Uruguay Round showdown.
If Germans like him, they're not telling. Whether he wins or loses:
canvassing Sutherland for top international jobs is habit-forming, so zero
chance of damage to ego.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Major plays safe by denying Dehaene: British PM found it
easier to fight all Europe than the Tory party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So this time Mr John Major did not blink. After his humiliating climbdown
two months ago over majority voting, the British prime minister calculated
that isolation among his European partners was preferable to derision from
Conservative MPs at Westminster.
The decision to veto the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the next
president of the European Commission was dictated more by domestic than by
European politics.
The anger and bewilderment he left behind in Corfu will be followed today by
noisy applause from the Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches in the House
of Commons.
There would have been no enthusiasm in London for the candidacy of the
Belgian prime minister even if Mr Major's political position had been
strong. Mr Dehaene's instincts about the future shape of Europe are not
those of the British government.
But after narrowly avoiding catastrophe in the recent elections for the
European parliament, Mr Major decided that his precarious political position
dictated that he take his opposition to the limit.
The political backlash which followed the fiasco over majority voting - when
Mr Major first signalled that he would stand and fight to make majority
voting more difficult in the Council of Ministers and then just as quickly
retreated - had been a salutary lesson. The prime minister was told by party
managers at Westminster that accepting Mr Dehaene in Corfu would revive the
threat to his premiership.
Mr Major did not arrive at the summit with a carefully laid plan to
demonstrate his political virility by using Britain's national veto.
He had been intensely irritated at the way the Franco-German axis had
promoted Mr Dehaene. He had tried to persuade the Belgian prime minister not
to enter the race by warning him in advance of Britain's opposition.
But if he had decided in advance he could not acquiesce at this summit in
the appointment of Mr Dehaene, Mr Major had hoped also for something less
dramatic than a line-up of 11 to 1. The decision to employ the veto was
taken only after a flurry of consultations with other EU leaders and with Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, late on
Friday.
Earlier, at the request of the Greek presidency, Mr Major had completed a
voting slip in which he had marked Sir Leon Brittan as his first and Mr Ruud
Lubbers as his second choice for the post.
The presidency said there was no mention on the slip of a veto. Instead the
British prime minister had simply placed Mr Dehaene's name third.
At that stage there had been hopes still in the British delegation that a
more generalised deadlock would allow the whole issue to be deferred until
after the start of the summer parliamentary recess late next month. The
recess, which runs until October, would have taken the immediate political
pressure off Mr Major. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's determination to secure
Mr Dehaene's appointment before the first meeting of the new European
parliament on July 19 changed the political calculation. An unpalatable
decision could not be deferred until Tory MPs were safely away on holiday.
Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Mr Hurd looked less than
happy at the outcome. The foreign secretary had told cabinet colleagues
before the summit that Mr Dehaene was no grand federalist in the mould of Mr
Jacques Delors.
Instead he was a political Mr Fixit whose integrationist instincts would
have been tempered by a large dose of pragmatism. Mr Hurd could have lived
with Mr Dehaene as commission president.
The foreign secretary has indicated that he does not plan to bow out from
the government in the impending cabinet reshuffle. He has said that before
he leaves he wants to put in place the building blocks for Britain's
approach to the 1996 intergovernmental conference on the next stage of EU
development.
But there must now be a question mark over how long Mr Hurd will be content
running a foreign policy dictated by the Euro-sceptic wing of the Tory
party.
For Mr Major the immediate political consequences of the veto will be
favourable. The European election results were just tolerable enough to
remove the threat of a summer crisis over his leadership. He will now hope
that his Thatcherite performance in Corfu has done enough in appeasing the
right to remove the remaining threat of a challenge in the autumn.
But in the longer term the picture is much less clear. In Europe, Mr Kohl
will have no cause to help Mr Major out of the inevitable future scrapes
that Britain will face. German officials appear contemptuous of Mr Major's
insistence that he must follow rather than lead the Conservative party.
Mr Major has no guarantee that the new candidate who emerges for the
Commission presidency will be any less 'federalist' than Mr Dehaene. He
explicitly acknowledged this when he set out his reasons for opposing the
Belgian prime minister. Mr Dehaene had been unacceptable because he came
from a 'tradition of big government and a tradition of interventionism'. No
mention was made of his views on the future structure of the EU. At
Westminster, the price of appeasement of the Tory right will be to
antagonise further the pro-European centre-left of Mr Major's party. And it
is they rather than the Euro-sceptics who have in Mr Clarke an alternative
candidate for the premiership.
Mr Major insists he is not in thrall to the right of his party. During the
European election campaign he told cabinet colleagues that his exposition of
the case for a multi-speed, multi-track Europe had been misunderstood as a
precursor for British disengagement from the next stage of European
integration.
But it is hard to escape the conclusion that the successor to Lady Thatcher
is being pulled inexorably into repositioning the Conservatives as the party
of nationalism rather than of Europeanism.
There is a good case to be put for developing the European Union of the
future as a more flexible and diverse association than envisaged by
old-fashioned integrationalists. But Mr Major did that case no service at
the Corfu summit.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Worst of all worlds as EU leaders fail to agree: FT writers
weigh up the two-day summit in Corfu which did not find a new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, DAVID GARDNER and KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Choosing a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission was never going to be easy. But amid chaotic scenes at the
European summit in Corfu, the 12 heads of government of the EU ended up with
the worst of all worlds, write Lionel Barber, David Gardner and Kerin Hope.
The Belgians are furious with the British for exercising a de facto veto
against Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, their prime minister and overwhelming
favourite. The Dutch remain resentful about the Germans blocking their prime
minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers. Everyone agrees that the selection process is
flawed; but with the exception of Mr John Major, UK prime minister, no one
seems happy with the summit stalemate.
Responsibility for solving the crisis over the Delors succession falls,
therefore, to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He intends to call a special summit on
July 15 in Brussels, apparently calculating that the incoming German
presidency can succeed where the Greeks so palpably failed in Corfu.
The choice of a successor to Mr Delors was supposed to be settled during a
dinner among the 12 heads of government at the Achilleon, a gaudy
19th-century palace built for the Empress Elisabeth of Austria which later
served as a summer retreat for Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany during the first
world war.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the 75-year-old Greek premier, whose heart condition
is unlikely to have improved during the two-day summit, chaired the first
session. Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene, both Christian Democrats, retired to the
Corfu Hilton to await the outcome. They were replaced by deputies: Dutch
finance minister Mr Wim Kok and Belgian foreign minister Mr Willy Claes,
both Socialists in their coalition governments.
Mr Major opened with a presentation on behalf of Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU
trade negotiator and the only other official candidate for the top
Commission post. Mr Kok followed with arguments for Mr Lubbers, and Mr Claes
for Mr Dehaene. Mr Papandreou then threw everyone off balance by calling for
an immediate secret ballot.
Eight countries led by France and Germany expressed a preference for Mr
Dehaene: Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal. Three  -
the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy - voted for Mr Lubbers. Sir Leon received
the solitary vote of the UK.
Shortly after midnight, Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg prime minister,
arrived at the Corfu Hilton and declared an impasse. The meeting of the
heads of government would reconvene at 10am on Saturday, he said.
The Spanish delegation meanwhile encouraged the impression that their prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez was negotiating with Mr Lubbers to reach a
compromise to salvage Dutch national pride, while paving the way for Mr
Dehaene.
But within a quarter of an hour, the meeting was reconvened, this time
chaired by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the unpredictable Greek European affairs
minister. Mr Papandreou retired to bed at the Imperial hotel, though Greek
officials insist that he remained in contact by telephone.
The second session was stormy. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign minister, who
generally steers clear of hyperbole, called the atmosphere 'poisonous'. Mr
Kok demanded that Mr Kohl explain why he was against Mr Lubbers' candidacy,
but failed to receive a satisfactory answer. 'Normally the chancellor has a
lot to say, but this time he didn't,' said a visibly angry Mr Kok later.
Mr Major refused, point blank, to support Mr Dehaene. He told his
colleagues: 'This is not going to be sorted out tonight. I won't agree to Mr
Dehaene even if it's 11 votes to one.'
Mr Pangalos tried to ease the tension. Pointing to Mr Delors, he joked: 'If
it continues like this, we will have to ask Jacques to stay on - except he
has other plans.'
Mr Delors, who is in two minds about entering next year's race for the
French presidency, smiled. Perhaps he was savouring the irony of a British
veto against Mr Dehaene having the unintended effect of prolonging his
10-year stewardship in Brussels. Later, however, he specifically ruled out
staying on for another five years.
In an effort to force a conclusion, Mr Pangalos called for a second vote.
This time the eight pro-Dehaene member states picked up support from Spain
and Italy, who said they were ready to 'join the consensus'. But the British
and Dutch held out for their candidates.
By 3am on Saturday morning, the British made clear that Mr Dehaene was
unacceptable to them, claiming he represented a tradition of big government
and interventionism. 'Sir Leon fits the bill. Mr Lubbers fits the bill. Mr
Dehaene does not,' said a UK official.
Once the heads of government resumed later that morning, Mr Lubbers and Sir
Leon withdrew their candidacies. For Sir Leon it was a lost cause, the
finale to the first-ever public campaign for the top job in Brussels. Mr
Lubbers, whose candidacy ran into an immovable Mr Kohl, had the last word.
'The German Chancellor now has a big problem. Either he has to persuade Mr
Major - which I doubt - or we have to find a new candidate,' said the
outgoing Dutch premier.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Kohl rattled as protege falls at the last fence: Paris and
Bonn need to be a little more sensitive toward their partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the casualties of the Corfu summit was Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He
pushed hard for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as
president of the Commission, only to see the Belgian premier stumble at the
last fence.
Mr Kohl clearly saw Mr Dehaene as something of a protege. Here was a
politician without pretensions, skilled in the art of compromise, a fervent
supporter of the need for deeper political and economic integration in
Europe - in short, a man in the chancellor's own mould.
After Mr Dehaene, Mr Kohl's recent track record on personnel matters is
looking mixed. Mr Steffen Heitmann, the right-wing justice minister from
former East Germany, was his first choice for president of the
Bundesrepublik; but he was forced to bow out after ill-judged remarks about
the Holocaust.
On Saturday afternoon, there was little disguising Mr Kohl's pique as he
fended off questions about his own role in the Delors succession. He was
particularly sensitive about why he favoured Mr Dehaene over the more
experienced Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister.
'I don't have to explain this,' said Mr Kohl.
The chancellor also betrayed irritation at suggestions that France and
Germany had tried to push through their candidate without proper
consultation - a suggestion which Mr Lubbers raised shortly after declaring
his own candidacy last month.
Mr Kohl retorted on Saturday that it was absurd to talk about Franco-German
hegemony in the European Union. The idea was 'mad' and 'primitive', he said.
Yet the impression of a Franco-German diktat on the Delors succession gained
force last month after the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, the traditional
high-level meeting in which Bonn and Paris seek to co-ordinate positions
ahead of the EU heads of government summit.
At Mulhouse, officials leaked the fact that Mr Kohl and President Francois
Mitterrand had agreed to put forward Mr Dehaene as joint candidate. The
officials described the decision as one of a series of joint positions on
important EU matters such as deregulation and the future integration of
central and eastern Europe.
One of the broader lessons from the Delors succession affair is that Paris
and Bonn need to be a little more sensitive toward their partners, even as
they draw closer to one another in the cause of European integration and are
eager to show the outside world that the Franco-German axis remains secure
in a Union in which Germany's weight is growing.
Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, Portuguese foreign minister, summed up the
mood among several other delegations. France and Germany were too big
countries whose co-operation was vital for the Union, but 'we do not like
the way this has been handled'.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Major's defiance wins support from backbench Tories:
Euro-sceptics welcome PM's veto of Dehaene to succeed Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major appeared to have strengthened his position within his party
yesterday as Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday welcomed his veto of Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene as European Commission president.
After his climbdown two months ago over majority voting, Mr Major is hoping
that his defiant performance at the Corfu summit will appease his party's
right wing enough to remove the threat of a challenge to his leadership in
the autumn.
The anger and bewilderment Mr Major left behind in Corfu will be followed
today by noisy applause from the Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches in
the House of Commons.
Having narrowly avoided serious defeat in the recent elections for the
European parliament, Mr Major decided that his precarious political position
meant that isolation among his European partners was preferable to criticism
from Conservative MPs at Westminster.
However, leading Euro-sceptics warned that the prime minister's position
could quickly weaken if he allowed another federalist to be appointed at the
special European summit called for July 15 to resolve the issue.
The decision to use Britain's veto appalled Tory members of the Positive
European group who warned Mr Major that he could find himself in a weaker
position by relying on the support of Euro-sceptics.
However, he had little choice but to use the veto following a warning from
Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, that acceptance of the Belgian prime
minister as commission president would provoke a vicious backlash on the
Tory backbenches.
Speaking after the summit, the prime minister said he was 'unperturbed' by
his isolation. He said: 'I believe that it is necessary, even at the expense
of painful decisions and difficult moments to make sure that we have the
best possible person for this vitally important job.'
Mr Major attempted to play down suggestions that the move could signal a
long-term crisis in Britain's relations with the other EU governments.
He said that he 'warmly welcomed' the decision to hold another summit in
July and was 'entirely' confident that a new candidate could be found that
was acceptable to everyone.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, denied that Mr Major had acted
against his advice in using Britain's veto, saying that he had no doubt
about the 'rightness' of the prime minister's course. But there were clear
signs that the foreign office would have preferred to avoid an 11-to-1
position.
Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Mr Hurd seemed less than
happy at the outcome. He had told cabinet colleagues before the summit that
Mr Dehaene was not a federalist in the mould of Mr Jacques Delors.
Mr Hurd has indicated that he does not plan to bow out from the government
in the impending cabinet reshuffle. The Corfu vote, however, will encourage
speculation over how long Mr Hurd will be content to run a European policy
over which the Euro-sceptics appear to have such influence.
Euro-sceptics such as Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor, and Sir George
Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Tory rightwingers, strongly backed the
prime minister's 'robust stance'.
But Mr Robert Hicks, a member of the Tory Postive European group, described
the veto as 'regrettable'.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Publishers face delay on TV and radio group takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper publishers' ambitions to take over British broadcasters may have
to be postponed because a growing parliamentary logjam is threatening
serious delays to the required legislation.
National Heritage ministers fear there may not be time in the 1994-95
legislative calendar for primary legislation on the media.
That would mean reforms to allow 'cross-media' ownership might be delayed
until 1996 at the earliest, along with legislation on a range of issues
vital to the future of British television, such as amendments to
controversial aspects of the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
A delay to legislation would be a severe blow to Channel 4 in its campaign
to reduce its payments to ITV companies by Pounds 50m a year. It would also
be a setback to media groups such as Rupert Murdoch's News International
which is thought to have ambitions to enter British broadcasting.
The opposition may seek to exploit the government's difficulties by
contrasting the delay in the UK with the wide-ranging plans of the Clinton
administration to develop US media and information industries.
Legislative proposals on key issues ranging from the future of Channel 5 and
plans for digital television to white papers on the future of the BBC and
the press and privacy are already considerably delayed.
Whitehall departments have just lodged their bids for legislative slots and
the outlines of the Queen's Speech - to be delivered in the autumn  - are
expected to be decided by the end of this month or early next. National
Heritage ministers fear the legislative timetable will be dominated by
issues such as the privatisation of the railways and the Post Office.
An interdepartmental committee on cross-media ownership is due to complete
its work this summer. It is likely to recommend a relaxation of the rules
that prevent publishers owning more than 20 per cent of broadcasting
companies and vice versa.
Primary legislation would be needed for anything other than a small increase
in the permissible stake. The cross-media ownership rules are central to any
further liberalisation of ITV ownership regulations. Last year's change in
the rules to allow one company to own two ITV licences, except in London,
was seen as an interim step.
Legislative delay would hold up a legal framework for digital radio and
digital terrestrial television as well as a plan to unite the two
broadcasting regulators, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the
Broadcasting Standards Council.

FT  27 JUN 94 / Markets expect banks to support dollar again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets expect central banks led by the US Federal Reserve to
repeat early this week - possibly today - their action to lift the dollar
against the D-Mark and the yen.
Shortly after the Tokyo opening today, bankers reported the Bank of Japan
buying dollars at around Y100.1. On Friday the currency closed in New York
at Y100.525. The yen's upward assault caused Tokyo stocks to post early
losses of about 335 points, or 1.62 per cent.
Despite the prospect of support, market analysts were sceptical last night
about whether a re-run of Friday's widescale intervention would be enough to
boost the US currency. If such action failed, it would encourage market
speculation about an imminent rise in US interest rates.
A European monetary official warned yesterday that after years in which US
government officials had displayed a lack of concern about the dollar, the
Fed might be forced into monetary tightening. 'Last Friday the US
authorities showed they care (about the dollar) - a bit,' he said.
The dollar purchases at the end of last week by 17 central banks including
the German Bundesbank failed to lift the currency, which closed on Friday in
New York at DM1.584.
Traders in New York and London were confident at the weekend that
intervention would continue but said this would provide a selling
opportunity for those wanting to offload the currency.
Mr Stephen Flanagan, of New York stockbrokers PaineWebber, said: 'There is
no question that there is an overwhelming amount of bearishness built up
against the dollar.'
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland in
London, said any further intervention would have to be 'aggressive and
concerted' to stop the dollar falling further. But he said selling of the
dollar so far this month, during which it fell sharply against the D-Mark
and yen, 'has been a long way from an avalanche', with most large
institutional investors on the sidelines.
The Fed is thought to be preoccupied with helping the US economy to recover,
making it less than keen to consider an imminent rise in the short-term
federal funds rate, now 4.25 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's political parties yesterday began the race to form a new government
following Saturday's resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata's eight-week-old
minority coalition.
Mr Hata stepped down rather than face a parliamentary no-confidence vote
that would risk a general election after he failed to persuade the
opposition Social Democratic party to rejoin the coalition.
'It is urgently important for politicians sharing similar policies and ideas
to establish a stable government and I will resign in order to pave the way
for reform,' said Mr Hata.
Japan faces a pressing economic and foreign policy agenda, with the recent
plunge in the dollar's value against the yen, the summit of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations on July 8-10, and the nuclear threat in
North Korea. Mr Hata and his cabinet stay on as caretakers until a new
administration is formed.
He attempted to calm fears that his resignation would create a leadership
vacuum by assuring US president Bill Clinton that Japan would push on with
talks to resolve their trade dispute. The government would also continue its
work on economic deregulation and tax reform, about which it is due to
unveil a package of measures tomorrow.
Leaders of the conservative Liberal Democratic party and the leftwing SDP,
the two largest opposition groups, plus the New Harbinger party, a
centre-left splinter group from the LDP, yesterday said they were
considering an alliance.
'The opposition owes responsibility to end the political confusion,' said Mr
Yohei Kono, president of the LDP, which was in power for nearly four decades
until it lost a vote of no confidence last June, thanks to the defection of
a faction led by Mr Hata.
However, a coalition of the LDP and SDP, which for years opposed each other,
is likely to be more fragile than the last government. The SDP was yesterday
undecided on whether to seek to rejoin Mr Hata's camp, two months after
storming out of the coalition, or throw in its lot with its former enemies,
the LDP.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, said he would try again to form a
government with the outgoing coalition, but was prepared to ally with the
LDP if this failed.
Both Mr Murayama and Mr Kono were cited as possible candidates for the post
of prime minister. Equally, there was some support for reinstating Mr Hata,
amid speculation that he had staged a tactical resignation with that in
mind.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, head of the New Harbinger party, said it 'would not
be totally impossible' for Mr Hata to become prime minister again.
By yesterday evening, Japan's political parties were no closer to clarifying
the succession.
'We can't say what will happen tomorrow. In fact, we can't even say in the
morning what will happen in the afternoon,' admitted Mr Kozo Watanabe,
number three in Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany will today start urgent talks with other
European leaders in an attempt to head off a political crisis in the
European Union following the failure of EU leaders to agree on a successor
to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.
Chancellor Kohl, bitterly disappointed that his choice of Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, was blocked by a British veto, has called a
special summit in Brussels on July 15 to resolve the dispute. However,
informal discussions on the issue are expected to start today.
Germany takes over the rotating EU presidency from Greece on Friday. Mr Kohl
has the difficult task of coming up with a new candidate acceptable to all
12 member states.
The bitterness of the dispute was underlined yesterday when Mr Klaus Kinkel,
German foreign minister, said there was 'no need' to look for a compromise
candidate despite the British veto - while Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign
secretary, said there were no circumstances under which Britain would accept
Mr Dehaene. 'The way in which this was handled makes it impossible for Mr
Dehaene to do the job successfully for five years,' Mr Hurd told BBC's
Breakfast with Frost programme.
A key meeting will be when the Group of Seven industrial nations convene in
Naples next month. Leaders might be able to agree on a nominee as part of a
wider package of jobs including leadership of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development and the World Trade Organisation.
Among several rumoured candidates for the Commission are Mr Peter
Sutherland, outgoing Irish head of the Gatt world trade organisation,
Viscount Etienne Davignon, a Belgian former industry commissioner who now
heads the Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian conglomerate, and Mr
Giuliano Amato, the former Italian prime minister. Mr Wilfried Martens, the
former Belgian premier, is also being canvassed by some EU officials.
The stalemate in Corfu could trigger a confrontation between member states
and the European Parliament, which is due to scrutinise the Commission
president-designate at its inaugural session on July 19.
Efforts to agree on a successor to Mr Delors broke up early on Saturday. Mr
Dehaene secured 10 votes at the end of two ballots. Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch
prime minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, later
withdrew as candidates. The UK decision to continue blocking Mr Dehaene
caused consternation. France and Germany were angered by the British refusal
to bow to what they saw as a consensus.
However, several member states - including Italy, Portugal and the
Netherlands - agreed with the UK case that France and Germany had been
heavy-handed in pushing Mr Dehaene. The Belgian premier remains in the race.

cauldron - Soccer
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ORLANDO, FLORIDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's 2-1 win against Ireland yesterday means that four countries are
locked in bitter struggle in the World Cup's toughest group. Luis Garcia
scored both Mexican goals. But John Aldridge's headed goal for Ireland in
the 83rd minute may prove important, reports Peter Berlin from Orlando,
Florida.
All four teams in Group E could still finish in any position. They are level
on points (three) and on goal difference (zero). However, Aldridge's goal
means Ireland at present share first place with Mexico: both have scored
twice while Italy and Norway have scored once each.
In the 44`C sauna of the Citrus Bowl, Ireland waxed and waned. When the sun
hid behind cloud, they ventured forth; when it blazed, they slumped into
defence.
Manager Jack Charlton's latest trick to combat dehydration was plastic
goldfish bags filled with water and tossed out to the players. But as the
game wore on, the heat took its toll.
Ray Houghton on Ireland's right wing was sluggish almost throughout. The
most dangerous Irish threats came from the pacy runs of Terry Phelan. But
Phelan was left leaden-footed in the 44th minute when a Mexican surge saw
the ball laid into Garcia's path.
His low 25-yard shot flew past Pat Bonner's right hand into the corner of
the net. In the 65th minute, Mexico repeated the trick, Alberto Garcia Aspe
skipping past Denis Irwin's indecisive challenge to set up Garcia, who drove
to Bonner's right.
Ireland were on the ropes. The normally unflappable Paul McGrath was left
floundering by Mexico's pace. At the other end, the Irish seemed incapable
of penetrating the Mexican penalty area. Charlton threw on two substitutes
and with only seven minutes left, Ireland stole a precious goal. Jason
McAteer escaped Joaquin Del Olmo and crossed for Aldridge to head down past
Jorge Campos.
'Come on you boys in green,' sang the fans, even though it was Mexico who
were clad in green.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Grand Metropolitan sells low margin wine
brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the leading wine brands in the US are to change hands in a proposed
deal between a US subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan and one of the country's
leading wine producers.
Heublein, a GrandMet subsidiary, has signed a letter of intent to sell
Almaden and Inglenook wines, as well as several Californian wineries, to
Canandaigua Wine Company of New York.
The Almaden and Inglenook brands are the third and sixth largest selling
wine brands in the US with more than 13 per cent of the overall market.
GrandMet is selling the brands as part of its focus on higher margin
products. Almaden and Inglenook are cheaper, higher volume wines, with lower
margins.
The businesses recorded net sales in the year ended September 30 of Dollars
235m (Pounds 155m) and were profitable, GrandMet said. The price has not
been disclosed, and the deal must wait for regulatory approval.
It is thought the agreement will be closely examined as Canandaigua is the
second largest wine producer in the US, with brands such as Paul Masson and
Taylor California Cellars.

FT  25 JUN 94 / EU agrees plan to aid Merseyside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A five-point plan to regenerate Merseyside's economy
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
including subsidised interest rates for small businesses - has been agreed
between the UK and the European Union after months of controversy and
negotiation.
The plan will be the basis for spending nearly Pounds 630m of EU funds
resulting from Merseyside's Objective 1 status, which was granted last year.
UK public-sector sources will match the sum. The combined Pounds 1.26bn is
expected to attract more from the private sector.
Although details still have to be approved by the European Commission next
month, the government yesterday published guidelines on the type of projects
that might be funded, with details of how applications should be made.
A plan for disbursing the money, with much going on training, was rejected
by Brussels in April as vague. The new plan picks five main 'drivers' of
economic change. These are:
In the big-company sector projects will relate to preparing and servicing
sites for companies and inward investors. Infrastructure spending will also
be provided. Small and medium-size enterprises will be encouraged to grow,
with EU money helping to fund training, services and advice through training
and enterprise councils and Business Links. There will be a Merseyside
Special Investment Fund, set up by the clearing banks but with EU money used
to subsidise interest rates for business loans.
Knowledge-based industries will be encouraged, with special attention to
technology transfer between Merseyside's two universities and industry. One
idea is a graduate-retention programme with local industry, to keep more
qualified people in the area. The arts, cultural and tourism sectors will be
encouraged.
Initiatives will concentrate on training and systematic development of human
resources. Inner-city and social-problem areas, such as outer estates with
high unemployment, will be targeted.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Mexican minister offers to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican political system was thrown into further disarray yesterday
after Mr Jorge Carpizo, the powerful interior minister, offered to resign.
President Carlos Salinas refused to accept the resignation and, yesterday
afternoon, a government official said it could not be assumed that Mr
Carpizo, who is in charge of national security and supervisor of the
presidential election due in August, would resign.
The minister, a volatile man widely respected for his political
independence, said of his resignation that he was indignant and
disillusioned that 'people in the most diverse sectors (of the country),
despite the current situation of the country, are only fighting for
themselves and for their group, not for Mexico.
'I am beginning not to be respected by one of the (political) parties, given
that I cannot agree with the actions of some sectors of this party.'
Mr Carpizo did not name the party but, in recent weeks, he has been angered
by criticism from the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution of the fairness
of the electoral system. He believes that this has called into question his
own honesty and impartiality.
Even so, Mr Carpizo's indignation with 'diverse sectors' of society
indicates a frustration almost certainly extended to parts of the government
and the ruling party, the PRI. Mr Carpizo has long been opposed by
conservative forces in the party.
The lawyer for Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the kidnapped Mexican financier, has
said on national television that his ransom would be paid, paving the way
for his release within three days. Mr Harp, joint head of Banamex-Accival,
the largest bank in Mexico, was seized in March.
The kidnappers said in their latest communication that the ransom demand had
been dropped to less than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.5m). The lawyer agreed to
pay an unspecified amount.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Illegal immigrants in California will be denied public education, healthcare
and other services if the state accepts an initiative which will be on
ballot papers in November. It would also require police, teachers and
healthcare workers to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal
authorities. The outcome of the vote might point the way for other US
states, such as Florida and New York, which also have many illegal aliens,
Jeremy Kahn writes from Washington.
Californian state officials confirmed that backers of the proposal - called
the Save Our State initiative - had collected more than the 600,000
signatures necessary to put the issue to a state-wide referendum.
Governor Pete Wilson of California, the incumbent Republican who is running
for re-election in November but trails in the opinion polls, endorsed the
initiative last week. Mr Wilson's Democratic opponent, Ms Kathleen Brown,
opposes the proposal, as do various prominent civil rights and Latino
groups.
These critics have labelled the initiative discriminatory and racist, as it
primarily targets Hispanic and Asian minorities. They have promised to
challenge the proposal on constitutional grounds if it wins a majority.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK set to veto Dehaene as EC president: Summit deadlock over
successor to Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CORFU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major signalled early today he was ready to veto the appointment of
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
European Commission, in spite of a Franco-German bandwagon in favour of the
Belgian premier.
Leaders of the 12 European Union countries failed to reach agreement on the
key Brussels job on the first day of their summit in Corfu, but will
reconvene later today for further discussion.
Senior British officials said there were 'no circumstances' in which Mr
Major would accept Mr Dehaene. The officials said the Belgian premier did
not command the necessary consensus within the EU. 'In our view he does not
fit the bill,' one high-ranking official said.
If the present Greek presidency of the EU continued to press Mr Dehaene's
candidacy, Mr Major was ready to use his government's veto to block it,
officials indicated. He would stick to this line if the issue was deferred
to another summit next month.
The British stand threw into confusion the whole question of who will take
over from Mr Delors. After a day of behind-the-scenes argument, a clash at a
summit dinner and a brief recall for emergency talks in the early hours of
this morning, only Britain and the Netherlands were still holding out
against Mr Dehaene.
Spain and Italy initially joined the Netherlands in backing Mr Ruud Lubbers,
the outgoing Dutch premier, but later switched to Mr Dehaene.
Mr Lubbers refused to withdraw from the race even though 10 member states
were eventually supporting Mr Dehaene.
Mr Major, under intense pressure from Tory Eurosceptics in the UK to veto
the appointment of the avowed Belgian federalist, was isolated in promoting
the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner.
British officials said that if Sir Leon withdrew, Mr Major was ready to
support Mr Lubbers.
Mr Dehaene's candidacy was overshadowed by widespread irritation at the way
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany had sought to control the succession to Mr
Delors and by the confused handling of debate by the Greek presidency of the
EU.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, attacked the handling of the
negotiations and, in a thinly veiled rebuke to Bonn and Paris, commented:
'There is a lot of poison around. The atmosphere is not good. The problem is
not so much with the three candidates but with the way the whole issue has
been handled.'
German officials insisted that Mr Dehaene was the overwhelming favourite and
that this left the UK and the Netherlands no option but to withdraw.
Mr Kohl has threatened a second summit next month if the deadlock continues
beyond the Corfu meeting, which is due to end this afternoon. But he
predicted yesterday: 'We'll be able to settle this problem.'
Other member states were more reserved, underlining that the candidate
required unanimous backing and that front-runners in previous successions
have been vetoed.
Mr Delors himself owes his job to a veto by Lady Thatcher, the former
British prime minister, in 1984 against the then French foreign minister Mr
Claude Cheysson.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Books: Spanish festivals captured in print
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A small child gazes transfixed at the shrine of Saint Minnia in Brion,
Galicia: one of 187 colour photographs from Festivals and Rituals of Spain
by Cristina Garcia Rodero (Harry N. Abrams, Pounds 40, 298 pages). Ms Garcia
Rodero, professor of photography at the University of Madrid, has captured
the rich fusion of ancient pagan ritual and solemn religious rite with its
parade of jesters, maskers, penitents and carousers in an apparently endless
cycle of celebrations. The poet and novelist J. M. Caballero Bonald provides
the introduction and a map shows the locations of the villages photographed,
most of them unknown to tourists.
