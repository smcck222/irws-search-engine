FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks ended sharply higher, driven by demand from foreign investors and
expectations of a decline in interest rates.
The key IPC index climbed 65.51 points, or 3.05 per cent, to 2,213.09.
Turnover was a moderate 85.32m shares. Rises exceeded declines by 63 to 15.
Traders said the market was also helped by the strong gains on Wall Street,
which spilled over into Mexican shares trading there.
The stock exchange authorities said yesterday that the value of foreign
holdings in ADRs fell to Dollars 30bn at the end of April from Dollars
33.5bn at the beginning of the year.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil advances 9 per cent in moderate
volume
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Sao Paulo were up nearly 9 per cent in moderate trade, more than
recovering Monday's losses as investors took a second look at the
government's announcement that it was to introduce a new currency unit in
July.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares ended 1,262 points up at
15,480. Turnover was Cr209bn (Dollars 143.2m).
In spite of the rally, analysts commented that it was difficult to define a
trend: 'prices are see-sawing sharply and volume remains very thin,' one
said.
Among active issues, Telebras, the telecommunications group, had put on 10
per cent.

Share prices yesterday fell for the third day, triggered by a renewal of
political uncertainty, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The KSE-100 index finished 71.49 weaker at 2,237.63. The index has fallen by
almost 7 per cent since Sunday following last week's violence in Karachi
which led to the death of at least 20 people.
Analysts noted that investors were also becoming cautious ahead of next
month's annual budget. COLOMBO, after four days of recovery, began heading
back towards its 1994 lows again. The CSE all-share index retreated 23.61,
or 2.3 per cent, to 1,023.95 as turn-over dropped from Rs124.6m to Rs82.9m.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Indian GDRs firm despite cancellation
of VSNL

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's overseas listed shares have been supported over the last few days by
institutional buying which had been set aside for the cancelled Dollars 1bn
Euro-issue by VSNL, the overseas telecommunications group, Reuter reports
from Bombay.
Analysts said that most Indian global depositary receipts (GDRs) -
certificates representing domestic shares - had risen by between 10 to 20
per cent since last Friday.
However, this follows a sharp decline in their value since February when
many of the world's emerging stock markets fell back after the US lifted
interest rates.
Mr Ajit Dayal of Jardine Fleming India Securities said: 'Fund managers who
have India-demarcated cash are buying those shares (GDRs). They are watching
good corporate results and generally good economic fundamentals.'
Twenty-two Indian companies have issued GDRs over the last three years,
raising nearly Dollars 2bn from international markets.
VSNL's Euro-issue, which would have been India's biggest, was abruptly
withdrawn last week after fund managers balked at the high price set by the
government.
The domestic stock market has also been resilient over the past week:
Bombay's BSE index yesterday added 10.70 at 3,769.72, after a 40-point
advance on Monday.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Nervous recovery as bourses
anticipate Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses anticipated yesterday's recovery in the US bond and equity
markets, writes Our Markets Staff. However, dealers were also conscious that
this was reaction time after some heavy losses, and caution and a sense of
nervousness also prevailed.
FRANKFURT responded to US and domestic influences. At home, sentiment was
improved by a cut of six basis points in the Bundesbank's repo rate, and
speculation whether this pointed to a cut in rates at the Buba meeting
today.
The Dax index rose 16.27 to 2,235.15, improving on that in the post-bourse
to an Ibis-indicated 2,241.34 by the end of the afternoon. Turnover rose
from DM6bn to DM7.95bn.
Ms Barbara Altmann, at B Metzler in Frankfurt, added that the broad equity
market was lifted by first quarter results from Veba. The energy and
chemicals group produced a 35 per cent rise in net profits, rose DM6.80 to
DM527.30 and took the utilities sector up with it; the growth rate, said Ms
Altmann, was 10 points stronger than expected.
Degussa, the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and metals combine, put on DM12 or
2.3 per cent to DM526 on a 58 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits.
In banks, waiting for Buba, Deutsche rose DM11.80 to DM793.50 and Dresdner
DM8.50 to DM401.50.
PARIS recovered all of Monday's losses and then moved into positive
territory helped by Wall Street, European bond markets and hopes for German
rates today.
The CAC-40 index closed 25.56 or 1.2 per cent better at 2,164.98, not far
short of the session high of 2,170. Turnover was estimated at FFr3bn, up
from Monday's FFr2.4bn.
BSN, the food manufacturer, was among the day's most active issues, adding
FFr21 to FFr869 on a 7 per cent rise in first quarter sales, expectations of
higher profits in 1994 and a change of name to Danone, currently the
division of the group which markets yoghurt. The group's chairman, Mr
Antoine Ribaud, also announced a series acquisitions as part of efforts to
strengthen its international presence.
LVMH, up FFr12 at FFr906, benefited from a number of buy recommendations,
including one from Hoare Govett which noted that, in spite of a rise of more
than 20 per cent in the shares since the beginning of the year, the group
has in fact underperformed the CAC-40 by 5 per cent over the last two years.
Euro Disney fell below the FFr30 level, and touched an all time low of
FFr28.20 before closing down 75 centimes at FFr29.25; investors feared the
effects of dilution following the company's capital increase.
MILAN waited for the formation of the new government, but had to wait some
more as the expected audience of the prime minister-designate, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was delayed further until
later yesterday.
The Comit index rose 16.23, or 2 per cent to 817.17.
Fiat rose L230 to L7,240, ahead of 1993 results which are expected tomorrow.
Analysts were confident that the car maker would show a good recovery for
1994, helped by better-than-expected sales of its new Punto range, as well
as a pick-up in overall Europan car volumes.
Insurance stocks were again in focus with Generali up another L1,000 at
L48,950.
ZURICH, down 2.7 per cent on Monday, saw the SMI index recover 59.5, or 2.3
per cent to 2,629.8 with banks in the lead after their recent weakness.
CS Holding bearers, the most active stock, rose SFr27, or 4.8 per cent to
SFr585. SBC put on SFr14 to SFr372 and UBS SFr32 to SFr1,087.
However, the market was less enthusiastic about Roche, the pharmaceutical
group. Its certificates, under pressure since the apparently generous bid
for Syntex of the US, recovered just SFr30 to SFr6,330. Roche said that
consolidating Syntex will not dilute earnings, and that 1994 profits will be
higher; but foreign selling continued.
MADRID rallied in the wake of domestic bonds, the general index recovering
6.58, or 2.1 per cent to 320.99. Turnover rose from Pta15.1bn to just over
Pta22bn.
The recovery in the US equity market was mirrored by Telefonica, the most
active stock of the day in volume of around 1.96m shares, and up Pta45 to
Pta1,770. Acerinox, recently neglected but one of this year's favourites,
rose Pta830, or 6.1 per cent to Pta14,400 on doubled pre-tax profits for the
first quarter of the current year.
AMSTERDAM was supported by the major internationals and the AEX index rose
3.96, or 1 per cent to 409.9. Royal Dutch was up Fl 2.20 at Fl 206.00 ahead
of first quarter results due today. In a preview, James Capel, sticking to a
hold recommendation, noted that the shares 'have had a tremendous run on the
back of improving oil price sentiment, but are looking somewhat stretched on
valuation grounds'.
Hunter Douglas, up 60 cents at Fl 79.80, said that it was launching an ADR
programme in New York.
STOCKHOLM was generally stronger with the exception of Ericcson, whose B
shares dipped SKr6 to SKr340, on disappointment that it had lost an
important Saudi Arabian telecommunications contract, worth an estimated
Dollars 4bn, to AT&amp;T of the US.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 5.10 to 1,499.70 in turnover of
SKr1.7bn.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Regional outlook
brightens in the afternoon session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing hopes of a rise in the dollar against the yen supported
confidence, and shares gained ground in spite of the overnight fall on US
stock and bond markets, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was ahead 130.82 at 19,917.78 after a day's low of
19,753.05 in the morning and a high of 19,962.69 in the afternoon session.
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.99 at 1,617.83.
Arbitrage buying linked to the Topix index supported shares, while
institutional and overseas investors picked up high technology stocks.
Volume was 230m shares, rising above the 200m level for the first time in
four trading days.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 4.12 to 1,320.29.
The yen declined against the dollar on expectations of a US discount rate
rise: 'Stabilised US financial markets will help Japanese stocks,' commented
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
High technology issues moved forward on the weaker yen, with NEC, the day's
most active issue, rising Y20 to Y1,150 and Hitachi Y3 to Y958. Some
large-capital stocks were also higher, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rising Y7
to Y690.
Ube Industries, a chemicals and machinery group, advanced Y14 to Y392 on
favourable earnings prospects. Real estate companies were higher on reports
of increasing liquidity in the property markets. Mitsui Fudosan added Y10 at
Y1,240 and Mitsubishi Estate Y20 at Y1,210.
Banks were supported by arbitrage linked buying. Industrial Bank of Japan
strengthened Y40 to Y3,240 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,950.
Battery makers attracted buying on hopes of higher profits due to increased
demand from the rapidly growing mobile telephone sector. Furukawa Battery
climbed Y55 to Y700 and Japan Storage Battery Y15 to Y793.
Stocks which had been sought recently by short-term speculators fell back as
profits were taken. Brother Industries, the sewing machine and typewriter
maker, receded Y14 to Y661 and Wakachiku Construction Y15 to Y652.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 51.24 to 22,078.57 in volume of 21m
shares.
Roundup
A number of markets in the region picked up, some staging recoveries in the
afternoon.
HONG KONG drew US funds into the index futures market, May index futures
climbing 260 to 8,635, and the cash market responded with the Hang Seng
index rising 118.39, or 1.4 per cent, to 8,540.09 after an earlier fall of
132 points.
Selected blue chips benefited from the buying, with Cheung Kong topping the
active list and firming 75 cents to HKDollars 35. HSBC gained HKDollars 1 at
HKDollars 82.50 after slipping to HKDollars 80.50. Hutchison went
ex-dividend and rose an adjusted 59 cents to HKDollars 28.50.
Among China stocks, however, Tsingtao Brewery slid 35 cents, or 5.4 per
cent, to HKDollars 6.10 in line with a downtrend for H-shares issued by
Chinese enterprises.
SINGAPORE, too, bounced from a low, the Straits Times Industrial index
closing 12.30 up at 2,234.70, having bottomed earlier at 2,208.03.
Resurgent rumours of an early Malaysian general election led to a strong
showing by speculative Malaysian shares. KUALA LUMPUR itself saw bargain
hunting in the afternoon and the KLSE composite index improved 8.85 to
999.48.
SEOUL rose for the fifth consecutive session on renewed institutional buying
of primary blue chips. The composite stock index added 7.25 at 947.40 after
the Korea Investment Trust said it had a new, Dollars 60m fund which would
begin buying stocks next week.
Among major gainers, the heavily weighted Kepco went the day's limit up,
advancing Won1,000 to Won28,800. Samsung Display Devices also hit its upper
limit, gaining Won2,500 at Won94,500.
But medium-priced blue chips lost momentum. Most financial and construction
counters retreated.
TAIPEI ended lower in slow trade as sentiment turned cautious, the weighted
index losing 59.43 at 5,937.37 in turnover of TDollars 57.05bn (TDollars
66.54bn).
However, selected electronics still saw strong gains on continued
expectations of sound profits. ASE rose by its daily 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 112.50.
MANILA was hit by US interest rate worries and a weakening in domestic blue
chips. The composite index dropped 46.78, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,913.45, with
turnover declining from 947.7m pesos to 900.8m pesos.
The US-influenced PLDT tumbled 1.6 per cent to 1,830 pesos, but other blue
chips such as Philippine National Bank and San Miguel more than matched this
with falls of 4.5 per cent to 530 pesos and 1.7 per cent to 175 pesos.
SYDNEY was flat in advance of the federal budget, which came after hours,
the All Ordinaries index ending 1.1 off at 2,008.2. News Corp fell 24 cents
to ADollars 8.80, influenced by New York, London and its third-quarter
results. CRA put on 32 cents at ADollars 16.62 on a strong copper price
rise.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Firmer tone to dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued speculation of a tightening in US interest rates and positive
developments on the US-Japan trade dispute helped the dollar finish firmer
yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency was also bought on the back of a rumour that the Federal
Reserve and the Bundesbank would move in concert today by respectively
raising and lowering rates.
The Fed did not move, as some had expected, to tighten policy ahead of the
Dollars 29bn quarterly Treasury refunding auction which started yesterday
and finishes today.
Against a background of fairly quiet trade, the dollar closed in London at
DM1.6705 from DM1.6579 and at Y103.900 from Y102.875. Analysts said the
dollar's recovery had not yet gone far enough to be convincing. In New York
it ended at DM1.6725 and Y104.415.
Elsewhere, the Bundesbank cut the repo rate to 5.35 from 5.41 per cent, in
line with market expectations. There is speculation in the market that the
Bundesbank council may lower the discount rate when it meets today.
Sterling was slightly firmer against the D-Mark on the back of a firmer
dollar, closing at DM2.4907 from DM2.4801. It lost  1/2 cent against the
dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.491.
In his first policy speech to the Lower House of parliament, after taking
office on April 25, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese prime minister, commented:
'Given persistent foreign criticism over the closed nature of Japan's
markets, it is important to change the economic structure . . . in order to
seek gradual shrinkage of the current account surplus.'
He said Japan would also try to restart the deadlocked trade talks with the
US. Mr Hata said Japan must pursue 'drastic' economic reforms for its own
benefit, opening its markets through deregulation and managing its economy
to achieve domestic demand-led growth.
He also said that Japan should implement the economic package adopted in
February and implement the market opening measures, set out in March, by
June.
The inability of Japan to reduce the size of the current account surplus is
widely seen as a reason for recent yen strength.
Earlier Mr Kantor had counselled patience in the stalled US trade talks,
saying: 'With some more discussion, we believe we could re-engage (the trade
talks) on an informal basis.'
Another explanation offered for the firmer dollar was rumoured dollar
buying, later denied, by the Swiss National Bank in the Far East.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said if the
dollar broke above Dollars 1.69 and Y104.50 a sustained appreciation could
be expected. In the short term, a successful refunding auction might improve
the tone of the dollar.
There was talk yesterday of Japanese participation in the auction as a
possible quid pro quo for the US administration toning down its critical
rhetoric.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said the dollar was being
undermined by the rerating of the D-Mark, based upon the upward revision of
German growth forecasts, and money markets now discounting the bottom of
German interest rates in September 1994.
Also lending support to the dollar was some anticipation of a possible 25
basis-point cut in the German discount rate today, from the current 5 per
cent. The rate was last reduced on April 14.
Arguments for and against are fairly evenly split. Although analysts believe
a cut is possible, few believe the Bundesbank is in a position where it must
move.
The repo rate cut to 5.35 per cent means that the Bundesbank has now, over
11 consecutive weeks, lowered the rate by 65 basis points to 5.35 per cent.
German call money was quoted at 5.50/60 per cent after the repo allocation,
from 5.35/50 per cent on Monday. Dealers cited weak bank reserve holdings as
being the reason for firmer rates.
Trade in the futures market was fairly weak, with the June Euromark contract
closing at 95.02 from 95.03. The December contract ended four basis points
firmer at 95.19.
In Europe the Belgian Franc ended unchanged at BFr20.58 per D-Mark after the
Belgian National bank trimmed its central rate to 5.45 per cent from 5.50
per cent.
Mr MacKinnon said the fact that the bank had felt constrained to cut by only
5, instead of the normal 10, basis points 'suggests the pace of easing is
being compelled to slow down (by the rate of decline in German rates)'.
The Italian lira finished firmer at L954.2 against the D-Mark from L958.9.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi was expected to present a new government to President
Scalfaro yesterday evening.
The Bank of England injected Pounds 420m liquidity into the UK money market
after forecasting a Pounds 400m shortage. Overnight money moved in the 3 3/4
to 4 7/8 per cent range. In the futures market the June short sterling
contract closed at 94.60 from 94.56.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (8): Jobs no longer for life / Examining the
labour reform package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in Spain's notoriously rigid labour laws to ease the hiring and
firing of workers are due to take effect in a few weeks - to the distress of
trade unions and the partial satisfaction of employers.
The first part of the controversial labour reform package - the introduction
of low-wage apprenticeship contracts - is already in place. In contrast to
France, where violent protests forced the conservative Balladur government
to withdraw its similar 'professional insertion contract' scheme, Spain's
Socialist government has pressed ahead. More than 70,000 young people have
signed up for the new contracts since the plan was approved in December.
Attempts to negotiate with unions on the changes, which include loosening
administrative restrictions on redundancies, broke down last year, prompting
a partly-successful 24-hour general strike in January.
But the government, having limited the scope of its reforms to what it
judged politically possible for now, has stuck to its guns. The remainder of
the planned changes are due to come into force within the next few days.
The reforms mainly involve:
Apprenticeship contracts for people between the ages of 16 and 25, starting
at 70 per cent of the statutory minimum wage and lasting between six months
and three years;
An end to the monopoly held by the National Employment Institute (INEM) as
job placement agency, making way for private firms;
Significant amendments to the 1980 Workers' Statute, the main plank of
current labour legislation, making it easier to move employees and, to some
extent, to lay them off.
The jobs-for-life mentality is deeply engrained in Spain. The Franco
dictatorship offered no right to strike or free collective bargaining, but
Spaniards became accustomed to security of employment. The 1980 labour
legislation, following a period of militancy by unions legalised after
Franco's death in 1975, combined new rights with a legacy from the past of
heavy state intervention in labour relations.
A significant measure of flexibility was brought into the labour market 10
years ago with provisions for fixed-term employment contracts. Until then,
almost all Spanish employees were on permanent contracts. Now, according to
Dr Simon Milner, a labour relations expert at the London School of
Economics' Centre for Economic Performance, 30 per cent of Spanish workers
are on a fixed-term basis, the highest proportion in Europe.
This deregulation has enabled Spanish companies to adjust more quickly to
changes in demand, especially in the private sector where the short-term
contracts are most prevalent. These employees accounted for much of Spain's
employment growth in the boom years of the late 1980s. However, they also
tend to be the first to suffer in hard economic times. As a result, Dr
Milner says, the proportion of permanent employees with highly protected
jobs has recently been increasing.
The amended Workers' Statute will make it easier for companies to move
employees from one job to another or between different sites. It will also
extend the scope for justifying collective redundancies, not just on
economic or technological grounds as at present but also to meet the needs
of reorganising production.
Employers will have some leeway to make cuts - up to 30 employees or 10 per
cent of the workforce for small companies in any three-month period -
without having to go through the laborious process applied to 'collective'
redundancies. Administrative redundancy procedures, now agonisingly slow,
are to be speeded up.
This in itself promises to reduce the cost of labour adjustments. However,
there is as yet no plan to reduce the level of statutory redundancy
payments.
These now stand at up to 45 days of pay per year of service in cases where a
court deems the redundancies to be unjustified. The minimum level is 20
days, but in practice companies will often opt to pay the higher amount to
avoid having to continue pay salaries until the end of a court case.
According to a European Commission study published last year, average
severance pay in Spain amounted to about 45 weeks, a level equalled only by
Italy and more than twice the average for other EU countries.
Easing redundancies is a delicate task for a Socialist administration facing
the highest unemployment in Europe - almost 24 per cent at the end of last
year, according to the government's quarterly survey - and sometimes
explosive reactions in regions affected by factory cutbacks.
However, a study by the Argentaria banking group reckons that the reform
package as a whole could knock four percentage points off the unemployment
rate between now and 1998. The government hopes that the new work contracts
will help to restrain wage costs and enable Spanish manufacturers to improve
competitiveness without necessarily cutting their workforces.
Business leaders criticise the scope of the reforms, the large amount of red
tape remaining and the discretionary powers left in the hands of judges.
Foreign companies may still be wary about the risks of embarking on new
ventures. The current measures may not be the end of the story, although
ministers are reluctant to talk in terms of a further reform in the near
future. 'Multinationals know that this is something that cannot change from
one day to another,' says one senior government official.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (10): Dial D for dinosaur - A protected
species
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's telecommunications sector is a throwback to a time when the domestic
economy was wholly inward-looking. Mr Jose Borrell, the public works
minister, fiercely protects Telefonica, its prize dinosaur, from today's
competitive climate.
Perhaps nothing illustrates this more poignantly than Telefonica's tariff
structure. The government-controlled monopoly operator has low rates for
inner city calls and by far the highest for international connections.
Mr Borrell is impenitent about his protectionist preferences. He argues that
Telefonica, 32 per cent government-owned, the largest domestic employer and
one of Spain's biggest corporate borrowers, needs to be nurtured in advance
of the domestic industry's deregulation.
But free marketeers suggest that his policy is likely to keep Telefonica fat
and flabby rather than transform it to mean and hungry fitness. 'The Spanish
government gives the impression of being determined to resist to its dying
breath any liberalisation of the telecommunications market beyond that by
which it is legally bound by EC regulations,' James Capel, the London-based
security house, noted in a recent report.
The minister has plenty of critics on the home front as well. In a swingeing
attack on Mr Borrell's department, the government's fair trading agency
asserted: 'Obviously, the Spanish economy cannot hope to be competitive with
such expensive telecommunications.'
Over the next four years, the domestic tariff structure will be turned on
its head in order to adapt to a liberalised telecommunications market.
Charges for inner city calls will be increased by 63 per cent, while the
cost of international calls will come down by an average 40 per cent.
The reduction is urgent, because users in Spain are increasingly bypassing
Telefonica when making foreign connections. An outgoing call to the UK, for
example, costs twice as much as an incoming call using BT or Mercury.
There is less clarity over the deregulation of the cellular sector. Last
month the government slashed prices by about 60 per cent in the mobile
telephone sector which it controls, but has indicated that the award of a
licence to a private cellular operator will be delayed.
The cheaper rates should boost the analogue TMA cellular service, which is
now offered by Telefonica before the introduction of updated GSM telephony
under the deregulation package.
The government originally promised to publish invitations to tender for two
GSM licences - one of which will be reserved for Telefonica, the other going
to a private operator - last year, but the new cellular services are now
unlikely before next year.
Mobile telephony is seen as an important growth market in Spain. It earned
Telefonica Pta25bn (Dollars 181m) in 1992 and Mr Fernando Pardo, a
telecommunications analyst at Price Waterhouse in Madrid, believes that the
cellular business could represent an annual return of Pta250bn by 1997.
Rival consortia seeking the licence include most of Spain's big banks and
corporations in alliance with foreign groups such as GTE and BellSouth of
the US and the UK's Vodaphone.
The sting in the government's cellular deregulation plans is not so much
delay as its decision, under the latest draft plan, to auction the private
sector licence instead of inviting tender bids.
The consortia could be forced to bid about Dollars 500m, according to Mr
Pardo, in their effort to gain the cellular licence, while Telefonica
obtains its own GSM licence free.
The 'protect Telefonica at all costs' policy also seems to shape the
government's approach to cable TV deregulation. Private sector critics say
this draft law, which is now in its fifth but possibly not yet final
version, is weighted towards Telefonica, which would control a great deal of
the cable industry to protect its telephone business.
Whatever the EU directives might dictate, the idea is that a
dinosaur-friendly environment should, as far as possible, be maintained.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (9): Costs are catching up - Foreign
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The blue work jackets of the Santana Motor factory in the Andalucian town of
Linares have become a familiar symbol of industrial protest in Spain over
recent weeks.
The company, a subsidiary of Suzuki, obtained protection from creditors in
February; the Japanese parent declared that it had poured enough money into
it, and then drew up proposals which included cutting 1,500 of the plant's
2,400 jobs.
In an area overwhelmingly dependent on one foreign-owned factory, the
Santana conflict is a paradigm of Spanish worries about multinationals'
commitment to their local operations. The anti-Japanese reaction raised
anxieties about the damage that the row could do to Spain's image among
investors, prompting the government to undertake a public relations campaign
in Tokyo.
It is not the only case. Another Japanese company, Kubota, announced it was
closing its Ebro Kubota tractor factory outside Madrid with 300 jobs. And,
to the anguish of the hard-pressed regional authorities in Andalucia,
Gillette of the US said it would abandon its razor blade plant near Seville,
employing about 240, to concentrate its western European production in
Germany and the UK.
In the eyes of many Spaniards, the multinationals which only a few years ago
seemed to be queueing up to enter Spain are now queueing up to leave.
Not so, insists Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, state secretary at the industry
ministry. For all the hard times multinationals have been facing - including
Volkswagen's Seat car subsidiary and Nissan's Motor Iberica operation, both
high profile acquisitions of the 1980s now going through drastic
restructuring - investment levels remain high, he says.
Net direct investment from abroad, according to the ministry's provisional
estimates, may have exceeded Pta1,000bn (Dollars 7.2bn) last year; less than
in the three previous years but more than any other year in Spain's history
including the boom period of the late 1980s.
The controversy, Mr Molto argues, has come from isolated cases. Suzuki never
wanted overall control of Santana and is in search of a new shareholder.
Ebro Kubota is not the only tractor company that has suffered - John Deere
has stopped production near Madrid. And Gillette's plans have nothing to do
with the profitability of the plant.
Nonetheless, these cases are symptomatic of more widespread concerns about
the competitiveness of Spanish manufacturing operations. Spain is no longer
the obvious place for investors seeking low wages, especially in comparison
with former communist economies in eastern Europe.
'Until a few years ago,' Mr Jose Maria Cuevas, head of the CEOE employers'
organisation, wrote recently, 'Spain was an attractive country for
multinationals, not because it was very productive, but because it produced
at lower cost than other developed countries.' Costs are now close to those
elsewhere. 'If there is still some advantage in labour costs, it is offset
by the gap that still exists in productivity.'
Mr Molto retorts that other factors than wage levels - such as location,
market access and industrial tradition - weigh in investment decisions.
However, a notable aspect of recent investments is that about 90 per cent
involve additional funds for existing operations or purchases of Spanish
companies. Only a small proportion go towards setting up new projects.
Circumstances have changed for many foreign-owned companies, set up in the
1950s, 1960s or 1970s in a protectionist environment in which transferring
production to Spain was the only way of tapping the country's internal
market.
Some older-established subsidiaries set up under Spanish industrialisation
programmes - Gillette, for instance - have been left behind in the move to
new products and technologies. Withdrawals by large multinationals are not
unprecedented. The Santana plant at Linares, for example, used to make Land
Rovers for the Spanish and Latin American market, but the UK company
progressively reduced its commitment in the 1980s before selling out.
General Electric of the US, Westinghouse and Brown Boveri all abandoned
Spanish subsidiaries when the capital goods sector restructured ahead of
Spain's accession to the European Community.
However, EC entry in 1986 prompted an unprecedented spurt of new investment.
As much as half of Spain's manufacturing capacity is reckoned to be in
foreign hands. The motor industry, Spain's chief exporting sector, is
entirely foreign-controlled. Multinationals hold a high proportion of
Spain's chemical and food and drink sectors - increased by Allied-Lyons'
recent takeover of the Domecq wine and spirits group. Of Spain's top 10
exporters, nine are subsidiaries of foreign companies.
Industrial production has declined since 1990 and last year fell 4.3 per
cent. But recovery began in November, when the indices moved ahead of the
previous year's figures. Recent confidence surveys show a marked
improvement.
And if the government needed a psychological fillip to set against the
misadventures of Suzuki in Spain, it received it last month when Nissan's
Barcelona plant started the first regular exports of Spanish-made
four-wheel-drive vehicles to Japan.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (7): Fewer births, more equality - Women are
becoming more visible in public life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<TEXT>
The changing face of Spain may be measured by the investment in
infrastructure, which makes it possible to drive 1,300km from the Portuguese
border to the French frontier without encountering a traffic light. Or it
may be quantified by the surge in sophisticated savings that has prompted a
twofold increase in domestic funds under management over the past year.
The increasing prominence of women is another yardstick of a profoundly
transformed society. In many aspects, Spain is now almost indistinguishable
from its ostensibly richer and more established European Union partners.
With nine women in its 60-member European parliament contingent, Spain has a
marginally higher proportion than the UK and a slightly lower one than
Belgium. The likelihood is that after the European elections in June, the
Spanish proportion of women MEPs will go up.
Ms Marina Subirachs, a sociologist who runs the Instituto de la Mujer, a
government agency created in 1983 to promote women's rights, argues that the
Strasbourg ratio is too low and that the 54 women elected to the 350-member
Madrid parliament in Spain's general elections last year, also representing
a 15 per cent proportion of women, are also far too few.
Echoing the views of those with similar responsibilities for promoting the
interests of women, Ms Subirachs believes the gender breakdown in any
legislative assembly should be 50-50 - give or take a percentage point.
As elsewhere, in Spain women are on track to achieve this political parity.
In 1982, out of 208 director-generals, the top civil service rank, three
were women. By last year 40 out of 289 were women.
The gap is closing in Spain because, as in other European societies, there
are now more women than men enrolled in higher education and gaining
university degrees. By 1976 the number of Spanish girls had overtaken boys
in secondary school enrolment. By 1990 there were as many female as male
undergraduates.
The Instituto de la Mujer notes a growing men-women equality among those who
pass the competitive exams for the main civil service positions. There are
proportionally fewer women entrants to high-flying private sector jobs,
particularly in industry - a fact Ms Subirachs attributes to 'greater
transparency of the civil service's recruitment'.
The growing success of women also owes something to the militancy of Ms
Subirachs and her colleagues, particularly in the Socialist party. Socialist
women carried a motion at the party's 1986 congress that made mandatory a 25
per cent proportion of women on all the party's internal committees. Last
March the congress raised this proportion to 33 per cent.
There was regret last year, after last June's elections, when Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, the prime minister, chose only three women to join his 17-member
government - just one more than in his outgoing cabinet. The party's women's
pressure group had expected six women ministers.
The significant difference between the status and role of women in Spain and
that in other European societies is the low overall women participation in
the labour market. Government surveys show that only 35 per cent of Spanish
women in the 16-65 years old age group are employed, or say they are
actively seeking a job. This is dismally low by EU standards.
But statistics show that 70 per cent of Spanish women under the age of 30
are employed or want employment - double the overall figure. (In Ms
Subirachs's home town of Barcelona the proportion has risen to 80 per cent.)
The overall figure is gradually climbing. During the past year, which has
registered a big rise in unemployment, it has been women, rather than men,
who are finding the scarce jobs available. New regulations encouraging
part-time employment are part of present reform of the existing labour
legislation. They are expected to lead to a significant increase in female
employment.
In the meantime, the fertility rate of childbearing Spanish women has
dropped to 1.2 children - the lowest in Europe, along with the Italian
women's fertility rate. This is a full point down from the 'replacement'
rate of 2.2, which was registered in 1980.
However, there is little difference between Spain and the EU in the battle
over equal pay for women. Although it is illegal to discriminate between
men's and women's salaries on gender grounds, the Instituto de la Mujer
estimates that women's take-home pay is between 20 and 30 per cent less than
men's pay in comparable jobs - a gap similar to that elsewhere in Europe,
Moreover, at far as the Instituto de la Mujer is concerned, male chauvinism
is a fact of life in Spain. But Ms Subirachs, who swaps views on the subject
at international conferences, says: 'Macho man is a very generalised
phenomenon. He is not a specifically Spanish animal and the species is
evolving only very slowly.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (6): Hard choices on welfare - Whether the
public sector can provide all the solutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain is by no means alone in the European Union in having an increasing
deficit problem, but its budget shortfall is bigger and has grown more
quickly than elsewhere, and it looks a lot tougher to control.
At the root of Spain's problem are the accelerated creation, within a short
time, of what western society understands as cradle-to-grave welfare and the
onset of the most severe economic recession in living memory, just when
social spending had reached record levels.
Between 1982 when it came to power and last year when it won a fourth
election, the governing Socialist party spent lavishly on education, health
care, pensions and unemployment benefits. Idealistic (and certainly youthful
in the early 1980s), Mr Felipe Gonzalez's cabinet set out to redress what it
perceived to be glaring social injustices.
Milestones in the welfare drive have included:
Raising the school leaving age to 16; doubling the university student
population; a big schools building programme and greatly increased budgets
for teacher training;
The extension of the health service and of pension rights to the entire
population - regardless of whether individuals had or had not paid social
security contributions;
The creation - virtually from scratch - of a nationwide unemployment benefit
scheme and enormous injections of cash to provide dole money for the
lengthening queues of job seekers.
Mr Gonzalez's governments added a social democratic spin on what was already
a drift towards greater welfare allocations in the aftermath of General
Franco's death and the restoration of democracy in Spain. All in all, social
spending has risen from 27 per cent of GDP in 1977, when Spain staged its
first free elections, to its present level of more than 50 per cent.
The government's welfare commitments hit trouble last year, when GDP shrank
by 1.1 per cent and the rising cost of social spending ran well ahead of
what proved to be sharply diminishing revenues. A planned budget deficit of
3.5 per cent of GDP for 1993 was revised upwards to 4.5 per cent and ended
up as a 7.2 per cent shortfall.
For Mr Pedro Solbes, finance minister, the time for a sombre reckoning as to
where and how can costs be contained and, if possible, reduced, is overdue.
It is a reflection of the magnitude of his task that Mr Solbes has all but
abandoned the EU's economic and monetary union convergence target of a 3 per
cent deficit in 1997 and has circulated draft documents to the cabinet
suggesting that the deficit will stand at 'about' 4 per cent by that date.
To bring the deficit down at all, let alone by three points, the government
will have to jettison much of the social democrat culture it has practised
in the past.
The Socialist party recognised as much last March, when it held its first
national congress in more than three years. It adopted a key resolution
entitled Towards a New Social Democrat Model, which asserted that free
markets and competition were no longer 'obstacles to the construction of
socialism' but 'simple data of existing reality'. The resolution said the
party had to 'abandon a culture' which was 'excessively weighted' towards
the state and which had 'the public sector providing solutions for
everything'.
The choices facing the government, as it turns such principles into
policies, are difficult - and could have unpleasant consequences. University
fees, for example, will have to be substantially increased, which may bring
students out in force on to the streets. (At present 85 per cent of the cost
of a student's education is picked up by the tax payer.)
Much more controversial is the need for a radical overhaul of the state
pension scheme. The present system, which features pensions based on 100 per
cent of average earnings during the eight years previous to retirement, is
more generous than in richer EU countries, where a lifetime's average
earnings is often the norm. More importantly, it is unsustainable.
Spending on pensions represented Pta1,596bn (Dollars 11.4bn) in 1982 and
grew to 9.8 per cent of GDP - Pta5,758bn - in 1992. There are now 5.3m
Spaniards over the age of 65 - more than double the total 30 years earlier.
In 1993 the average age of new pensioners was 63, two years below the
official retirement age, reflecting the increasing number of employees who
had opted for voluntary redundancies and early retirement.
Mr Joaquin Almunia, a former cabinet minister who now chairs a parliamentary
committee examining the future of the social security system, argues that
the mandatory retirement age of 65 for civil servants should be raised to
70; that incentives should be introduced for those who choose to continue
working after the age of 65; and that pensions themselves should be based on
a longer earnings time scale.
Unless such reforms are introduced, Spain will not be able to pay pensions
in 2025-2020 - the decade when the domestic baby boomers - there was a high
Spanish birth rate between 1955-1965 - are due to retire.
The problem is made more difficult now by the collapse of Spain's birth
rate. The fertility rate - the average number of children per woman of
child-bearing age - has dropped from 2.6 per cent in 1977 and 2.2 per cent
in 1980 to 1.2 per cent, one of the lowest in Europe.
Mr Almunia suggests that the shrinking youth population means that Spain
will have to import labour in the coming years. Spanish society will thus be
facing for the first time the problems which can accompany a large immigrant
population.
Nonetheless, the biggest immediate problems - insofar as they are most
directly responsible for the growing deficit - are the health care and, in
particular, the unemployment welfare systems. Current spending on
unemployment represents 4 per cent of GDP - one of the highest ratios in the
EU. Proportionally, Spain has by far the highest number of registered
unemployed.
The government is now reducing the number of pharmaceutical products
available free under the health care system and is negotiating lower costs
with drug producers. On the unemployment front, it is increasing its
inspections of unemployment fraud.
But tougher decisions are required. These range from deregulating the
stranglehold which pharmacies exert over the health care sector, to bringing
the spendthrift employment institute, the INEM, under direct control of the
treasury.
Along with thorough-going reforms, two things have to happen before Spain's
public finances pick themselves up off the floor. First, the economy must
recover - and recover strongly. Second, the limitations of a welfare system
must be properly understood by politicians and by voters.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (2): The nationalists are the powerbrokers -
One political cycle may have ended. But when will the next begin?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the leader of the opposition, says that the general
elections last June marked the end of a political cycle and the start of a
new one. He implies that the day when he will take power as head of a
centre-right Partido Popular (PP) government is at hand.
The first assertion is indisputably true, for last year's vote ended the
overall parliamentary majority that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist prime
minister, had enjoyed over three terms since 1982. But the timing of the
next cycle is open to doubt - quite apart from the inevitability of the big
swing to the PP that Mr Aznar takes for granted.
Opinion polls indicate that the PP opposition is likely to win June's
European elections and that the Socialists will suffer their first
nationwide electoral defeat in 12 years. But Mr Gonzalez, although he is
short of a parliamentary majority can in theory stagger on until 1997.
This seems to be what Mr Gonzalez wants to do. Corruption scandals have
severely dented his credibility but he is hoping that over the next two
years the economy will recover sufficiently to bring him, or his anointed
successor in the socialist party, back to power.
But even with expert corruption damage control, the prime minister can only
stagger on in theory. Mr Gonzalez does not, in fact, control the timing of
the next cycle, any more than Mr Aznar does. The powerbrokers of domestic
politics are Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalists, and to a
lesser extent Mr Javier Arzallus, the leader of the Basque nationalists.
When a hung parliament was returned after last June's elections, the 17
representatives of Catalonia's Covergencia i Unio (CiU) group in parliament
and the five members of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) joined forces
with the 159 Socialist deputies to ensure the necessary majority in the
350-member legislature for Mr Gonzalez's investiture as prime minister for a
fourth term. After long negotiations between Mr Gonzalez's Socialists and Mr
Pujol's CiU, the Catalan nationalists subsequently voted alongside the
socialists to push the government's budget through parliament last autumn
and its labour market reform legislation in the spring.
The prime minister needs the nationalist votes to remain in power - just as
the opposition leader needs them to prevent the Socialist government serving
out its full term. A Catalan and Basque defection to Mr Aznar's 141-strong
PP camp in parliament would sooner rather than later trigger a mid-term
general election.
There is nothing intrinsically worrying about a parliament in which a
minority party, or in this case two minority parties, can make or break
governments. But the situation in the Madrid parliament is different.
Fundamentally, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar subscribe to the same agenda. Mr
Pujol and Mr Arzallus share a different one.
The two nationalist leaders make no bones about the fact that their guiding
political principle is an ever-greater degree of home rule for Catalonia and
for the Basque country respectively. As powerbrokers, the Catalan and the
Basque nationalist parties are in an ideal position to exert the leverage
which will further their political aims.
To push through legislation, Mr Gonzalez he has often had to resign himself
to painstaking horse-trading on a case-by-case basis. As a result of the
budget negotiations, Mr Pujol obtained a measure of fiscal autonomy for the
Generalitat, the Barcelona-based Catalan government. He will certainly want
more this coming autumn (under the present arrangement the Generalitat keeps
15 per cent of the income tax raised in Catalonia) when the 1995 budget is
debated.
Meanwhile, the PNV has abstained from further support for the government and
Mr Arzallus has recently stepped up his nationalist rhetoric to emphasise
Basque separateness. This is because elections to the 75-member Basque
parliament are scheduled for October; this regional poll pits the PNV
against the Socialists, the other main party in the area.
Mr Arzallus is right to be concerned that PNV votes will be lost to Basque
radicals and to the conservative PP if his mainstream Nationalist party
continues to back the Socialist government in Madrid. Mr Pujol, who shares
the Basque leader's Christian Democrat policies, will face the same worry in
the spring of 1996, when elections to the 135-member Catalan parliament take
place, because the CiU's main rival is also the Socialist party.
The consequences of a hung parliament and of nationalist party powerbrokers
are only now beginning to be properly digested by analysts.
It is very possible that neither the socialists nor the PP, that is to say
the national parties as opposed to the nationalist parties, will in future
elections obtain the sort of commanding majority that from 1982-93 allowed
Mr Gonzalez to dictate terms to the Pujols and the Arzalluses of Spain's
political establishment.
This means that, whether they like it or not, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar will
have to accept the inexorable drift towards federalism of Spanish politics.
It is Mr Pujol who best understands - or at least best explains - what
Spanish-style federalism could mean.
The Catalan leader will continue to press for fiscal autonomy for his
region's 6m population and he will also step up his campaign to make Catalan
the language used in the area's schools.
But his central ambition is a loosely federated Spain in which the Spanish
monarch is not King of Spain but King of 'the Spains' - reigning over a
federation of nationalities.
Mr Arzallus's authority extends over an area where nationalism has more
confrontational overtones. Radical Basques, who represent at least 15 per
cent of the area's 1.2m electorate, seek secession from Spain; they give
political respectability to the ETA organisation which has been responsible
for about 600 deaths in its 25-year-old campaign for Basque independence.
On practical issues, for example, Mr Arzallus wants Basques to have sole
prerogatives over the area's ports and airports and over social security
budgets for the elderly and the unemployed. In all, there are 54 devolution
'chapters' that the PNV has placed on the negotiating table.
But the Basque leader's ideal is to have an enlarged Basque country,
incorporating parts of south-west France and the adjoining Spanish province
of Navarre, forming a Basque nation within the European Union. A former
Jesuit and very much a realist despite his rhetoric, Mr Arzallus will settle
for sort of monarch-viceroy relationship that is championed by Mr Pujol.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar discuss in private the dangers of a
drift towards a federalism and jointly exploring what they call a 'unity of
criteria' over the new framework of Spanish politics. They want to agree on
ground rules which will allow them to say 'enough is enough' to nationalist
pressure.
Neither politician relishes the prospect of Catalan or Basque parties
setting the timing of political cycles. Nor are Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar at
all comfortable with a leverage which allows the nationalists to pursue
their separate agendas.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (5): Bank at head of the pack - Santander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander's acquisition of Banesto at the end of last month has
changed the land - scape of Spanish banking. In the past, most of the estate
belonged to four, roughly equal, landowners. After San- tander's Dollars
2.05bn purchase, there is one very sizeable domain and a trio of compar-
atively smaller holdings.
Before the auction, Santander was the most international and most profitable
of the big Spanish banks. It had more funds under management than its
rivals. But Argentaria, the state-controlled bank, had a bigger loan
portfolio, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) had more assets and Banco Central
Hispano Americano had more bank branches.
With Banesto under its belt, Santander outstrips the rest across the board
of financial services to become the unquestioned leader of domestic banking.
The assets of the combined banking group, according to San- tander's
calculations, rank number 22 in Europe and 45 in the world.
The second consequence of the Banesto saga - its inter- vention by the
authorities, its rescue and its subsequent sale - is the fillip it has
provided to the whole domestic banking sector. In the space of four months,
and at a cost of some Dollars 3.7bn, the sector has cleaned up the mess
caused by the collapse of one its largest and most traditional members.
The Bank of Spain, which stage-managed the auction through the Deposit
Guarantee Fund, and the private banks which provided a high proportion of
the funds required to cover Banesto's losses, proved themselves well up to
the task of coping with the crisis. The reputation and solidity of Spain's
financial system emerge enhanced as a result.
In the aftermath of the auction, a third lesson is taking shape. This is
linked to Santander's extraordinarily strong bid - well over what others had
valued Banesto - to gain what Mr Emilio Botin, the bank's chairman, called
'a unique opportunity'.
The oddest feature of Santander's determination to obtain Banesto is that Mr
Botin's strategy had in past years focused on building up the bank's network
in Latin America and by further boosting its international business through
equity holdings in First Fidelity of the US and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
In contrast, Santander had sold three banking subsidiaries in Spain, two of
them to Credit Lyonnais.
Spain, and specifically retail banking on the home front, appeared to come
low on Mr Botin's list of priorities. In past years he had also allocated
resources and time to developing the merchant banking activities of the
group through Banco Santander de Negocios, the unit run by his daughter, Ms
Ana Patricia Botin, which has now been renamed Santander Investment.
Now Santander's chairman seems to have turned this strategy on its head by
acquiring Banesto, a bank that is emphatically Spanish and has historically
been involved in the country's major industries, and whose main asset is an
extensive branch network that reaches deep into the rural nooks and crannies
of la Espana profunda.
The lesson therefore has to do with what Mr Botin, whose family name is a
by-word in Spain for conservatism and banking professionalism, feels about
the future of the domestic economy. A working assumption is that Mr Botin is
betting on domestic growth and that he is certain that there are a lot of
pesetas to be made in Spain's small towns and pueblos.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (3): Recovery seems likely - David White
considers the economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a fair bet that unemployment in Spain will cross the 25 per cent
barrier this year.
No doubt the official rate, as measured by the National Statistics
Institute's quarterly survey, includes several percentage points which
correspond to people who work on the black market. Still, to citizens of
most other European countries facing half that unemployment rate or less, it
might well seem beyond tolerable limits. It is a testimony to the resilience
of Spain's extended family-based society that it can bear it.
Last year the figure rose by more than 600,000 to 3.68m, by far the
largest-ever increase and the most telling evidence of Spain's most horrible
economic year of recent memory. Gross domestic product fell by 1 per cent,
the sharpest recession in three decades. Only once in that period had the
economy shown an annual decline - in 1981, and then by 0.2 per cent. In the
first four years of Spanish membership of what is now the European Union, it
had grown by an average 4.8 per cent a year.
Mr Pedro Solbes, the independent technocrat promoted last year to economy
and finance minister, says he is confident that Spain is on its way to
recouping last year's slide and achieving positive growth of more than 1 per
cent, possibly close to 1.5 per cent. With domestic demand depressed, the
impetus for renewed growth is coming from exports and tourism.
Spain's competitive position has improved in the wake of the three peseta
devaluations between September 1992 and May 1993. Exports have been showing
strong growth - not only to the rest of the EU, with which Spain was in
surplus in January for the first time since it joined, but also to Latin
America and emerging Asian economies.
Tourism looks as if it may enjoy a boom year, helped by exchange rates - and
by political violence in a number of other traditional Mediterranean
destinations. The number of visitors to Spain this year is expected to
surpass last year's 57m. Of the total, it is reckoned about 40m can be
classified as tourists, roughly equal to the resident population.
This combination can be expected almost to wipe out the traditional deficit
in Spain's balance of payments current account, which fell last year by
two-thirds to Pta632bn. Some analysts believe the figure could move into
surplus for the first time since 1986, the year of Spanish EU accession. Mr
Solbes, however, believes that expectation would be 'excessive'.
Encouraged by a slight reduction in March in the number of unemployed
registering with the National Employment Agency - a figure which in the past
few years has shown a wide discrepancy with the quarterly survey - Mr Solbes
believes unemployment will peak, beginning to fall towards the end of the
year, and more sharply in 1995 and 1996.
Most private forecasts are less optimistic on short-term growth than the
government's, however. Mr Jaime de Pinies, head of research at Santander
Investment, the merchant banking arm of Banco Santander, predicts GDP growth
of 0.7 per cent for the year, or roughly half the official forecast. But he
sees the economy picking up speed, growing towards the end of the year at an
annual rate of 1.6 per cent. Next year he predicts 2 per cent growth,
reaching an annual rate of 3 per cent late in the year.
The climate is now favoured by a stable peseta and the lowest interest rates
for many years. Last month the Bank of Spain's benchmark rate was reduced to
below 8 per cent for the first time since 1977. The 12-month inflation rate
stubbornly stuck at 5 per cent in the first three months of this year,
slightly higher than 1992 levels, but is generally expected to fall below 4
per cent for the year, with the government target set at 3.5 per cent. Wage
growth is for the moment contained.
The risk which Mr Solbes recognises, however, is that in two or three years,
with wage pressures undermining competitiveness and domestic demand pushing
the current account deep into deficit, Spain could find itself once again
having to devalue its way out of trouble.
'There is no doubt we have to be very careful,' Mr Solbes says, emphasising
the need for wage moderation and control of government spending. Average
wages last year rose by 2 per cent above inflation - 'a paradox' in a period
of soaring unemployment. It makes no sense, he says, that the only option
for Spanish companies wishing to become more competitive should be to shed
jobs when there is such a large reserve of spare labour.
He also argues that the government needs to 'go further' in steps to control
spending, and is running out of leeway to increase tax revenues. The overall
public sector deficit rose by 69 per cent last year to 7.3 per cent of GDP.
Mr Solbes says it would be 'very hard' to bring this down to 3 per cent by
1997, one of the targets set in the EU's convergence programme for the third
phase of economic and monetary union. He advocates welfare reforms and
reduced subsidies to loss-making state companies.
But all these measures are politically difficult. Although the ruling
Socialist party, at its March conference, endorsed government free-market
policies and a 'rigorous choice' in public spending, these policies are
unlikely to please the party's grass-roots supporters.
Last month, the government launched a series of television, radio and
newspaper advertisements to persuade Spaniards to be public-spirited and pay
their taxes. As a public relations exercise, however, it backfired: on the
morning of the launch reports appeared alleging that the former governor of
the Bank of Spain had avoided taxes on profits from stock investments while
in office.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (1): The periphery is just too far out -
Afraid it may be consigned to the margins of the European Union, Spain is
seeking ways to re-enter the international mainstream
</HEADLINE>

Europe  .. goodbye. That was how the headline ran. It was enough to make
anyone stop short, coming as it did in the heat of final negotiations for
enlarging the European Union from 12 countries to 16. Could it be that,
eight years after Spain's long-awaited and enthusiastic entry, the
experience of Europe had produced such disenchantment?
belonged to Marca, Spain's biggest-selling sports daily. The story was no
more than Real Madrid being knocked out simultaneously from European
football and basketball competitions. Nobody in Spain is against Europe or
even seriously Euro-sceptical. Joining fulfilled an aspiration of 40 years.
For Spaniards, Europe is a synonym for modernity.
But even so, in the words of one senior government official, 'Spain is
losing its European virginity.' The terms for enlargement have created some
bitterness. The new Nordic members - sometimes referred to as 'Vikings' -
are felt to have been better treated than Spain. The EU's centre of gravity
is perceived to be shifting towards the north and east. Having joined in
order to end its historic isolation on the periphery of Europe, Spain sees
itself in danger of being consigned back to the margins.
Criticised by the opposition for not having exacted better terms for Spanish
membership, Socialist administration officials are frustrated at not having
obtained more leverage in the compromise over EU council voting rights. They
feel that a country of 39m people should be less easily overruled.
There is also a widespread feeling - partly the result of high expectations
 -that Spain might have got more out of membership, although it continues to
be a net recipient of EU funds.
From its entry in 1986 until 1991, Spain enjoyed faster growth than the
average among its European partners. Since then, it has fared worse than
average. Last year's 1 per cent fall in gross domestic product was the worst
performance since Spain began opening its economic borders under the Franco
regime's 1959 stabilisation programme. And although activity shows signs of
picking up, it is unclear when or whether Spain can regain its growth
premium and start catching up again with its richer northern partners.
The gilt from the showpiece year of 1992 - the Barcelona Olympics and the
Seville Expo - has flaked off. Just as Spaniards were late in waking up to
recession, which began that year, so too the perception of deep economic
crisis still persists, despite the evidence of economic improvement.
Unemployment - the actual size of which lies somewhere between the 18 per
cent registered with the National Employment Institute and the 24 per cent
classed as unemployed in the government's quarterly survey - is the highest
among OECD countries. Spain has 1m households in which nobody has a job.
Although its economy has grown almost threefold in the last 30 years and its
population has risen by a quarter, there are no more jobs now than there
were in 1964.
The government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez needed a period of stability while
nurturing the economy back to health. But its hopes have been dramatically
shaken by a political crisis over corruption scandals.
Public outrage over the cases of Mr Mariano Rubio, alleged to have salted
away stock investment gains in a secret account while governor of the Bank
of Spain, and Mr Luis Roldan, another Socialist appointee who managed to
amass a real estate fortune while head of the paramilitary Civil Guard, has
created a serious predicament for the government, provoking two ministerial
resignations and the departure from parliament of two of Mr Gonzalez's
former cabinet colleagues.
Despite the resignations and promises of a crackdown on corruption and
unrelenting prosecution of offenders, the Socialists' credibility has been
gravely damaged by the affairs. The dirty linen of 11 years in power is
being dragged out of the closet. More is likely to come out through a
parliamentary committee set up to investigate party financing. Mr Gonzalez
may have difficulty salvaging his own 'clean' image, which up to now has
been a vital political asset. Both the conservative Popular Party headed by
Mr Jose Maria Aznar and the communist United Left have done their best to
pin responsibility for the affairs on Mr Gonzalez himself.
The prime minister faces the probability of heavy setbacks in June in the
European parliament ballot and in regional elections the same day in his
home ground of Andalucia. His party, divided by clan rivalries, has lost
much of its support among the young and in urban centres.
Mr Gonzalez himself often appears remote, while government power has become
increasingly concentrated in the Moncloa Palace, the prime ministerial
complex outside Madrid. Most of his ministers are virtually unknown to
ordinary Spaniards. Only two cabinet ministers besides himself have survived
from the original 1982 team photo, and only three since 1990.
it is clear that Mr Gonzalez is counting on economic recovery to revive the
Socialist party's worn image by the next gen- eral election, due at the
latest in 1997. Last year it scraped through to win a fourth term but in a
hung parliament, depending on support from the 17 deputies of the Catalan
nationalist party, Converg- encia i Unio. The alliance, like the one between
the Socialists and the Basque Nationalist party in the Basque country, is
delicate. The push towards ever greater autonomy in the two regions creates
a constant, nagging unease at the centre of Spanish politics, made worse in
the Basque case by the persistence of sporadic terrorist killings.
How long a weakened Mr Gonzalez can rely on the parliamentary support he
needs is uncertain. For the moment, however, the economically-conservative
nationalists are willing to back the government in its pursuit of pragmatic
free-market policies, aimed at opening up monopolies, curbing the budget
deficit and creating favourable conditions for business and job creation.
Against trade union opposition, the government is pressing ahead with a
package of labour reforms to relax the notoriously stringent rules on hiring
and firing. Although the idea of lifetime job security will be hard to
dislodge, the Spaniards are coming around to the realisation that these
rules might actually impede the creation of new employ- ment. As has been
demonst- rated enough times before in the history of post-Franco Spain,
seemingly entrenched attitudes do not necessarily survive from one chapter
to the next.
There can be no better example of this kind of sea change than the row over
Nato membership, culminating in a 1986 referendum which almost unseated Mr
Gonzalez from office within three months of Spain's joining the European
Community. Spaniards today must wonder what the crisis was all about. These
days Spain is virtually a full Nato participant and 1,400 Spanish troops
serve alongside British, French and Canadian UN battalions in Bosnia-
Hercegovina, the biggest force deployed outside Spanish territories since
the Blue Division went to fight under German command on the Russian front.
Spanish opinion is just as happy to have them there as it was hostile, a few
years back, to any idea of having soldiers engaged abroad. The fact that
Spain is now seen playing a prominent and responsible role, in the midst of
a conflict with many echoes of its own civil war of a previous generation,
is a token of its re-entry into the international mainstream.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's cashless trade in
Kazakhstan's gas - Diplomacy is keeping an 'incomprehensible' system going
Robert Corzine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Political confusion as well as natural gas condensate flows along the
pipeline that links the giant Karachaganak gas condensate field in
Kazakhstan with one of the world's largest de-sulphurisation plants in the
neighbouring Russian region of Orenburg in the southern Urals.
The break-up of the former Soviet Union has left an international border
running through an oil and gas-rich area developed according to a single
integrated plan. Production on both sides of the frontier has been
maintained. But there is deep political and economic uncertainty about the
future relationship between the various elements of the industry.
It is compounded by a chain of non-payments. In the case of Orenburg,
Gazprom, the integrated Russian gas company that runs the processing plant,
pays nothing to the Kazakhs for the 3.2m tonnes of Karachaganak condensate
it processes each year. And it receives no payment from the refinery 400km
away in the autonomous Russian republic of Bashkiria, to which it sends the
partly treated condensate.
'Its incomprehensible as to how the system works,' concedes Mr Vladimir
Mirkitanov, an official of the regional government. But the products
continue to flow because it is diplomatically expedient for them to do so.
Officials say much effort is being spent to 're-create torn ties' with
Kazakhstan on a commercial basis. But there are also moves to boost the
capability of the regional energy industry to operate more independently, a
development which is mirrored in other energy-rich regions throughout
Russia.
The debate in Orenburg and elsewhere over the future structure of their oil
and gas industries includes the degree to which regions control their
resources and the role of foreign companies. The outcome is not only crucial
to the economic well-being of the producing areas; over time it could affect
the level of Russian oil production and the amount it can export.
The debate in Orenburg has been given added flavour by frequent
interventions by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, who was
born in the area and began his previous career in the Russian gas industry
with the local Gazprom subsidiary.
He recently chided managers at the local gas industry, which produces about
6 per cent of Russian gas, for failing to move more quickly on plans to
expand the number of products recovered from the raw gas.
Regional officials say recent annual oil output of about 7.5m tonnes has
matched the best levels achieved during the Soviet era. But Mr Chernomyrdin
has criticised the local industry for skimming off the 'cream' of the
resource, and failing to realise the full potential of existing wells.
Mr Vladimir Yelagin, Orenburg's president, believes increased production of
oil, gas and minerals - combined with a move towards extracting more
valuable refined products from raw resources - is the key to developing the
region. But Orenburg needs to gain control over a greater portion of its
resources and attract foreign investment if it is to implement a strategy of
using such reserves as collateral for loans to finance conversion of defence
plants and non-energy joint ventures.
At present regions control 10 per cent of their resources, but are demanding
50 per cent. But even if they succeed in the political struggle with Moscow,
the problem of attracting foreign capital remains.
The take up of schemes to encourage export-oriented energy joint ventures
has so far been patchy. It is also uncertain how many companies will take
advantage of a privatisation plan which will allow foreigners to bid for 20
per cent of the shares in regional oil companies later this year.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper prices beat retreat -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices finished lower at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, with
the market beating a retreat from new 13-month highs on expected technical
selling and profit-taking.
The high-water mark for three months delivery was Dollars 2,097 a tonne, but
final business was at Dollars 2,073, down Dollars 4 from Monday's after
hours close.
Other metals were pulled back from artificially high levels by copper,
although ALUMINIUM proved resilient, and continued its technical
base-building above the Dollars 1,330-a-tonne level.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Survey shows gold investment
rallied strongly in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 348 tonnes of investment gold, the highest level for more than ten
years, was bought in 1993, compared with only 69 tonnes in 1992, according
to the latest survey of the market by the Gold Fields Minerals Services
research group.
A revival of interest in gold was sparked among American and some European
investors by the well-publicised activities in April and May last year of
two high-profile international financiers, Sir James Goldsmith and Mr George
Soros.
They helped to end a five-year bear market in gold and lift the price by
Dollars 60 a troy ounce, or about 18 per cent, during 1993.
On the other hand, a combination of higher prices and economic weakness in
Europe and Japan caused the first fall in the use of gold in fabrication in
the western world since 1987. The drop was particularly noticeable in the
jewellery sector - which accounts for more than 70 per cent of gold demand
and used almost 7 per cent less gold: 2,302 tonnes against 2,474 in 1992.
Mr Stewart Murray, GFMS managing director, pointed out yesterday that
speculators and investors could drive the market either way this year,
depending on such things as their perception of whether the US authorities
had inflation under control. This made it impossible to make sensible price
forecasts.
Nevertheless, 'based on figures for the first quarter of 1994, it appears
that consumers in the main Asian markets have adjusted to the higher price
levels, and there is now good support for gold in the Dollars 370 to Dollars
390 an ounce range'.
Mr Murray admitted some producers might find it worrying that with the
average price for the year only 4.6 per cent up from 1992 a record 516
tonnes of scrap supply was encouraged into the market, mainly from the
recycling of old jewellery. However, he said the flow was not surprising,
given the rapid rise in the past few years of the 'pool' of gold jewellery.
Last year there were special factors such as many Indian investors turning
temporarily from jewellery to bars of gold, property and equities. Also many
of the Saudi Arabian sales were to exchange old jewellery for items of more
modern design.
Other points from the survey, the fifth since GFMS - which is financially
supported by Gold Fields of South Africa, that country's second-largest gold
producer, and Newmont, the biggest North American producer - took it over,
include:
Mine production outside the former eastern bloc countries rose only 2 per
cent to 1,891 tonnes, the lowest growth in output since 1980;
Both average western world cash and total mine production costs fell by 5
per cent, to Dollars 233 an ounce and Dollars 285 respectively;
Forward sales by gold mining companies increased to their highest level
since 1990 and the second highest level since 1980 - 180 tonnes against 165
in 1992;
Central bank sales added a net 475 tonnes to supply, down from 626 tonnes.
Gross sales totalled 608 tonnes involving 22 central banks or other
government organisations. In 1992 some 18 official organisations sold 978
tonnes, including 600 tonnes sold between them by the Belgian and Dutch
central banks;
Global supply was slightly down, from 3,570 tonnes to 3,538, even though
output in the Commonwealth of Independent States is estimated to have held
up well at 244 tonnes against 237 tonnes;
The so-called 'global gap' between supply and physical demand narrowed from
700 to 300 tonnes. Mr Murray asked: 'Will private or official holders fill
the gap as they did last year or will the price have to rise to tease the
gold out?'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cyprus rebids for Chilean
copper

<TEXT>
Cyprus Amax, the US mining group, showed it was still interested buying 51
per cent of El Abra in Chile, one of the world's biggest undeveloped copper
deposits, by delivering a revised offer to Codelco of Chile six days ahead
of the May 15 deadline.
No details were given of the revised terms. Cyprus and its partner Lac
Minerals of Canada asked for changes after tests showed the copper content
of the El Abra ore was lower than suggested by Codelco's test work. Lac
recently said it would hand its share of the project to Cyprus, if the new
offer was accepted.
Codelco's board will consider the new offer on May 18. It has said that it
will call another international tender if the bid fails to meet
requirements. Two of the world's biggest mining groups, BHP of Australia and
RTZ of the UK, which lost to Cyprus in the first tender, have indicated they
may rebid.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures burst through
Dollars 1,900 a tonne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures stared briefly into the abyss yesterday before regaining
their poise and bursting back through Dollars 1,900 a tonne to a fresh
five-year high, up 6.7 per cent on the day.
The London robusta market began strongly but then dropped over Dollars 70
after New York arabica futures stumbled into profit-taking shortly after the
opening. The subsequent recovery in New York fired London into another round
of buying.
The July contract in London closed up Dollars 122 at Dollars 1,935, just
below the day's high of Dollars 1,947. In afternoon trading in New York, the
second position was up marginally at 109.2 cents a pound.
'I think the two markets are goading each other on,' said one London trader.
However, the dip in New York had 'put the frighteners on' because US funds
were believed to be about 30,000 lots long.
Traders have been warning of a huge correction after the London market's 62
per cent rise this year, much of it in the past two weeks. But news
yesterday that arabica coffee producers are free to release 50 per cent of
their stocks now that the trigger price has passed 85 cents a pound caused
only a blip in the upward momentum.
'Sometimes a market just goes and goes and goes,' said Mr Bill O'Neill,
analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'We view stocks as being extremely
tight and the fundamental situation as constructive. But we're starting to
discount a lot of the news. We should be cautious.' He added, however, that
further gains might be justified by the significant reductions in Colombian
and Brazilian crops and high internal prices in Brazil, which were
discouraging exports.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Lloyds Bank funds C&amp;G bid
</HEADLINE>

Lloyds Bank's Pounds 400m two-tranche transaction of subordinated debt
dominated a relatively busy day in the international bond market yesterday.
Of the total, which Lloyds said would satisfy all its loan requirements in
relation to its proposed takeover of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society, Pounds 300m was raised through an offering of five-year
floating-rate notes - exchangeable at the bank's option into a further
10-year issue - priced to yield 70 basis points over three-month Libor.
The balance was made up of an issue of 15-year fixed-rate bonds priced to
yield 110 basis points over the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2008.
Dealers noted that the spread on Lloyds' 10-year subordinated bonds launched
in February stood at 90 basis points yesterday, so it was paying an extra 20
basis points for the additional five years.
Mr John Gillbe, chief manager group finance at Lloyds Bank, said the
structure of the deal was designed to keep the average cost as low as
possible. In addition, the call option on the FRNs gave the bank flexibility
with its capital requirements. 'We may not need the capital for that long,'
he said.
Syndicate managers said the greater proportion of FRNs and the generous
pricing reflected Lloyds' desire to overcome difficult market conditions and
ensure a successful transaction. 'It was a greedy trade by people who need
the money,' said one syndicate manager.
The three joint lead managers, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and S. G.
Warburg, said the FRNs sold quicker than the fixed-rate bonds.
The perception that the FRNs were cheap caused the discounted margin on the
notes to tighten to 62 1/2 basis points over Libor at one stage. However, it
settled at 65 basis points in late trading.
By contrast, the fixed-rate bonds went almost exclusively to UK institutions
and the spread remained unchanged when they were freed to trade.
'There is not the same depth of demand for fixed-rate sterling bonds as
there was three months ago,' said Salomon. However, S. G. Warburg said the
statement by Lloyds that it had no further plans to raise loan capital
facilitated sales.
Elsewhere, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, raised
FFr1.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds.
Joint lead manager SBC said Unilever's wide following among institutional
and retail investors enabled it to achieve pricing comparable with French
public sector debt. Eurofima, L'Oreal and Carrefour are also thought to be
looking to raise French francs.
Standard &amp; Poor's has revised its outlook on the Republic of Ireland's
long-term foreign currency rating of double-A minus to positive from stable.
The revision reflects the government's adherence to conservative demand
management policies and structural reform.
IBCA, the rating agency, has upgraded Fokus Bank of Norway to A - from BBB+,
writes Karen Fossli from Oslo.
The move follows a strong improvement in the bank's financial position.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Overseas buying helps US Treasuries
rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices yesterday staged an impressive rally from Monday's
losses, aided by overseas buying, dealer short-covering and a successful
three-year note auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 17/32 at 85
7/32 , yielding 7.497 per cent. Prices were also markedly firmer at the
short end of the market, where the two-year note was up  7/32 at 98 27/32 ,
to yield 6.114 per cent.
The bond market got off to a positive start yesterday due to strong
overnight buying of Treasuries by Japanese and Middle Eastern investors.
That demand quickly triggered buying in New York, which forced many dealers
hurriedly to buy securities to cover their short positions.
Later in the day, prices jumped further after the auction of Dollars 17bn in
three-year notes met heavy demand - much of it, it was said, from foreign
investors. The successful three-year sale raised hopes that today's auction
of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes would also pass well.
In spite of the gains, however, analysts said that the mood of the market
remained restrained in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision not to
raise interest rates on Monday. Investors and traders had been hoping that
the Fed would tighten monetary policy to slow the economy and stifle
inflation. It is now thought likely that the Fed will not make a move until
the May 17 meeting of its policy-making open market committee.
European government bond markets temporarily recovered their composure,
closing higher as the Bundesbank's decision to cut its closely-watched repo
rate yesterday raised market hopes of a further cut in the key discount rate
at today's Bundesbank council meeting.
The securities repurchase, or repo, rate fell from 5.41 per cent to 5.35 per
cent, with the Bundesbank adding a net DM1.1bn in liquidity, and narrowing
the gap between the repo and the discount rate, which effectively provides
the floor for money market rates.
The move, which was within the market's expected range, prompted speculation
that the Bundesbank will cut its discount rate by 25 basis points today to
4.75 per cent, and that the Bank of France will have room to ease again,
possibly at next Monday's repo.
The European markets have been jittery since Friday, when the release of the
latest US payroll data sparked fears of an imminent rise in short-term US
interest rates.
'There is mounting speculation that we could see the Federal Reserve raise
rates on Wednesday while the Bundesbank could cut rates,' said Mr Kit
Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
Adding to the optimistic mood in the bund market was the fact that April
inflation was revised downwards from 3.2 per cent year-on-year to 3.1 per
cent.
Meanwhile, news that the German March M3 figure was revised upwards to 15.4
per cent, from a preliminary figure of 15.2 per cent, was largely ignored by
the market.
Dealers commented that there was very little cash business, with most of the
activity taking place in the futures market. The bund futures contract
opened at 94.27 and slipped back to a low of 94.25 soon afterwards, but then
picked up and recovered to reach 95.10 by late afternoon.
UK government bonds gained  3/8 points despite a volatile session, but the
most important news came after the gilt market had closed, when the Bank of
England released its quarterly bulletin and inflation report.
The Bank revised upwards its inflation forecast for 1995, citing higher
monetary growth and rising labour market costs. However, dealers said the
gilt futures contract climbed a quarter point from 103.15 to 103.23 in
after-hours trading as participants chose to focus on the relatively
favourable short-term inflation outlook.
Japanese government bond prices closed higher, driven up by modest domestic
buying and helped by the Bank of Japan's decision to inject liquidity at its
money market operations.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Equity Issues: Austria launches road-show to
promote sell-offs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Austria is launching an international campaign to promote forthcoming
privatisation issues and broaden the appeal of the Vienna stock exchange.
The government hopes to raise around Dollars 500m from the sale of its 51
per cent stake in VA-Tech, the engineering, power and construction group,
shortly. Altogether, 7.65m shares are being offered (at an indicated price
range of Sch820 - Sch920 per share), with 4.59m of those available to
international investors.
The deal is being priced on Friday and Mr Viktor Klima, minister for the
nationalised industries and transport, will be in London tomorrow to
publicise the event. In all, it is hoped privatisation will raise around
Sch20bn over the next 18 months.
Sales will include Sch4bn for Boehler-Udderholm, the steel maker, and
Sch10bn for OMV, the oil, gas and chemicals group. Mr Klima said there had
been strong interest in VA-Tech from international institutional investors.
A private partner for a stake of around 20 per cent in OMV - 28 per cent is
already held by private shareholders - is expected to be chosen within a
month. A group of investors from Abu Dhabi, and separately Bayernwerke of
Germany, have shown interest in buying the stake. OMV also plans a
one-for-eight rights issue to raise around Sch3bn, at current prices.
Boehler-Udderholm was given a Sch2.5bn capital injection this year to
prepare for privatisation in 1995.
The government also plans to sell part of its holdings in Bank Austria and
Creditanstalt, the country's two largest banks, and at least half its 36.5
per cent stake in Vienna International Airport. It is also looking for a
strategic partner for Austrian Airlines, the state carrier. Later, it wants
to privatise the state railways, and the country's post and
telecommunications company.
The privatisation programme is the most ambitious yet by an Austrian
government. Mr Klima says it will improve the companies' competitiveness and
give a boost to the domestic capital market by attracting more foreign
investors.
'In the past, we failed to promote the Vienna stock exchange to the
international community,' he said. As a result the market remained weak,
because there are no major institutional investors such as large pension
funds in Austria, and individual investors prefer to place their money into
savings accounts.
Austrians are among the world's leading savers, with more than Sch2,000bn in
various forms of savings. Only 4 per cent own shares.
The preference for individuals to place their money in savings books, and
for companies to borrow money rather than go to the stock exchange, has been
good for the banks but has restricted the growth of the local capital
market.
The government has improved the legal environment, abolished its tax on
assets, and reduced taxation to make issuing and buying shares more
attractive, and several private companies are planning issues.

<TEXT>
Great Central Mines, the Australian exploration company headed by Mr Joseph
Gutnick, is to acquire the outstanding 30 per cent interest in the
Bronzewing gold prospect in Western Australia.
GCM will also buy the 49 per cent interest in the Jundee tenements, north of
Bronzewing. In both cases, GCM is raising its interest to 100 per cent, and
buying the stakes from prospector Mr Mark Creasy.
The total payment will comprise a non-refundable deposit of ADollars 5m
(USDollars 3.5m) and 1m GCM shares. The company will then make a final
payment of ADollars 107m within 120 days, or ADollars 117m within 12 months.
GCM said that it intended to raise debt finance to fund the final payment.
GCM sprang into the limelight a year ago, when New York rabbi Rebbe
Schneerson of the ultra-orthodox Lubavicher sect, prophesied it would enjoy
large finds, sparking a share-price surge.

<TEXT>
Qantas, the state-owned Australian airline in which British Airways holds a
25 per cent stake, will be privatised in 1994-95.
In its annual budget statement yesterday, Australia's federal government
announced a number of asset sale proposals, which are expected in the next
financial year. The sale of its remaining 75 per cent interest in Qantas is
the biggest single item.
The shares are likely to be sold through a stock market flotation. 'Current
planning is proceeding on the basis that a float will be undertaken within
1994-95,' the budget stated.
The sale of the government's remaining interest in Qantas has already been
much-delayed - largely because of the internal turmoil within Qantas as it
tries to meld its international operations with the business of Australian
Airlines, the domestic carrier acquired in 1992.
Although privatisation had been seen as likely in 1994-95, both Mr Gary
Pemberton, Qantas' chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, his counterpart at BA,
have suggested they would prefer this to be undertaken later, rather than
sooner.
In March, when Qantas announced interim figures, Mr Pemberton referred to
Qantas' ADollars 400m-plus (USDollars 288m) profits target as 'the right
return on shareholder funds'. In the first half of 1993-94, the airline made
only ADollars 71.6m, and warned the second half-year could produce
'something less'.

<TEXT>
Mr Peter Cohen, the former Shearson Lehman chairman who joined Republic New
York 18 months ago to run its new securities brokerage business, is
resigning from the banking group to set up his own investment management and
securities firm.
Mr Cohen's resignation comes two weeks after Republic decided its securities
operation should concentrate on servicing the bank's client base of
institutions and wealthy individuals, and not on developing a market-making
and underwriting franchise to compete with big Wall Street securities
houses.
Mr Cohen said yesterday he was leaving to pursue businesses, particularly
specialised securities financing and investment management. These would be
better developed by a firm that was independent of Republic, he said.
His new firm will include the operations of the Palladin Group, an
investment management company with Dollars 200m of clients' assets
specialising in non-merger arbitrage in domestic and foreign securities.
Mr Cohen is not completely severing his ties with Republic, which is 30 per
cent-owned by the Geneva-based financier Mr Edmond Safra. He will continue
to work as a consultant to the bank, which will become a minority investor
in Mr Cohen's new firm.
Mr Cohen joined Republic in November 1992, almost three years after he was
ousted as chairman of Shearson Lehman.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Jungheinrich's profits fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg- based lift truck producer, yesterday announced a
sharp fall in group net profits to DM8.1m (Dollars 5.06m) last year from
DM54.3m in 1992, writes Andrew Baxter.
The group which also has property interests, said it is cutting its 1993
dividend per ordinary share from DM7 to DM3, while the payout on preference
shares was cut from DM8 to DM4.
The group said the 'toughest ever post-war year for west European lift-truck
producers' had left its mark, but the company had retained its strong
poition worldwide. Group sales fell from DM1.6bn to DM1.4bn, and group
income from ordinary activities fell from DM90m to DM34.5m.
The company said 1993 distributable profit was DM10.2m. The 1992 figure was
not available.
Jungheinrich, which produces mainly at its large Hamburg plant and also buys
in lift trucks, said it expected a slight improvement in earnings this year,
with group sales recovering to about DM1.6bn.

Jil Sander, one of Germany's leading fashion designers, will increase its
annual dividend by DM3.50 to DM25 after the company announced a 2 per cent
rise in profits last year.
In spite of the recession, which has particularly affected Germany's textile

on turnover of DM133.3m, a decline of 1.2 per cent on the previous year.
Exports last year accounted for 42.8 per cent of total turnover, and are
expected to rise above 45 per cent this year. Debis, the services subsidiary
of Daimler Benz, yesterday announced a 40 per cent rise in operating profits
for 1993, with the financial services division heading the group's strong
performance.
Operating profits rose in 1993 to DM400m from DM312m the previous year,
while total sales for the group, which consists of 59 companies organised
under seven divisions increased by 20 per cent to DM9.5bn.
Performance in the the financial services division, increased by 18 per cent

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Lift-truck producers go global -
Takeover of Lancer Boss will not be the last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's takeover of the UK's Lancer Boss by Jungheinrich of Germany is
unlikely to be the last such deal in an industry where medium and
small-sized companies are becoming increasingly squeezed as the 'big boys'
pull away from the pack.
In spite of a series of mergers in the 1980s, the industry is still plagued
by excess manufacturing capacity - especially in Europe - and increasing
price competition exacerbated by the strong growth in the past decade of
Japanese and Asian producers.
Success in traditional but mature western markets requires financial
strength to weather the business cycles inevitable in industrial equipment.
Meanwhile, the best long-term growth prospects are elsewhere, notably in
Asia.
To succeed, large producers of lift trucks are taking a global approach,
either through acquisition or organic growth.
Medium-sized producers, in contrast, are finding they lack the volume to
generate sufficient cash flow when markets are strong, while small companies
are left to exploit specialist niches.
Since the 1980s, the industry has been reshaped. The big acquirers of the
past decade have been Linde of Germany and Nacco of the US.
Linde has become the industry leader through a string of acquisitions in
Europe - Fenwick in France, Wagner and Still in Germany, and Lansing Bagnall
in the UK.
Nacco (North American Coal Corporation Industries) has made its purchases in
the US. It bought Yale in 1985 and Hyster in 1989.
Speculation of further deals continues - Nacco, for example, is said to be
keen to buy Swedish-owned BT. Nacco supplies four-wheeled counterbalanced
electric trucks and engined trucks to Jungheinrich, which could eventually
produce these machines in-house, following the takeover of Lancer Boss and
its German unit, Steinbock Boss.
'There are a few smaller companies left in Europe, which will fall by the
wayside,' said Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), yesterday. 'It
will be difficult for them to survive.'
Before its twin receivership in the UK and Germany, Lancer Boss was a
classic medium-sized company, whose global sales peaked at about Pounds 200m
(Dollars 298m). It, too, had expanded by acquisition in Europe, but wanted
to become bigger.
Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, its former chairman, believed the company needed
sales of Pounds 500m to secure its global position.
Its problems have given Jungheinrich an excellent opportunity to bolster its
global position. In contrast to Linde and Nacco, the Hamburg-based company
has until this month followed the Japanese-style organic approach to growth.
Its last lift-truck acquisition was a small French deal in 1974, but by 1991
it had grown quietly to third place in the industry behind Linde and Toyota.
Jungheinrich slipped to fourth in 1992, the latest year for which rankings
were available, but the takeovers of Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss would
have put it into second place with turnover of nearly DM1.8bn (Dollars
1.08bn) and more than 8,000 employees.
For Jungheinrich, though, the rankings are less important than the impact on
its competitiveness. Overall, says Mr Bischof, Jungheinrich has both
broadened its product range and 'taken the first step to looking outside
Europe into a global market.'
The acquisition of Steinbock significantly strengthens Jungheinrich's
position in the market for very narrow aisle (VNA) trucks used in
warehouses.
By taking over Lancer Boss, the Hamburg company says its potential to
penetrate the counterbalanced electric and combustion engined market is
strengthened because of the UK company's 'excellent engineering' in this
area.
The deal takes Jungheinrich for the first time into sidelift trucks and
container handling trucks. For all its financial problems, Boss was the
world leader in trucks to handle empty shipping containers, and has been
very successful in the booming Asian market that Jungheinrich wants to
exploit.
Mr Bischof hints that the twin acquisitions may not be the last made by
Jungheinrich, and says they will make a positive contribution to
Jungheinrich's profits next year.
As one observer points out, there are some 'lovely' profit margins on big
container handling trucks. And Lancer Boss' home market is recovering
strongly from recession.

Storebrand

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurer, yesterday published weaker than
expected first-quarter results, and announced the surprise departure of its
chief executive.
The departure of Mr Per Terje Vold, who had led a one-year turnround of the
group, was only one of a series of moves revealed.
Uni also disclosed that it had signed a letter of intent with a foreign
investor to dispose of Christiania Re Corporation, the group's US
subsidiary, but refused to give details.
The group also announced plans for a one-for-14 rights issue for restricted
and free shareholders, priced at NKr12.25 a share to raise NKr307.4m during
a subscription period from May 25 to June 7.
Uni said Mr Aage Korsvold, vice-chairman of the board, is to replace Mr Vold
from July 1. Mr Korsvold also holds a key position within the group's
strategic operations.
The company said Mr Vold had successfully led Uni's restructuring following
the group's release from a board appointed by the government. This followed
Uni's collapse after a failed raid launched two years ago on Skandia
Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer.
'The group's results for 1993 were good and the company is well on its way
with a strategic process for a further positioning in the market,' Uni said.
Mr Jon Gundersen, board chairman, said he was looking forward to the fresh
approach that Mr Korsvold would bring in addressing the challenges facing
Uni, including the growing domestic savings market which has been chosen as
a central area for group expansion.
Mr Vold had been asked to remain with Uni and his position would be
clarified shortly, the company said.
Uni reported a decline in first-quarter operating profit, before
policyholders' allocations, to NKr998m (Dollars 139m) from NKr1.03bn. It
blamed higher interest rates which produced lower financial income.
Group net operating income rose to NKr7.07bn from NKr6.38bn as operating
costs increased to NKr5.56bn from NKr4.82bn. Pre-tax profit, after
allocations to policyholders, fell to NKr84m from NKr150m.

Aerospatiale, the French state-controlled aerospace group, is stepping up
its efforts to forge European alliances in both its defence and commercial
activities as part of its strategy to return to profit.
After reducing net losses to FFr1.42bn (Dollars 250m) last year from
FFr2.38bn in 1992, Mr Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman, said the group
was on target to break-even this year.
Like the rest of the aerospace industry, the French group has been hit by
the prolonged slump in the civil aircraft sector and the decline in the
defence market.
However, Aerospatiale is more vulnerable than other European aerospace
groups to the problems of the civil rather than the defence side of the
business, because it relies on civil aerospace for about 70 per cent of its
FFr50bn annual consolidated turnover.
'After Boeing of the US, we are probably the most civil aerospace company in
the world, but we don't have the same substantial 60 per cent market share
of the civil market as Boeing,' Mr Gallois explained. He added that he did
not expect any sustained recovery in the civil aircraft sector before 1996
or 1997.
To consolidate his company's financial recovery, Mr Gallois said a priority
was to reduce the production break-even point of the group's principal civil
aerospace products. Aerospatiale holds a 37.9 per cent stake in the European
Airbus consortium and a 50 per cent stake in the Franco-Italian ATR regional
turbo-propeller aircraft group.
The big Airbus investments made over the last 10 years to compete against
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US were based on an average French
franc-US dollar exchange rate of FFr5.80 and Airbus annual aircraft
deliveries of around 200 airliners a year. In the regional turbo-prop
market, the annual production break-even point for ATR aircraft was
estimated at around 60 aircraft, explained Mr Yves Michot, Aerospatiale's
managing director.
The problem for Aerospatiale is that Airbus production has now dropped to
around 130 airliners a year while ATR production is down to 42 aircraft.
'We simply must adjust the European industry to manufacture profitably
Airbus aircraft at a rate of around 130 aircraft a year,' Mr Gallois
stressed. At the same time, Airbus is facing increasing competition from
Boeing, which is seeking to reduce its production costs by 25 per cent.
'We have also reduced our production cycle times for narrow-body airliners
to around nine months, but the problem is that Boeing wants to bring them
down to six months,' said Mr Claude Terrazzoni, head of Aerospatiale's civil
aircraft division.
'In the wide-body sector, Boeing cycle times are down to 10.5 months while
Airbus is around 12.5 months, but we plan to come down to 10.5 months as
well,' he added.
Both Mr Gallois and Mr Terrazzoni also stressed Airbus's intention to
challenge Boeing's monopoly of the jumbo airliner market.
'We simply can't afford not to be part of that market,' Mr Terrazzoni said,
explaining that aircraft of 400 seats or more will account for an increasing
share of the market during the next 20 years.
In the turbo-prop sector, it is vital to rationalise the European industry
suffering from over-capacity and competing products. 'You now need to
produce about 70 to 80 aircraft a year to break even in this sector: there's
therefore no other way out but to regroup the industry in Europe,' Mr
Gallois said.
Aerospatiale is continuing discussions with British Aerospace in an effort
to merge BAe's Jetstream turbo-prop activities based in Prestwick, Scotland,
with those of ATR. Aerospatiale has proposed to combine the two groups
around a new project, the development of a larger 82-seat turbo-propeller
aircraft, the ATR 82.
There are still doubts on whether there is a niche in the market for an
82-seat turbo-prop competing against smaller regional jets, but Aerospatiale
believes if ATR and BAe can combine forces in this sector, other European
manufacturers will join.
Aerospatiale also hopes to complete by the end of this year its long
negotiations to merge its guided weapons and satellite activities with those
of Deutsche Aerospace in separate joint ventures. (Aerospatiale already has
a joint helicopter venture with Deutsche Aerospace, called Eurocopter.)
These joint ventures could lead to wider European alliances in both missiles
and satellites.
'We need to achieve a much deeper integration of our European defence
industries to compete with the US, where consolidation is taking place at a
very rapid pace,' Mr Gallois said.
'The difficulty in Europe is that consolidation in the defence sector is
bound to take much longer. You need a balance between partners, for no
country will allow its defence industry to pass under foreign control. You
must create real joint ventures, which is much harder than simply buying out
another company as our US competitors are doing in their domestic market,'
he added.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Veba ahead 18.5% in first term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veba, the German energy conglomerate, has reported a sharp rise in
first-quarter profits and predicted profits for all 1994 would be 'markedly
better' than last year.
The Dusseldorf-based group, which has around 1,000 subsidiaries in areas
such as power generation, oil, chemicals, trading and services, said pre-tax
profits in the first three months of the year rose 18.5 per cent to DM608m
(Dollars 367m).
Much of the increase was due to an extensive group-wide rationalisation
programme set in motion last year. The plan is to cut the 131,000 workforce
by 10,000 over 1993-94 in measures which are designed to save DM1.2bn costs
a year.
Veba said the rationalisation programme would be the chief factor behind the
expected marked improvement in this year's profits.
As Veba announced in March, group net profits for 1993 fell 9 per cent to
DM825m on turnover up by 1.4 per cent to DM66.3bn.
In the first three months of the year turnover climbed to DM17.5bn, an
increase of 6 per cent, which reflects the impact of acquisitions in the
eastern German power sector.
A 28 per cent increase in turnover from energy, to DM4.36bn, offset stagnant
or falling sales in the other main business areas, although Veba made clear
that, excluding acquisitions, turnover in energy was flat.
The group gave no detailed profits breakdown at the three months stage, but
it said it had substantially reduced losses in its chemicals division, the
focus of intensive rationalisation. Losses in petrochemicals were also
reduced and there was an increase in profits in services, trading and
transport.
Degussa, the Frankfurt-based specialty chemicals and precious metals group
which recently completed an extensive rationalisation programme, reported a
58 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the six months to March.
The increase in pre-tax profits to DM121m followed a 25 per cent gain in the
first quarter.
Degussa said its performance in the first half was better than anticipated,
with all business areas improving their results. It singled out the
chemicals division as a beneficiary of rationalisation measures and
increased sales.
The company predicted that earnings in the second half of the year would
improve, but warned that the rate of growth would not be as high as in the
first half.
Group profits for the year to the end of last September dropped 14 per cent
to DM172m on sales up 16 per cent to DM15bn. Sales in the first half of the
current year rose 2 per cent to DM7.2 per cent.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Drugs industry seeks
prescription for growth - Manufacturers and distributors are scrambling for
market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bomb detonated under the US drugs industry last year by Merck's Dollars
6.7bn takeover of Medco, a drug distributor, has been reverberating loudly
in recent weeks.
In a rapid series of takeovers and alliances, some of the biggest
distributors in the US have aligned themselves with pharmaceutical
manufacturers. And with a shrinking number of distributors not yet spoken
for, the scramble for market position is getting intense.
'We clearly want to keep our lines of distribution open as much as
possible,' says Mr Edward Bessey, president of Pfizer's US pharmaceuticals
business. Pfizer, which has had one of the best records among manufacturers
for launching big-selling new drugs, has been quick to make its own
arrangements, forming links with two distributors in recent weeks.
The panic prompted in drug company boardrooms by the Merck/Medco deal is
understandable. Medco is one of a new breed of distributors, known as
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which has come to prominence in recent
years. These companies have a strong grip on drugs sales in the US: access
to their distribution channels has become vital.
Medco, for instance, claims to account for 38m people (known in the trade as
'lives') under assorted managed care arrangements. Diversified
Pharmaceutical Services - which, under a deal announced last week, is being
bought by SmithKline Beecham - claims 44m lives, PCS (a subsidiary of
McKesson) 45m and Caremark, another independent, 28m. Even allowing for some
inflated claims and a degree of overlap, it is a fair bet that more than
half of all Americans buy drugs through these companies.
The distributors have won their position by discounting heavily. They fill
out prescriptions for people covered under company health plans and other
bulk programmes.
The main weapon in the distributors' armoury, though - and the one that
frightens some manufacturers - is their formularies. These are lists of
recommended drugs they maintain, and which doctors are steered towards when
prescribing. A doctor prescribing a drug not on the formulary is likely to
get a call suggesting they switch to another (usually cheaper) drug that is.
Caremark claims that it manages to persuade three out of every five doctors
to change their prescriptions in these circumstances.
McKesson claims some 20m lives are covered by its formulary, while Medco
claims 18m, Caremark 12.5m, Diversified 11m and Value Health, another of the
distributors, 5m. These numbers are likely to grow fast: the distributors
have all made it a priority to convert their customers to the formulary
approach, and are using aggressive pricing as an inducement.
The result has been a scramble. Merck and SmithKline Beecham have already
bought two of the biggest PBMs (the latter still needs approval). Two other
distributors, Caremark and Value Health, have made clear their intention to
remain independent of any one drug company. A month ago, Caremark signed
agreements to put the products of three manufacturers on its formulary -
Pfizer, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and (it is widely believed) Bristol-Myers
Squibb. Value Health last week agreed a similar deal with Pfizer.
Other, smaller companies could also become takeover candidates. For
instance, Express Scripts, a small PBM based in Missouri, has seen its
market value leap from Dollars 175m to Dollars 450m in recent months.
McKesson, though, stands out as the only big company that has yet to show
its hand.
Control of distribution may be the main force behind the realignment, but
there is also a second motivating factor: access to information.
The manufacturers' thinking goes like this. Under pressure to hold down
prices, both from bulk buyers of their products and politicians in
Washington, they need new data both to support their marketing and develop
new markets. Information on how their drugs are being used, and the
effectiveness of the treatments, is vital: it would enable the manufacturers
to make a better case for the effectiveness of their products, and at the
same time would enable them to develop closer ties with the users of their
drugs.
It would also enable them to sell drugs to big buyers under capitation
arrangements - agreements to provide all of a patient's drugs over a set
period for a pre-determined fee.
Some of the information that the manufacturers needs sits in the databases
of the PBMs. More of it, though, resides with the Health Management
Organisations (HMOs) and other managed care groups who provide overall
healthcare cover to many Americans. Notably, SmithKline's deal with United
Healthcare - the company from which it is buying Diversified - will give it
access to United's database. Pfizer will likewise have access to information
about Value Health's patients.
'Disease management' - an overall approach to treating illness that goes
beyond just selling drugs - has become the fashionable industry jargon for
this approach. Explaining the Value Health deal, Mr Bessey at Pfizer says:
'We saw the capability and the data that will allow us to move very quickly
into disease management - from diagnosis to cure.'
Ultimately, that approach could help the stronger manufacturers both to take
market share off weaker rivals, and at the same time grow their overall
market by giving pharmaceuticals a more significant role in overall courses
of treatment than they currently enjoy (only 7 per cent of US healthcare
spending is on drugs, for instance, compared with more than 60 per cent on
hospitals).
Over the long term, the drug companies hope, this approach could sustain the
sort of growth which has been lacking in the industry in recent years.

LOT Polish Airlines yesterday signed a commercial partnership agreement with
American Airlines, the second largest US carrier, to give it greater access
to the US market. The deal is expected to lead to a long term strategic
alliance, LOT said.
The partnership will involve ticket code sharing, co-ordination of
timetables, baggage handling co-operation, and the use for LOT of American's
aircraft purchase and leasing opportunities.
The Polish airline, which has been battling with British Airways for North
Atlantic traffic from Poland to the US, has been seeking a western partner
to help it modernise and become more competitive.

<TEXT>
Glaxo of the UK is understood still to be in talks on alliances with US
healthcare companies including the drugs distributor McKesson, writes Daniel
Green.
Talks have been under way for several months as the company searches for a
corporate response to changes in the US healthcare system.
The slow progress of the talks reflects Glaxo's unwillingness to buy a US
company. It does not want to follow US rival Merck and Anglo-US company
SmithKline Beecham which have spent Dollars 6bn and Dollars 2.3bn
respectively on distribution companies.
Instead it wants to sign alliances such as that agreed last week between US
company Pfizer with Value Health, a distributor, in a Dollars 100m joint
venture. McKesson remains one of the largest potential partners yet to sign
such a deal.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, has said that deals with intermediaries
and even other pharmaceuticals companies were under consideration.

<TEXT>
Air Canada, which yesterday placed orders for 25 Airbus 319 112-seat
short-haul airliners, reduced losses in the first quarter and is on target
to at least break even for 1994, said Mr Hollis Harris, chairman.
The March quarter, normally the slowest, showed a loss of CDollars 32m
(USDollars 23.1m), or 27 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 293m, or
CDollars 3.96, a year earlier, including restructuring charges. The
operating loss was CDollars 12m against a CDollars 143m loss.
Mr Harris said operating results had exceeded expectation and Air Canada's
turnround was continuing with the benefits of cost reduction, rising
efficiency and steps to build new North American and overseas markets.
Passenger traffic rose 9 per cent, helping to push revenues to CDollars 902m
for the quarter, up 12.5 per cent. Yield per revenue passenger mile gained 2
per cent due to reduced fare discounting.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Parent to boost capital of CS
First Boston by Dollars 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the Swiss financial group, confirmed yesterday its plans to
provide its US-based investment banking subsidiary, CS First Boston, with a
capital infusion of about Dollars 400m.
The move is being made in an effort to boost CS First Boston's earning
power.
Mr Gerhard Beindorff, a spokesman for CS Holding, said yesterday that work
on an equity capital increase for CS First Boston of about Dollars 400m was
at 'an advanced stage'.
It will be the second large infusion of capital at CS First Boston in four
years. In 1990, its parent provided Dollars 300m in equity capital as part
of an Dollars 800m recapitalisation plan aimed at restoring confidence in
the bank, which was struggling at the time under the weight of troubled
loans.
When this latest infusion is completed, probably at some point in this
quarter, CS First Boston will have capital of Dollars 1.7bn. This is still
relatively small by the standards of its biggest Wall Street rivals such as
Salomon Brothers (Dollars 5.3bn in capital), Goldman Sachs (Dollars 5bn) and
Morgan Stanley (Dollars 4.5bn).
Equity capital is crucial for investment banks. The larger their capital
base, the more they can use their own money in the financial markets for
proprietary trading and underwriting activities, and the more likely they
are to earn a high credit rating which allows them to conduct derivatives
business with clients.
In recent years, a large share of investment banks' profits have come from
capital- intensive businesses such as proprietary derivatives trading.
The decision to provide the capital infusion comes a month after CS Holding
increased its stake in CS First Boston from 68.5 per cent to 75.7 per cent
by purchasing the stakes of five foreign institutional shareholders.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Roche seeks to assure investors
on Syntex bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the leading Swiss pharmaceutical group, claimed yesterday that
Syntex, the US drugs group for which it launched an agreed Dollars 5.3bn bid
last week, would be an 'optimal addition' to the group. It said the cost of
financing the takeover would not dilute its earnings.
The price of Roche's non-voting securities has fallen about 7 per cent since
the bid was announced, reflecting investors' worries about the offer price -
59 per cent above the pre-bid market capitalisation - and potential
dilution.
Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman, said yesterday that he assumed dilution would be
avoided. 'We expect to see another increase in group income (in 1994). In
making this forecast, I have taken our offer to the Syntex shareholders into
account.'
Mr Henri Meier, finance director, said Roche would decide on exactly how to
finance the deal only when and if the tender was successfully completed.
He said the group had shown its ability to use innovative devices, such as
bull spreads and knock-out warrants, to finance previous large acquisitions
on favourable terms.
Roche officials also pointed out that the group had SFr14.6bn (Dollars
10.4bn) in liquid funds at the end of last year, enabling it to raise money
on the finest terms.
Syntex is expected to achieve net earnings of about Dollars 380m in the year
to July 1994.
Mr Gerber said Syntex's well-established clinical research unit would enable
Roche to develop products more quickly, and that its 'interesting products'
in the research pipeline would add to Roche's own core areas.
He said Roche would not follow recent moves by rivals Merck and SmithKline
Beecham to acquire drug distributors. He was leery of diversifications, and
said Roche was fully-occupied with research and development and confident of
its strengths.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia advances to SKr1.33bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmacia, the Swedish drugs group being privatised next month, yesterday
announced a big jump in first-quarter profits, after benefiting from higher
sales and cost-cutting.
Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.33bn (Dollars 172m), compared
with SKr486m in the same 1993 period.
The result was better than expected, and the A shares rose SKr3 to SKr130.
Analysts said the figures should assist the privatisation process, with the
government planning to sell a 47.4 per cent voting stake in the group. The
disposal is expected to raise around SKr10bn in Sweden's biggest
privatisation.
Group turnover rose 3 per cent, to SKr6.78bn. However, on an underlying
basis the increase was 6 per cent. Operating costs fell 2 per cent to
SKr5.12bn from SKr5.22bn.
The group benefited from one-off gains of SKr183m, compared with costs of
SKr308m a year ago. This helped lift operating profit to SKr1.38bn from
SKr577m. Excluding one-off items, operating profits were 35 per cent higher
at SKr1.19bn.
Financial costs, linked mainly to the financing of the group's acquisition
of the Italian drugs group Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice), dragged the overall
figures down.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: BSN puts new name on the table -
Danone wants to expand across the globe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What's in a name? For Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN, France's largest
food group, the answer is a great deal.
Yesterday, the 75-year-old founder of the company announced that BSN would
change its name to Danone, after its dairy and yoghurt products and the
company's most important brand in an industry where brands are
all-important. 'It is one of the most significant announcements I have
made,' said Mr Riboud. 'I built BSN with my own hands.'
The importance of the decision lies partly in a break with the company's
past. Formed in 1966 through the fusion of two glass manufacturing
companies, Boussois and Souchon-Neuvesel, the group moved rapidly into
foods. In the past 25 years, it has risen to become the biggest in the
sector in France, and the third-largest food group in Europe, with annual
sales of FFr85.5bn (Dollars 622m).
More significantly, however, the decision to become Danone reflects Mr
Riboud's strategy of aggressively expanding in markets beyond Europe. 'The
three letters that make up our name reflect its past more than its future.
These initials are not well-known in the international arena . . . Danone is
the second brand name in Europe after Coca-Cola, and my dream is to make
Danone the Coca-Cola of the future,' said Mr Riboud. His ambition is to
become a worldwide group through expansion in Asia, eastern Europe, Russia,
and Africa.
To illustrate these goals, the BSN chairman announced a string of investment
and acquisition plans. In Russia, the company is to set up its first
production plant there, called Danone Volga, in which it will hold an 80 per
cent stake. In Brazil, it will take a 49 per cent stake in Campineira de
Alimentos, the country's second-largest biscuit producer. In Morocco, the
French group is to take 2.7 per cent of the capital in ONA, the country's
leading food group. In Spain, it will take full control of San Miguel
breweries, one of the country's largest brewers, in which it already has a
24 per cent stake.
For Mr Riboud, such international expansion is essential to keep pace with
the development of the industry. 'Since the beginning of the 1990s, the
globalisation of the food industry has accelerated,' he says. This is
attributed partly to the development of more international tastes by
consumers and the growth of tourism. In this context, the emergence of
worldwide distribution groups and television advertising have enabled the
development of global brands.
BSN, says Mr Riboud, has been left behind in the battle for name
recognition. 'A recent survey showed our name was recognised by 93 per cent
of people in France, but just 7 per cent in Italy and 5 per cent in Spain,'
he said. In Malaysia, BSN is the name of a bank; in the US, the name of a
textiles company; and in Japan, the name of a television network. 'We have a
weakness,' he admitted. 'The weakness is our name.'
Hence the decision to change to Danone, a brand which accounts for
one-quarter of the group's sales and is present in 30 countries. 'It is an
interesting move, which is in line with the decision of other companies,
such as Heinz, to focus on a corporate name,' said Mr Sylvain Massot,
European food and drink analyst at Morgan Stanley.
However, if changing a name is relatively easy and cheap, becoming a global
group is expensive and a great deal more complex. Mr Riboud admits to
hiccups on the trail of international growth, citing the group's battle with
its partner in India for control of Britannia, the Indian foods group, which
was finally resolved last year.
Industry observers point to the strain on management resources with BSN's
programme of rapid expansion. 'The problem they face is that, as a
relatively young company, they need to grow quickly to catch up with the
Nestles and Unilevers of the world,' says one industry analyst in Paris.
'But this clearly costs money and is open to risks.'
Mr Georges Lecallier, BSN vice-chairman, counters that expanding through the
development of existing brands such as Danone limits the risks. And by
establishing joint ventures and partnerships, existing groups supply
first-hand knowledge on the local markets.
On the financial front, Mr Christian Laubie, finance director, points to the
health of the balance sheet, reinforced last year by a FFr3.5bn convertible
bond issue. He says that cashflow, which reached FFr3.6bn after industrial
investments last year, provides adequate scope for expansion through
acquisition. Total net debt fell from FFr10.3bn at the end of 1992 to
FFr8.6bn at the end of last year, giving a debt-to-equity ratio of 22 per
cent.
According to BSN, yesterday's deals will be easily absorbed. The FFr1.9bn to
be spent on acquiring San Miguel, the biggest of yesterday's deals, is to be
spread over a four-year period. The investment in Russia is described by Mr
Riboud as 'light', with annual production of between 2,000 and 3,000 tonnes.
'We can build on it later,' he says.
Given his ambitions, this is highly likely. 'We want to become a French
aircraft carrier,' he said yesterday, referring to his expansion plans.
Investors will hope that he can steer clear of the reefs.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Non-life side helps boost Zurich
Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich Insurance, one of the world's largest insurance groups, has reported
a 24.8 per cent jump in 1993 net income, to SFr613.2m (Dollars 434.9m). It
attributed the advance to an improved result in non-life business and to
buoyant investment income.
The directors have proposed a 14 per cent rise in dividends, to SFr20 per
share.
Gross premium revenue was up 16 per cent to SFr24.9bn, with about half of
the rise coming from acquisitions and the widening of the consolidation.
Among the group's more important additions last year was the business of
Municipal Mutual Insurance in the UK, and the purchase of the remaining
minority interests in Bermuda-based Centre Reinsurance.
Zurich said its expense ratio declined in both life and non-life sectors.
There was a 'substantial increase' in investment income, and total
investments stood at SFr78.6bn at the end of 1993, 18.9 per cent higher than
a year earlier.
Shareholders' equity at year-end, prior to the dividend payment, was
SFr10.2bn, SFr1.5bn higher than at the end of 1992.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Electrolux plans global share
offering in Autoliv
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux, the world's leading maker of household appliances, yesterday
stepped up its refocusing programme by launching a global offering of 25m
shares in Autoliv, Europe's leading supplier of car safety equipment.
The move could raise up to SKr4.5bn (Dollars 584m) and produce a capital
gain of more than SKr3bn.
Mr Lennart Ribohn, Electrolux senior executive vice-president, said the sale
would improve the company's opportunities to expand core activities in east
Asian, South American and east European markets. Proceeds will also help
fund the group's just-finalised DM730m (Dollars 439.7m) purchase of
Hausgerate, AEG's household appliance unit.
Autoliv has 40 per cent of the European market in car safety equipment such
as seatbelts, airbags and child restraint seats. Growth has been rapid, in
spite of the car industry recession, due to rising demand for airbags and
increased emphasis on safety.
Last year, Autoliv's sales climbed to SKr5.33bn from SKr3.53bn, and
operating income rose to SKr310m from SKr211m. Progress continued in the
first quarter of 1994, with sales rising 69 per cent, to SKr2.0bn, and
operating income more than doubling to SKr99m from SKr45m. The book value of
the company, which Electrolux bought in 1980 as part of a larger purchase,
is around SKr1.3bn.
The issue will have three tranches. The biggest, 8.75m shares, will be
allocated to Swedish institutional and retail investors. The balance will be
split equally between the US and international markets. Enskilda Corporate,
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Merrill Lynch International are the joint
global co-ordinators of the issue.
Shares are to be sold to institutions for between SKr160 and SKr180 each,
following a book-building exercise. Swedish retail investors, who are
expected to buy about 5 per cent of the company, will be offered a
SKr9-per-share discount.
Selling Autoliv enables Electrolux to fund the Hausgerate purchase without a
rights issue.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mobile phones lift Ericsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, almost
doubled in the first quarter, rising to SKr813m (Dollars 105.58m) from
SKr428m with booming sales of mobile phone equipment.
But the figures disappointed a market already concerned by the group's loss
of a big Saudi Arabian contract to AT&amp;T. The group's B shares fell SKr7 to
close at SKr340.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive, said income and sales showed a
'clearly positive trend . . . in a market that is anything but easy.'
He said the group was standing by its forecast that earnings for the full
year would exceed last year's SKr3.1bn, in spite of increasingly fierce
competition.
Mr Ramqvist said the market was characterised by 'lower investments,
depressed prices, politicising and financing problems.'
In an oblique reference to AT&amp;T's Saudi Arabian success, he said there was
'increased political involvement in negotiations for major
telecommunications projects.'
Group net sales were 24 per cent ahead at SKr16.0bn. The best area was the
group's radio communications division, which includes cellular operations,
where sales rose 51.6 per cent to SKr7.2bn from SKr4.7bn.
Public telecommunications sales climbed by only 6 per cent to SKr5.33bn.
Orders were 23 per cent higher at SKr21.5bn. Ericsson's orders have risen
for ten consecutive quarters, with a successful expansion in mobile phone
systems.
By contrast, public communications orders were lower. The group said this
was because it benefited from big orders in the UK and Thailand in the first
quarter of 1993.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W spurns partners for outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, yesterday reaffirmed its
intention to attack the growing corporate market for telecoms
contracting-out without seeking international partners.
It said its existing federation of companies made an external alliance
unnecessary. It claimed it had won a quarter of the contracts awarded around
the world in the last 18 months by large multinationals for providing
telecoms services outside public networks.
C&amp;W's strategy contrasts with those of British Telecommunications and AT&amp;T,
the US group, both of which have forged international alliances to develop
corporate business over the past year.
BT has formed a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.63bn) alliance with MCI, the second
largest US carrier, while AT&amp;T launched Worldsource last year in partnership
with telecoms operators in the Asia-Pacific region. It is seeking a similar
arrangement with state operators in Europe.
Some analysts believed that C&amp;W, which is far smaller than BT and AT&amp;T,
would also seek an alliance. But Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, emphasised his
company's determination to develop its international business through its
existing companies.
'It is the alliance of C&amp;W companies which gives us our competitive edge,'
he said. C&amp;W owns a majority stake in Mercury and Hong Kong Telecom and has
significant stakes in operators in the Caribbean, Sweden, Australia and the
Baltic, as well as a US subsidiary.
Mr James Ross, chief executive, claimed that C&amp;W had an 8 per cent stake in
the international telecoms network services market and could develop its
multinationals business through its business networks division, established
18 months ago to pioneer outsourcing. The division has staff of 200 liaising
with C&amp;W operations in 56 countries. 'We already do business with more than
1,500 of the 2,500 multinationals we are targeting,' Mr Ross said.
C&amp;W estimates that the contracting-out market for the top 2,500
multinationals could be worth Dollars 15bn a year. In March, C&amp;W launched a
Pounds 1bn network upgrading programme, starting with a new Pounds 200m
'backbone' network for the UK capable of offering advanced services such as
video-conference and corporate phone meetings.

GR (Holdings), the leisure, property and sheepskin processing company, is

shareholders, Mr Anthony Stalbrow and Mr John Stalbrow.
Through a specially created company, A Stanford, they are making an agreed

GR's shares were unchanged yesterday at 64p.
The move continues an ongoing process at GR where the traditional trading
activities have declined so that now only 40 per cent of current assets are
deployed in this area, the balance being used in securities and property.
In March, GR reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 216,882 (Pounds

Glasgow Income Trust reported a net asset value of 48.64p per share as at
March 31, up from 47.68p at its September year end and 43.46p at end-March
1993.
The total return on net assets at the period end was 5.2 per cent, against
5.5 per cent on the FT-SE-A All-Share Index.
Gearing stood at 8.2 per cent, funded by short-term borrowing; directors
said the employment of gearing reflected their view that after recent
weakness, particularly among large capitalisation stocks, UK equities
represented 'good value'.
Net revenue dipped to Pounds 353,000 (Pounds 362,000) for earnings of 1.18p
(1.23p). A second interim dividend of 0.6p maintains the total at 1.2p,
requiring a transfer of Pounds 17,000 from the revenue reserve.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant 25% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holmes &amp; Marchant Group, the marketing services company, reported pre-tax
profits ahead 25 per cent from Pounds 461,000 to Pounds 576,000 for the six
months to end-March.
The improvement was achieved on turnover down by Pounds 3.38m to Pounds
13.3m. Earnings per share emerged at 1.76p (1.45p). Comparative figures have
been restated to reflect the accounting policy adopted for empty leasehold
property costs.
Mr John Holmes, chairman and chief executive, said Pounds 1m of the decline
in turnover was accounted for by the closure of the group's consumer
advertising agency in February 1993, while a further Pounds 1.5m related to
client expenditure on new product launches.
With lower average borrowings in the period and a reduction in interest
rates, net interest payable was reduced from Pounds 450,000 to Pounds
350,000. Net borrowings at March 31 stood at Pounds 8.6m, an improvement of
Pounds 400,000 on the 1993 year end.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: How to disguise the embarrassment of riches
/ Preview of the electricity companies' preliminary results season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's electricity companies are a cautious bunch. In the four years
since privatisation began, the 17 quoted companies in the sector have
established a tradition of holding back from the maximum possible when
declaring profits.
It has not stopped them from announcing profits way above pre-privatisation
expectations. But taking a 'prudent' approach on issues like provisions for
bad debts and business restructuring has enabled them to reduce the
potential political flak which would have arisen from even stronger
financial performances.
If, however, the sector has in the past hidden its financial light under a
bushel the temptation for most companies this time will be to dig a deep
hole for it.
As the sector's seven-week preliminary results season begins today, with an
announcement from Scottish Power, the focus of attention for 14 of the 17
privatised companies and their investors is a review that Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the industry regulator, has launched into their distribution
businesses.
The review takes in the two Scottish companies as well as the 12 recs in
England and Wales but the latter will be most affected since a larger
proportion, in some cases virtually all, of their profits comes from
distribution.
Early indications in a letter from Prof Littlechild to the distributors are
that some companies may have to reduce their prices by as much as 20 per
cent from next April when the new regime comes into effect.
Desperate to avoid this fate, companies will be doing their best in the
results season to disguise the embarrassment of riches that have flowed
their way since privatisation.
'Caution will be the watchword,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at
Hoare Govett.
'Anything which could be interpreted as excessive will make the regulator's
job more difficult and may worsen the outcome of the review from the
companies' point of view.'
Mr John Wilson, analyst at UBS, detects a considerable slowdown in regional
companies' cost control exercises ahead of the review.
He says there may also be a reverse of the traditional dividend race in
which companies appear to have been in competition with each other to see
who can pay out the biggest increase to shareholders.
But however hard they try, the regional companies are bound to show
exceedingly healthy profit increases from 1992-93. UBS expects average
pre-tax profits for the recs to be about Pounds 163m in 1993-94, against
Pounds 140m the previous year.
Growth in sale volumes might be low, perhaps up 1 per cent to 2 per cent if
half-year results are anything to go by, but the companies are still
benefiting enormously from the improvements in efficiency that have been
effected in the last four years.
Most of the companies will have had cash in hand by the end of last March -
the end of the financial year.
That would have been the case even if they had not benefited from customers
paying more than Pounds 500m of their bills in advance to avoid paying value
added tax which the government introduced from April 1.
Companies' plans for the pre-payments will be one of the side issues around
the results.
The Labour party and consumer groups are stepping up their pressure for the
money to be set aside for helping disadvantaged customers rather than be
used to boost company profits.
However, the issue that every investor and analyst will try to resolve at
the regional companies' presentation of results will be how each company
will come out of the distribution review.
With company executives under strict instructions to keep secret the
progress of their negotiations with Offer, the industry regulator, the
questioners may be disappointed.
The large generating companies will be less constrained in giving their
results, particularly the two serving England and Wales. National Power and
PowerGen have just come through their own regulatory review and are still
smarting from the results.
Over the two years from last month their profits could be depressed by about
Pounds 120m in total as a result of the price cap negotiated with Prof
Littlechild, according to SG Warburg Securities. The cap will not affect
their results for 1993-94.
However, the companies will be attempting to show the City that they can
still grow profits and dividends by impressive amounts because of continuing
cost cuts and expansion overseas.
North of the border, Scottish Power will also be emphasising its improved
efficiency with some analysts expecting the company today to show job cuts
in the last year of 7 per cent to 8 per cent.
Hydro-Electric's results will be watched for the company's latest word on
the weather, which the company warned recently would depress profits this
year because low rainfall had reduced the scope for generation through hydro
electric power.
However, most clouds have a silver lining and some Hydro watchers hope
heavier rainfall so far this year will produce an equally freakish result -
this time in Hydro's favour.
The star of this year's results could turn out to be Northern Ireland
Electricity, the smallest company of all.
Having come to the market just last year, it does not face a big regulatory
review for three years.
This gives it stability and the company appears to be using the
opportunities well by cutting costs vigorously. Hoare Govett's Mr Hawkins
thinks earnings growth could be as high as 30 per cent, facilitating one of
the highest dividend increases among power distributors.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Widows gloom over HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Widows, one of Britain's leading institutional investors, has
decided to reduce its investment in the Hong Kong market because it believes
property valuations are overblown.
Mr Robin Garrow, director in charge of global asset allocation, made a
particularly glum assessment of the Hong Kong stock market following a visit
there in April.
'In terms of investment policy my main conclusion was to confirm a negative
view of Hong Kong,' Mr Garrow wrote in a recent briefing note. 'This has all
the hallmarks of a classic bubble.'
He also noted that fund managers, perhaps wrongly, approach investment in
south-east Asia on a country basis and not on an individual stock basis.
Hong Kong forms about 38 per cent of the FT-A Pacific Basin Ex-Japan Index
and many fund managers feel they must hold a weighting roughly equal to that
even when they are uncertain about the colony's prospects.
'This is understandable if not laudable for stock markets but, I believe,
regrettable for fund managers. Why should we feel constrained to keeping
Hong Kong, for example, as a proportionately high holding in the area?' Mr
Garrow wrote.
Scottish Widows, with roughly Pounds 20bn in assets, has about Pounds 600m
in east Asia, excluding Japan, with only 15 per cent of that in Hong Kong.
In citing his reasons for reducing exposure, Mr Garrow said that analysts
attending a recent Bank Credit conference believed that profits of property
companies accounted for 65 per cent of the whole of the Hong Kong stock
market and that some companies may be producing paper profits by counting
the future value of properties still under development.
Also, he noted, one company he visited in Shenzhen which described itself as
a conglomerate turned out to be largely involved in property development.
Meanwhile, Mr Tom Crombie, investment director at Scottish Equitable, said
he had also significantly pared investment in Hong Kong since the beginning
of the year to about 20 per cent of Pacific Basin holdings outside Japan,
and would consider cutting further.
'A property bubble of hair-raising proportions has just taken place,' Mr
Crombie said, noting that a house on the Peak in Hong Kong has just sold for
Pounds 10,000 per sq ft - about 250 times more expensive than the top
residential neighbourhood in London.
Mr Crombie said investors counting on a shortage of space to keep up
property prices were mistaken. 'If you go up in a helicopter you can see
that there is plenty of land in Hong Kong and that there is even more over
the border.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Schroders poised to launch Japanese
investment trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroders is to launch an investment trust to catch the current wave of
enthusiasm for Japan.
The Schroder Japan Growth Fund will invest in the whole range of Japanese
companies, from the Tokyo Stock Exchange first section to the
over-the-counter market.
It is the second new Japanese trust to be launched this year, while at least
two existing funds have raised new capital or are planning to do so.
Many trusts in the sector have been trading at a slight premium to net asset
value, making new issues comparatively attractive.
Schroder Investment Management is better known for unit than investment
trusts: it already has four Japanese unit trusts. The new trust will be
managed from Tokyo by Mr Ed Merner, who has been responsible for the
Schroder Japanese Smaller Companies unit trust since its launch 10 years
ago.
Mr Jeremy Hill, a director of Schroder Investment Management, said the
company believed there was growing evidence of recovery in Japan.
The fund is being launched by means of a placing and public offer for
subscription which opens on June 7 and closes on June 30. Shares will be
issued at 100p, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Dealings are due
to start on July 11.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cassell, the publisher which will soon come to the market with a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 15m, yesterday published its pathfinder
prospectus.
The document said the group, which recently bought the Victor Gollancz
fiction imprint, made an operating profit of Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds
20.1m in 1993.
Cassell is being floated by way of a placing by Charterhouse Bank, with
Charterhouse Tilney acting as broker.
It will raise about Pounds 7m of new money to redeem preference shares and
substantially reduce debt. Impact day is May 24 and dealings are expected to
begin on June 2.
The group is best known as a publisher of dictionaries and reference books.
Its other imprints include Ward Lock, which includes the Mrs Beeton cookery
books.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Headlam launches Pounds 9m
rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Headlam, the acquisitive floorcoverings and fabrics distribution group, has
launched its second rights issue within a year in order to help finance two
further purchases.
The cash call, via the issue of up to 5.05m new ordinary shares on a 1-for-7
basis at 185p, will raise Pounds 9m net of expenses.
The acquisitions are of Gordon John Textiles, a converter and distributor of
plain and printed fabrics for the domestic and contract curtain markets, and
Wiltrex Readymades, an operator in the ready made soft furnishings market.
Consideration for Manchester-based Gordon John is Pounds 2.98m while that of
north London-based Wiltex amounts to Pounds 900,000. Both transactions will
be in cash. For the 1993 year Gordon John returned pre-tax profits of Pounds
500,000 on turnover of Pounds 14.7m. Wiltex achieved pre-tax profits of
Pounds 200,000 from turnover of Pounds 2.3m for the same year.
Mr Graham Waldron, Headlam chairman, said the acquisitions would complement
last year's purchase of Claremont Fabrics, which was part financed by a
Pounds 5.04m rights issue.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Luxury end helps Time Products rise 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A successful year in the luxury wristwatch market, with one item being sold
for Pounds 500,000, helped Time Products to boost 1993 profits by 15 per
cent.
The watch and jewellery distribution group reported pre-tax profits up from
Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11.4m, including Pounds 1.5m from the disposal of the
group's remaining property interests in Hong Kong. Turnover expanded 13 per
cent from Pounds 59.2m to Pounds 67.1m. The 1992 turnover contained Pounds
9.6m from discontinued operations.
Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said the group's luxury business had had an
outstanding year. Luxury items now accounted for 80 per cent of operating
profits, compared with 20 per cent from the volume operations, which include
Sekonda watches.
Last March the group paid Pounds 11.9m for Judith Leiber, an American
designer of luxury handbags and evening bags sold at between Dollars 1,200
and Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 820 to Pounds 2,740). It also bought the North
American distribution rights for Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker, for
Pounds 2m.
The two acquisitions contributed Pounds 13.6m to last year's turnover and
Pounds 1.57m to operating profits of Pounds 9.15m (Pounds 6.34m).
Mr Margulies predicted that near-term growth would come predominantly from
expanding the Judith Leiber brand beyond the US. The group was already
supplying two outlets in Thailand.
The group had also opened a luxury watch showroom at Judith Leiber's
premises in New York. It holds agencies for seven luxury watchmakers
including Blancpain, Vacheron Constantin, and Audemars Piguet.
Since the year end it has purchased 78 per cent of the marketing company for
Audemars Piguet in Switzerland - which Mr Margulies described as 'a real
feather in our cap'.
Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 2.12m to Pounds 728,000.
Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 15.8p (13.9p). A proposed final
dividend of 5.5p takes the total for the year to 8.5p (7.95p).
COMMENT
The strategy of concentrating on luxury brand names appears to be bearing
fruit. Taking non-recurring items out, profits were ahead by 12 per cent - a
good underlying performance - and the group ended the year with net cash of
Pounds 10.9m. If the management's faith in the expansion possibilities of
the Judith Leiber brand is realised, further strong growth can be expected.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m this year would put the shares on a
prospective multiple of 16, which looks fair value.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew sets up new joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew, the medical goods company, has made the first of what could
be a series of investments in the biotechnology sector by setting up a joint
venture to develop a product for what it says will be a Dollars 1bn a year
market.
The venture is with Advanced TissueSciences, a California-based
Nasdaq-listed company with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 200m
(Pounds 137m).
ATIS grows living cartilage in the laboratory which is then surgically
inserted into the patient's knee.
The technology has been demonstrated in animal tests and the joint venture
would now put it into clinical trials, said Mr John Robinson, chief
executive.
S&amp;N is already a large supplier of joint replacement systems such as knees
and hips, but the technology has not changed fundamentally for many years.
It is putting Dollars 10m cash into the venture, with the cartilage
technology valued at Dollars 10m coming from ATIS.
Mr Robinson hoped to have the product on the market by 1999.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chesterfield shares rise on 63% net assets
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Chesterfield Properties yesterday rose 12p to 613p after the
company announced a 63 per cent rise to 650p in its net asset value per
share as at December 31.
The figure partly reflected the write-back of a Pounds 25.7m provision in
the previous year; the investment property portfolio increased by 17 per
cent in value, with its central London component improving by 24 per cent.
Pre-tax profits leapt to Pounds 37.4m in 1993, compared with a restated loss
of Pounds 18.1m. Excluding the write-back, profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds
8.2m.
The group's entertainment interests, which range from its three Curzon
cinemas to a number of West End theatres, suffered from a Pounds 500,000
provision for bad debt and contributed a loss of Pounds 1m.
Rental income fell from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 26.9m reflecting property
disposals. Mr David Kiernan, finance director, said one further small
property disposal was under consideration, but the company was seeking
acquisitions.
Net debt amounted to Pounds 160m at the year end, representing gearing of
102 per cent, less than half the 1992 figure.
The company's Pounds 56m of development properties are still valued at cost,
with Pounds 30m of these in the US. Mr Kiernan was confident that this
reflected current market value, and no provisions would be required.
A proposed final dividend of 8p makes a total of 12p (11p). Earnings per
share were 171.54p, of which 137p was accounted for by the revaluation.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ashanti on course to hit 1m ounces a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange
last month, is still on course to become one of the world's few 1m ounces a
year gold producers in 1995.
This was revealed yesterday by Mr Sam Jonah, managing director, who also
reported a marginal increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to
end-March.
The profits figure of Dollars 42.6m (Pounds 29m) was in line with most
expectations and compared with Dollars 41.5m. Turnover increased from
Dollars 127.3m to Dollars 142.8m and earnings per share emerged at 53 cents
(52 cents).
Mr Jonah said gold production in the half-year was below the budgeted
395,268 ounces at 380,581 ounces, principally because of a lower grade of
ore processed at the Pompora treatment plant.
A higher gold price encouraged Ashanti to use more low-grade ore from its
stockpile. Also, a lower average grade of ore mined underground pushed
Ashanti's cash costs from Dollars 157 an ounce in the same period a year ago
to Dollars 184.
Mr Jonah said these underground difficulties should come to an end in about
a month's time.
Ashanti expected production to increase significantly in the second half
following the full commissioning of a biological sulphide treatment plant
and further development of the underground mine. The production target of
860,000 ounces for the year was expected to be met at cash costs below
Dollars 180 an ounce over the full year.
The average gold price achieved before hedging in the half-year rose from
Dollars 339 to Dollars 382 an ounce.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: GA tops Pounds 60m but balance sheet
suffers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp decline in the value of its investments in equities and gilts has
dented the balance sheet of General Accident, one of the largest UK
composite insurers.
The Perth-based company yesterday disclosed the extent of the damage when
reporting a rise in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 41.3m) for
the first three months of 1994.
GA's solvency margin - the yardstick which compares shareholders' funds as a
percentage of non-life premium income - had fallen to 55.4 per cent by May
6, compared with 65.5 per cent at the end of last year. Net asset value per
ordinary share fell from 545p to 455p over the same period.
However, Mr Nelson Robertson, group chief executive, described the operating
result as the best 'ever achieved in an opening quarter'.
The impact of severe winter weather in the US and Canada, which added an
extra Pounds 27m in losses compared with last year, was offset by continued
improvement in UK underwriting results, with a profit of Pounds 30.3m
(Pounds 4.1m deficit) for the three months.
'The control of costs, more selective underwriting procedures and an
increased emphasis on customer service,' were singled out as factors behind
the improvement by Mr Robertson. Each of GA's UK underwriting lines was in
surplus, with the exception of liability business.
Underwriting losses in the US amounted to Dollars 57.8m (Pounds 39.5m)
against Dollars 60.1m, while losses in Canada increased to CDollars 63.1m
(Pounds 31m) compared with CDollars 22.4m. Parts of Canada have experienced
one of the coldest winters in living memory.
Overall general premium income increased to Pounds 1.07bn (Pounds 1.01bn).
Life premiums rose to Pounds 216.6m (Pounds 207m). Investment income rose to
Pounds 118.8m (Pounds 117.3m).
Estate agency losses were marginally higher at Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 3.7m).
Underwriting losses were Pounds 63.3m (Pounds 77.1m deficit). Life profits
were Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.5m). Interest on loans amounted to Pounds 3.4m
(Pounds 5.7m).

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Disposal plan will cut Do It All to 140
stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots and WH Smith said yesterday they planned to sell up to 100 stores in
their loss-making DIY joint venture Do It All, with 40 disposals already
agreed. They are making total provisions of Pounds 60m.
Do It All has 220 stores trading, with 20 already closed. The disposals will
leave 140 stores, all of which will eventually be refitted to a new format
called the 'new trading concept'.
The joint venture partners said they expected the chain to return to a
trading profit in the next financial year, 1995-96.
The agreed disposals were fewer than the City expected, although the
eventual total was larger and the provisions smaller. Analysts pointed out,
however, that only 14 sales had been finalised, with contracts exchanged on
10, but 16 were still under negotiation.
'It's a bit disappointing,' said one, 'This has been going on for a long
time, and it's still not clear how they are going to get rid of all these
stores.'
Mr Steve Russell, managing director of Do It All, said the disposals could
not be rushed, but the target was achievable.
'We intend to perform this task carefully. These are not panic measures. We
want to sell these stores in good order and get the best deals we can.'
Sir Malcolm Field, chief executive of WH Smith, said the programme
represented 'decisive action', which would 'create a strongly competitive
business for the longer term'.
Boots' shares closed up 3p at 556p, but WH Smith's dropped 9 1/2 p to 506
1/2 p.
The provision will be taken in Do It All's profit and loss account for the
year to February 1994. It includes a Pounds 19m write-off on fittings and
stock, Pounds 5m for trading losses, and Pounds 31m for reverse premiums,
rents on vacant stores and redundancies.
The remaining Pounds 5m is to cover write-offs associated with refitting
stores.
Mr Russell said it was difficult to forecast the number of redundancies, but
it was unlikely to be large. Some staff would remain with stores under new
ownership.
Some jobs would be lost at head office, but these would result from a wider
review of management systems to increase efficiency.
The partners are spending Pounds 10m this year on converting 38 Do It Alls
to the new format, taking the total to 82. The remainder will be refitted
over two years - with some earlier refits upgraded - at a cost of about
Pounds 20m.
Efficiency will also be improved through the introduction of centralised
distribution.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chime confirms Chartwell deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chime Communications, Sir Tim Bell's private PR business, confirmed plans
yesterday to come to market through a reverse takeover of Chartwell Group,
the USM-quoted toilet cubicle and carpet tile manufacturer.
The proposed deal provides a partial 34p a share cash offer for Chartwell's
existing shareholders. Shares in Chartwell, which yesterday reported a
substantially higher pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.19m (Pounds 445,000) in the
year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 6.26m (Pounds 5.62m), were suspended
last week at 48p pending an announcement.
The Gravesend-based group will pay a total of Pounds 14.3m to acquire Chime,
which was set up by Sir Tim in 1989 following a management buy-out from Lowe
Howard Spink, the advertising company.
The acquisition will be partly funded through the placing by Panmure Gordon
of 11.9m new shares at 34p each with institutional shareholders to raise
Pounds 4.05m. The remaining Pounds 10.2m will be satisfied through the issue
of a further 30.1m shares to the vendors.
A further 7.35m shares will be placed to raise Pounds 2.5m which will be
used to reduce the debt incurred by Chime at the time of buy-out.
The enlarged group, which will be renamed Chime Communications, has applied
for a London listing. It plans to dispose of the current Chartwell
businesses 'in due course'.
Chime made 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.05m (Pounds 918,000) on turnover
of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 11.9m).
Because of 'the fundamental change' in the nature of Chartwell's business,
Chartwell's existing shareholders are being offered 34p a share cash for up
to 3m shares, representing 45 per cent of its fully diluted equity.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Wiseman buys rival for Pounds 8.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish milk processor which floated on the
stock market in March, is paying Pounds 8.1m to buy Kennerty Farm Dairies, a
rival Scottish processor and distributor. The deal follows Wiseman's
purchase of Mackies, another Scottish dairy group, in April for Pounds
3.17m.
The deal will take Wiseman's share of the Scottish milk market from 21 per
cent to 31 per cent, and its share of the total UK market from 2 to 3 per
cent.
Kennerty, owned by Juronom, a private company, sells to independent
retailers, caterers and households through doorstep deliveries. It has three
processing sitesand a half share of a dairy in Dundee. It also has 15
distribution depots and a dairy farm.
In the float which valued it at Pounds 63.7m, Wiseman raised Pounds 14.5m
cash for the company. The Wiseman family retained a 74.8 per cent stake.
Wiseman said Juronom had net assets of Pounds 3.2m at January 1, and made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 338,000 on sales of Pounds 45.8m in the year to
that date.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs put Arlen Pounds 6.81m in
red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A provision for the loss on the sale of a subsidiary, reorganisation costs
and compensation to former directors left Arlen, the light fittings and
electrical accessories company, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.81m for the
nine months to December 31.
The provision, relating to the sale of Highland Electronic, amounted to
Pounds 6.37m, of which Pounds 5.8m was for goodwill previously written off.
The operating loss of Pounds 456,000 on continuing activities was the result
of the compensation and reorganisation, directors said.
There is a deficit on revenue reserves and a capital reorganisation is
planned.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 26.5m, of which Pounds 6.01m was for
discontinued activities. In the previous 12 months pre-tax profits were
Pounds 719,000 on turnover of Pounds 32.2m. The net interest charge fell
from Pounds 486,000 to Pounds 144,000.
Losses per share were 13.2p (earnings 0.9p). During the period there was a
Pounds 6.7m rights issue which left Fortress Trust with a 25 per cent stake.
Directors said the first quarter's trading was satisfactory.
The shares rose 3p to close at 30p.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Hotels and nursing homes behind rise at
Vaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance in hotels and nursing homes helped Vaux, the
Sunderland-based brewer, to a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to Pounds
10.7m for the six months to March 19.
The price war in the wholesale beer trade continued to take its toll, with a
10 per cent fall in Vaux's volume sales to the free trade.
Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman, said the overall beer market had fallen by 3
per cent, and by 10 per cent over the past three years. Vaux had resisted
pressure to cut prices, he said. 'We weren't prepared to trade margin.'
Sales to Vaux pubs were also down 1 per cent.
However, this was more than offset by the start-up of a contract to brew
Heineken lager for Whitbread, which helped contract brewing volume to
double. The net effect was a 7 per cent rise in beer volume and a 3 per cent
rise in trading profit to Pounds 8.7m, on sales up 1 per cent.
Group turnover was up 3 per cent at Pounds 109.1m. Profits from Swallow
Hotels were up 13 per cent at Pounds 6m, with room rates held steady over
the period and occupancy rates up slightly at 58 per cent. Profits from St
Andrew Homes, the nursing homes chain, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 2.3m.
Profits from Vaux pubs were up 4 per cent at Pounds 2.4m.
Net debt was Pounds 125m (Pounds 132m) at mid-year, resulting in gearing of
33 per cent. After interest charges of Pounds 6.23m (Pounds 6.16m) and tax
of Pounds 2.13m (same), earnings per share emerged 12 per cent higher at
6.09p. The interim dividend is raised 3 per cent to 3.35p.
Sir Paul criticised the government for inaction over beer imports. 'The
brewing industry is looking at difficult times ahead', he said. However,
though the strength of recovery in consumer spending remained uncertain,
Easter trade had been up to expectations and profits were ahead in the year
to date.
COMMENT
Though the shares dipped 9p to 278p, there was nothing in the figures to
surprise. The dividend increase looks mean, but Vaux is on record as wanting
to rebuild cover to 2 to 2.5 times. Coming at the start of the brewers'
results season, the profits performance may compare favourably with the rest
of the sector. Assuming a full year pre-tax rise of some 10 per cent to
Pounds 29.5m, the shares are on 15 times earnings. Though this is not hugely
attractive, Vaux has the advantage of exposure to an apparently reviving
hotels sector, in which it invested heavily through the recession.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Where diversity helps balance the books -
Royal Bank of Scotland and its true worth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the four years since Mr George Mathewson took control of Royal Bank of
Scotland, his constant refrain has been that his bank's true value is not
appreciated.
The steep climb in its share price over the past two years has reduced the
volume of his complaint, but not yet stopped him making it.
'I'm in a bind, because when I say value is not recognised, people ask why
we don't release value by floating something. But no, I still don't think it
is,' he says, undaunted by the fact that his bank's shares now trade at 2.46
times their book value - marginally higher than even Lloyds Bank.
This is a considerable turnaround from when Mr Mathewson was appointed
deputy chief executive in 1990. It was part of a reshuffle engineered by
Lord Younger, the chairman, to shake up what Mr Chris Ellerton, a bank
analyst at SG Warburg, refers to as its 'moribund' former management.
The publication of its interim results today marks a further step in its
development since then. The flowering of businesses such as Direct Line, its
telephone insurance arm, and Citizens, its US subsidiary, have now pushed
its value to some Pounds 1.25bn more than its old rival, Bank of Scotland.
Yet whatever the quality of the former senior executives, it was they who
made a series of strategic decisions that have paid handsomely. These
include the acquisition of Direct Line and Citizens, and forming an alliance
with Banco Santander after it bought 9.9 per cent of Royal Bank's equity.
Mr Mathewson, a former engineer who joined the bank from the Scottish
Development Agency, has cemented what once seemed a strained link with Mr
Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line. He has also developed the
Santander link strongly by investing in its Ibos cross-border payments
system.
But questions remain over whether he has turned Royal Bank into a coherent
business, rather than a collection of several. The bank has faced constant
speculation about the flotation of Citizens or Direct Line, despite his
insistence that he will continue to develop the bank as a single entity.
The rising share price has helped. Doubts about it having overlapping
distribution methods in Direct Line and its branch bank are also easing. As
more banks reduce their branches and turn to telephone and direct selling
methods, Royal Bank's dual delivery approach appears increasingly sensible.
'I think it does make sense as a business, because banking is boiling down
to the number and quality of the customers you can get,' says Mr Ellerton.
He says that Direct Line's ability to attract reliable, well-off customers
means that Royal Bank can take market share cheaply, and with little risk.
'People do not realise the value of having more than one brand,' says Mr
Mathewson. He cites Direct Line's ability to price personal loans
differently according to its assessment of how credit-worthy the borrower
is. The branch bank could not do it because it would be socially
unacceptable.
This ability to deploy a variety of selling approaches is one reason why Mr
Mathewson likes having a diversified bank.
A second is that he has been trying to reduce the volatility of the bank's
earnings after the shock of the Pounds 1.1bn bad debt provisions it had to
make between 1991 and 1993.
He says that corporate lending has proved the most volatile activity. The
bank has partly tried to address this by working harder to sell things such
as treasury products, and custodial services to large companies. But its
main emphasis has been on diversifying its businesses to balance volatile
ones.
Mr Mathewson says this is one reason for keeping Citizens, which made Pounds
19.7m in 1992 when pre-tax profits of the whole group fell to Pounds 20.9m.
'Citizens earnings were very convenient then. The US banking market is not
directly correlated with the UK one, so it gives us a balance,' he says.
This belief in diversification, and reducing volatility of earnings, means
that speculation about Royal Bank has been turning from the question of
whether it will sell businesses to whether it will buy another one. Mr
Mathewson himself insists that the latter is the more obvious course.
He argues that Royal Bank's capital backing and management expertise have
helped to develop operations such as Citizens and Direct Line. 'We have
added value to Citizens even though we do not run the operations, and we
will continue to try to create new and exciting businesses,' he says.
Mr Mathewson sees the obvious next target as a building society. The bank
has already been selling more mortgages because they provide more consistent
income than lending to companies. 'The right society would give us a stable
earnings stream, and perhaps a higher credit rating,' he says.
The problem is that societies have been alerted to their potential value by
Lloyds' bid.
For the moment, many analysts think that investors have already recognised
at least the greater part of Royal Bank's value. 'The expectations are built
into the price already,' says Mr Ellerton. It remains for Mr Mathewson to
prove that these expectations are still not great enough.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Redrow's small public response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 117m flotation by Redrow, the third housebuilder to come to the
market this year, has fallen foul of the recent fatigue in the London stock
market for new issues.
The company announced yesterday that while all of the 87m shares on offer
had been taken up, the public had subscribed for only 17.12m or 78.7 per
cent of the minimum 21.75m shares they had been offered.
The shortfall has been placed with institutions which have acquired 4.6m
more shares than they had expected. The issue at 135p was fully underwritten
by Barclays de Zoete Wedd with Cazenove acting as broker.
The issue price valued the company at Pounds 298m. The company scaled down
the offer price following a fall in building share prices this spring. It
had originally considered an issue price of 145p, valuing the company at
Pounds 350m.
Under the terms of the issue Redrow gained Pounds 55.4m from the sale of 41m
shares while Mr Steve Morgan, the founder and chief executive, raised Pounds
62m from the sale of 46m shares, reducing his stake to 60 per cent. Mr
Morgan originally had planned to raise Pounds 100m and reduce his stake to
50 per cent.
Dealings are due to start in the shares on May 17.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bearing Power at Pounds 404,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite continuing pressure on margins, Bearing Power International, which
distributes precision bearings and power transmission components, raised
pre-tax profits from Pounds 257,000 to Pounds 404,000 in the half year to
March 31.
Acquisitions helped turnover jump 58 per cent to Pounds 17.9m. After a tax
charge of Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 26,000 credit), earnings per share emerged
lower at 0.84p (0.91p). There was again no interim dividend - last year's
single distribution was 0.75p.

FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlain Phipps to seek relisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the British footwear industry fights against the threat of east Asian
imports, one UK company is making a healthy living by supplying shoe
components to Asian manufacturers.
Chamberlain Phipps - which manufactures plastic and rubber soles, as well as
shoes - is hoping to cash in on its success by returning to the market this
summer valued at more than Pounds 90m.
The group was last quoted on the London Stock Exchange in 1989, when it was
acquired by Evode, the adhesives company, as part of a larger purchase.
By 1992, however, the company had begun to suffer the effects of recession
and a sharp downturn in the UK shoe market. Evode opted to sell Chamberlain
to Mr Dan Sullivan, a US investor, and Legal &amp; General Ventures, the venture
capital company, for Pounds 12m.
Since then, the two shareholders have invested a further Pounds 30m in
acquisitions and restructuring. Chamberlain now claims to be a leading
exporter of plastic and rubber shoe components to east Asia, and France's
largest private-label shoe supplier. Profits have risen from just under
Pounds 5m in 1992 to about Pounds 11m this year.
The company aims to raise Pounds 50m in the float, of which Pounds 35m will
be used to reduce debt. The remaining Pounds 15m will be split between the
founding shareholders.
Mr Sullivan, who boasts a track record of more than 30 buy-ins and
flotations in the US, including Tyco Toys, is expected to recoup his Pounds
4m original investment in return for selling about 10 per cent of his 50 per
cent holding.
After the float, which will roughly double Chamberlain's equity base, Mr
Sullivan will hold between 27 and 30 per cent.
Legal &amp; General is selling about half its stake and will retain between 15
and 20 per cent of the enlarged group.
Mr Sullivan said the export market, particularly in east Asia, represented
great potential. 'Demand is high for western European materials,' he said.
They offered quality and choice at a price which could be incorporated into
the cheaper east Asian shoes, because of the relatively low labour cost.

FT  11 MAY 94 / SmithKline seeks to limit generic rivalry: Drugs group to
launch unbranded version of best-seller as US patent of Tagamet expires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, is to launch an unbranded
version of its former best-selling ulcer drug Tagamet in the US in an
attempt to stave off competition from makers of cut-price generic products
after Tagamet's US patent expires on May 17.
SB has said that as many as 10 generics manufacturers could enter the market
after the patent expired. The US accounted for two-thirds of Tagamet's
global sales of Pounds 673m in 1993.
From next week, SB will sell Tagamet under its generic name cimetidine
directly to US hospitals and the health management organisations, which run
healthcare services for employers and insurance companies. Customers could
include Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services which SB bought for Dollars
2.3bn last week.
SB has also signed a distribution agreement with Lederle, part of American
Cyanamid, known for its aggressive selling of generics.
The generics will be made at Tagamet's Puerto Rican site but sold by SB's
subsidiary Penn Labs. No pricing details were revealed, but Mr Jerry
Karabelas, president of SB's North American pharmaceuticals business,
acknowledged that previous patent expiries have seen prices fall by more
than 80 per cent within 18 months.
SB is unlikely to engage many more distributors of the drug because the
industry has seen the results of US company Syntex's efforts to become the
dominant supplier of the raw active ingredient.
Over the last six months Syntex tried to cushion the blow of patent expiry
by supplying the active ingredient of its anti-inflammatory Naprosyn to
generic manufacturers. Sales nevertheless fell rapidly, one of the factors
behind last week's Dollars 5.3bn takeover of Syntex by Switzerland's Roche.
SB is likely to reveal further parts of its strategy to limit the damage of
the patent expiry. They have already included legal action against US
generics company Mylan, which has US Food and Drug Administration approval
to sell cimetidine. That action alleges trademark infringements: Mylan's
cimetidine is the same pale green colour as Tagamet and could confuse
patients, said Mr Karabelas.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Royal Bank of Scotland seeks to purchase building society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland would like to buy a medium-sized building society
with a 'recognisable name' in the high street, Mr George Mathewson, its
chief executive said yesterday.
Mr Mathewson, whose bank will disclose its interim results for the six
months to March 31 today, said a society acquisition could help it with its
strategy of diversifying business, and making its earnings less volatile.
Mr Mathewson confirmed Royal Bank had been interested in acquiring
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, for which Lloyds has bid Pounds
1.8bn. But it was also interested in societies with a different mix of
operations. 'We would certainly be interested in the right building society.
It would need to be substantial in size, of high quality, and with a
recognisable brand name,' he said.
Mr Mathewson said that the acquisition of a society could also help to
strengthen its deposit base. 'The cost-income ratios of other societies may
be higher (than C&amp;G's) but that does not necessarily mean they are poorer
businesses,' he said.
He also said that Royal Bank might be an attractive owner for a society
because it had shown it was capable of allowing subsidiaries such as Direct
Line, its telephone insurance arm, to have operating autonomy.
Mr Mathewson's confirmation of interest in acquiring a society follows
similar statements by Bank of Scotland, Abbey National and TSB Group.
Mr Mathewson said that Royal Bank would like to increase the proportion of
residential mortgages within its assets because they have been less risky
than corporate loans. This would help to make its earnings less volatile.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Why Ken and Eddie need not have bothered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ghost is stalking the world's financial markets, but its identity remains
shadowy. Is it the spectre of resurgent inflation? It is hard to see where
it would come from, at any rate in the US, Europe and Japan. Perhaps we are
seeing the unwinding of too much speculation, a spooky enough problem which
was focused during the winter on the hedge funds and is currently being
fleshed out by the shifts in the US mutual fund market. Alternatively, there
is simply too much borrowing by governments.
Consider the plight of the Bank of England, which yesterday issued its
quarterly Inflation Report. Since the last one came out, the yield on
10-year UK government bonds has jumped by 2 percentage points. Can the Bank
possibly consider issuing gilts at a ruinous 8.4 per cent?
The publication of the February report ironically coincided with the
damaging argument between Eddie George, the Bank's governor, and Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, over whether short-term rates
should be cut from 5 1/2 to 5 per cent. They need not have bothered. In the
event monetary policy has been crudely tightened for them by the markets
(the one-year rate is already 6 per cent). Mortgage lenders, for instance,
have now withdrawn most of the cheap fixed-rate offers which were fuelling
the housing market's recovery.
UK inflation on 'RPIY' - the Bank's preferred measure - is under 2 per cent.
Yet the yield structure in the gilt-edged market appears to discount a rate
of almost 5 per cent, given a real yield on index-linked gilts of about 3
1/2 per cent. However, there are other interpretations. You can argue, for
instance, that there is an unusually large risk premium on fixed interest
gilts. But my own view is that the real yield on linkers is being
temporarily held down by the influence of the equity market, which is about
20 times bigger.
Inadequate arbitrage between the UK bond and equity markets has permitted an
anomaly. It seems more realistic to suppose that the real long-term gilt
yield has risen to between 4 1/2 and 5 per cent, forced up by the surge in
borrowing over the past two or three years (no longer absorbed by
speculators) and by recent political uncertainty. But equity investors have
been reluctant to sell the share market down below the current 3.7 per cent
All-Share Index yield. The linkers' yield has therefore been trapped -
within only about 10 basis points of the equity yield, a remarkably narrow
gap which itself is a clear sign of distress. The anomaly could be corrected
by a fall in gilt yields to 7 1/2 per cent - or by a jump in the average
equity yield to near 5 per cent.
Is there a similar anomaly on Wall Street? Albert Edwards, strategist at
Kleinwort Benson, has combed through the US mutual fund statistics for March
and come to some very disturbing conclusions, using words such as 'disaster'
and 'bloodbath'.
In March 1993 bond funds and stock funds both attracted net inflows of
Dollars 12bn. In March 1994 equity fund inflows were still Dollars 12bn
(though well down from the recent peaks) but bond fund net sales were down
to Dollars 2bn. Worse, says Edwards, this does not allow for umbrella-type
switches from bond to money funds, allowing for which bond funds suffered a
negative net cash flow of Dollars 5bn.
Where bond markets lead, equity markets tend eventually to follow. The
problem is that equity managers do not appear to have woken up to the
dangers. Whereas the bond fund managers have been battening down the hatches
and raising liquidity, stock fund managers have seen the market's weakness
as a buying opportunity. So if they are hit by a wave of redemptions they
will be unprepared.
Goose-pimply comparisons with 1987 should be taken warily: equity markets
are not so overvalued as they were then, though on the other hand bond
markets may be fundamentally cheaper, with returns forced up by vast
government borrowing. If bonds and equities suddenly come back into a
coherent relationship, the impact, if not bloodsoaked, could still be
painful.
Ghosts of the past may meet ghouls of the present. Putting it another way,
there is an unusually attractive arbitrage opportunity between bonds and
equities.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Price war threat to profitable Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save, the UK's biggest discount grocery retailer, yesterday announced
an increase in interim profits before tax from Pounds 61m to Pounds 65.4m,
but said trading was being damaged by last month's tax increases and prices
were falling.
Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said sales volumes from existing stores
increased 3.2 per cent in the 28 weeks to March 12, but since the tax
changes took effect, volume growth had fallen to 1 per cent.
At the same time, grocery prices were now 3.5 per cent lower than last year,
owing partly to intense price competition. An increase in liquor and tobacco
prices offset that, but overall price deflation had reached 2 per cent,
after averaging 1.2 per cent in the first half.
Mr Graeme Bowler, chief executive, warned the tough competition would
continue.
'I don't think it is something that is here today and gone tomorrow. We are
in for a period of sustained pressure on prices,' he said.
Kwik Save shares closed down 2p at 570p.
Total turnover rose 9.1 per cent to Pounds 1.63bn, of which new stores
contributed 8.4 percentage points. The operating profit increased 8.5 per
cent to Pounds 66.3m.
Mr Pretty said price competition had forced the gross margin down 0.2
percentage points - less than the falls reported by the superstore
operators, thanks to alterations to the product mix, tough negotiations with
suppliers and action to reduce shrinkage.
The operating margin had fallen only 0.1 points to 3.6 per cent.
Rental income from Kwik Save's fresh food concessions increased 18 per cent
to Pounds 12.2m.
Kwik Save now has 838 stores, and plans 80 openings a year for up to 10
years. Mr Bowler said recent research had identified 800 more locations
throughout the UK where Kwik Save stores could trade profitably, including
smaller towns which did not interest superstore operators.
Capital spending will increase from Pounds 103m to Pounds 115m this year,
with 45 store openings planned in the second half, on top of the 35 in the
first half.
Earnings increased from 26.5p to 28.36p per share, and the interim dividend
was lifted from 5.4p to 5.75p.

FT  11 MAY 94 / East Midlands takes Pounds 130m hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits for last year at East Midlands Electricity will be depressed by
Pounds 130m after the company yesterday disclosed the consequences of
widely-criticised diversifications shortly after privatisation.
More than 700 jobs will be lost, some almost certainly through enforced
redundancies, as the company closes three of the six contracting companies
which emerged after acquisitions three years ago.
The 'business re-alignment' includes write-offs in the company's security
and retailing businesses as well as its contracting arm. The policy of
strong growth of the security business is to be discontinued.
East Midlands' statement, from Mr Nigel Rudd, new chairman, represents the
first significant admission of diversification failure by a power company
since privatisation.
East Midlands' announcement came just 10 days after Mr John Harris stepped
down as chairman. Although Mr Harris, 54, went voluntarily, there was
uneasiness within the company about his chairmanship and this could
eventually have led to moves to unseat him.
Analysts yesterday revised forecasts for East Midlands' 1993-4 profits from
about Pounds 185m to Pounds 55m. However the Pounds 130m reduction included
goodwill write-offs which had previously been set against reserves. The
company's actions yesterday will result in a more palatable one-off cash
outflow of Pounds 30m.
The company said its dividend policy would remain unchanged. Investors were
also heartened by a statement from Mr Norman Askew, chief executive, that
the company would concentrate on its core businesses. They marked the
company's shares up 13.5p to 561p.
Yesterday's action means net assets at March 31 will be reduced by Pounds
80m (after related tax relief of Pounds 18m). Some Pounds 61m of the pre-tax
total relates to contracting, Pounds 17m to security and Pounds 20m to the
Homepower retailing division.
Last year's profits will also reflect a Pounds 31.5m charge representing the
value of the goodwill associated with businesses acquired in 1991 and 1992.
Because of previous write-offs this will not affect net asset totals. Mr
Askew said the provisions would have a minimal effect on gearing.

FT  11 MAY 94 / BSN changes name to Danone
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN, France's largest food group, is changing its name to Danone, its
leading yoghurt brand, and has unveiled several international deals,
including the FFr1.9bn (Pounds 223m) acquisition of San Miguel, one of
Spain's largest brewers.
Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman, said the change of name to Danone, the
company's strongest brand, would help the group expand internationally,
particularly into non-European markets.
Mr Riboud also announced a string of investments and acquisitions, including
the purchase of San Miguel, one of Spain's five largest brewers, with sales
last year of Pta38bn (Pounds 186m).
BSN already holds 24 per cent of the Spanish brewer and will increase its
stake to 100 per cent over the next four years.
BSN is to set up a joint venture in Russia, Danone-Volga, to produce
yoghurts and dairy produce. It is investing about FFr20m and will take an 80
per cent stake in the new company.
In Brazil, BSN is to pay an estimated FFr200m for 49 per cent of Campineira
de Alimentos, Brazil's second largest biscuit manufacturer, and in Morocco
it will pay about FFr100m for a 2.7 per cent stake in ONA, the private
sector food group. Mr Riboud hopes that non-European sales will amount to
half of total sales within 20 years, from about 9 per cent at present.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Brewer attacks 'scandal' of cross-Channel bootleg beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The head of one of Britain's biggest regional brewers attacked the
government yesterday over the 'scandal' of bootleg imports of beer from
mainland Europe.
Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux Group of Sunderland, said there was a
'strong criminal element' in the cross-Channel beer trade. 'It's easy money
 -easier than drugs,' he said.
Cross-Channel shipments were now running at over 2m barrels a year, he
claimed. This was equivalent to four times the production of Vaux itself,
which last year sold beer worth over Pounds 100m. 'We have evidence of vans
crossing the Channel and transferring to 40ft wagons,' he said.
Much of the trade is thought to be illegal, since Customs and Excise require
that duty-free beer should be brought in only for personal consumption.
However, Sir Paul said, it was unclear whether this was enforceable under EC
rules. 'The customs are showing a remarkable reluctance to do anything about
it,' he said. 'I suspect that's because they're afraid that if they brought
a case they'd lose it.'
Sir Paul's strictures, coming as Vaux began the brewers' reporting season,
may be followed by other brewery chiefs, who have been lobbying the
government to reduce the duty on beer to bring it closer to French levels.
However, most accept privately that they are unlikely to succeed in the near
term, since the initial drop in revenue would put further pressure on the
government's shaky finances.
Sir Paul strongly criticised the paymaster general, Sir John Cope, who
recently defended the government's position on the grounds that revenue from
drinks duty was up this year.
'I don't think the government really understands how much duty they're
losing,' he said.
'If they let it go on, they will destroy a huge swath of British brewing and
pubs. Then they will lose revenue, panic, reduce duty, and allow a further
wave of French beer in.'
Calling for an immediate halving of beer duty to 15p a pint, Sir Paul
recalled that the last cut in duty in 1959, had presaged a period of
increased consumption.
'The first pub we opened (after the 1959 cut) we called the Jolly Minister,'
he said. 'I'm quite prepared to repaint the sign with a portrait of the
present chancellor if he listens to our suggestions.'
Vaux's half-year figures, announced yesterday, showed a 10 per cent rise in
brewing profits to Pounds 8.7m.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Berlusconi names cabinet to cut economic red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister designate, yesterday announced
a 25-member cabinet for the country's 53rd post-war government, which he has
committed to deregulate the economy, and shake up and decentralise public
administration.
The formation of the cabinet took 11 days of difficult negotiations and
comes nearly seven weeks after Mr Berlusconi's four-party Freedom Alliance
won a landslide victory in the March 27-28 general elections.
The presence of five ministers from the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance
also marks an historic break with the party's long-standing political
isolation.
The government, composed of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist
Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, the MSI and the small Christian
Democratic Centre, will be sworn in today.
However, it is still uncertain whether Mr Berlusconi will go to parliament
with his programme to obtain a vote of confidence this week. Mr Berlusconi
gave the main economic portfolio, the treasury ministry, to Mr Lamberto
Dini, the number two at the Bank of Italy.
Mr Dini is well known internationally, having worked with the International
Monetary Fund, but he is a political novice and his move to the treasury
raises questions about the existing treasury team as well as his replacement
at the central bank.
Mr Berlusconi decided not to scrap the budget and finance portfolios which
have gone respectively to Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, a former accountant and
League senator, and to Mr Giulio Tremonti, a tax expert.
Mr Berlusconi was obliged to make some important last-minute changes. The
most significant involved Mr Cesare Previti, who handles the legal affairs
of Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest empire.
He was switched from the justice ministry to the defence ministry after
objections from within the Freedom Alliance as well as from President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro.
The presence of Mr Previti in the justice ministry was considered likely to
cause a conflict of interest at a time when magistrates are investigating
various aspect of Fininvest activities.
President Scalfaro himself took the unprecedented step of writing a curt
letter to Mr Berlusconi reminding him of his duties in choosing ministers.
The president also reminded Mr Berlusconi that foreign policy must take
account of Italy's existing international obligations and alliances as well
as support for European Union. This was seen as an implicit reference to Mr
Berlusconi's choice of Mr Antonio Martino, his economic adviser, as foreign
minister. Mr Martino, a Chicago-trained economist, is seen as a
'Euro-sceptic'.

FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident is a prime example of the way in which insurance companies
have been de-rated this year. The company's net asset value has fallen by 16
per cent since the turn of the year, while the shares have fallen by 25 per
cent. Gloom about the outlook for stock and bond markets - especially in
North America, which accounts for half of GA's premium income - are partly
to blame. Even if asset markets now calm down, though, worries about
competition in insurance markets will not go away.
There is little doubt that the insurance cycle is turning down in UK
personal lines. Private motor premiums have already started to fall. Claims
will probably become more frequent as the economy turns up. Current returns
on household insurance are also unsustainable. With underwriting profits of
Pounds 28 per Pounds 100 of homeowners' premium income in the first quarter,
GA must have been making a pre-tax return on capital close to 100 per cent.
It is little wonder that direct insurance writers are turning their
attention to this line of business.
Still, GA's shares now yield 60 per cent more than the market average. That
valuation only makes sense on a bleak view of both asset markets and the
underwriting cycle. The plunge in stock and bond markets may thus be a
blessing in disguise. Having seen its solvency ratio fall by 10 percentage
points to 55 per cent so far this year, GA cannot afford to lower its
underwriting standards.

FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Do It All
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots and WH Smith have finally accepted that Do It All needs more than a
fresh lick of paint. The disappointment is that the structural work outlined
yesterday will take so long to complete. Of the 100 stores earmarked for
disposal, only 14 have actually been sold. The Pounds 60m provision - which
will be split equally between the two parents - covers trading losses from
unwanted stores for the next two years. That may hint at how long the
remaining work will take.
Whether the slimmed-down chain can show a decent return thereafter is
difficult to judge. While money is being made available to convert the
remaining 140 stores to a new trading format, it is too early to say that
the format is a runaway success. Even if Do It All can hang on to third
place in DIY, shrinking must have its disadvantages. Yet nimbler
competitors, such as Sainsbury's Homebase, have shown that brain is more
important than brawn. With a new trading format, better distribution and a
little help from the housing market, Do It All must stand a fair chance of
reaching break-even at a trading level next year.
But Do It All's competitors will not stand still while the restructuring
proceeds. New retail space is being added elsewhere in the DIY market. So it
is by no means clear that Do It All can carve a niche large enough to allow
it to flourish. With something like a credible plan in place, though, Boots
and WH Smith can spend a year or two deciding for themselves.

FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Kwik Save
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik Save has done well to improve earnings in a harsh environment. The food
discounter suffered a 1 per cent decline in its selling prices in its first
half year but managed to contain the decline in trading margins to just 0.1
per cent and increase earnings per share by 7 per cent. But it will be hard
to repeat the performance. Price competition is intensifying while the scope
to squeeze further costs out of the supply chain is probably declining.
The main problem is in groceries, where the pace of price cuts has stepped
up. Year-on-year deflation averaged 2 per cent during the half year but has
since risen to 3.5 per cent. Moreover, Kwik Save is struggling to increase
sales: like-for-like sales are currently running at 1 per cent less than
their level of a year ago. Though chief executive Mr Graeme Bowler may be
right to blame the government's tax rises, tougher competition from
superstores and rival discounters must also be a factor.
Kwik Save's strategy for growth is now dependent on its ambitious store
opening programme. The group plans to double the number of outlets to 1,600
over seven to ten years. Its return of 35 per cent or more on capital
clearly justifies further expansion.
Still, given the sector's existing overcapacity and rival groups' expansion
plans, further price pressure looks inevitable. Since Kwik Save's market
positioning has exposed it to more severe price deflation than Tesco or J.
Sainsbury, the recent underperformance in its share price seems logical.

FT  11 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Turning expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The clear message from yesterday's inflation report is that the Bank of
England has now entered that difficult territory where it must start
wondering when and whether to put interest rates up again. On the one hand,
it must prepare the ground; on the other, it cannot want to spook the
markets. Hence the report is both peppered with warnings about what might
happen and reasons why the most recent news is not yet alarming. Thus M0
money supply is still returning to a new equilibrium. Earnings are growing
faster than expected for this stage in the cycle, but there is no logical
reason why they should run away with themselves. Bond markets are indicating
higher inflation down the road but they may have overshot.
Yet stubbornly high inflation expectations cannot be that easily brushed
away. There must be a reason why gilts have performed worse than other
leading bond markets this year: premiums over US and German issues have
widened by 60 and 100 basis points respectively. Perhaps the markets have
been worried that Mr John Major's weak standing will sap his determination
on inflation. The UK certainly does not yet have a strong record to fall
back on.
The Bank thus faces a struggle to establish credibility, especially after
the botched rate cut in February. As of now, it is difficult to believe
money market projections of base rates at 9 per cent within a couple of
years, though that might be consistent with sustained pressure on sterling.
But if the Bank means what it says about expectations, the turn in rates
must have come closer. Any investors still hoping for one last cut are in
for a disappointment.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Sainsbury alters cola packaging to avoid legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, the supermarket group, is making minor changes to the packaging
of its look-alike cola to ward off the threat of legal action from
Coca-Cola, in a dispute which exemplifies the growing row between brand
manufacturers and retailers over shops' own-label products.
Sainsbury, however, will retain the 'Classic' name, which Coca-Cola uses in
the US, and all the core elements of the design and the colour.
Mr Tom Vyner, Sainsbury's deputy chairman, said customers would not notice
the difference in the packaging. 'What we have agreed to do is minor,' he
said. Sainsbury is modifying the type face of the vertically printed 'cola'
inscription and removing the squiggle underneath it.
Mr Vyner said there had been a 'gi-normous' upsurge in sales in the three
weeks since the cola was launched.
A survey by market research group AGB shows that in the third week since it
appeared in the stores, Sainsbury's Classic has captured approximately 15
per cent by value of all cola sales through UK retail outlets, compared with
the 2.5 to 3 per cent share held by Sainsbury's previous own-brand cola
before the launch.
The dominant shares of Coca-Cola and PepsiCola have both been squeezed but
there has also been an 8 per cent increase in overall sales of cola through
grocery outlets, following the Sainsbury initiative.
Mr Vyner said the rapid surge in Sainsbury's sales in part reflected the
great media attention the product has received. A TV advertising campaign is
likely within two months, he said.
Coca-Cola has taken the Sainsbury threat so seriously that negotiations have
been led by its Atlanta head office, largely bypassing UK-based executives.
The dispute has been keenly watched by other manufacturers, increasingly
angry at the damage to sales of market leading brands by supermarkets'
own-label look-alikes. Under existing UK law, it is difficult for them to
take legal action for 'passing off'.
Sainsbury has consistently denied that its product could ever be mistaken by
customers for Coke's. However, Mr Peter Stokes of Coca-Cola, said it had
carried out surveys which showed customers were 'readily confused' about
which product was which.
Sainsbury said it disputed the findings but was happy to make the changes.
Mr Vyner said: 'What we have achieved is the elimination of any danger of
confusion.'
The design changes are believed to have eliminated any possibility of
Coca-Cola's taking legal action for alleged passing off. This will
disappoint other brand manufacturers.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survival at stake as losses byte: Digital Equipment's
restructuring plan may not be enough to remedy its failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive of Digital Equipment,
described the outlook for the computer company in brutally honest terms last
week. He told employees that the 'entire enterprise could be at risk' if
drastic steps were not taken to cut costs.
At least 20,000 jobs had to be axed and segments of the business sold or
abandoned if Digital was to return to profitability, he warned. 'We must
achieve a competitive cost structure as rapidly as possible, and
unfortunately we cannot escape the fact that significant additional
downsizing at Digital is unavoidable.'
Digital has been thrown into crisis by heavier than expected losses for the
January-to-March third-quarter period (its 1994 fiscal year ends in June),
which revealed serious weaknesses in the company's management and a further
decline in profit margins. Losses widened to Dollars 183m, from Dollars 30m
in the same period of 1993. Revenues for the quarter declined by 6 per cent
to Dollars 3.26bn.
In the wake of the financial report, Digital's share price plummeted 20 per
cent to Dollars 23. On Monday it closed at Dollars 21 7/8 , and rating
agencies have downgraded the company's debt. Wall Street is not alone in its
fears for Digital's future. Mr Palmer this week tried to reassure the
company's customers that it remains a 'viable, long-term partner that you
can rely on'. However, confidence in his ability to steer Digital back from
the brink of disaster has been severely shaken.
After sustained criticism from financial analysts, the press, directors and
customers, Mr Palmer feels chastened. 'One of us has a brand new and
personal appreciation for what it feels like to undergo a public lynching,'
he told employees.
Mr Palmer's attackers charge that Digital has failed to come to grips with
its principal problems - high sales costs, weak marketing and poor
management controls. Although the strength of Digital's technology is widely
recognised, the company is still struggling to adjust to an industry-wide
trend toward lower profit margins.
Just 18 months ago, when he took over the top job from Digital founder Mr
Kenneth Olsen, Mr Palmer hoped to engineer a speedy turnround at the ailing
computer group and restore it to former glory.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Digital was second to International Business
Machines in the world computer market. The company 'looked as if it could
walk on water', says Mr Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research, a US market
research firm, recalling the days when Digital's Vax minicomputers were
best-sellers.
But Digital's earnings began to slump in 1989 as competition from
lower-cost, powerful desktop workstations made by companies such as Sun
Microsystems and from networks of personal computers by IBM, Compaq and many
others running industry-standard software began to eat into its core
businesses. Digital was slow to respond to these shifts in technology.
So in October 1992 Mr Palmer took on a company with flat revenues and
deepening losses. Digital had already reduced its workforce by 12,000 to
114,000 and taken restructuring charges of Dollars 2.75bn over the prior
three years. Still the company had failed to stem deepening operating
losses.
Moving quickly to cut expenses and institute tighter management controls,
the new chief executive seemed to be making all the right moves. He
rationalised the company's structure, forming nine customer-focused and
product divisions out of Digital's more than 140 business units.
In sharp contrast to Mr Olsen, who believed strongly in encouraging
entrepreneurial spirit within his company, Mr Palmer began shifting Digital
towards 'a more directive, decisive, top-down management style' to
streamline the company.
In important moves that his predecessor had vetoed, Mr Palmer announced
workforce cuts, streamlined engineering and manufacturing operations and
introduced a commission-based pay scheme to provide incentives to the
salesforce.
Mr Palmer also finally put to rest debate over Digital's commitment to 'open
systems' software which enables different types and brands of computers to
work together more efficiently. Although Digital declared itself an 'open
systems' company in 1990, Mr Olsen continued - right up to the time of his
retirement - to undermine the efforts of his marketing staff by expressing
doubts about the performance of open systems software. In a symbolic break
with the past, Mr Palmer announced in April 1993 that Digital would vacate
the disused woollen mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, its headquarters since
the company was founded in 1957. When Digital recorded a small profit of
Dollars 113m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993 (March-June) it seemed
that the company was on the road to recovery.
With the introduction of its first 'Alpha' computers, it set in place the
cornerstone of a strategy to restore revenue growth and offset declining
sales of older minicomputers. A super-fast microprocessor, Alpha is the core
technology for a broad new range of products.
But it has been downhill for Digital ever since. Between July and September
last year Digital dropped back into the red, as its European sales -
typically about half of total revenues - declined sharply. The quarter to
December produced another disappointing performance with higher than
expected losses and a 12 per cent fall in revenues. Sales of Digital's
'Alpha' computers were not growing as quickly as the company had hoped, in
part due to delays in the development of software and poor marketing.
Then came the shocking third quarter - a 'slap in the face', Mr Palmer
acknowledged, 'a complete surprise'.
Although sales of the Alpha increased by 66 per cent over the previous
quarter and Digital more than doubled its personal computer sales, the gains
did not offset a steep drop in minicomputer sales and an unexpected fall in
service revenues. Some customers are upgrading older minicomputer systems
with new Digital disc drives that are more reliable and require less
maintenance, the company said.
Gross profit margins fell 6 percentage points to 33.8 per cent of revenues
compared with the same period last year, as Digital's sales continued to
shift from high-profit proprietary systems to lower-margin Alpha
workstations and personal computers.
Worse than this performance, in the eyes of investors, was Digital's
inability to foresee sales trends. The company has 'not done a good job of
being able to forecast in sufficient detail the mix of products that our
customers are likely to buy', Mr Palmer acknowledged to the FT this week.
For example, the company could not keep pace with orders for its Alphas,
because it wrongly predicted which models would be in demand. This resulted
in excess inventories of some products and a shortage of others.
'This has a cascading effect on other parts of the business,' Mr Palmer
said. For example, the service business suffered and sales of disc drives
for workstations were held up.
Heavy discounting of prices by Digital's salesforce was another problem, Mr
Palmer told the FT. 'There is some concern that our sales people were put
under tremendous pressure to meet their numbers.' Digital's head of
worldwide sales and marketing, Ed Lucente, resigned in the wake of the
results.
Digital is 'like the barber's son who needs a haircut', said Mr Palmer. The
company lacks the sophisticated management information systems needed for
forecasting, matching supply and demand and other standard business
procedures, he explained. 'We are re-engineering our business processes and
redesigning our whole management information system.'
But such measures are unlikely to solve all of Digital's problems. Last week
Mr Palmer announced the 'second phase' of his restructuring plan. To be
cost-competitive with companies such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Digital
will cut its workforce by about 20 per cent.
Mr Palmer said he was reviewing all the company's activities and would
decide over the next six to eight weeks which parts of the business might be
sold to reduce costs and raise cash to offset further restructuring
expenses.
Digital's salesforce is expected to take the brunt of the job cuts. Unlike
other computer companies, Digital has been slow to switch sales to less
expensive, 'indirect' channels, via independent resellers. Such distribution
channels would need to be in place before swingeing cuts are introduced if
revenues are to be protected.
Although Mr Palmer has yet to set a timetable for the next round of job
losses, he has made it clear that the survival of the company is at stake.
'I intend Digital's operations to be profitable by the end of this calendar
year at the latest. Shareholders demand it, the board of directors expects
it, and I expect us to deliver it.' Mr Palmer's job also depends upon it.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Bank warns on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Major, be warned. The Bank of England's latest quarterly Inflation Report
is bad news for you. It predicts that, if interest rates were to remain
unchanged, underlying inflation two years hence would be 3-3 1/2 per cent.
This would mean that the government's inflation target of 1-2 1/2 per cent a
year by the end of the current parliament will not be met. The Bank's
message is crystal clear: the next move in interest rates will not only be
upwards but may have to come quite soon.
The report identifies three main risks. First, rates of monetary growth have
continued to increase. Second, expectations of inflation have risen.
Finally, the growth of underlying average earnings has picked up.
Narrow money, which grew at an annual rate of 6.2 per cent in April, is
still well above its 0-4 per cent monitoring range. But this, says the Bank,
may reflect an adjustment of cash balances towards a new equilibrium level,
as interest rates have fallen. The growth of the broader measure of the
money supply, M4, has increased for three consecutive quarters, to reach an
annual rate of 5.9 per cent in March, which is near the centre of its 3-9
per cent monitoring range. Furthermore, the Bank's own weighted measure of
the money supply has also begun to pick up.
Greater uncertainty
The clearest evidence of a deterioration in expectations of inflation is in
financial markets, where gilt yields have risen by more than 2 percentage
points since the turn of the year. This rise has been a global phenomenon,
but it has been far greater in the UK than in most major economies. The gap
between yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, a good indicator of
expected inflation, has also risen by almost 1 1/2 percentage points since
January, to 4.7 per cent. Obviously, investors doubt whether the
government's inflation target will be met.
The rise in yields may also reflect greater uncertainty about future
inflation and real yields. The Bank points, mischievously, to the last cut
in interest rates, on February 8, now known to have been imposed, against
its advice, by the chancellor of the exchequer. 'The substantial rise in
nominal bond yields some days after this cut,' notes the report, 'suggested
revised perceptions of the authorities' commitment to monetary stability.'
The pick-up in the growth of underlying average earnings, from 3 per cent in
November to 3 1/2 per cent in February, may be early evidence that
expectations of inflation have risen among wage bargainers too.
Puzzling rise
This rise is rightly deemed puzzling, since there remains a large excess
supply of labour in the UK economy. The number of hours worked in the
economy has, after all, fallen significantly since its peak in 1989. The
Bank iself estimates the 'output gap' - a measure of economy-wide excess
capacity - at just under 6 per cent. This ought to give the UK several years
of rapid growth before strong inflationary pressures re-emerge. But the
evidence of higher pay inflation means that 'it will be necessary to monitor
labour market developments extremely carefully over the next few months'.
The report warns wage bargainers that 'monetary policy will not be used to
validate inflation outside the target range'. If higher inflation is assumed
in pay negotiations, 'real wage levels will turn out to be too high, with
the result that labour demand will be lower and unemployment higher than it
need be'.
The warning is needed. If policy were expected to accommodate higher levels
of wages and prices, that belief could lead to higher wage bargains and
settlements. People must have faith in the inflation target and 'that belief
must be reinforced by adherence to a firm monetary stance'.
Unfortunately, the government is responsible for the actions needed to
reinforce credibility and, not surprisingly, given its past record and the
current political shambles, its commitment is in serious doubt. This means,
in turn, that the real cost of achieving the target is higher than it need
be, which further reduces its credibility. Whatever the political
difficulties, the chancellor must heed the Bank's warning. Neither he, nor
the country, can afford to preside over yet another missed target.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Europe in the firing line: Problems in the company's biggest
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees at Digital's manufacturing facility in Galway, Ireland, used to
receive free turkeys at Christmas. Today, the Ballybrit hardware plant is
closed, the biggest victim of a continuing and seemingly inevitable
retrenchment.
In the 1970s and mid-1980s, Digital spread its manufacturing across Europe:
minicomputers in Galway and Ayr, in Scotland, storage products and
peripheral systems at Kaufbeuren in Germany, printers and terminals at
Valbonne, France, semiconductors in South Queensferry, near Edinburgh,
Scotland, and network systems at Clonmel in Ireland.
Today, only Ayr and South Queensferry remain big manufacturing sites. The
South Queensferry site, where Digital makes the Alpha microprocessor, said
to be the world's fastest, is now manufacturing chips under contract to the
US company Advanced Micro Devices. There are powerful suggestions that
Digital is considering selling the plant to AMD. Mr Vincenzo Damiani,
Digital's European president said this week, however, that it was unlikely
the semi-conductor operations would be sold.
Europe is nevertheless in the firing line. The total workforce is down to
about 27,000 from 29,000 last year, and Mr Damiani confirms it is on course
to fall to 23,000 by December. About 1,000 redundancies will fall on
Digital's bloated direct salesforce.
This total does not include extra job cuts which might be demanded following
the latest analysis by Mr Robert Palmer, Digital chief executive, of the
imbalance between the company's revenues and the size of its workforce.
The 23,000 figure for Europe, however, was calculated by project teams
commissioned by Mr Damiani, as soon as he took up his position at the
beginning of the year. He said yesterday that the balance between
performance and resources was monitored continuously: 'If revenue growth
does not come, we will have to take action accordingly.'
Europe, however, performed no better than the rest of the company last
quarter and it is clear that the disappointing results were due to a large
extent to poor management information. 'We were unable to ship enough
workstations and network servers to satisfy demand,' said Mr Damiani.
'Our ability to forecast customer requirements accurately is not adequate.
Our internal processes are not yet sufficiently customer-focused.'
Having diagnosed the fault lines, it will take time, perhaps up to a year,
to bring the monitoring systems up to scratch. It will be a nervous period
for Mr Damiani and his team. Europe is Digital Equipment's single largest
market, generating about half the faltering computer giant's annual sales.
By comparison, the US accounts for less than 40 per cent of annual revenues.
As a result, the company has been disproportionately hit as Europe's
economies slid into recession over the past three years. The outlook in the
UK is getting brighter, but France and Germany are still black spots. In
Germany, Digital admitted recently that it had achieved little more than
access to Kienzle's customers when it spent Pounds 122m for a controlling
interest in Kienzle, a struggling computer company.
Mr Damiani, who joined the company after 29 years with IBM, has put in place
a strategy he calls 'Go to Market', based on a three-tier approach.
Digital's 500 main European accounts will be managed directly by account
executives. The small and medium-sized companies will be handled by a
combination of the direct salesforce and other distributors. A new
executive, Mr Barry Moloney, with extensive experience in the components and
peripherals business, has been appointed to manage relationships with the
large computer dealers and distributors.
Substantial improvements will have to be made in the company's ability to
meet its customers' needs by matching supply to demand. One senior Digital
executive said: 'Our management processes have been focused internally,
rather than on customer issues.'
Overall, Digital employees in Europe speak of a sense of frustration with
the system; a sense that a company with the technology, products and
expertise that Digital undoubtedly possesses should have come to such a
perilous pass.

Who's to blame for Glasgow's failure to get its new art gallery? The finger
is being pointed at Michael Shea, the Queen's former press secretary and
part-time spin doctor for Lord Hanson.
Shea became a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland after he moved
back to his native Scotland in 1992. He never liked the idea of the new
gallery's nucleus being the Scottish national portrait collection, which
would have been removed from Edinburgh to the new gallery. Shea persuaded
his fellow trustees and his chairman, the terse merchant banker Angus
Grossart, to state in February that while they wanted the new gallery to go
ahead, they also wished to leave the portrait gallery intact.
That not only defused the row; it also made it easy for Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, to point out this week that the proposals not only lacked general
support but also, by excluding the portrait collection, had 'lost their
core'.

Sometimes feet of clay are preferable to being rock-steady. As much as 600
tonnes of gold has moved from the US Federal Reserve bank's vaults to London
and Zurich in the past year, and the word is that the Bank of England has
captured the lion's share.
The Bank of England's big selling point is its better filing system. The Fed
stacks its gold from floor to ceiling, which makes finding and shipping it a
costly, lengthy business. The Old Lady, by contrast, stores its gold on
easy-to-move forklift pallets.
This is more luck than judgment. Terry Smeeton, the Bank's foreign exchange
guru, says: 'The difference is . . . that the Fed in New York is built on
rock whereas the Bank of England is founded on London clay. There is
therefore a limit to the weight our floors will bear.'

Among the more arcane absurdities of British law is a power granted to
Customs and Excise prosecutors to overturn court decisions and spring from
jail anyone convicted of a Customs offence, no matter how long the sentence
or serious the offence. Given by Parliament in 1979, it's apparently
intended to enable a convicted criminal to be a witness in other countries.
This power was probed yesterday at the Scott inquiry by Lord Justice Scott.
Customs chairman Valerie Strachan agreed it was 'totally amazing'. So
unusual, that even the Customs Commissioners were initially astonished to
find they had been given it, she averred.
Lord Scott, dig deeper. What else have they got up their sleeves?

The sight of the Duke of Edinburgh strolling the streets of South Africa -
attending President Mandela's inauguration - will probably have infuriated
hard-bitten Afrikaners, for whom the British royal family is scarcely less
palatable than the African National Congress.
The British monarchy last officially set foot in the Boer heartlands in
1947, just before another seminal election - that of 1948, which brought the
country's first all-Afrikaner government to power.
Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, was then editor of Die
Transvaler, the official organ of the Transvaal National party. The
newspaper was viscerally anti-royalist and studiously carried no reports on
the visit of King George VI, the present Queen Mother and the two
princesses.
Except for one. On the day they were due in Johannesburg, a single paragraph
stated that certain streets in the city would be closed to traffic - because
of the visit of the British king and queen.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Leading Article: In search of a foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton never intended to be a foreign policy president. He knew well
that his predecessor was ejected from the White House in part because of a
perception that he was more interested in international affairs than in
sorting out US domestic problems. President Clinton was determined not to
make the same mistake.
From his inaugural speech onwards, the focus was on his social and economic
agenda at home; references to the wider world were brief, unspecific and
emphasised the constraints on American leadership. The foreign policy
priority - in presidential rhetoric as much as in top government
appointments - was damage limitation: to prevent crises abroad from
intruding on his domestic tasks.
Yet as Mr Clinton has discovered repeatedly in the past 18 months, the
demands of international affairs will not go away. Time and again, he has
found himself distracted by foreign policy brushfires as well as by bigger
questions concerning relations with Russia, China and Japan.
To almost every brushfire, his response has appeared fitful and reactive:
witness the bursts of interventionism on Bosnia, or the sudden reversals on
Haiti. On bigger questions, his policy has often seemed hesitant or riven
with internal contradictions: for example, China, where his campaign promise
to link renewal of most favoured nation trading status with progress on
human rights coexists uneasily with his desire to boost relations with
Asia's fastest-growing economic power.
Nervous allies
As a result he stands accused by the foreign policy establishment at home
and by nervous allies abroad of failing to take a consistent lead
commensurate with the US's role as the world's only superpower. Above all,
he is charged with failing to articulate a coherent set of principles or
priorities for American engagement with the outside world.
Seen from the Oval Office, a good deal of this criticism must seem unjust.
Challenged on the administration's foreign record, Clinton aides tick off
successes such as completion of the Uruguay Round and Nafta; even in Bosnia,
they can claim that the conflict has so far been contained.
Moreover, they argue, the US like every other power is still coming to terms
with the post-coldwar era - one in which there are no reliable precedents to
guide policy, the US faces no strategic threats, and parts of the world are
gripped with intractable civil conflicts whose direct relevance to America's
national interests can seem hard to define.
Valid charge
Yet the fact that a task is difficult does not mean it should not be
attempted. The US's importance to, and involvement in, the wider world means
that it, of all countries, cannot afford not to have a coherent foreign
policy.
The most valid charge against President Clinton is that he has devoted
insufficient energy to developing an intellectual framework within which
such a policy could take shape. Instead of setting the agenda, or even
entering a full-scale debate on what the agenda should be, he has let the
shifting tides of Congressional opinion and lobby group pressure set it for
him. Instead of attempting to define the criteria on which the US would be
prepared to intervene in foreign trouble spots, he has wavered between
stressing the limits on American action and promising actions that he cannot
deliver or which will not have the desired effect.
The least incoherent thread of this patchwork is the Clinton
administration's attempt to put US economic and commercial concerns at the
heart of foreign policy. But even this can seem narrow - as in the obsessive
focus on America's bilateral trade deficit with Japan - and tangled, as in
China. Neither it nor sporadic activism over peace-keeping, peace-making and
the promotion of democracy reflects a clear and internally consistent
concept of US international interests.
It is not too late for Mr Clinton to begin articulating such a concept. With
one, however limited in scope, he would have a basis for weighing the huge
competing demands on America's attention and resources. Without one, the
domestic-policy president will continue to be buffeted by foreign policy
crises not of his choosing.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Japan's regret for the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AKIHIKO FUKUNAGA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Japan withdraws atrocity claim' (May 7/8), has some
historical misunderstanding. It says that Japan 'lags far behind Germany in
voicing official regret for the past', but from 1954 to 1976 Japan paid
enormous amounts of reparations to its neighbouring 12 countries. It even
paid reparations to prisoners of war of 14 countries in 1955 (including the
UK). Germany never paid 'official reparations' to its neighbouring countries
(except victims of 'scientific' experiments). It only compensated victims of
the holocaust and Germans who suffered persecution.
It is difficult to compare what Nazi Germany and Japan did during the war.
Nazi Germany was dominated by an organised violence; the Nazi party tried to
liquidate its political opponents, several races, cultures and
civilisations. This is quite similar to the Stalinist Soviet Union (I have
never heard that the Soviet Union apologised or paid reparation to its
victims).
The 'crimes' Japan committed were colonisation, killing of civilians and
ill-treatment of POWs. Every country has at some time committed these
'crimes' (I have never heard of any country apologising for committing these
'crimes' except Japan).
It is difficult to evaluate and reflect history because, unlike natural
science, it does not have only one answer. If we changed our viewpoints,
there is a totally different dimension. I am not defending militarism, but I
want to defend our ancestors who died in the war.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: No right to speculate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From WA GAMBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on retail recovery and cash surpluses ('Pleasing some of
the people', May 5) highlights an issue which is fundamental and yet is all
too infrequently addressed. Whereas the analyst who advocates the return to
shareholders of cash surpluses which are beyond the immediate needs of the
business has an unassailable case, the arguments (pleadings) against are
devoid of substance and cannot be sustained.
The twin suggestions emanating from directors of companies featured - that
share buy-backs and special dividend payments would be '. . . judged poorly
by investors . . .' and '. . . would be indicative of a moribund management
team with no ideas' - are in each case fatuous. There can be few recorded
cases of investors being opposed to receiving a payment of cash which
belongs to them, and the implication that investors cannot come up with
ideas of their own on how to deploy their surplus cash is both arrogant and
insulting.
Managements (ie, the servants of the owners of the business) should be aware
that it is not their function to speculate with their owners' money in
fields beyond their briefs and outside their areas of competence. While this
may clip their wings in a manner they find irksome, experience suggests that
by being restricted to activities which they know and understand, even
though these activities may be 'mature', they (and their shareholders) are
more likely to prosper than if they are permitted to speculate with money
which does not belong to them.

FT  11 MAY 94 / A blot on the map: The genocide in distant Rwanda can no
longer be ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be wiser not to write about Rwanda. Very few FT readers want to
know about it, and if they did I should not be the best person to inform
them.
There may not even be anything one can usefully say, let alone do, about
what is, for most of us in London and New York and Tokyo, a very faraway
country indeed. Maybe we should be better off, and the Rwandans themselves
at least no worse off, if we literally knew nothing of their affairs.
But that state of innocence is denied us. We have eaten of the fruit of the
tree of knowledge, alias the global media network. We do know that 'up to
200,000' people have been massacred in Rwanda since the death of President
Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6. Even a mind like mine, long since numbed
with the arithmetic of horror, finds that rather a large pile of corpses to
pass by in silence.
So I am forcing myself to think about Rwanda, at least for a minute or two.
To what purpose, you may ask. 'If those people insist on killing each other,
is it any affair of ours? Can we be expected to fight their wars for them?
How many troops would it take to stop this slaughter, and how long would
they have to stay there? Wouldn't foreign troops soon become one side in the
war, or even unite all sides against them? Aren't you advocating a new
colonialism?'
If those questions are asked about Bosnia, which is in the heart of Europe,
and about which we have now had two years to educate ourselves, they are
bound to be asked about Rwanda, an obscure ex-Belgian colony in the heart of
Africa.
Let me answer the last one first, in order to avoid the others. At this
stage I am not advocating anything, except that we pay more attention to
these terrifying events and take them seriously.
I am willing to admit, and I hope it does not make me a racist, that as a
European I feel more directly concerned by Bosnia than by Rwanda. But I have
a strong and uncomfortable impression that many Europeans, including
educated and well-informed ones, do not feel concerned by Rwanda at all.
Part of the reason is probably that during the past month, while the Rwanda
tragedy has been happening, the attention of almost all our Africa
specialists has been riveted on South Africa. Indeed most of them have been
physically there, caught up in the tense and moving denouement of the epic
struggle to end apartheid. They have had little time, and probably even less
to spare of energy or emotional commitment, for events elsewhere in Africa,
as well as being less accessible to diplomats, exiles or relief agencies
involved in Rwanda than they would have been at home.
But that is not the whole story. The truth is that Africa specialists in
themselves are a dwindling and embattled breed. The South African election
might even be their last hurrah. They have been finding it increasingly
difficult to hold the attention of their colleagues and bosses for events in
other parts of the continent where neither white lives nor foreign
investments are at stake on a large scale.
We in the west, or north, have got into the habit of writing off, or
shrugging off, Black Africa as a hopeless case. We think of it as a grim and
tragic story, but one 'told by an idiot, signifying nothing' to the rest of
the world. 'Why can't Africans be more like Asians?' has become the essence
of our conventional wisdom on the subject.
That wisdom was challenged in a recent article in the Atlantic Monthly,
which caused a bit of a stir when copies of it were distributed among the
cream of the Anglo-American establishment at a recent foreign affairs
conference at Ditchley Park, near London.
The author, Robert Kaplan, suggested that many parts of Asia, and even some
parts of North America, are actually very like what we think of as typical
Black Africa, and are going to get more so; and that even if more Asians
than Africans are likely to join the privileged elite of global capitalism,
that elite will increasingly have to spend its time in a kind of
air-conditioned, heavily defended ghetto - since large areas of most big
American cities, not to mention the urban sprawl between Hong Kong and
Guangzhou, are already little safer or healthier than the anarchic,
Aids-ridden shanty towns in which so many Africans now live their short and
miserable lives.
The article, entitled The Coming Anarchy, raised a very uncomfortable
question: could it be that an 'African' future - in which the majority of
the world's population would have to live with endemic violence, rampant
disease, soil erosion, malnutrition, and the collapse of family structures
and values - is not the alternative to an 'Asian' future of headlong
economic growth, but actually the other side of the same coin?
Mr Kaplan raised that question. He did not answer it altogether
convincingly. And anyway he was not trying to explain the genocide in
Rwanda, which happened since he wrote the article. But he did succeed in
making Africa a little harder to shrug off.
Meanwhile, there is another habit which western commentators need to break,
namely that of lumping together victims and murderers, and of assuming that
violence is deeply ingrained in any society where large-scale violence
occurs, rather than looking for specific causes and indeed specific
culprits.
Genocide does not just happen. It has to be carefully planned, and evidence
is already coming out that this was the case in Rwanda, perhaps even more
clearly than it was in Bosnia.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competitiveness matters in the real
world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS MCWILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As someone who has done as much as anyone to awaken interest in
Europe's competitive difficulties, I find it unfortunate that your leader,
'Jobs agenda for Europe' (May 9), repeats uncritically the assertion by the
economist Paul Krugman that European competitiveness 'is not the burning
issue'.
Since 1980, European economic growth has averaged 0.4 per cent per annum
less than the OECD as a whole. Few forecasters, if any, expect any catching
up in the near future. Over the same period the European Union's share of
the world non-commodity exports (if trade within Europe is excluded) has
fallen by more than a quarter. European investment in innovation as a
percentage of gross domestic product is running 25 per cent lower than that
in the US and 30 per cent lower than in Japan. As a result, it is not
surprising that the proportion of European industry described as 'high
technology-based' in 1990 was only 14.5 per cent, compared with 19 per cent
for the US and 20 per cent for Japan.
One of the causes of those problems is lack of profitability; OECD figures
show that the real return on capital in the business sector from 1981-91 was
15.4 per cent in the US, 14.3 per cent in Japan and 12 per cent in Europe.
This is partly because European hourly labour costs are about a fifth higher
than those in the US, while industrial productivity is about a quarter
lower.
Moreover, the economic difficulties resulting from Europe's competitive
problem of being a high cost economy with only medium levels of skills and
technology will be exacerbated in coming years by the likely pattern of
world economic development, especially in Asia and South America.
Because Europe's problems go beyond labour markets, the overhaul of labour
market regulations and of labour taxes and benefit systems which your leader
correctly recommends is unlikely to be sufficient on its own to solve
Europe's jobs problem. In addition, deregulation, privatisation, lower
levels of taxation generally and the ending of the subsidies and
protectionism that preserve inefficient industries in Europe will also be
required. Even then, reversing Europe's declining ability to create jobs may
take a generation to achieve.
Your leader's assertion that the concept of competitiveness 'in relation to
an entire economy . . . lacks much meaning' is based on the academic notion
that exchange rates can always adjust freely to handle competitive
imbalances.
But in the real world devaluation normally adds to inflation and worsens the
terms of trade. This is why competitive problems are just as likely to
result in deflation, leading to loss of jobs, as devaluation.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Ploughs in search of fertile lands: Upheavals in the US and
European farm equipment industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years farm equipment manufacturers in the US and Europe have ploughed a
lonely, and increasingly tough, furrow. Sales have declined as farmers have
battled against recession and tended to buy fewer, larger tractors. Other
opportunities - in Asia, for instance - have been slow to open up, and offer
limited immediate rewards. Factories have been closed, merged or sold.
But in the last month there have been tentative signs of a revival of
interest in the industry's growth prospects. Agco, the fast-growing,
Atlanta-based farm equipment group, has paid Dollars 328m to buy Massey
Ferguson, the UK tractor manufacturer based in the Midlands, from Varity,
the US industrial group.
A day before that deal was announced, Tenneco, the Houston-based industrial
group, said it intended to sell 35 per cent of its J. I. Case farm and
construction equipment division via a public share offering. The decision
apparently reflected a belief that it was a good time to sell.
If the deals go through, two diversified US corporations will have signalled
a strategic shift away from the tractor and farm equipment industry. But
others will have taken their place.
It is easier to explain the motives of the sellers than the buyers. Demand
for the industry's products has sunk, resulting in serious overcapacity and
financial losses for manufacturers. In the US, recession and the heavy
burden of farm debts in the mid-1980s forced many farmers off the land and a
consolidation of small farms into larger ones. The farmers that were left
have bought larger, better-made tractors which last longer than they did 20
years ago. In consequence, North American tractor sales have fallen from
195,000 units in 1980 to 115,000 last year.
In Europe, tractor sales have plunged from about 300,000 in 1980 to 135,000
last year. This is because of the European Union's farm set-aside
programmes, high interest rates which have dented farmers' willingness to
invest, and farmers' 'machinery rings' for sharing heavy equipment,
including tractors.
Reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, including cuts in cereal
prices and increased compensation payments for farmers who take land out of
production, have piled on the pressure.
No farm equipment maker escaped unscathed. Massey Ferguson, for example, has
shut all its North American plants. In Europe, larger producers, which
formerly had three or four tractor factories, have cut back to one or two.
Case, for example, is to shut its Neuss tractor factory, near Dusseldorf, in
1996, leaving Doncaster in the UK as its only European tractor plant. It is
also restructuring its UK and French operations.
Besides closing factories, farm equipment manufacturers are also sharing
production. The most important deal was announced in January, between
Renault, the French vehicle manufacturer, and Deere, the largest US tractor
maker. Renault will supply medium-sized tractors to replace a Deere model
currently manufactured in Mannheim, Germany, and Madrid. In return, Deere's
plant in Saran, France, will supply diesel engines for Renault tractors.
Another result of the retrenchment has been a series of big takeovers,
mainly in the US. Once-thriving enterprises have been swallowed up as their
losses have become unsustainable - most of International Harvester, the US
farm equipment group, for example, was bought by Case in 1985.
In Europe, the process of retrenchment seems far from complete: it still has
at least 40 tractor producers, many with very small market shares and
declining volumes.
In the past year market conditions have improved. UK tractor sales are at
their highest level since 1989, while in the US 'there is a mini-boom taking
place', says Mr Eli Lustgarten, analyst with PaineWebber, the US broker. But
rather than reversing the trend towards retrenchment, some large farm
equipment manufacturers have taken the revival as a chance to sell up.
Explaining why his company sold Massey Ferguson, Mr Victor Rice, Varity's
chairman, says it sees stronger growth in its other businesses  - diesel
engines and automotive braking systems.
Tenneco, too, says it will redeploy proceeds from the sale of its stake in
Case - expected to be about Dollars 500m - into less cyclical, higher-growth
businesses, such as automotive parts.
Their decisions reflect an assumption that, notwithstanding the current
revival, the long-term outlook for the tractor and farm equipment industry
is lacklustre. 'We, like the whole industry, believe that over the long term
retail sales of agricultural equipment will continue to decline. Europe is a
very difficult environment for our business, given the CAP and weakness in
the general economy,' says a Deere spokesman.
Economic conditions are only part of the story: there is also a belief that
the long-term growth areas are going to be those where profit margins are
smaller. 'The most discouraging factor is the likely shrinkage of the market
size in profitable areas, where you can sell tractors with higher
specification,' says Mr Chris Barrow-Williams, analyst at the London-based
consultancy, Corporate Intelligence Group.
'In Europe and the US, tractors are four-wheel drive, not two-wheel drive,
and often have a computer on board. They have 36-speed gearboxes, while
Africa wants eight-speed gearboxes,' he says.
But if the announcements of the last month were logical moves for Varity and
Tenneco, what are the motives of the new owners?
One possible explanation is that they believe farm equipment manufacturers
fare better when separated from other operations. In the 1980s, when Ford
Motor of the US was still in the tractor business, its commitment to the
industry was often questioned: there seemed little synergy between its
tractor operation, with its very long product cycles, and the more dynamic
car business.
But in 1985, Ford's tractor business took over the farm equipment division
of Sperry (now part of Unisys, the US computer group) to create Ford New
Holland. In 1991, Ford New Holland was taken over by Fiat and combined with
the Italian group's earth-moving and farm equipment interests. Though still
under the wing of a large vehicle group, the increased size of the company,
now called New Holland, and its global spread have resulted in a greater
independence.
The workforce of 30,000 in 1991 has been cut to 18,200, but New Holland has
eliminated duplication, streamlined production and stripped out bureaucracy,
enabling it to direct more money to product development. It claims to have
raised its share of the main world tractor markets, and its financial
performance is improving, although last year it still made a pre-tax loss.
Similarly, Agco believes Massey can flourish under its wing, rather than
under the control of a broad industrial conglomerate such as Varity. Mr
Robert Ratliff, Agco chairman, notes that Massey has already made capacity
cuts.
Mr Dominic Chauvin, Massey's president, says the takeover could bring new
opportunities for Massey's plants at Coventry and Beauvais, France, as Agco
moves to exploit its expanded global base through broadening sales of farm
equipment lines acquired in the US over the past three years.
Mr Chauvin says there is also potential for growth in developing countries
of the Far East and in eastern Europe, although sales are constrained
because local farmers rarely have sufficient finance to buy expensive
tractors. 'As soon as there is a mechanism for improving financing, there
should be additional opportunities,' he says.
Such patience requires a long-term commitment to the farm equipment
industry. But the larger manufacturers that remain in the industry appear
confident of reaping reasonable returns from a global market where much of
the ground is stony.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Effect on actuaries' valuations of
dividend limits 'broadly neutral'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN LOWES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex ('UK savings', April 25) considers the effect of a reduction in
dividend payouts on actuaries' valuations of pension funds.
Actuaries' valuations reflect both the current dividend income and
anticipated future increases in that income. If current dividends were
lower, the higher earnings retained by companies would be expected to
produce higher earnings in future years, and in turn higher dividend growth.
The overall effect on actuaries' valuations of pension funds should be
broadly neutral.
So fears that any restriction of dividends might cause an increase in
companies' pension fund contributions and therefore a reduction in the
government's tax take should prove groundless.
The effect of the change in the tax treatment of dividends introduced by the
Finance Act 1993 was different. The reduction in the income received by
pension funds went to the Exchequer. As a result, actuaries did indeed place
a lower value on the assets of pension funds, in many cases causing an
increase in companies' pension fund contributions.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: The Ralf Ralf illusion - Theatre in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The brothers Jonathan and Barnaby Stone - aka Ralf Ralf - are so crazily
concerned with illusion and with theatricality that I would call them
baroque artists if I did not feel that might lead to confusions. They are
entirely modern, and they keep presenting you with satires of modern life.
But, in their current show It's Staring You Right in the Face - which
launches this year's Barclays New Stages season at the Royal Court - they
play sketches-within-sketches and roles-within-roles, so that you are
seamlessly led from one stage event into another. They even wear
suits-within-suits.
Again and again, they make uncanny jokes about fake spontaneity. They
present several sketches as if they were TV presenters, and we the studio
audience; they catch perfectly the awful, synthetic manners of such people,
even though most of the time they are speaking not English but a brilliant
genre of jabberwocky. They conduct an entire chat show in this lingo,
through which somehow they reproduce the inflections of real English as it
is spoken on TV, so effectively that the audience cackles. And, while one of
the star guests reads a nonsense poem with richly inflected sincerity, the
show's presenter quietly slips off into sleep.
Then the guest poet turns the words of his poem into a kind of hypnotism on
the TV presenter . . . and from then on we no longer know where we are. Is
everything that follows part of the presenter's trance? Even when the whole
show suddenly (as if we had switched channels and found ourselves watching
American TV) becomes a Bible-belt show? Replete with casting out devils,
handing over all worldly goods, and leading on 'live' members of the
audience to sing the praises of Him . . . all of which is achieved in more
coherent nonsense language, with every twanging vowel somehow speaking of
the religious fervour of the American South.
Behind these satires is a disturbing vision. You laugh at the soul-barings
of this religious event, but you also know the alarming realities it evokes.
You laugh at the con-man smoothness of other TV presenter types, while
knowing that their banality is one of the most depressing features of modern
life. You laugh because Ralf Ralf shows how fake these things are; but you
are disturbed because you know how effective they are. And the connection of
reality and illusion keeps you happily bewildered.
This is a considerably revised and improved version by the way (it toured
from the middle of 1993 until early '94.) There are still moments when the
show gets struck in a groove, but these do not last long now. And the show's
structural ingenuity is far more apparent and far more baroque.
Does the word baroque confuse? Ralf Ralf confuses too, and brilliantly.
At the Royal Court Theatre until June 11

FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: Falling over England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one minor surprise in Falling Over England. Harry Cowper, the man
who has risen from sub-lieutenant to captain during six years in Egypt,
wants to go into politics when he comes back from the second world war. He
chooses the Tory Party, not Labour.
In the event, his wife declines to let him stand since she does not want to
live in Tintagel, even for the odd weekend, nor in London either. So the
political ambition has turned out to be something of a red herring. It has
merely served to establish Cowper as a bit of a bounder: anti-foreigner,
mildly corrupt, pro-public school and generally refusing to grow up.
Julian Mitchell, the author, seems reluctant to grow up, too. Falling Over
England is the sort of play that should have stopped being written around
the mid-1960s. It has three periods: 1945 and the end of the war, 1956 - the
year of Suez, and the present day. Suez is dominant. Cowper's 20-year-old
son, Matt, leaves the country rather than respond to the call to enrol as a
paratrooper during the Suez campaign. The father dies of a mixture of drink
and incomprehension.
By the present day, the same Matt is having problems with his own son, Tom,
who has unleashed a load pigs onto the M4 in the interests of animal rights.
His Oxford career may be jeopardised.
The message is that English family life, in its rather unpleasant way, goes
on: tea in the garden, the move from mild idealism in youth to mild reaction
in middle age. As Matt, now Matthew puts it: 'When I was Tom's age I thought
there'd be no public schools by now. Or private medicine. Or dukes with
millions of acres . . . I thought people could be educated to a higher
standard. Nothing's happened.' The only change is a debate in the Cowper
family on whether the next generation might possibly go to a state school:
there is a passing reference to someone reading law at Durham. All the
characters are stereotypes except the daughter Sarah, who has a kind of
independence in her painting and journalism, but seldom steps far out of the
family line. The aim cannot be satire because the characters are not strong
enough; nor is it affection since most of them are so unattractive and
Falling Over England is certainly not comedy - more old-fashioned soap.
James Laurenson plays the elder Cowper. Matthew Francis directs.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: Giordano's 'Fedora' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the first interval one man was overheard to remark dolefully, 'You
realise this is costing us more than Pounds 1 per minute'. Giordano might
have been amused, as his opera Fedora panders shamelessly to the desire to
see the rich on stage, caught up in some futile story of love and revenge in
a selection of the world's most luxurious locations.
It is said that Jose Carreras wanted Fedora staged in London. Any request
from one of the 'three tenors' is probably difficult to resist and the Royal
Opera has responded by borrowing this existing production (by Lamberto
Puggelli) from La Scala, Milan - a sensible move, given that the opera is
unlikely to come back often. Caruso helped launch it and since then it has
become the vehicle for a star tenor or soprano, or both.
A poor man's Tosca would be a charitable description. Sardou (soon to
provide Puccini with his 'shabby little shocker') prided himself on putting
together historical melodramas from a stock handful of props and some exotic
locations: this production of Fedora takes us on a charter trip from the
Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to an aristocratic salon in Paris and the
mountains of Switzerland.
If the composer had been Verdi, he might have focussed on some political or
social issue. If Puccini, he would have invested the characters with deeper
emotional psyches. Instead, as humble Giordano, he was content to put the
music to a creaky outline of a period thriller. For an opera lasting barely
90 minutes Fedora remarkably manages to seem too long, forever stalling
before making its next point. At the denouement, as the hero stands around
helplessly, one wants to call out, 'It was her. Don't you see? She did it]'
The music needs pace at all costs if it is to build up any feeling of
anticipation, but Edward Downes was not in a hurry. The opening scenes do
have some theatrical bustle written into them, but here the smaller parts
had to work hard to make the business look busy. Jonathan Summers gets the
main supporting role as the diplomat, De Siriex. Judith Howarth needed more
fizz for her song on the delights of Veuve Clicquot (is this one of the
earliest cases of 'product placement'?)
Fedora herself is any diva's dream of a role - a Russian princess, who makes
her entrance swathed in white fur, dripping in diamonds (cue audience
applause). The role asks for an extravagant soprano who is unashamed at
playing the Joan Collins of the verismo dynasty. Mirella Freni is not that
kind of singer and her performance is more about being thrifty, using a few
well-chosen gestures for the character and pressing her bright, contained
voice to do duty for the lavish dramatic soprano it has never been. What she
does offer is Italian style in abundance.
Carreras sounded hard pressed in the tenor role. So long as he is able to
sing loudly and get a grip on the consonants the music suits his present
style well enough, but there is little in the way of phrased, legato
singing. He hangs on to some of the top notes more by will-power than
anything else. Ever since we first saw him nearly 20 years ago, Carreras has
given body and soul to every role he has sung and he does so again here. It
is not his fault that poor Loris fails to touch the heart.
In the final scene Giordano lays on the agony: Loris's brother has been
drowned in prison, his mother has died at the news, his lover has
effectively killed off his family and betrayed him too. But do we care? Not
for a minute. Real inspiration in an opera composer costs more than money
can buy.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: The Wasteland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is not called, you will notice, The Waste Land: this 'thriller opera'
has nothing to do with TS Eliot, oh no, certainly not. Not literally, anyhow
 -because the pernickety Eliot estate forbade the use of any name or
recognisable phrase from the sacred text.
The estate is odd that way. For several years after his friend Stravinsky
set 'The Dove descending' as a cantata, Eliot's poem could not be reproduced
in programme-notes for performances. The ban seems now to have been lifted
for 'serious' music, and of course Cats was acceptable (and very profitable)
 -but not, apparently, a scintillating parody like Martin Rowson's
comic-book 'Waste Land', which was the basis for this show.
Luckily, The Waste Land itself provides a loophole which the librettist Andy
Rashleigh and composer Stephen McNeff have exploited with glee. Some of its
best-remembered lines are quotations from other sources, and they get
mischievously prominent settings here. Nor are the mythical seers Tiresias
and Sosostris pure inventions of the Master, so they can appear with their
own names (or almost: just for safety, the seeress is spelt 'Sesostris').
All this is byplay, however, for the basic joke is to turn The Waste/Land
into a Raymond Chandler mystery. Rowson's knowing cartoons overflowed with
visible puns and gags. In the Modern Music Theatre Troupe's operatic
version, crisply directed by Caroline Sharman, they meld into a cod film
noir, which has to trail the perpetual Eliot references with less recourse
to Lit.- Crit. visuals. The private-dick hero, cutely called 'Chris
Marlowe', only speaks (Matthew Aldridge looks wearily right, though his
spoken American is as pallid as most of Rashleigh's Chandlerisms). Five
intrepid singers sing everybody else - clients, mistresses, victims,
obscurely sinister figures and cops.
That gives each of them a crack at a flashy cameo or two. There is plenty of
action, variety and contrast, crucially underpinned by McNeff's score:
pitched between Kurt Weill and Sir Arthur Sullivan, leaning this way and
that as opportunity dictates. More strenuously chromatic than either of
them, more than a big commercial musical would risk; but economical,
craftsmanly - there are a couple of very ingenious ensembles - and
endearingly loyal to the film noir sound.
The excellent singing cast take to it easily, flattered by the Donmar
acoustic. Something irretrievably Lit.- Crit.- clever clings to the piece;
for maximal appreciation, you should re-read The Waste Land just before you
go.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: No match for Dickens - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Useful idea the holiday. Helps you put things in perspective. Beautiful
Umbrian hillside, nice old farmhouse. Why not read David Copperfield? Bit
long: 836 pages in the excellent Pounds 1 Wordsworth edition. But it's a
treat. A joy. I had forgotten that although Dickens was a barnstormer and a
sentimentalist, he was, first, a master of character and narrative, and set
out to give his readers enjoyment. His books still do.
We are told Dickens would have been at home in the television age because,
like so much fiction on television, his work is episodic, having been
written as part-works for monthly publication. There is probably less to
this than meets the eye. The question I bring back to the old green sofa in
London is simple: although I spend much of my time defending television and
arguing that, as in most other aspects of life, the best is very good, do I
ever get as much pleasure from it as I get from reading David Copperfield?
The answer after one week back in front of the screen is a qualified no.
The first programme I see is a new comedy series called Once Upon A Time In
The North. BBC1 seems to have invented it to show that Bernard Hill, flavour
of the decade, who has done everything else from Yosser to a police chief,
can also turn his hand to comedy. Well, yes, it seems he can, but is that
surprising when the material is as undemanding as this? Hill is saddled with
that standard comedy figure in the age of feminism: the useless
paterfamilias. Out of work, unable to do even the smallest thing (putting a
message on an answerphone) correctly, he is treated with contempt by
everyone from wife to youngest child. This might have seemed novel, shocking
and funny in, say, 1850 when patriarchy was still the norm, but in 1994? It
is time British comedy writers caught up with their American cousins who
moved into the post-feminist age four or five years ago. I itch to get back
to David Copperfield.
Instead I watch The Lifeboat, an episodic drama (BBC1 again) featuring a
group of characters brought together by the dangers of the sea. But where in
this soggy, soapy story of darts and extra marital sex is there a single
character as memorable as Copperfield, Steerforth, Traddles, Betsey
Trotwood, Uriah Heep, Agnes Wickfield, Peggotty, Ham, Little Em'ly, Dora,
Rosa Dartle, or Doctor Strong? You could list a dozen more: even minor
Dickens characters such as Barkis the carrier, and Creakle, the
Chenevix-Trench of his day, have more life in them, more vividness, than the
entire cast of The Lifeboat. Good grief, Jip the dog is more memorable than
the characters in most of last week's television dramas.
There was one programme which did have something of Dickens' power to evoke
the very smell of its milieu. Family (yet another from BBC1) on Sunday, the
first in a four-part drama written specifically for television by Roddy
Doyle, author of The Commitments and The Snapper, reeked of Dublin. Its
portrayal of Charlo, the violent, thieving, lying, brawling, unfaithful,
unemployed paterfamilias, was very powerful. Indeed, even after all these
years of working class realism in television drama, Doyle - and superb
acting from Sean McGinley - made this a truly shocking portrait.
The trouble lay in the bleakness. Though Doyle has shown us brutishness
before, there have always been redeeming moments, but the opening episode of
Family lacked even a hint of redemption. However much one may admire the
professionalism of the production, that makes enjoyment difficult. Dickens
painted some grim pictures, but his canvases were so broad, covering the
whole of society, that it was almost impossible for the gloom to be
unrelieved. In this, television is at a terrible disadvantage, being such a
desperately literal medium. While print can leap in one sentence from the
real to the imagined, from the literal to the metaphorical, from the inside
of someone's head to the outside of the stagecoach in which he rides,
television's cameras have a terrible tendency to bind you to the actual.
Perhaps that is why the most vivid and engrossing drama of the television
week was not fictional but factual. Watergate, the first in a five-part
series of BBC2 documentaries, began to re-tell the story of how men employed
by the late Richard Nixon broke into the offices of his political opponents
and, crucially, how Nixon and his cronies then plotted to cover this up.
One of the difficulties is that although producers Norma Percy, Mick Gold
and Paul Mitchell are doubtless so familiar with every nook and cranny of
the story that they cheered at every new morsel they unearthed, most of us,
as non-experts, feel we have heard it all before.
However, this does not matter because here, at last, television comes up
with a truly Dickensian cast and the sort of narrative drive that would have
made the old boy beam with pleasure. What writer of fiction would dare have
Jeb Magruder deliver his reminiscences while dressed as a priest? And follow
that with a performance from Gordon Liddy - seemingly in front of a table
spread with hand guns - which makes Micawber seem quiet and retiring?
Having roped in just about everybody who played any part (as with her
outstanding series The Second Russian Revolution) Norma Percy has once again
made the process of telling true stories on television look easy. Yet when
you think of the interviewing and then the editing which must have gone into
this apparently seamless narrative, with John Dean picking up from Haldeman,
or Ehrlichman seeming to take his cue from Alexander Haig, you realise that
this is the art that conceals art.
As a collector of eccentrics and one-time political reporter, Dickens would
have loved it.

<TEXT>
If track records are anything to go by, today's 'Screen Two' ought to be
worth 70 minutes of anybody's time. Hope In The Year Two is a drama about
Danton, written by Trevor Griffiths (author of Comedians, The Party and so
on) directed by Elijah Moshinsky (Covent Garden producer, director of
several BBC Shakespeare plays and much besides), starring Jack Shepherd as
the French revolutionary, with music by Carl Davis. Danton is in a Paris
gaol, awaiting the guillotine in the morning .. (9.00 BBC2).
Last week's episode in The Lifeboat was like an episode from a soap opera.
No doubt lifeboatmen do lead lives much like the rest of us when they are
ashore: they are unusual because of what they do at sea and, above all,
because of their extraordinary courage. Television, wouldn't you know,
thinks that the really interesting things about lifeboatmen are their
domestic difficulties and their darts matches. What a waste (8.00 BBC1).
Dispatches reports on child labour around the world, claiming that 100
million are forced to work every day (9.00 C4).

FT  11 MAY 94 / People: Morgan and Thomas to put steel into GM Firth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Morgan, 58, who steps down as director general of the Institute of
Directors in July, is teaming up with Sir Alan Thomas, head of the
government's defence sales organisation, to try and revitalise the fortunes
of GM Firth (Holdings), the small Wakefield-based engineering company with a
turbulent past.
Morgan, who spent 30 years with IBM before being headhunted for the IoD job
in 1989, has been appointed a non-executive director of GM Firth (Holdings).
The loss-making group, currently capitalised at Pounds 14.5m, recently had a
Pounds 4m rights issue to repair its balance sheet and announced that Sir
Alan Thomas, 51, a former Raytheon executive, would take over as executive
chairman in July when he finished his MoD job.
The two men go back a long way together. They both hail from Wales, made
their names in computers and have more than a passing knowledge of the steel
business. Morgan's first job was programming computers for the Steel Company
of Wales and he came to know Sir Alan during his IBM days because Sir Alan's
Data-Logic was an important IBM customer. Having sold his company to
Raytheon, Sir Alan continued as a senior Raytheon executive. They took up
their posts at the IoD and the MoD at the same time.
Morgan is a non-executive director of South Wales Electricity and National
Provident, and is also an adviser to Apax Partners, the venture capital
firm.

FT  11 MAY 94 / People: Des Wilson takes off for Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised UK airports operator, is enlisting Des Wilson, one of
the country's most experienced lobbyists, to strengthen its hand in the
public inquiry over the company's controversial plans to build a fifth
terminal at London's Heathrow airport.
A former president of the Liberal Party and the party's campaign director in
the 1992 general election, Wilson founded Shelter, the national campaign for
the homeless, as well as a former chairman of Friends of the Earth UK and
ran CLEAR, which campaigned for lead-free petrol.
He is currently vice-chairman, public affairs, worldwide, of
Burson-Marsteller, one of the leading international public relations firms.
He has also been a columnist for the Guardian and Observer, a deputy editor
on the Illustrated London News, and head of public affairs for the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
Wilson will join BAA at a time when the airports operator is preparing
itself to fight a long and difficult planning inquiry for the construction
of Heathrow's fifth terminal estimated at between Pounds 800m and Pounds
900m.
The inquiry is expected to start in spring 1995 and to last about three
years.
BAA claims the new terminal is critical for the future of Heathrow, the
world's busiest international passenger airport and one of the most
congested.
Wilson is appointed director of corporate and public affairs and will become
a member of BAA's top management team reporting to chief executive Sir John
Egan; he joins in September on completion of Burson-Marsteller's recently
won contract to re-launch the TUC, and replaces Terry Morgan who next week
becomes managing director of BAA's Stansted airport.

FT  11 MAY 94 / People: Sandy Stewart to chair Scottish Amicable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Scottish Amicable, the mutual life insurer, ever wishes to flex its
muscles in Thailand, it has made a wise decision in appointing Sandy Stewart
as its non-executive chairman. For among his many other activities he also
squeezes in time to act as Thailand's honorary consul in Scotland.
Stewart, 60, is taking over the stewardship of Scottish Amicable from
William Brown, 64, who was chairman from June 1989 following the death in
office of William Cuthbert. The normal duration for a chairmanship is two
periods of two years. Brown remains a non-executive director of the company.
Sir Ronald Miller has been appointed deputy chairman.
Scottish Amicable's 13 member board has just three executive directors, with
Roy Nicolson, 49, as managing director. One of its more senior figures, Lord
Elgin, has just retired on reaching 70. The title of president of the board
will also retire with him, in recognition of what the company describes as
his 'unique contribution to Scottish Amicable'. He was a director since 1970
and president since 1975.
Born in Edinburgh, Stewart is a solicitor by training, a former partner of
McGrigor Donald, specialising in company law. He is also a farmer, and acts
as deputy lieutenant for the county of Perth. He joined Scottish Amicable's
board in 1985.
As for his Thai consulship - it is clearly more than just an honorary title.
Next week he will be shepherding a senior Thai government minister through
the highways and byways of the Scottish business and political world.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: A costly colour run - Textile
dye pollution is turning some of Britain's rivers purple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rivers have natural colours. They may look grey and uninviting in winter,
but that is the way they are. Rivers are not for colouring by stray
effluents from a textile plant. That is aesthetic pollution.
So much is agreed by the National Rivers Authority, the official guardian
which sets the standards of Britain's water purity, the water companies
whose sewage plants expel treated effluent into the rivers and the textile
companies whose dyes are the source of the colour.
'The removal of colour from dyehouse waste waters is currently a major
problem in the textile sector,' says Peter Cooper, technical executive of
Courtaulds Textiles. The problem is concentrated in three areas of the UK
Midlands: around Leicester and Loughborough where, with about 100 mills,
there is the most intense concentration; around Leek; and in the Erewash
Valley. All in the region are covered by the operations of Severn Trent
Water.
Purple and black are 'persistent and noticeable', according to Brian Waters,
the NRA's area general manager for the Severn Trent region. The dyes are not
toxic. 'Their main problem is that they're consistent and they're not
removed by conventional sewage treatment systems,' he says.
There are possible solutions but none so far available at a price which
industry finds acceptable. In an ideal world, colour would be eliminated
from effluent running into the sewage system at the dyehouse. But, warns
Barry Hazel, director of the Textile Finishers' Association: 'If every site
has to do its own treatment, there's a risk quite a few of the small
companies would go out of business. The capital costs frighten the dye
works.'
The plants would cost Pounds 2.5m, a considerable investment for companies
with up to 100 employees, turning over between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m a
year. They operate in a harsh commercial environment, where longer term
investment decisions are rare.
Many companies would prefer to push the colour problem away. There needs to
be cost-benefit analysis and 'there is a need for Severn Trent Water to
accept responsibility', according to John Harrison, director of the Knitting
Industries' Federation.
Severn Trent, however, feels caught between industry and regulator. 'Sewage
works are not designed to cope with these issues,' says David Woods, the
environmental director.
'The NRA response (to the colour question) is to go after us. They are
imposing very stringent colour consent conditions - or they've been seeking
to impose them,' he says.
Pressure on Severn Trent was one way of forcing the issue on the textile
companies; water companies in their turn can place restrictions on the
industrial waste they will accept in their sewage works. 'The proper way to
tackle it is at source,' says Waters, mindful that the Water Act 1989, which
set up the NRA, embodies the principle that 'the polluter pays'.
With companies worried about high capital outlays, the easiest solution for
them is to pump the coloured waste into the sewer and leave the question of
separating out the residual dyes and disposing of them to the water company.
But Severn Trent has also had its problems: it has spent around Pounds 5m on
a treatment plant at Leek without finding a foolproof economic solution.
As Cooper comments: 'Apportionment of costs is more difficult to arrange
than reaching a technological solution.' But the NRA attitude concentrated
minds in the textile and water industries.
Discharges to rivers are controlled by 'consents', or authorisations by the
NRA. It can review these consents and it threatened to withdraw, from the
beginning of this year, those where discharges were putting colour into the
rivers.
Brandishing its consent powers, the NRA has given an urgency to work on
solutions to the colour problem, which was already under way. It has removed
its threat to withdraw consents in exchange for a collaborative programme
with industry to eliminate colour from the water over about three years.
'I thought two years ago there was a technology void. Now, I'm beginning to
worry about timescales to turn ideas into the ultimate panacea. I think now
that treatment will have to be different for each business unless Severn
Trent Water can do anything at the sewage works,' Cooper says. Certainly,
the range of technological solutions is varied.
The collaborative approach to environmental problems which are bigger than
any single company has been used before in the textile industry - and
worked. The Textile Finishers Association, four companies and the Department
of Trade and Industry have just completed a Pounds 290,000 study of waste
minimisation and effluent treatment.
In the process, a way has been found to treat pentachlorophenol (PCP) - a
toxic substance on the EU's red list of nasty chemicals - used to stop
mildew forming on cloth in transit and washed out in the mills during
scouring. Big changes have taken place in the technology, says Hazel. 'All
PCP used is in closed systems. Before, it was swilled down the drain.' At
the same time, the mills have persuaded the cloth importers to specify
materials to which no PCP has been applied.
There is no such simple answer to the colour problem. Over the short to
medium term, efforts will be concentrated on treating the waste water either
before or after it goes into the sewage system. But over the longer term the
most effective solution may be to tackle the problem at its source.
Cooper has noted that this has been applied to the colour problem on three
levels: improving the ability of the dye molecules to stay on the material
so that fewer escape as waste, changing the molecular structure of the dyes
so that they are more readily biodegradable and the recovery and reuse of
dye colours which otherwise become effluent.
The difficulty is that the scientific solutions reduce the choice of colours
for the consumer. The water companies are caught between the regulators and
the mills and the mills are caught between two sorts of consumers. One sort
wants bright coloured clothes, the other wants clean rivers. The two demands
need not be mutually exclusive - if there is somebody to pay the bill.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Utilities unite in E7 club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairmen of eight of the world's largest electric utilities meet in
Tokyo tomorrow to establish a co-operative framework for promoting
'sustainable development' on a global scale.
They have formed a club - called E7 after the G7 group of large
industrialised countries - to support joint action. Its aims range from
informal discussions about energy policy to practical consultancy work in
developing countries and the former Soviet Union.
Early proposals include the promotion of solar power in Indonesia and
Malaysia, pollution control in India, clean coal technology in China and
hydroelectric development in Georgia. A small E7 secretariat in Montreal,
Canada, co-ordinates the projects.
The eight utilities include two from Canada and Japan and one each from
Italy, France, Germany and the US. Two of the club's leading figures are
Gilles Menage, chairman of Electricite de France, and Maurice Strong,
chairman of Ontario Hydro.
The UK is the only G7 country not represented. After the privatisation and
restructuring of the electricity industry, there is no British company which
satisfies the E7 rule that members should be integrated utilities both
generating electricity and selling it to consumers. There is likely to be a
debate in Tokyo about whether to expand E7. 'It seems too bad that we cannot
have a British member when the UK has led the way in restructuring its power
sector,' said one participant.
But the priority will be to convince funding agencies such as the World Bank
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that the club is
not a vehicle to promote its members' business interests. They will give
their experts' services free of charge to E7 consultancy projects.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Best practice for survival -
The EU's first environmental audit for farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers pride themselves on being the guardians of the countryside. So it is
perhaps surprising that many of them have given little thought to measuring
production methods according to their impact on the environment.
This week, however, the European Union's first environmental audit for farms
was launched in London. The brainchild of Leaf (Linking Environment and
Farming), a British organisation promoting profitable but
environmentally-friendly farming, the audit has won support from government,
conservationists, supermarkets, banks and even agrochemical manufacturers.
Farmers' very survival could depend on adopting practices such as careful
pesticide use, crop rotation and energy conservation which the audit is
designed to monitor, according to some of the speakers at the launch.
'Care and concern for the environment does not necessarily add cost, but
lack of quality certainly does,' says Don Phillips, sales marketing director
of Dalgety Agriculture, the UK grain trader, which helped sponsor the audit.
'We need to associate ourselves with farmers who clearly understand the need
for best farming practices. They will be the survivors.'
Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, glimpsed the potential for
countering Britain's Pounds 6bn trade deficit in food and drink. 'I hope
that carrying out this exercise will help farmers get and maintain markets
for their produce by building a better image for their products,' she says.
Leaf is part of a pan-European project to promote 'integrated crop
management'. This involves using crop rotations and natural predators to
reduce reliance on pesticides and fertilisers, along with positive
management of the landscape and wildlife habitats.
For the agrochemical companies, environmentally-sensitive farming is
preferable to a public backlash against all chemical inputs if intensive
production methods continue.
Initially the audit is being targeted at larger farmers. Those with 100
hectares or more will be invited to buy the questionnaire, which costs
Pounds 20 and takes about two hours to fill in, according to Leaf. It is
divided into eight sections covering the landscape, wildlife habitats, soil
management, crop protection, energy conservation, pollution control, animal
welfare, and farm planning and organisation.
Caroline Drummond, co-ordinator of Leaf, hopes the audit will be used by
about 3,000 British farmers in the first year and eventually be taken up as
an annual exercise 'by the industry as a whole'. Self-assessment by farmers
is the first step, but Leaf is considering a three-yearly external audit to
monitor the scheme if there is demand for it.
Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, backed the 'integrated' farming
approach in a speech in Brussels last month. Surpluses could not be reduced
just by price cuts, compensatory payments and laying fallow arable land, he
said. 'Farms must optimise their production costs, adapt to market forces
and compete by producing goods with a high level of defined quality, for
which they can command attractive prices without the need for agricultural
subsidies.'
Some farmers at the launch remained unconvinced. Hugh Oliver-Bellasis, a
member of the council of the National Farmers' Union, said he feared that
maintaining high production standards would put UK farmers at a disadvantage
to producers using cheaper methods elsewhere. 'In vegetable production,
there are some very nasty, very cheap insecticides on the market, and there
are some very good, very safe products which are considerably more
expensive,' he said.
But Geoff Spriegel of J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket chain, insisted the
same standards applied to all the group's suppliers.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Management: Blue-collar team, white-collar wise - How a
better-educated workforce is helping the US car industry to raise
productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a handful of Chrysler assembly workers gathered late last year with
suggestions on cost-cutting, they came up with an innovative solution to
replace the expensive sealer used in car boots. The idea amounted to an
annual saving of Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 171,000).
The car company says this is just one example of the boost in productivity
derived from a better-educated, more participative workforce.
'The days of the cattle-call are over,' says Dennis Pauley, executive
vice-president of manufacturing at Chrysler. 'We used to put out the word on
Fridays that we needed X number of workers Monday morning. If you could walk
and breathe you were in. That's not how it is anymore.'
US car manufacturers hope tougher hiring standards will ensure they get the
skilled workers they need to stay competitive. Blue-collar employees in the
industry are looking more like white-collar workers in terms of educational
background.
At Chrysler's Windsor plant in Ontario, for instance, some 20 per cent of
new assembly plant workers are college graduates, while nearly 5 per cent of
new blue-collar employees for Ford Motor Company are university graduates,
up from almost none 10 years ago.
Even more striking is the surge in the number of workers who have completed
high school. About 97 per cent of the blue-collar employees Ford has taken
on since 1991 possess a high school diploma or higher degree. More
significantly, since nearly half the blue-collar workers at US car
manufacturers will become eligible for retirement over the next five years,
'this offers us a major opportunity to reshape our workforce', says Pauley.
The American car sector is taking its cue from Japan, where groups such as
Toyota and Honda have built up a highly-skilled employee base. 'The Japanese
assembly-line workers graduated in the top 20 per cent of their technical
school,' says David Jones, president of the consulting group HR Enterprises,
which advises US car companies on assembly line hiring. 'They put the same
energy into blue-collar recruiting that the companies here put into
management recruiting at the top universities.'
US car manufacturers now realise that to compete with the Japanese, they
need a workforce with similar accomplishments. 'In the past, we put our
energy into making sure we had a well-educated management force,' says
Pauley. 'Now, we know that assembly-line workers are just as important. My
workforce needs to be at least as good as that of the Japanese, or I'm out
of the game.'
Recruitment of the highly-educated is made easier because university
graduates are finding assembly-line jobs appealing. The work is less
physically strenous, and more intellectually challenging, than it was just a
decade ago. High salaries are also enticing. Hourly wages usually range from
between Dollars 15 and Dollars 18 an hour, generous even by university
graduate standards.
To select the best workers, car makers have adopted strict new screening
methods. Potential employees are required to take examinations which measure
reading, writing and mathematics ability, manual dexterity and
inter-personal skills. No specific degree is required, but the tests
automatically favour the well-educated.
'It is more likely that people with high school diplomas will do better on
the exams, and individuals who score higher clearly are more productive on
their jobs,' says Jones.
Changes in the industry over the last decade have made educated workers more
of a necessity. Companies have been eliminating middle management to slice
costs; as a result, more workers are being left to their own devices.
At Chrysler there are now 50 workers to every manager. Ten years ago that
number was 20; soon, says the company, it will be 100.
'Once you back out the supervisor, you need more self-directed workers,'
says Pauley. 'By having fewer managers, you redefine the job of the assembly
plant worker.'
Manufacturing jobs are also more technical than they once were. 'Many jobs
have changed beyond recognition,' says Arthur Johnson, supervisor in charge
of employment and training planning at Ford. 'For instance, a welding line
used to consist of a man holding a piece of metal on to the car, and someone
welding it with a hand-held machine. Today, robots do all that.'
These changes require new skills. The ability to read an instruction manual
is now more important than brute strength, and with new technology being
adopted all the time, workers must be capable of learning new tasks quickly.
Workers must have the flexibility to perform more than one job. To keep the
plant running smoothly, and cut down on overtime pay, assembly-line
employees are often expected to fill in for absentee workers, or ease the
work load in another section of the plant.
Employees are also asked to participate in the daily running of the company.
At the Dodge City Complex, a Chrysler operation which opened last July, each
worker has the right to halt the assembly line at any time. The company says
it helped them iron out the wrinkles and address inefficiencies which under
the old system would never have come to light.
'One guy suggested we put in a computer program which would tell him what
materials he'd need for a particular vehicle in advance. Now, he prepares
the stuff ahead of time,' explains Norman Hunt, a supervisor assistant who
will soon receive an engineering degree.
Even General Motors, which because it is not hiring has less flexibility in
shaping its workforce, is attempting to improve blue-collar educational
levels. The company, in conjunction with the Auto Workers Union, has
launched a programme which subsidises employees' tuition at university and
technical schools. The company says that 17 per cent of assembly-line
workers involved in the initiative are working towards a college degree.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Management: Game, set, match for the Rule of Benedict -
Tennis and the Church of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With more than a touch of worldly scepticism, even trepidation, 13 Church of
England vicars last week swapped their dog collars for track suits and
converged on a south London tennis centre.
The unlikely occasion was a Church-sponsored training course aimed at
improving clerical coaching skills, in particular participants' ability to
bring out the best in curates placed under their care.
Just as the supervisor/subordinate relationship in a company can be tricky,
so the chemistry between vicars and curates is potentially unstable,
sometimes even explosive.
Not everyone would think of a tennis court as the best place to tackle this
issue, but by the time last week's 'class' had been run off their feet and
showered, most confessed to having overcome initial doubts.
'I think many of us had misgivings about what it was all costing the Church,
and we were wondering why we were being asked to dig out our own tennis
kit,' explained one. 'But I think it has been successful. You realise there
are unbounded possibilities in looking at things afresh.'
Tennis, explains Stephen Bampfylde of course organisers Saxton Bampfylde
International, is merely a vehicle for exploring the coaching process. 'We
like it because it's fun and also because it's important for people to see
that you can win and lose. It's a bonus, however, if anyone comes out at the
end with a better serve or a better backhand.'
Roughly three hours during the first of the two days is actually spent on
court, part of it with the vicars divided into groups of three (one playing
the role of coach, another the pupil with the third observing). The rest of
the first day is devoted to discussion and analysis, while the second
concentrates on the 'real world' problems of parish life and how the tennis
analogy can be applied.
'It doesn't matter if you can't catch a ball,' adds Martin Kitchen, priest
in charge of training in the Diocese of Southwark, where all the vicars
attending the course have their parishes. 'The message we want them to take
away is that their curates will probably arrive with a lot of learning,
knowledge and skills and that it is better for these to be drawn out than
for the vicar just to tell them what to do.'
Whatever the difficulty for outsiders of making the connections, phrases
like 'current reality', 'focused attention', 'process' and 'task' were all
being happily batted around the tennis court (and who knows, may pepper
sermons in south London churches for some time to come). As one participant
put it: 'The clergy is used to using parable and metaphor. There is also an
openness in the Church about learning from management studies, just as the
Church has learnt from history, philosophy, linguistics and other studies
over the centuries.'
He added: 'As I see it, management is about making decisions that affect
people and resources - if there is expertise from which we can learn, we
should do it.'
Bampfylde and partner Anthony Saxton are oblates of the order of St
Benedict, or 'part-time Benedictine monks' as Bampfylde puts it. He argues
that the process is two way, and suggests that the Rule of Benedict (written
at the start of the sixth century) can be seen as a useful management text.
'Benedict says that those who hold authority in a community are not to be
above the group,' writes Joan Chittister in a commentary on St Benedict's
thoughts on the qualities to make a good abbot (or ceo?), 'they are to be
the centres of it, the norm of it, the movers of it. They themselves are to
mirror its values. Their job is not simply to give orders. Their job is to
live out the ideals. It is an authority far removed from office elitism or
pompous hierarchy or high-handed parenting.'
Saxton Bampfylde, best known as a headhunter but also active in the fields
of psychological assessment and team building, gives 10 per cent of its
profits to charity and employs a high proportion of christians: some 80 per
cent of the staff claim commitment to the faith. 'We do have our resident
atheist, though,' says Bampfylde reassuringly.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Recruitment: Management techniques lost in translation -
Western businesses are seeking ways to develop their home-grown talent for
eastern and central European operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recruitment market for management in eastern and central Europe is
becoming increasingly sophisticated as more western companies establish
operations in former communist regimes.
The initial flow of management from west to east has slowed to a trickle as
more companies are seeking to recruit and develop home-grown managers.
Where outside management is still required, companies are becoming
increasingly selective. Tony Goodwin, managing director of Antal
International, a specialist recruiter working solely in eastern Europe, says
that the three areas of western expertise most needed are in
finance/accounting, sales and marketing, and general management.
'Their education systems were geared towards technicians,' he says. 'There
is no end of engineers, physicists and chemists to be found there, but
because of their former political system there are gaps in some commercial
skills.'
Among the placements Antal has made recently was a Welsh finance manager of
Romanian stock for a business in Bucharest and an Estonian-born accountant
living in Leicester found for the Getech Corporation. In that case the
accountant's wife, also Estonian, is a doctor, so the recruitment was doubly
beneficial to the Baltic republic.
Over the past four years, recruitment organisations have been scouring
expatriate communities in different parts of the world. Australia has proved
a rich source for Polish professionals and Paris has a strong Russian
contingent.
A continual problem has been attracting good western managers, particularly
those with families, to eastern Europe. But a revival in the old-style cafe
society culture in Budapest, Prague, even Warsaw, and improvements in
schools is attracting better candidates.
Recruitment has been concentrated among the central European republics. The
former Soviet republics have been far more resistant to western management
which, coupled with political volatility, may have contributed to Russia's
sharply decreasing industrial output.
Mr Tamas Toth, managing partner of the Vienna-based H. Neuman International
Management Consultants, one of the biggest recruiters into eastern and
central Europe, has carried out a study of the transfer of management
know-how from west to east.
After an initial period of wariness, where eastern and western managers were
suspicious of their respective merits, he says, a better spirit of
understanding was reached.
Toth found that local managers did not value western managers for their
organisational skills but for their expertise in financial management.
Western managers in turn reported low morale among their eastern
counterparts and said many were not well trained for their jobs. Both sets
of managers placed differing economic experiences and eastern bloc-western
mentality ahead of language problems when assessing the biggest obstacles to
successful co-operation.
Toth concluded that the transfer of management theory among those companies
he surveyed was virtually complete, even if its effective application had
still to be achieved.
The challenge now for recruiters moving into eastern and central Europe is
to identify and foster home-grown talent. Advocates of personality testing
argue that their approach is ideal in circumstances where there has been no
previous western-style selling, marketing or management culture.
Herbert Greenberg, chairman of Caliper Human Strategies, a New Jersey,
US-based consultancy, is seeking to apply US-style selection techniques
among businesses in the Czech Republic.
In a preliminary study, the company examined some sample profiles from
neighbouring Poland to see whether it could find profiles of young
entrepreneurs to match those it had identified previously in the US. The
fear was that years of totalitarianism would have crushed any drive for
selling.
Part of the problem, said Greenberg, was the definition of sales among many
eastern and central Europeans. The tendency was to equate sales figures with
production figures. 'Somebody will say they sold 10,000 cars when 7,000 of
them are still in the showrooms waiting to be bought. What they mean is that
they produced 10,000 cars,' he said.
The client sending the profiles was choosing sales staff from former
state-run companies. 'Then he sent us a profile that looked like a sales
person and we said 'This is the guy'. Our client drew breath and told us
that we'd picked someone who had been working in the black market for 25
years,' said Greenberg.
The potential recruit was unacceptable but the exercise did tell them that
such people could be found. Subsequent research has suggested that the
proportion of eastern Europeans with what Greenberg calls 'ego drive' is
something like 30 per cent, about the same as that in the US.
Recruitment may, however, be facing a more complex market than that
envisaged by raw capitalism. The recent re-emergence of socialism as a
political force suggests that doing business the western or US way may be
losing its lustre in the east. Therefore organisations developing in the
east may find it useful to consider the German model of consensus capitalism
if they want to get the best out of their home-grown management and
workforces.
Sue Fernie and David Metcalf at the London School of Economic's Centre for
Economic Performance say they received 600 requests for their recent paper
which concluded that human resource management did nothing to improve
management-employee relations.
Expanding on earlier research, they have produced a new paper*, which finds
that while HRM may not, by their measures at least, have delivered better
industrial relations, it has improved productivity in the workplace.
When they looked at both growth in productivity of organisations between
1987 and 1990 and comparisons of productivity levels, they found those
workplaces that used HRM techniques produced better results than those which
did not. The difference was even more marked when the comparison was made
with strongly unionised workplaces.
Absenteeism rates in such workplaces were almost double those of the HRM
users although the same rates were recorded by those employers without
unions or HRM, indicating that HRM was not a factor in this.
Neither did HRM appear to be a strong differentiating factor for the rate at
which people left their employers. It was noticeable that the leaving rate
was much lower in organisations with strong unions.
Fernie and Metcalf have leaned heavily on their findings covering industrial
relations to criticise HRM. Having first removed the caring halo from HRM
and its affect on industrial relations, their wider study does put its use
in a broader context.
If anything, it shows that the use of human resource management is closer to
what the words might suggest - systems or strategies for getting the best
and most out of people. The study also suggests that HRM may deliver what
management has wanted most - more productive workforces. The notion that it
should be viewed in any other light, such as representing a paternalistic
approach, would seem misplaced.
The study is based upon a Department of Employment workplace industrial
relations survey of more than 2,000 UK employers, each with more than 25

FT  11 MAY 94 / Euro-market benefits 'confirmed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European single-market trading system has left the logistic departments
of many UK businesses celebrating as they benefit from better trade
structures, but drawn fire from finance directors who face a new accounting
headache.
That is the message of a study released yesterday by the Customs and Excise
board on the impact of the removal of community trade barriers on British
companies. It comes at the end of the first full year of using the new
trading and European Union statistical system, known as Intrastat.
The study, based on a survey of 1,000 companies, reaffirms the department's
earlier prediction that British business should reap at least Pounds 440m
worth of benefit from the single market over the next five years - although
it admits that many business people remain unconvinced about these gains.
This savings figure is calculated through a 'cost/benefit' balance sheet
which measures the impact of switching to the new regime.
On the 'benefit' side, Customs calculates that last year companies saved
about Pounds 151.97m because they no longer had to declare exports and
imports at ports. They also saved Pounds 5.83m from cheaper community
transit costs and Pounds 3.99m from the simpler VAT system.
On the 'cost' side, companies faced Pounds 97.33m start-up costs switching
to the new system, which requires any company with an EU trade balance of
more than Pounds 135,000 to submit trade statistics from in-house trading
data.
They also faced Pounds 3.99m of extra annual operating costs from the new
system for value added tax returns.
However, annual operating costs of the new system were only Pounds 40.44m a
year - which implies an annual saving of Pounds 134.98m to UK business as a
whole after initial start-up costs.
But in spite of the department's up-beat conclusion, it faces a difficult
public relations job in getting this message across to business, Mr Mark
Eland, Customs commissioner, admitted yesterday.
Part of the problem, he said, was that the new system had created another
accounting headache for company finance departments - even where the same
company had benefitted through more efficient trade structures.
Bigger companies have, unsurprisingly, born the brunt of the costs of
Intrastat. Although the average switch-over cost for the 25,000 UK trading
companies in the survey was calculated to be only Pounds 1,608, one large
company quoted a cost of Pounds 1m. Smaller companies quoted start-up costs
below predictions. The smallest trading companies have arguably seen the
best benefits because they no longer face the cost of reporting their
statistics at all.
Benefits have also varied between sectors. While transport reported savings
of 24 hours on road journeys to southern Europe, commodity trading groups
have been more critical. Companies carrying out chain transactions in oil,
for example, claim the system is penalising them because it fails to take
account of the complexities of multiple purchases.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Labour clamours for minister's resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, was under growing pressure
to resign last night after he admitted misleading the Commons during a
debate on rights for the disabled.
Following angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
called for Mr Scott's resignation after the minister admitted that his
department had helped Tory backbenchers to wreck the passage of a private
member's bill that would have required employers to provide facilities for
disabled people.
Mr Scott appeared determined to ride out the allegations that he misled the
Commons last Friday when he stated that his department had played no part in
drawing up the amendments.
Downing Street officials also made clear that Mr Scott enjoyed the prime
minister's full confidence, that he had cleared up any misunderstandings and
was now in the clear.
But Labour sees the row as a test of the accountability of members of Mr
John Major's government.
In a letter to the prime minister, Mr Smith said Mr Scott's statement was
'wholly unsatisfactory'. He had 'confirmed that his department, with his
authority, had been involved in the preparation of the amendments'.
The Labour leader quoted a letter from the prime minister to Mr Giles
Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, in which Mr Major said ministers should
'relinquish their positions' if they knowingly failed to give truthful
information to the House.
Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker of the Commons, said that she would soon
rule on whether Mr Scott had been in 'contempt' of the House. It would be
almost unprecedented for a minister to be found in contempt.
In last Friday's debate, Mr Scott told MPs his officials had played 'no part
whatsoever' in the more than 80 amendments submitted to the bill, He
withdrew that statement yesterday, admitting that his department had, with
his knowledge, been involved in their preparation.
He told a hushed Commons: 'I very much regret that by not giving a fuller
explanation at the time, the effect of my reply was misleading, and I offer
my unreserved apologies to the House.'
Labour MPs were also threatening to question whether Lady Olga Maitland, the
Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam who introduced some of the amendments, had also
been in contempt. Lady Olga told the House on Monday that she 'sought
consultation' on the amendments, but that it would be totally unfair to
suggest that they came from any other source than the parliamentary council
office.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Lenders argue for credit where it's due: The debate over
whether card use counts as borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The treatment of credit card 'debt' in the official credit figures is
distorting the way consumer borrowing is calculated and presented, the
leading research group on credit-card transactions has said.
Earlier this week the Central Statistical Office issued credit figures
apparently showing that the prospect of April's tax rises did not dent
consumer confidence in March.
Net credit levels were at a 58-month high and - more remarkably - new
lending figures reached a record with about Pounds 5.2bn worth of credit
being advanced in March - apparently beating even the heady surges of the
1980s.
The problem is one of definition. Imagine you spend Pounds 1,000 on your
credit card. You intend to repay it when the tally comes in at the end of
the month, and in recent months you have always cleared your credit card
bill in full. Does this sale mean you are Pounds 1,000 in debt?
According to the Central Statistical Office the answer is 'yes'.
The CSO's long-established practice is to include credit-card transactions
in its monthly figures which show levels of net borrowing and new consumer
lending.
In recent months the Credit Card Research Group has been lobbying the CSO to
change this way of compiling the statistics. It argues that with more than
50 per cent of consumers now paying credit-card bills in full each month,
many consumers are using their cards as a means of payment rather than as a
borrowing tool.
The research group says that an unusually high number of processing days may
have accounted for some of the surge reported by the CSO. And the CSO itself
admits that the figures should be regarded with caution, not least because
about Pounds 3bn of the new credit was accounted for by credit cards in the
Mastercard and Visa systems.
The CSO says: 'The high figure partly reflects the increased volumes of
transactions and number of credit cards - there are simply more credit cards
around.'
It argues that credit card transactions still need to be included in lending
figures because the level of outstanding credit-card debt represents about
20 per cent of the total outstanding consumer borrowing. 'We can't just
ignore that,' it says.
But the Credit Card Research Group believes that because the unpaid debt
represents only part of credit-card turnover, equating credit cards with the
other components in the figures, such as motor finance or bank loans, is
confusing.
Mr Peter Welch, the group's head of research, says: 'Only some two-thirds of
credit-card outstandings incur interest charges and thus represent genuine
borrowings.' This figure has fluctuated in recent years, rising to 70 per
cent in 1984 and falling to 59 per cent in 1990.
The CSO is meeting the Credit Card Research Group to consider ways of
modifying the system. But as the CSO is already involved in debate about how
'broad' or 'narrow' credit measures should be, Mr Welch admits that a
solution is unlikely to be found rapidly. This suggests the issue is likely
to remain simply one more example of the problems statisticians face in
responding to new payment systems as fast as consumers.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Value of Scottish exports falls 10%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports of manufactured goods from Scotland fell 10 per cent in value in the
first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter, according to
the recently launched index of Scottish exports compiled by the Scottish
Council Development and Industry.
The fall, from 127.31 in the fourth quarter of last year to 114.33, is due
to a drop in computer, whisky and textile exports after the pre-Christmas
surge. Export sales fell from Pounds 3.08bn to Pounds 2.77bn. The index was
based at 100 in the first quarter of last year.

FT  11 MAY 94 / BCCI regulator faces writ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
have launched legal action against the Luxembourg banking regulators, Andrew
Jack writes.
The writ, issued in the Luxembourg courts in the last few weeks, seeks
compensation from the Luxembourg Monetary Institute (IML), the lead
regulator for BCCI's holding company.
The action follows similar litigation launched last year by the liquidators
against the Bank of England for allegedly failing in its duty as a regulator
to BCCI.
The liquidators have also sued BCCI's directors, auditors, and Sheikh Khalid
bin Mahfouz and National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia in efforts to
recover assets for creditors.
Details of the writ are expected to be announced today at the same time as
the liquidators appointed to BCCI in England from accountants Touche Ross
make public their annual filing to the Department of Trade and Industry.
The filing, which has been produced after the statutory deadline with the
consent of DTI officials, will show that the English liquidators have so far
realised assets of about Dollars 750m from a stated total asset value of
Dollars 3.2bn.
Touche Ross fees up until this February total Pounds 98m on the English
liquidation, but were in dispute and had still not formally approved when
the BCCI creditors' committees met most recently last week.
The liquidators refuse to add to their long-standing estimate that creditors
may ultimately receive 30p-40p in the pound.
They are still finalising the terms of an agreement tentatively approved
with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank, in
which it pays Dollars 1.8bn in exchange for a waiver of any possible
litigation against it by the liquidators.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Saatchi raps 'sloppy' advertising industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advertising industry should end 'vague, sloppy thinking' and get back to
'simple and direct' messages, Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman of global
advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said last night.
A grim picture of an industry which has lost its sense of direction and is
searching, like the character Hamlet, for a reason for existence was painted
by Mr Saatchi in the speech to women advertising executives in London.
'The advertising industry now is more lacking in self-confidence,
self-worth, than at any time I can remember,' he said. The recession could
no longer be blamed for this bleak state of affairs.
It is highly unusual for Mr Saatchi to speak out about the state of the
industry. His comments come as Saatchi is battling to regain market share,
particularly in the US, and follows a period of widely publicised conflict
between Mr Saatchi and the group's chief executive, Mr Charlie Scott.
Manufacturers which fail to invest in their brands came under particular
attack from Mr Saatchi. He said: 'The old verities about advertising seem to
have broken down. Advertising seems no longer to be part of that virtuous
circle, in which the gift that advertising bestows - a premium price - is
used to provide funds to reinvest in superior product quality, innovation,
product development, which is the only true justification for a premium
price.'
Saatchi, together with WPP and the other large advertising groups, has
stressed the benefit of global campaigns to clients and built worldwide
networks accordingly. Yesterday, however, Mr Saatchi pointed to the
difficulties of sustaining such campaigns. 'How do you communicate to lots
of different people in all these different countries across the world
without being so bland and jelly-like that you have nothing real to say?' he
asked.
He also said that network agency systems 'mean co-ordination, which often
means committees - not the best environment for inspired creativity. In
fact, global advertising quickly becomes trite and cliched - the lowest
common denominator, not the highest form of expression of creative talent'.
For advertising to meet the challenges of the future it needs to 'speak in
simple, universally recognised truths', he said. This will mean that every
brand has 'a consistent strategic focus'.
'It will mean the end of vague, sloppy thinking which leads to the vague,
sloppy clothes in which so many brands go out in public. It will mean
creative work so simple and direct that it strikes a chord in humans
everywhere.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Legal liaison plea at Iraq arms probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sensitive prosecutions brought by Customs and Excise would be improved if
the attorney-general had greater involvement in such cases, the chairman of
Customs told the Scott inquiry into the export of arms equipment to Iraq
yesterday.
Mrs Valerie Strachan, while not calling for changes to the independent
constitutional position occupied by Customs, said that there would be
benefits in more regular meetings between its lawyers and the attorney over
such prosecutions.
Improved contact would bring Customs into line with the director of public
prosecutions and the Serious Fraud Office, whose lawyers regularly meet the
attorney-general as a matter of course.
It would lessen the chances of Customs getting 'out of line' with the
prosecution policies of the director of public prosecutions and the Serious
Fraud Office, and help the attorney-general carry out his role as overall
supervisor of Customs as well as answer questions about its operations, she
said.
She added: 'I would see positive advantages from a number of points of view
of the relationship being a bit closer, better articulated and with a more
regular channel of communication.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Pay offer of 2.2% for civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the CPSA, the biggest civil service union, are being urged by
their executive to accept a pay offer worth 2.2 per cent in one of the first
negotiated public-sector pay deals this year after the government's pay-bill
freeze.
The Treasury said the rise for about 100,000 typists, secretaries and
clerical workers across the civil service would be wholly funded by
efficiency savings in line with government policy.
Greater flexibility in pay negotiations has been created by the relaxation
of rules preventing departmental cost savings from being carried over from
one financial year into the next.
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, CPSA general secretary, said: 'Against the background
of the government's determination to freeze the public-sector pay bill, this
is a remarkable achievement. We have forced the government to make a decent
offer.'
Most of the rise involves a one-off lump sum payment of 1.8 per cent which
will not be consolidated into pay or pensions. The rest comprises
performance pay.
The deal looks like setting the trend for public-sector settlements this
year. Most forecasts give overall rises of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent
in the public sector.
The union also said that it had recorded its highest membership for a decade
in spite of legislation aimed at making it easier for union members to
relinquish their memberships.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Trade benefits of single market 'confirmed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European single-market trading system has left the logistic departments
of many UK businesses celebrating as they benefit from better trade
structures, but drawn fire from company finance directors who face a new
accounting headache.
That is the message of a study released yesterday by the Customs and Excise
board on the impact of the removal of community trade barriers on British
companies. It comes at the end of the first full year of using the new
trading and European Union statistical system, known as Intrastat.
The study, based on a survey of 1,000 companies, reaffirms the department's
earlier prediction that British business should reap at least Pounds 440m
worth of benefit from the single market over the next five years - although
it admits that many business people remain far from convinced about these
gains.
This savings figure is calculated through a 'cost/benefit' balance sheet
which measures the impact of switching to the new regime.
On the 'benefit' side, Customs calculates that last year companies saved
about Pounds 151.97m because they no longer had to declare exports and
imports at ports. They also saved Pounds 5.83m from cheaper community
transit costs.
On the 'cost' side, companies faced Pounds 97.33m start-up costs switching
to the new system, which requires any company with an EU trade balance of
more than Pounds 135,000 to submit trade statistics from in-house trading
data.
They also faced Pounds 3.99m of new annual operating costs because of the
new system for value added tax returns.
However, annual operating costs of the new system were only Pounds 40.444m a
year - a figure that implies an annual saving of Pounds 134.981m to UK
business as a whole, after the initial start-up costs.
But in spite of the department's up-beat conclusion, it faces a difficult
public relations job in getting this message across to business, Mr Mark
Eland, Customs commissioner, yesterday admitted.
Part of the problem, he said, was that the new system had created another
accounting headache for company finance departments - even where the same
company has benefitted through more efficient trade structures.
Bigger companies have, unsurprisingly, born the brunt of the costs of
Instrastat. Although the average switch-over cost for the 25,000 UK trading
companies in the survey was calculated to be only Pounds 1,608, one large
company quoted a cost of Pounds 1m. Smaller companies quoted start-up costs
below predictions. The smallest trading companies have arguably seen the
best benefits because they no longer face the cost of reporting their
statistics at all.
Benefits have also varied between sectors. While transport reported savings
of 24 hours on road journeys to southern Europe, commodity trading groups
have been more critical.
Companies carrying out chain transactions in oil, for example, claim the
system is penalising them because it fails to take account of the
complexities of multiple purchases.
Mr Eland says that Customs is lobbying the European Commission to 'tidy up'
its VAT and trading directive - although officials within the Commission
admit that change is unlikely to occur rapidly.
With the next round of trade statistics due to be released tomorrow, Mr
Eland said that an analysis of Intrastat would be issued tomorrow following
widespread criticism from economists that the change-over to the new system
had led to distortions in reporting the UK trade balance.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Bank disappointed at rising inflation expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is disappointed. Inflation on the government's
underlying measure has fallen to its lowest level since the index was first
compiled in 1975. But although the 12-month change in the retail prices
index less mortgage interest payments was only 2.4 per cent in March - in
the bottom half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range -
inflation expectations are rising in the UK.
Wages are rising faster than expected and, as the chart shows, employees'
expectations of inflation have been very slow to adjust to the sharp fall in
retail price inflation since 1991. After jumping sharply in recent weeks,
yields in the gilt-edged market are suggesting an inflation rate of above 4
per cent from 1996 to 2007.
The Bank takes such expectations seriously. They 'affect behaviour, and an
expectation of higher inflation can make it more difficult to achieve the
combination of low inflation and output expansion permitted by the current
growth of nominal demand', it says. It therefore peppers its latest
quarterly inflation report with warnings that it may have to tighten
monetary policy if matters get out of hand.
'Monetary policy will not validate inflation outside the target range,' it
warns at one point. More explicitly, it notes that: 'If the private sector
comes to expect higher inflation, this belief could cause employees and
firms to push up earnings and prices even faster. A constant monetary stance
would then imply the need for higher interest rates until inflation
expectations were brought back into line.' It concludes the report by
declaring that the public's belief in the inflation target 'must be
reinforced by adherence to a firm monetary stance'.
At present such warnings are a shot across the bows of wage bargainers,
although they leave the clear impression that the Bank believes base rates
in Britain have bottomed out.
On the assumption of unchanged bank base rates of 5.25 per cent, the Bank
still believes the most likely outcome for underlying inflation in two
years' time is 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent.
On the Bank's own favourite measure of retail price inflation less mortgage
interest payments and local authority and indirect taxes, it expects
inflation will be less than 3 per cent in two years' time.
But the pick-up in the growth of underlying average earnings from 3 per cent
in November to 3.5 per cent in February 'and possibly higher in March'
worries the Bank, especially when 2.72m are still unemployed.
'It is puzzling that earnings should be increasing as fast as they are at
this stage of the recovery, and it will be necessary to monitor labour
market developments extremely carefully over the next few months,' it says.
The Bank is also concerned that companies have not adjusted down their
required rate of return from investment decisions to reflect lower
inflation. Investment in Britain could be suffering as a result.
The fast growth of narrow money which expanded by 6.2 per cent in the year
to April is less of a worry. The Bank's current view is that the recent
growth of M0 'has limited inflationary consequences' and can be explained in
part as an adjustment to a new 'equilibrium growth rate' in the velocity of
notes and coins in circulation.
The Bank also sees little problem in the acceleration of the UK's economic
growth rate to 'probably slightly above trend'. The output gap between
current and potential full capacity production is narrowing 'but limits of
capacity are still some way from constraining producers', it says.
The report contains some good news for housebuyers. With the house price to
earnings ratio at its lowest for a decade, it says house prices in London
and the south-east are 'more affordable than ever'.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Magazine group agrees print deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Ives, the printing group, said yesterday that it had agreed an unusual
long-term contract with IPC Magazines, part of the Reed Elsevier publishing
group.
Under the terms of the contract, one of three new web-offset presses which
will be installed in a new St Ives print plant in Wales will be allocated
exclusively to IPC. The agreement is thought to be the first of its kind
between a printer and a publisher for many years.
The three presses are part of a Pounds 30m investment which St Ives is
making in a new facility at Ystrad Mynach, four miles from the existing
plant at Caerphilly, south Wales, which it replaces.
The press dedicated to IPC is expected to print between 10 and 12 of the
publisher's monthly consumer magazine titles. IPC, which views the deal as
'an important strategic partnership', believes it will reduce costs and help
improve its competitiveness.
The new plant is expected to begin production in April next year and be
fully operational by the autumn.

FT  11 MAY 94 / The BBC makes a commercial break: The launch of a
partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC intends to become 'number one in world television' to match its lead
in radio, where the BBC World Service has 130m regular listeners a week, Mr
John Birt, director-general, said yesterday.
To complement its expertise and its lack of capital for investment in
commercial ventures, the BBC yesterday unveiled its new international
commercial partner - Pearson, the media group which has a 17 per cent stake
in British Sky Broadcasting and owns Thames Television and the Financial
Times.
The public corporation and the publicly quoted media group will be
responsible for the launch of two satellite television channels by this
autumn aimed at the European market: a 24-hour news channel funded by
advertising and an entertainment channel funded by subscription.
Pearson is committed to investing up to Pounds 30m in the venture though
this will fall to Pounds 20m if, as expected, a third continental European
partner joins the project.
As far as anyone could determine at the BBC yesterday the 'global strategic
alliance' with Pearson is a unique example of a public-service broadcaster
linking with a commercial group.
'We are satisfied, one with another, that we share a similar set of
corporate values that underpin what we do,' said Mr Bob Phillis, deputy
director-general of the BBC and a principal architect of the new strategy.
The government has accepted in principle the idea of such an alliance ahead
of a white paper on the corporation's future. But Mr Birt accepted yesterday
that the government had neither seen nor agreed the details.
Mr Phillis said the alliance was designed to lead Britain into a multi-media
world. But it proved politically controversial. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow
national heritage secretary, expressed deep concern that the decision had
been taken before the launch of the BBC white paper.
The Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom said the alliance as a
purely commercial venture 'calls into question the very existence of the
licence fee and the role of the BBC as a public-service broadcaster'.
The Liberal Democrats said it would provide 'a British-based counterweight
to Rupert Murdoch and to the other large international alliances'.
The alliance will concentrate on provision of satellite channels outside the
UK aimed primarily at continental Europe, Asia and the Americas.
Programmes will be in English although other language channels could follow.
Apart from taking World Service Television News around the world, the
partners will look at the possibility of launching channels or part channels
devoted to documentaries, children's programmes and education.
'These strengths are not particularly Rupert Murdoch's strengths,' observed
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames and managing director of Pearson
Television Holdings, the subsidiary which will represent Pearson in the
alliance.
The BBC detailed a far-reaching reorganisation of its international and
commercial ventures yesterday to make sure that 'no public funding plays any
part in financing the international television developments'.
A new organisation - BBC Worldwide - has been set up with three separate
divisions all reporting to a Worldwide board chaired by Mr Phillis which
will have no Pearson representatives.
The BBC, which already works with Pearson in satellite channels such as UK
Gold, the UK library channel, will take equity in the new joint-venture
subsidiaries but will not usually put up capital.
'I have no doubt that this strategy will not just extend choice for
countless millions of people around the world but also that it will
represent better value than ever for British tax and licence-fee payers,'
said Mr Birt.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Football race-abuse incidents down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Football grounds have seen a marked decline in incidents of racial abuse and
harassment at the end of a season-long campaign.
But the Commission for Racial Equality warned yesterday that there is still
work to be done to promote clubs as safe, welcoming environments.
In the three years since the passing of the Football Offences Act, which
outlawed racist chanting and abuse, the number of arrests has fallen from 76
in 1991-92 to 40 in 1992-93 and 12 in 1993-94.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Modern architecture rapped: Gummer aims to use planning
powers to raise quality of buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, launched a savage attack
yesterday on the standard of much modern architecture, echoing criticisms
repeatedly made by the Prince of Wales in recent years.
Speaking to the Cities 94 conference in London's Docklands, Mr Gummer
indicated he would use his planning powers to improve the quality of
buildings in British cities.
He made it clear he would block city-centre developments that he regarded as
poorly designed or out of keeping with existing buildings. He said: 'Too
many buildings which won prizes in the 1960s need to be pulled down in the
1990s.'
Mr Gummer gave as examples Birmingham's Bull Ring shopping centre, his own
departmental headquarters in Marsham Street in Westminster, and the National
Westminster Bank building in Leeds. He later added to the list residential
developments such as the high-rise flats overlooking Richmond Park at
Roehampton, south-west London. Many 1960s flats suffered from water
penetration, he added.
'One important quality of buildings is that they should keep the water out,'
he said. 'Many of the buildings of the 1960s are bad buildings in a
functional sense.'
Mr Gummer assured his audience that he was not against all modern
architecture. 'I certainly don't want pastiche styles,' he said. 'I want
buildings of today and tomorrow which respect what has gone before.'
He promised an initiative to set standards for developers, encouraging them
to create developments that complement existing buildings and specifying the
use of appropriate materials and finishes. 'This generation could be
remembered for architecture which enhanced its environment and used
imagination and innovation to build for the future by building to last,' he
said.
Architects and town planners welcomed Mr Gummer's plans. 'A lot of
architects and planners were seduced by the new style of buildings in the
1960s, and went too far,' said Mr Jed Griffiths, senior vice-president of
the Royal Town Planning Institute.
The Royal Institute of British Architects said it was 'delighted' at the new
emphasis on quality and design.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Builders launch Brussels lobby group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An organisation to win Britain a bigger share of the European Commission's
Pounds 8.5bn research and development budget was launched yesterday by the
construction industry.
The Construction Industry European Research Club, which is supported by the
Department of the Environment, will provide information on impending
projects, arrange partnerships with other European companies and research
organisations, provide contacts and prepare submissions to the Commission.
It will be managed by the independent Building Research Establishment, which
has extensive contacts with research organisations in continental Europe.
To qualify for EU funds applications must be supported by bodies from at
least two EU countries. Establishing co-operative ventures between UK
companies competing in the same sector, and arranging cross-border support
has proved difficult in the past.
British companies have failed to win as big a share of the EU budget as they
would like. There was now a significant opportunity to redress this balance,
said Mr Tony Baldry, the construction minister.
Corporate membership will cost Pounds 1,000 a year and Pounds 500 for
academic organisations.
Builders started work on 48,800 homes in Britain during the three months to
the end of March, 1 per cent more than during the corresponding period last
year. Starts were also 1 per cent higher than during the previous three
months, figures published yesterday by the environment department show.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Incentives urged to boost private rented housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was urged yesterday to adopt a package of measures supported
by grants and tax incentives to encourage greater investment in Britain's
diminished private rented-housing sector.
The proposals, launched at a conference in London by the Association of
Residential Letting Agents and the independent Housing Investment Group,
renewed a call for the establishment of Authorised Housing Investment
Trusts.
The organisations say the size of the private rented sector has fallen from
90 per cent of the housing stock in 1939 to 9.6 per cent at present.
Investment trusts would need to appeal to institutions which would not
invest directly in private rented housing because of the intensive
management required and poor returns measured against other lower-risk
investments.
The trusts, to compensate, should be free from capital gains tax and pay
corporation tax at the lower rate of 25 per cent. The joint report says that
even with these benefits there would be a yield gap.
It proposes that the government offer grants of up to 25 per cent of the
cost of providing properties. Grants would be funded by the issue of zero
coupon bonds redeemable over 10 to 15 years and secured against investment
trust assets. Bonds, although underwritten by the government, would be
repayable by trusts.
The report estimates that grants of up to Pounds 250m a year supporting a
total investment of Pounds 1bn would provide 16,600 new or reconditioned
properties at an average cost to the exchequer of Pounds 15,000 a home.
Mr Alan Thurlow, one of the report's authors, says this would provide better
value for money than mortgage tax relief or public-sector grants to housing
associations.
Other proposals include allowing companies and individuals converting small
commercial premises into homes for rent to offset losses against other tax
liabilities during the early years of investment. This, the authors say,
would be cheaper than providing grants.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Sales of vans and trucks rise 11.6% as imports grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New commercial vehicle registrations rose 11.6 per cent last month to
18,884, figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
show.
Sales of new commercial vehicles, which are an important economic indicator,
have been higher than a year ago in seven of the past eight months.
Imported vehicles are increasing their share, however, as the market
recovers from recession. Imports accounted for 45.2 per cent of the market
in April, compared with 39.1 per cent a year ago.
In the first four months of the year, new commercial vehicle registrations
rose by 12.4 per cent to 75,486. The share taken by imports jumped to 43.1
per cent from 40.3 per cent a year ago.
Imports are making the biggest impact in the truck sector, where the
domestic production base was hit by the financial collapse a year ago of
Daf, the former Dutch commercial vehicle maker. Registrations of new trucks
(of more than 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), which have led the
commercial vehicle market out of recession, rose by 20 per cent in the first
four months to 12,677. Sales of imported trucks, however, jumped by 50 per
cent to 7,299. They account for 58 per cent of the total truck market
compared with 46 per cent in the first four months last year.
Daf Trucks, which succeeded the old Daf group - the former UK truck market
leader - has ceded considerable ground to its rivals.
The Iveco group, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, is now
the market leader, while Mercedes-Benz of Germany has moved into second
place and was the market leader in April.
Volvo and Scania, the Swedish truck and bus makers, account for more than a
third of the UK heavy truck market (more than 15 tonnes), where MAN of
Germany and Renault of France are also strengthening their presence, albeit
from a small base.
In the medium van market, which is dominated by the Ford Transit, LDV
(formerly Leyland Daf Vans), the company rescued by a management buy-out
from the former Daf group, is successfully rebuilding its presence. It
increased its registrations by 52 per cent in the first four months in a
market that has increased by 11 per cent.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Fears of Rosyth closure are renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the closure of Rosyth naval base will be announced when the
outcome of the latest defence expenditure review is revealed in July were
heightened by government ministers yesterday.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, told MPs in the
Commons that while the Royal Navy now had fewer ships, there had been no
corresponding reduction in the support facilities provided by four separate
bases.
He said: 'We will have to look carefully at the size of the infrastructure
as well as at the size of the fleet.'
Mr Aitken accused Labour MPs of seeking to exaggerate 'promises which were
never made' by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Aitken said assurances
given by the prime minister that the employment implications of closing the
Rosyth base in Fife would be taken into account fell short of the kind of
promise which Labour MPs inferred he had made.
Mr John Reid, a Labour defence spokesman, called for an assurance that
before any decision was announced all the alternative costs would be made
available to MPs.
Mr Aitken said Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, would be among ministers
consulted before any final decision was taken. After the proposals were
announced the government would publish the information on which decisions
had been based.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, reaffirmed that the government
had no intention of making any further reduction in the 'fighting capability
of our forces'.

A fall in the number of learner drivers has closed 22 of the UK's 484
driving test centres. Until recently 2m people a year took a driving test,
but the figure is now 1.6m.
'Changes in the birth rate means there are fewer 17 to 18-year-olds around
and this is the main reason for the fall in test-taking numbers,' said the
Driving Standards Agency.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Commons backs Sunday betting on horse racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday horse racing with betting on- and off-course was overwhelmingly
approved by the Commons last night as the government backed down over plans
to abolish market franchise rights.
A MPs voted by a majority of 101 to allow Sunday betting as part of the
government's de-regulation bill.
It brings England and Wales into line with other horse racing nations such
as Ireland, France and Italy, which already allow Sunday betting.
Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, said: 'I cannot myself see
that as a result of the changes proposed here, which I warmly support, the
nation will suddenly be plunged into a hell-hole of gambling the like of
which we have never seen before.'
If the Lords back the change, the British Horse Racing Board will include in
its fixture list a small number of Sundays in the next two years.
The government was later forced to withdraw proposals to de-regulate the law
under which local authorities holding market franchise rights can oppose the
creation of rival markets - such as weekly open-air markets - nearby.
Threatened with a backbench revolt, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry
minister, said that the government would now 'discuss with all interested
parties how best to remove the adverse effects of market franchise monopoly
rights'.
Sir Michael Neubert, Conservative MP for Romford, said the market franchise
rights were 'an effective means of controlling markets, which has ensured
that markets have prospered up and down the country'.
Ministers plan to bring forward amendments 'on an agreed basis' when the
de-regulation bill reaches the Lords.
Labour voiced worries about the potential impact of the bill on health and
safety standards. Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour's trade and industry spokesman,
called for this issue to be cut out of the legislation.
He said he feared that ministers would phase out important safety
regulations using the 'excessive powers' given to them under the bill to
repeal measures without primary legislation.
Mr Hamilton stressed the need to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on
business.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Environment failures rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has failed to keep more than 27 environmental commitments,
according to the annual audit of its environmental performance published
yesterday.
The count does not include some of the slippages in policy implementation
for which the government has been most heavily criticised.
Environmentalists yesterday attacked the government's failure to develop an
underground store for nuclear waste, and the lack of finance for the newly
created Energy Saving Trust, which is intended to promote energy efficiency.
The 200-page report lists the action taken on 657 separate environmental
commitments. The report is the third annual assessment of This Common
Inheritance, the government's environmental strategy published in 1990.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday that there had
been action 'on almost all commitments'. While the government was determined
to maintain high environmental standards this could be achieved within the
framework of competitiveness and by reducing regulation. The National Audit
Office yesterday criticised English Nature, the government-funded
conservation body, for its management of England's 3,700 sites of special
scientific interest. It said many reserves were hard to find and few were
signposted.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Greens want Third World debt cancelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Green party yesterday launched its European election manifesto, urging
the cancellation of most Third World debt and an end to the use of nuclear
power.
The manifesto combines the Green antipathy to free trade with a call for
European Union membership to be open to any country in Europe.
It spells out the party's opposition to the European single market and the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Greens believe the agreements
'undermine local economic initiatives and environmental standards'. They are
also opposed to a single European currency.
In the last European election, in 1989, the Greens gained 14.9 per cent of
the vote.
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, calls in its manifesto for reform
of the Common Agricultural Policy and for British acceptance of the
Maastricht treaty's social chapter.
Mr Dafydd Wigley, party leader, said subsidiarity was 'equally applicable to
the relationship between Cardiff and London as it is to the case of London
and Brussels'.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Lloyd's to reveal double counting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London will next week disclose for the first time the exact
extent to which its losses are 'double-counted', when it reports its losses
for 1991.
It is expected that about a fifth of the loss, expected to total some Pounds
2.5bn, has been counted twice - as the original loss, then again as a claim
on syndicates underwriting errors and omissions, personal stop-loss or
estate-protection insurance.
Errors and omissions policies insure Lloyd's agents against legal awards for
negligence, while stop-loss and estate protection are forms of personal
reinsurance bought by Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the Lloyd's market.
Lloyd's last year estimated that the 'double count' amounted to about Pounds
600m of its 1990 loss of Pounds 2.9bn. This year the market, which accounts
its results three years in arrears, has commissioned a firm of actuarial
consultants to perform a precise accounting exercise. The measure is one of
a number designed to soften the impact of the 1991 loss on Names.
Also under consideration at the market is a plan to allow Names to take
credit for profits which are expected in years where accounts have still to
be finalised. Names would be allowed to offset these credits against losses
when the market's authorities assess their solvency - the extent to which
their assets can meet liabilities - later this year.
Last year Names were allowed to take credit equal to 5 per cent of their
premium income limits for solvency purposes.
The 1991 loss, about half of which stems from claims on policies written in
1990 and earlier years, is the fourth in succession and will bring Lloyd's
cumulative loss since 1988 to more than Pounds 8bn.
However, both 1989 and 1990 included a significant element of
double-counting, according to Inside Eye, the monthly independent Lloyd's
newsletter.
'Any regular company would blanch at the incorrect figures which have been
published to date and would certainly have endeavoured earlier to reduce any
unnecessary exaggeration of the loss,' says the newsletter.
'Recognition of the need to strip out the duplicated element of losses was
slow in coming,' it adds.
The market is expected to report a further year of losses - possibly of
around Pounds 1bn - when it reports its 1992 results next year.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Ministers face Scots Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Tories, chastened by their disastrous showing in last week's
regional council elections, will confront party leaders today at their
annual conference in Inverness.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will be the first of seven cabinet
ministers to address the conference. and Mr John Major will attempt to
rekindle his premiership at the closing rally on Friday.
The Scottish Tories will try to identify what changes of policy or
presentation to make.
The regional council elections, in which they made a net loss of 23 seats
and took less than 14 per cent of the vote, shocked them and came as a
pleasant surprise to their opponents in the Scottish National, Liberal
Democrat and Labour parties.
The Tories are uncertain whether they lost support because of government
plans to take Scottish water out of local authority control, or whether
former supporters were expressing the same discontent with the Major
government as their counterparts south of the border.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, inclined to the latter interpretation,
although he also said the party would have to 'readdress the things we do
and the way in which we present them'.
Today Mr Hurd will wind up the debate on Europe, replying to a motion that
'supports the principle of subsidiarity, rejecting the concept of a federal
Europe'. On Thursday Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will reply to the
debate on the economy.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Rightwing MPs divided over Major's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A split has emerged among rightwing Conservative MPs over how to get the
party to adopt their agenda. They are divided between those who want Mr John
Major to go and those who think sustaining him in office is their best
course of action.
The split suggests that all may not yet be lost for the prime minister even
if the Tory party does badly in next month's European elections as indicated
in the latest Guardian/ICM poll. The poll puts the Conservatives 17 points
behind, excluding 'don't knows', with Labour on 44 per cent, the Tories on
27 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 24 per cent.
The rightwing Tory split stems partly from a feeling that Mr Michael
Portillo - the Thatcherite chief Treasury secretary who is the preferred
candidate of many of the right - would be unlikely to beat Mr Michael
Heseltine if a leadership contest were staged later this year.
However, some rightwingers believe there is a case for a change of leader
even if this makes the pro-European Mr Heseltine prime minister. Encouraged
by Mr Heseltine's voting record on issues such as the age of consent for
homosexuals, they argue that on many subjects he is closer to the right of
the party than the left. If he came out in favour of a referendum on the
next step of European integration they say they would warm towards him
further.
A number of rightwingers supported Mr Heseltine against Mr Major and Mr
Douglas Hurd in the last Tory leadership contest in 1990.
MPs in this category include Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North who
recently said he was ready to stand in an autumn leadership contest; Mr Tony
Marlow, MP for Northampton North who stunned the Commons in March by
demanding Mr Major's resignation; Sir Peter Tapsell, the Euro-sceptic MP for
Lindsey East; and Mr David Evans, an executive of the Tory backbench 1922
Committee.
The second rightwing camp believes that a Heseltine premiership is to be
avoided at virtually any cost. As a leadership contest later this year is
therefore best avoided, they reason that their best bet is to promise Mr
Major their support while urging him to adopt more rightwing policies and to
appoint rightwingers to more prominent cabinet posts in a summer reshuffle.
Some of them think Mr Major could in effect be used as an interim leader
until Mr Portillo, or an alternative candidate from the right, is ready to
mount a winning challenge.
There is little or no enthusiasm among rightwingers for a prolonged Major
premiership as anything other than a means to an end. According to one MP:
'The big difference between now and 1990 is that no one is going around
saying this is a prime minister we have to go to the wall for.'

South West Water yesterday agreed to pay about Pounds 400,000 to settle

The settlement was announced in the High Court in Truro, Cornwall. The

Lunn Poly said summer sales this year were expected to be 13 per cent higher

However, the chain's price data disclosed that the increase in holidays sold

FT  11 MAY 94 / Stoy Hayward faces two probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, yesterday said it was to be the subject
of two high-profile professional investigations for its roles as auditor to
both Astra Holdings and Polly Peck International, Andrew Jack writes.
The details came after a day of confusion in which the joint disciplinary
scheme, the accountancy profession's senior regulatory body, delayed making
an official announcement.
Polly Peck, the conglomerate which entered administration in October 1990,
was controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus while facing
charges of false accounting and theft involving Pounds 34m. Astra Holdings,
which was the subject of a highly critical and long-delayed Department of
Trade and Industry inspectors' report published last June, was a munitions
company connected to the Iraqi supergun affair. It is now in receivership.
Stoy Hayward was the principal auditor to both companies, although Polly
Peck's Cyprus subsidiaries were audited by Erdal &amp; Co, a local firm, and
other accounting services to the group and Mr Nadir were provided by Coopers
&amp; Lybrand.
A joint disciplinary scheme inquiry may focus on any chartered accountants
or accountancy firms associated with the companies under investigation,
including board members.
Stoy said it had been informed that the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales had referred both cases to the scheme.
The scheme said it was delaying an announcement as a result of
'representations' after publicity concerning the Polly Peck investigation.
Mr Adrian Martin, Stoy's managing partner, said his firm had made no such
representations and he welcomed an independent review. He added: 'For a
regulatory system to be fair, it has to be open, consistently applied and
timely. This has not been the case.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Lilley aims to ease fears over post offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, will today unveil measures to
boost rural post offices in a move to ease backbenchers' fears over
proposals to privatise the Post Office.
In a speech to the Federation of Sub-Postmasters, which represents 19,000
sub-post offices, he will commit the government to strengthening the post
office network by making it easier to pay benefits across post office
counters.
The Department of Trade and Industry is still finalising its 22-month review
of the Post Office, which favours privatisation.
Mr Lilley, who is understood to favour the flotation of the Royal Mail, the
letters division, and Parcelforce, the parcels arm, will make it clear that
his reforms to post office counters will remain in place irrespective of the
government's review.
A significant number of Tory backbenchers oppose privatisation because of
the perceived threat to the rural post offices, many of which rely on a
subsidy from the Post Office.
Their fears were increased last year when Mr Lilley announced an expanded
range of benefits available for payment direct to bank and building society
accounts, which is seen as a threat to the post office network. However, the
government made clear that the system would not be made compulsory.
Mr Lilley will today attempt to assure both backbenchers and sub-postmasters
that there is no fear that large numbers of post offices face closure.
He has decided to make benefit payments through post offices more secure by
introducing three main reforms:
The use of bar codes on benefit books will be extended to clamp down on
fraud.
Computer terminals will be installed in post offices, to enable postmasters
to verify claimants. Benefit books will be replaced in the medium term with
special payment cards designed to cut theft and fraud.
Ministers believe Labour has mounted a 'scare campaign' about the threat of
automated credit transfer in its campaign against privatisation.
Mr Lilley intends to use his speech today to assure the postmasters that the
government needs the post office network to deliver benefits and that many
people would still prefer payment across the counter.
He is also known to support the DTI's favoured method of privatising the
Royal Mail and its parcels arm, which would leave Post Office Counters -
responsible for the sub-post offices - in the public sector.
His speech coincides with a campaign by Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief
executive, to win over MPs to the merits of more commercialisation or
privatisation by stressing his commitment to the rural post offices.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Bogus factories hid fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax evasion was so widespread among a group of London garment factories that
the use of false invoices and bogus companies was widely regarded as normal,
a judge said yesterday.
Judge Mota Singh said at Southwark Crown Court that 'vast resources' had
been necessary to uncover a fraud centred on garment factories predominantly
controlled by members of the Turkish and Cypriot communities in the Hackney
and Stoke Newington areas.
A series of fraud trials ended yesterday in jail sentences for four company
directors and a bookkeeper.
Customs and Excise was defrauded of Pounds 6m in value added tax and there
was an estimated further Pounds 10m in unpaid income tax and national
insurance contributions.
In April 1990 a total of 300 Customs officers raided more than 50 London
premises. Sixty-one people were arrested and of the 47 who came to court, 20
admitted various offences relating to VAT fraud.
Five trials were held with the longest taking seven months. Total prison
sentences of 60 years and six months and total fines of Pounds 180,000 were
imposed.
Customs investigators found that in some cases only Pounds 150 of a worker's
Pounds 500 weekly wage was being declared for tax.
To conceal what was going on a large number of bogus businesses were set up
to provide fictitious invoices to the garment manufacturing companies.
Investigators believe it is unlikely any of the money will be recovered.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Convenience food set for bigger role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Convenience foods, private healthcare and home shopping are the sectors most
likely to benefit from further demographic and social changes before 2000,
according to Mintel.
Meanwhile, rock concerts, pub drinking and purchases of red meat are all set
for decline, says the report on consumer habits.
Three groups will make up a larger proportion of the population: families,
in particular those with children aged between five and 14; 'empty-nesters',
whose children have left home; and elderly people, especially those above
the age of 75.
For the food and drink markets, the ageing population and increase in
single-parent households - for whom time is at a premium - will mean the
increased use of convenience foods.
The decline in numbers of young people and increase in adults with young
children will lead to more home consumption of alcoholic drink and lower pub
attendance, says the report.
The increase in numbers of young children will have other consequences:
'Within the home, DIY activities will increase in popularity, as children
necessitate more decoration work.'
For the financial services market, there will be an overall growth in
segmentation between families and 'empty-nesters', the group forecasts.
It concludes: 'Consumers are likely to become more financially sophisticated
over the coming decade, with stocks and share ownership and unit-trust
ownership rising.
'Hand in hand with this will go a greater provision for personal pensions
and high-interest building society and bank accounts.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Consumers more self-reliant, says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emergence of 'self-reliant' consumers, more willing to take
responsibility for their health and economic well being, is one of the
principal trends identified by Mintel, the market research group, in a
report reviewing social changes over the last 20 years.
The past decade in particular has seen responsibility shift from the state
to the individual, says the report.
'Council house sales, problems with the NHS, and the move away from state
pensions have forced people to take more responsibility for their own lives
and made them more confident in their ability to go private, or go it
alone.'
The change is reflected in the increased role of personal pensions and
health insurance, as well as in personal transport, self-employment and home
ownership, says the report.
'It is also evident in the move away from mass marketing and fashion.
Today's consumer is more likely to make a choice based on their own style
rather than current fashion or national norm,' says Mintel in its report.
Spending has shifted away from goods towards services. In particular, there
has been a decrease in spending on food, alcoholic drink and tobacco and an
increase in spending on non-utility, especially leisure, services.
Other large-scale lifestyle trends over the last 20 years identified by
Mintel include:
Greater interest and awareness of health issues, leading to reduced smoking
and greater attention to healthy eating.
Increased interest in environmental issues.
Growth of the home as an increasingly important leisure centre.
Increased individualism, leading to greater segmentation within consumer
markets.
Increased mobility, leading to greater use of superstores and out-of-town
shopping centres.
A growth in home and personal security because of rising crime.
These changes mean that many areas of consumer spending growth that did not
exist or were in an embryonic state 20 years ago are today taken for
granted, says the report. These sectors include satellite TV, video
recorders, home computers and the DIY superstore.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Mortgage broker 'preyed on greed'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A mortgage broker 'preyed on the greed' of investors and conned them out of
Pounds 43m in a mortgage lending fraud, Oxford Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Roy Wharton persuaded retired couples and businesses to hand over cash
for his schemes and transferred money between different accounts so the
extent of his company's financial difficulties could not be traced, said Mr
Philip Mott QC, prosecuting.
Mr Wharton denies two counts of fraudulent trading and two of using a false
instrument, the latter referring to a charge on a house and a lending
agreement.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Pressure grows on minister to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, was under growing pressure
to resign from the government last night after he admitted misleading the
Commons during a debate on rights for the disabled, James Blitz writes.
Following angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader,
called for Mr Scott's resignation after the minister admitted that his
department had helped Tory backbenchers to wreck the passage of a private
member's bill that would have required employers to provide facilities for
disabled people.
Mr Scott appeared determined to ride out allegations that he misled the
Commons last Friday when he stated that that his department had played no
part in drawing up the amendments.
Downing Street officials made clear that Mr Scott enjoyed the prime
minister's full confidence, and had cleared up any misunderstandings.
But Labour intensified pressure on the minister, seeing the row as a test of
the accountability of members of Mr John Major's government. In a letter to
the prime minister, Mr Smith said Mr Scott's statement was 'wholly
unsatisfactory'. He had 'confirmed that his department, with his authority,
had been involved in the preparation of the amendments'.
The Labour leader quoted a letter from the prime minister to a Labour MP, in
which Mr Major had said ministers should 'relinquish their positions' if
they knowingly failed to give truthful information the House.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, announced that she would rule soon on
whether Mr Scott had been in 'contempt' of the House.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Scottish Tories to confront leaders on election failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Tories, chastened by their disastrous showing in last week's
regional council elections, will confront their leaders today at their
annual conference in Inverness.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will be the first of seven cabinet
ministers to address the conference. Mr John Major will attempt to rekindle
his premiership at the closing rally on Friday.
In a routine that has become all too familiar in the past decade of decline,
practically uninterrupted but for a revival in the 1992 general election,
the Scottish Tories will try to identify what changes of policy or
presentation to make.
The regional council election result, in which they made a net loss of 23
seats and took under 14 per cent of the vote, shocked them and came as a
pleasant surprise to their Scottish National party, Liberal Democrat and
Labour opponents.
The Tories are uncertain whether they lost support because of government
plans to take Scottish water out of local authority control, or whether
former supporters were expressing the same general discontent with the Major
government as their counterparts south of the border.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, inclined to the latter interpretation,
although he also said the party would have to 'readdress the things we do
and the way in which we present them'. He does not believe many Tory
supporters thought it pointless to elect opposition-run councils which are
to be abolished in 1996 anyway.
Mr Hurd will tackle the issue of the hour when he winds up today's debate on
Europe, replying to a motion that 'supports the principle of subsidiarity,
rejecting the concept of a federal Europe'.
On Thursday Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will reply to the debate on
the economy before embarking on two days of electioneering in north-east
Scotland for the European elections. Later that day Mr John McGregor, the
transport secretary, will speak.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary and Mr David Hunt, the employment minister will speak on
Friday.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Gummer joins attack on modern architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, launched a savage attack
yesterday on the standard of much modern architecture, echoing criticisms
repeatedly made by the Prince of Wales in recent years.
Speaking to the Cities 94 conference in London's Docklands, Mr Gummer
indicated he would use his planning powers to improve the quality of
buildings in British cities.
He made it clear he would block city-centre developments that he regarded as
poorly designed or out of keeping with existing buildings. He said: 'Too
many buildings which won prizes in the 1960s need to be pulled down in the
1990s.'
Mr Gummer gave as examples Birmingham's Bull Ring shopping centre, his own
departmental headquarters in Marsham Street in Westminster, and the National
Westminster Bank building in Leeds. He later added to the list residential
developments such as the high-rise flats overlooking Richmond Park at
Roehampton in south-west London. Many 1960s flats suffered from water
penetration, he added.
'One important quality of buildings is that they should keep the water out,'
he said. 'Many of the buildings of the 1960s are bad buildings in a
functional sense.'
Mr Gummer assured his audience that he was not against all modern
architecture. 'I certainly don't want pastiche styles,' he said. 'I want
buildings of today and tomorrow which respect what has gone before.'
He promised an initiative to set standards for developers, encouraging them
to create developments that complement existing buildings and specifying the
use of appropriate materials and finishes. 'This generation could be
remembered for architecture which enhanced its environment and used
imagination and innovation to build for the future by building to last,' he
said.
Architects and town planners welcomed Mr Gummer's plans.
'A lot of architects and planners were seduced by the new style of buildings
in the 1960s, and went too far,' said Mr Jed Griffiths, senior
vice-president of the Royal Town Planning Institute.
The Royal Institute of British Architects said it was 'delighted' at the new
emphasis on quality and design.
A new organisation to win Britain a bigger share of the European
Commission's Pounds 8.5bn research and development budget was launched
yesterday by the construction industry, Andrew Taylor writes.
The Construction Industry European Research Club, which is supported by the
environment department, will provide information on impending projects,
arrange partnerships with other European companies and research
organisations, and provide contacts and prepare submissions to the
commision.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Gas price rise fears dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The deregulated gas industry should be able to subsidise as many as 2.4m
households which consume small amounts of gas if it is politically desirable
to do so, Alliance Gas, one of the largest of the new independent gas
marketers, said yesterday.
Mr Kris Maroe, managing director of Alliance, which is owned by British
Petroleum and Statoil of Norway, said fears that many consumers might face
price rises during the move to an open market should not be an obstacle to
introducing competition.
Its calculations showed that by 1996, when competition is to be phased in,
no more than 2.4m households out of a total of about 18m would be
unprofitable for gas companies to serve. The category covered households
which used less than 200 therms of gas a year, and which included many
consumers who used gas only for cooking.
Mr Maroe said the volume required to supply them amounted to only 1.6 per
cent of gas consumed. He added: 'If it is politically desirable then we in
the industry should be able to afford a cross-subsidy amounting to only 1.6
per cent of the market.'
He was confident that such a cross-subsidy would not alter the level playing
field for a deregulated gas industry which the government is trying to
create.
Opposition MPs and some consumer groups have said that up to 6m households
could face increased gas prices when cross-subsidies are removed.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt launches drive to find new chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday formally launched its
hunt for a successor to Mr Peter Sutherland, who plans to stand down from
Gatt's top job at the end of this year.
The successful candidate will become the first director-general of the new
World Trade Organisation which will absorb Gatt in 1995. However, he or she
will be selected under current Gatt procedures. Mr Andras Szepesi of
Hungary, this year's chairman of the contracting parties (members), said
yesterday he would begin the necessary consultations, which are designed to
secure a consensus.
Trade diplomats in Geneva said they hoped agreement could be reached by the
summer. No names are yet officially in the ring, but several possible
candidates have been mentioned, not necessarily with their knowledge or
approval.
Among the more plausible are Mr Renato Ruggiero, former Italian trade
minister and an early advocate of the WTO, Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's
environment minister and a former Gatt ambassador, and Mr Philip Burdon,
trade minister of New Zealand.
Developing countries, which account for three-quarters of Gatt's 123
members, are expected to make a strong push for the WTO top job. Many Third
World nations, who played a key role in the just-completed Uruguay Round of
trade talks, see the vacancy as a golden opportunity to break the hegemony
of the industrialised powers over the big international economic
institutions. Latin American candidates mounted a vigorous challenge to Mr
Sutherland last year.
US officials in Geneva yesterday denied suggestions that Washington was
opposed to the WTO job going to a developing country national. 'We have no
geographical or developed-developing country limitations', said one senior
US diplomat.
Whoever succeeds Mr Sutherland will need to win the assent, if not the
sponsorship, of the leading trading powers - the US, the European Union and,
to a lesser extent, Japan.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland urges early Chinese entry to
trade body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday urged a speedy conclusion to negotiations on China's
application to resume its Gatt status. Beijing withdrew in 1950, a year
after the communists came to power.
Mr Sutherland in Beijing for a business seminar said the international
community favoured China's early return to Gatt or its successor body, the
World Trade Organisation.
'We are very anxious the negotiating process should be pursued speedily,
constructively and with a view to finding solutions to any difficulties that
may remain,' he said.
'All parties involved in the negotiations have to co-operate to find
solutions and bring China into the World Trade Organisation.'
Mr Sutherland's remarks in the Chinese capital were clearly aimed at
persuading the Americans and the Europeans that the time is ripe for China
to resume its Gatt status.
They come just weeks before President Clinton is due to rule on whether to
extend China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in the US. Denial of MFN
would certainly affect Gatt negotiations.
Beijing is due to resume bilateral discussions with the Europeans on the
Gatt issue late this month and with the US early in June. A meeting of the
Gatt 'working party' on China is scheduled to be held in Geneva next month.
Gatt negotiators have narrowed discussions on terms for China's entry to
such issues as a transitional period during which Beijing would be expected
to make further progress towards liberalising its economy. Talks are also
focusing on review arrangements to ensure compliance and a safeguards clause
to counter Chinese export surges.
Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief Gatt negotiator, said it was time for
negotiations to be accelerated. It would make no sense for China, which
accounts for one-fifth of the world's population and ranks number 11 among
trading nations, to be excluded from the WTO when it is formed next year, he
said.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: ABB to invest in China power projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB, the world's largest electrical engineering group, plans to invest
Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) on power projects and equipment in China by 1996;
but low government-mandated returns of 12 per cent are discouraging equity
participation in power stations.
Mr Percy Barnevik, president of the Zurich-based company, told reporters in
Beijing yesterday ABB was adopting a 'long-term perspective' in its approach
to the Chinese market where there is enormous demand for energy.
'We are very optimistic about China's potential,' he said, 'even if economic
growth is slower than the last five years'.
China more than doubled its power generating capacity in the last decade but
to reach Europe's electricity per capita consumption would mean harnessing
1,500 gigawatts of generating capacity - half of today's global capacity. (A
gigawatt is equivalent to 1bn watts).
'China needs 15,000-18,000 MW annually - that is 30 power plants a year, or
two-and-a-half a month,' Mr Barnevik said.
ABB has some 11 ventures in China, including four power stations. It plans a
further 10 projects in the next few years, mostly in the power sector.
Beijing recently dampened investor enthusiasm for build-operate-transfer
(BOT) projects by seeking to cap returns at 12 per cent. This compares with
some earlier deals in southern China involving as much as an 18 per cent
return on investment.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Airbus wins Dollars 1bn Canada order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air Canada yesterday said it planned to buy up to 35 European Airbus A319
twin engine narrowbody airliners worth Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 950m) to
replace its fleet of old McDonnell Douglas DC9 aircraft.
The deal is a significant boost for the European consortium which lost out
earlier this year to its two US competitors, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas,
in a Dollars 6bn Saudi Arabian civil aircraft order.
Air Canada's decision is also a blow for McDonnell Douglas which had
proposed to rebuild and re-engine the Canadian carrier's fleet of 35 DC9s to
modern aircraft standards as a cheaper alternative to buying new aircraft.
Apart from McDonnell Douglas, Boeing had also competed for the deal with its
737 twin-engine narrowbody airliner, while Fokker, the Dutch aircraft
manufacturer controlled by Deutsche Aerospace, had also offered its Fokker
100 jet.
Airbus launched its new A319 aircraft at the Paris Air Show last summer. The
aircraft is a smaller 124-seat version of the 150-seat A320 twin engine
airliner. Air Canada said its A319 cabin configuration would offer 112
seats.
Air Canada said it intended to place firm orders for 25 A319 worth about
Dollars 1bn and take options for an additional 10 aircraft worth another
Dollars 400m.
The A319 orders will turn Air Canada into the largest operator of Airbus
aircraft in North America. The airline already operates 34 A320s and has
also ordered 6 A340 long range widebody airliners.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Japan boost for foreign cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imported cars captured a record 8.4 per cent share of the Japanese new car
market in April according to figures released yesterday by the Japan
Automobile Importers' Association
Sales of imported cars rose last month by 35.1 per cent year-on-year to
21,856 in sharp contrast to the continuing decline in the overall Japanese
new car market, where total car sales fell by 6.1 per cent to 259,249.
The volume of imported cars is being increased significantly by rising
imports to Japan from Japanese vehicle makers' overseas plants. Total
imports of Japanese-badged cars jumped by 61.5 per cent to 5,459 from 3,381
a year ago.
Overall new car sales in Japan have fallen for three years in succession
from 5.1m in 1990 to 4.2m last year, and total new vehicle sales declined by
a further 5.8 per cent year-on-year in the first four months this year.
By contrast sales of imported vehicles in the first four months jumped by
37.6 per cent year-on-year to 86,662, including a 28 per cent increase in
sales of imported cars to 78,825 cars.
In the whole of last year imported cars accounted for 4.6 per cent of the
total Japanese new car market.

Canadian and European telecommunications equipment suppliers which lost out
to AT&amp;T of the US in a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) Saudi contract on Monday
claim political pressure by the Clinton administration cost them the
business.
The Saudi contract, one of the largest awarded in telecoms, provides for
wholesale upgrading of the kingdom's telecoms network over the next seven
years, including 1.5m new telephone lines and a new digital mobile cellular
network.
AT&amp;T hailed the contract as 'a big boost to our globalisation efforts'. It
is a staging post in the attainment of the company's goal of increasing the
non-US share of its equipment supply business from 20 per cent to 50 per
cent of total turnover by the end of the decade.
The contract was bitterly fought between AT&amp;T and Siemens of Germany,
Alcatel of France, Ericsson of Sweden, and Northern Telecom of Canada. All
four non-US companies are believed to be aggrieved at the extent of lobbying
by Washington on AT&amp;T's behalf. Yesterday Ericsson claimed political factors
had been 'decisive'.
The group said its offer had been lower than its competitors, although it
declined to be specific. It noted AT&amp;T's eventual order at 1.5m lines was
bigger than specified in the original tender.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive, complained last year Ericsson
was losing orders because of its lack of political clout: 'We could easily
double our revenues today if we had the same political and financial muscle
as our competitors.'
Stockholm analysts said the US role in the Gulf War and President Clinton's
intervention in the contract talks had almost certainly helped AT&amp;T to
clinch the order. But they believed Ericsson was well placed to recover from
the setback, particularly when a new batch of cellular mobile licences is
auctioned in the US later this year.
The group played down the impact of the loss on its overall business.
'The value of this order corresponds to roughly 2 per cent of our yearly
order intake; the volume of 200,000 lines per year should be compared to
Ericsson's annual deliveries of around 10m lines,' said Mr Bo Landin, a
senior vice-president.
Mr Ron Brown, US Commerce Secretary, cited the contract as a prime example
of the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's promotion of US
business.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Peru's opposition 'in search of candidate': Former UN chief
Perez de Cuellar is being touted as likely opponent to Fujimori
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lima's leading news magazine recently carried a photographic mock-up of a
'dream ticket' for next year's presidential elections: as president, Mr
Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary general; running mates, Mr
Ricardo Belmont, a television personality twice elected mayor of Lima, and
General Ketin Vidal, who masterminded the capture of Sendero Luminoso
guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman.
The three are not known ever to have met and none - least of all General
Vidal - has expressed a firm intention to run. But speculation about who
might have a chance of beating Mr Alberto Fujimori next year is growing.
Influential opposition figures are busily promoting a Perez de Cuellar
candidacy. And a series of opinion polls in the past month have indicated
that, in a straight two-way fight, the former diplomat would beat Mr
Fujimori by six points.
'What we really have at present is an opposition in search of a candidate,'
says Mr Manuel Torrado, head of political research at local polling
organisation Datum.
Mr Perez de Cuellar towers over other presidential hopefuls. What is most
important, he fits the bill as a political 'independent' - 80 per cent of
Peruvians claim to have no party loyalty and the traditional political
groupings are still suffering from the generalised discredit both
self-inflicted and skilfully promoted by Mr Fujimori.
Supporters of Mr Perez de Cuellar point to his impeccable democratic
credentials and high international standing. He would, they argue, help
rebuild the still-precarious bridges between Peru and the rest of the world.
His experience in seeking consensus could also be a welcome change from Mr
Fujimori's authoritarian style.
On the down side are Mr Perez de Cuellar's age (he is 74) and his lack of
familiarity with his native land: he has lived abroad most of his life and
continues to do so. A senior Fujimori aide describes the former UN secretary
general as 'colourless, tasteless and odourless'. Former president Mr
Fernand o Belaunde Terry, meanwhile, is reported to have said that 'this is
a product that won't sell in the Andes'.
Mr Torrado, a veteran of Peruvian political campaigns, disagrees. With
proper marketing, he says, Andean peasants in the remote highlands would
vote en masse for Mr Perez de Cuellar. 'How could they not? In their eyes,
he's already been president of the world.'
President Fujimori, however, will be hard to beat. His approval ratings
remain high and, though he has yet to announce his candidacy for a second
term, he already appears to be on the campaign trail.
For weeks he has been visiting remote rural areas and urban shanty-towns,
opening new schools and the like. The 1994 public purse has been
conveniently swelled by a stepped-up 'social compensation fund' budget as
well as by cash from privatisations.
One thing Mr Fujimori notably lacks is a political party. Cambio (Change)
90, which he created to support his 1990 presidential campaign and New
Majority, conjured up to run candidates in the 1992 post-coup constitutional
elections, have failed to put down roots. With the long-established Apra and
Popular Action parties gearing up to run candidates, a 1995 congressional
majority for Mr Fujimori looks unlikely.
Increasingly, the army has substituted for the political party Mr Fujimori
lacks. That, too, may create problems. Army support is always essential in
electoral processes in Peru - to distribute electoral material, guarantee
order and collect ballot boxes.
The biggest test for Peruvian democracy over the 11 months before the first
round may be whether the armed forces can maintain neutrality towards a
president-candidate with whom they are intimately linked.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Bankers defend derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior banking executives rallied in Washington yesterday to fight off calls
for more government regulation of derivatives. There is growing
congressional concern about the risks raised by these sometimes complex
financial products, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges.
A panel of senior bankers and former financial services regulators told a
House of Representatives committee yesterday that the risks associated with
derivatives had been greatly exaggerated and that they saw no need for
further legislation.
'Whatever else is true - and there are real issues that should be addressed
 -the sky is not falling,' said Mr Richard Breeden, former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, former head of the new York Federal Reserve, also
rejected the need for legislation.
'I am hard pressed to think of sensible things that might be done through
legislation that would better equip the Fed or other official bodies to deal
with a financial disruption of consequence,' Mr Corrigan said.
'So far the normal channels are working. It is hard to make a case that
additional regulation or legislation is needed to make up for a deficiency,'
added Mr Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, who headed a study last
year by the Group of 30 of derivatives practices.
The three financiers scoffed at measures proposed by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, one of the principal bank regulatory agencies,
to broaden the requirement for banks to determine whether a derivatives
transaction is appropriate for a particular customer.
Expanding on a circular it put out last year, the OCC said banks should
assess the suitability of a derivative instrument for their customer,
whether they were acting as a dealer or an agent, and should make sure the
customer understood the risks of the transaction.
But Mr Breeden dismissed the need for such concern about the large and
sophisticated financial investors who may be engaged in derivatives.
'The traditional and still appropriate answer as to whether a dealer should
have a duty to make a suitability determination with respect to a major
multinational corporation is simply no. There has not been a category of
'widow and orphan multinational corporation,' and I do not believe that we
should create one now,' Mr Breeden said.
Mr Corrigan added that it would be a 'colossal mistake' to try to extend the
system of financial regulation to corporate end users of derivatives.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, is due to
publish a report on derivatives later this month which is expected to call
for more comprehensive capital standards for banks dealing in derivatives,
along with greater federal scrutiny of the market.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Sony in Mexico labour complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The AFL-CIO, the US labour union grouping, is preparing to file a complaint
against Sony Electronics for allegedly violating the labour rights of its
Mexican workers, in a potentially important test case of the North American
Free Trade Agreement's side accord on labour.
Mr Michael Byrne, spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said its complaint would be
filed within weeks. The union alleges a Sony-owned plant in Nuevo Laredo,
Mexico, fired workers for union activism in January, played a substantial
role in staging fraudulent union elections last month, and called riot
police into the plant to put down a peaceful demonstration.
Sony denied the allegations, saying it had been caught in a dispute between
two factions in the company union. It says two workers were fired in March,
but for disrupting work rather than union activism, and that Sony played no
part at all in union elections.
The AFL-CIO complaint will be the third presented to the National
Administrative Office of the US Labour Department, which was set up to
implement the labour side agreement of Nafta. The first two complaints were
filed against General Electric and Honeywell for allegedly firing workers
for seeking to organise a union in their Mexican-owned plants.
The NAO agreed last month to review the complaints against General Electric
and Honeywell, and has up to 180 days to issue a non-binding public report,
which could be followed by a public hearing. However, the alleged violations
are not punishable by sanctions, and it is not clear what the next step
would be if the complaints were upheld.
Under the Nafta side accord, labour offices are established in each member
country to receive and report on complaints labour laws have been violated
in other member countries. However, in most cases the result of the report
will be a recommendation, since sanctions are only applicable if a country
fails to enforce its minimum wage, child labour or health and safety laws.

Peru's government can spend up to Dollars 876m from its privatisation
programme on social and capital investment projects this year, according to
an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Reuter reports from Lima.
A letter of intent, published in the official gazette and due to be signed
soon, lays out the 1994 targets for Peru's economic programme under a
three-year extended fund facility which the government signed with the IMF
in March 1993.
Inflation will be reduced to between 15 and 20 per cent, gross domestic
product will grow between 4 and 5 per cent and net international reserves
will rise by Dollars 151m, it said.
'The government will deepen structural reforms to improve efficiency and
increase national savings, laying the base for sustained growth and
balance-of-payments viability,' the letter said.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Law fees eclipse court selection
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a week when American eyes might have been on President Bill Clinton's
search for a new justice for the Supreme Court attention has been diverted
by an issue even older than the highest bench; the relationship between the
law and money.
Mr Clinton did confer yesterday with senior advisers on the court selection
after mounting speculation over who has been on and off his moveable short
list. Most frequently mentioned names include Mr Richard Arnold, a
distinguished federal judge who happens to hail from Arkansas, Mr Bruce
Babbitt, the interior secretary, and Mr Jose Cabranes, a federal judge of
Hispanic extraction.
But the White House staff has been preoccupied with a far more prosaic issue
 -how to pay for Mr and Mrs Clinton's private legal fees resulting from the
Whitewater investigations and the sexual harassment law suit filed by Ms
Paula Jones against the president. Ms Jones has an equivalent financial
problem on her hands, the cost of prosecuting her case.
The first family (declared income last year Dollars 293,000) has contracted
with two high-priced (Dollars 400-Dollars 500 an hour) lawyers. The White
House is considering inviting private contributions to finance the bills
which could easily rise towards the Dollars 1m range, capable of wiping out
their known private assets. Rough precedents include private donations to
the Reagans to help redecorate the White House, but that also attracted
conflict of interest criticisms.
Ms Jones (income unknown but small) might well find backing from
conservative sources intent on embarrassing Mr Clinton. But accepting
funding from such sources would suggest her action was politically
motivated, not exactly the way to win over a jury in her Dollars 750,000
damages suit if the case ever comes to trial. Her lawyer said yesterday that
only one Dollars 50 contribution had been received.
But even the financial scale of their problems were dwarfed this week by
news of another lawsuit. Mr Brian Mooar, a reporter/photographer for the
Washington Post, sued the District of Columbia government for no less than
Dollars 171m - and this from a government whose budgetary shortfall is such
that it wants to postpone Dollars 230m in payments to its pension fund. Even
his editor expressed doubts about the size of the damages sought.
Mr Mooar, en route one night last December to another crime story,
photographed a woman handcuffed to a mail box after she had been pulled over
on suspicion of drunken driving. Two policemen who tried to grab his camera
in a tussle in which the reporter suffered back injuries were later cleared
by an internal police investigation.
Mr Mooar's lawyer declared: 'This suit is not about money.' These were
exactly the same words used by Ms Jones's lawyer last week, prompting Mr
Robert Bennett, Mr Clinton's attorney, to counter-charge: 'This suit is all
about money.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Yemen's political leaders yesterday stepped up their propaganda
offensive in the civil war by denouncing the prime minister, Mr Haydar Abu
Bakr al-Attas, and stripping him of all government powers.
Mr Attas is the fifth southerner dismissed in a week as northern political
leaders attempt to consolidate and legitimise their authority throughout the
country.
The military situation remained unclear, with each side broadcasting its own
version of events. Heavy fighting is reported around Aden, where northern
troops were said to have advanced to within three miles of the city on
Monday. But reports from Aden said the situation there was normal.
Northern troops appear to have secured the region around Lodah, about 100
miles to the north-east of Aden, and to have sent reinforcements on the road
to Ataq, 350 miles north-east of Aden, in anticipation of further fighting
there. Southern troops, reported to have taken heavy losses in last week's
fighting, are now regrouping to rebuff the expected northern advance.
So far, the main oilfields have been spared direct involvement in the
fighting. But observers say that could easily change as the battle unfolds
in and around Aden, the southern stronghold.
The north's main oilfields, which produce about 180,000 barrels a day, are
located at Mareb, 150 miles east of Sanaa. The south's main fields are in
the Hadramout Valley at Wadi Masila and produce 150,000 b/d. But oil men say
that between those fields 300 northern and southern tanks are now arrayed
against each other. If a battle should take place there, they admit, it
could mean one side or the other taking all the country's oil.
The dismissal of Mr Attas followed his appeal last week for outside forces
to help end the civil war, now in its second week. The Yemeni parliament,
meeting without its southern members, insisted that Mr Attas's actions were
illegal and notified embassies in Sanaa, the northern capital, that he no
longer represented the government.
The Sanaa government, which now describes itself as having the only
constitutional legitimacy in the country, has also sacked Mr Saleh Abu Bakr
bin-Husaynoon, oil minister.

Israel began a long-delayed transfer of authority to the PLO in the Gaza
Strip last night, handing over the first military base to Palestinian police
officers, Reuter reports.
The handover in the town of Deir al-Balah came hours after a first group of
157 policemen had moved into Gaza from Egypt. Gaza's streets were filled
with thousands of excited Palestinians witnessing the transition into the
early hours of this morning.
Under the terms of the peace accord, Israel will transfer all civilian and
policing authority to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of
Jericho within weeks.
A senior adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, said 1,800 policemen would be deployed in Gaza and 400 in
Jericho by Friday.
The policemen who arrived yesterday were unarmed and dressed in olive-drab
uniforms. They brought in 24 jeeps. They were stuck for hours at the Rafah
border terminal in southern Gaza, apparently delayed by bureaucratic snags.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday appealed for
Dollars 56.7m (Pounds 37.9m) to cover the urgent needs of 860,000 refugees
who have fled ethnic strife in Rwanda and Burundi, writes Frances Williams
in Geneva. The appeal is intended to cover food, drinking water, shelter and
sanitation over the next three months for refugees now in Tanzania, Burundi,
Zaire and Uganda.
Two weeks ago, in the largest and swiftest exodus UNHCR has ever seen, some
250,000 people surged into north-western Tanzania in the space of 24 hours.
The UNHCR, which has set up a makeshift camp at Benaco 18km from the Rwandan
border, says it is still receiving 400-1,500 new refugees each day. Children
make up half Benaco's 250,000 population.
Only last week UNHCR said it would need Dollars 38.5m for refugee aid, but
the agency has revised upwards its immediate requirements as the numbers
escaping the civil war in Rwanda continue to grow.
Separately, Canada has asked for a special session of the UN Human Rights
Commission to discuss the atrocities in Rwanda, where up to 200,000 may have
died in recent weeks. If agreed by a majority of the 53 members, the
commission will meet later this month in Geneva.
Meanwhile, a report to the UN Security Council has proposed a new
peacekeeping force for Rwanda of at least 5,500 troops to support relief
operations and protect civilians.
It is unclear who would participate in such a force. The Security Council
recently voted to reduce its 2,500-strong peacekeeping contingent in Rwanda
to 270 after violence made it unable to function. About 450 remain.

Japan's economy continues to be generally sluggish, according to the latest
monthly report of the government's Economic Planning Agency.
The economic decline passed its 37th month in April, the longest downturn in
post-war history, showing almost no change from the previous month.
The economy 'is going through an adjustment phase, and showing an overall
slump, though there are some bright signs,' said the EPA, using the same
phrase as last month's report.
The agency - over-optimistic about the recovery outlook last year - has in
recent months become more pessimistic than some other official government
forecasters, especially the Bank of Japan, which believes that the
conditions for an upturn are falling into place.
Among the bright signs highlighted by the EPA were the continued strength in
housing starts at 1.5m per month, an apparent end to the decline in
corporate confidence and an upturn in personal spending.
However, Mr Yoshio Terasawa, the EPA's new director general, warned
yesterday that the impact of the yen's recent rise was 'extremely severe'.
Recovery prospects are weakened by the continued fall in corporate earnings,
down four years in a row as the annual results season will confirm over the
next few weeks. Industrial output continues to fall, though companies are
making progress in cutting stocks of unsold goods, said the EPA.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Labour faces Histadrut defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's governing Labour party faced defeat last night in nationwide
elections for Israel's biggest labour federation, at the hands of Mr Haim
Ramon, a former Labour minister set on breaking the mould of Israeli
politics.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin congratulated Mr Ramon on his win, put by an
Israeli TV exit poll as 47 per cent of the vote compared to 33 for the
Labour candidate, Mr Haim Haberfeld, and 16 for the opposition Likud
candidate.
Final results were expected today but Mr Rabin acknowledged his party had
'suffered a blow' and raised the possibility of forming a coalition with Mr
Ramon to rule the trade union. 'I really hope that the Labour party and
Ramon's people will remember one thing, that the main enemy is the Likud,
both in the national and the Histadrut arena,' Mr Rabin said. 'I hope very
much that. . . we will find a way to co-operate.'
Mr Ramon answered that 'the first possibility is to form a coalition with
the Labour party'. If the exit poll is confirmed, it will be a stunning
victory for Mr Ramon. Analysts believe Mr Ramon, 44, who resigned as health
minister in February, intends to use his victory as a springboard to
challenge Mr Rabin inside the Labour party, or form his own party, named the
Social Democratic party.
Mr Ramon, who is standing on an independent list, represents the young
generation of the Labour party who are desperate for reform and a change
from the old-guard leadership symbolised by Mr Rabin, 72, Mr Haberfeld, 62,
and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, 70. They also want to break the
Histadrut's stranglehold on Labour party policy, and speed Israel's
transition from socialism to the social market.
Mr Ramon, in coalition with the left-wing Meretz bloc and the ultra-orthodox
Shas party, focused his campaign on social issues and vowed to curb
Histadrut's bureaucracy.
If the exit poll is correct, Mr Ramon will be short of an absolute majority
and will be forced to form a coalition.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Nigeria wonders when its turn will come
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
While the Nigerian military leadership was in Pretoria to witness the start
of South Africa's majority rule, many of Nigeria's 88m people were at home
wondering when their turn would come.
Nigerians' admiration for South Africa's transfer of power is mixed with
realisation that South Africa can now claim the title to which Nigeria has
long aspired: foremost black African state. Mr Mandela's inauguration is
poignant for Nigeria, which has championed black majorities in southern
Africa more successfully than it has resolved its own political problems.
Nearly seven months after Gen Sani Abacha seized power, promising a swift
transition to lasting democracy, Nigeria is no nearer civilian rule than
when the armed forces took over a decade ago.
'I wish Abacha had worn army uniform instead of the agbada (traditional
dress) to show the world we have military rule,' said a Nigerian after
watching the inauguration on television. There will be no political activity
until next year at least, after a national constitutional conference,
supposed to be starting on June 27, has debated and passed its
recommendations to the government before the drafting of a new constitution.
Until next year, political parties are illegal, all democratically-elected
institutions are dissolved, and all political activity is banned.
The conference was Gen Abacha's idea. Many hoped it would be a sovereign
conference in which Nigerians could resolve some of the country's political
problems, not least the role of central government and minorities
representation.
But the goodwill evaporated as the government delayed the start date for the
conference and began to limit its scope and powers. The Campaign for
Democracy (CD) has refused to share in or support the conference and has
called for a boycott of the election of 270 delegates, due to start on May
23.
'This conference is a ruse, designed to buy time for a military regime in no
hurry to go,' says Mr Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, the CD's general secretary in
Lagos. 'The regime has removed all substance from the conference. If the
government disapproves of any of the elected delegates, it can replace them
at any stage. How can the divergent views of a country like Nigeria coalesce
when a ban exists on all pre-conference political activity?'
Information Minister Jerry Gana denies this charge. 'The constitutional
conference is definitely not a ploy to buy time; we believe we are answering
the yearnings of Nigerians,' he said recently.
Since then, Gen Abacha has said his Provisional Ruling Council will vet the
outcome of the conference's report. Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the
government, has said the final report of the conference will be written by a
commission appointed by the military.
That commission will in turn report to a political bureau, to be appointed
by the regime, which will draft the constitution. 'The so-called
constitutional conference is unnecessary,' says Mr Moshood Abiola, who won
the majority in last June's annulled presidential election. 'We don't need
it because when you have held an election, the next step should be the
formation of an elected government. We have not had that.'

FT  11 MAY 94 / Interest rate increase attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's banking and business community yesterday attacked Monday's 0.5
percentage points rise in interest rates and warned the central bank's
action would damp economic growth, harm exports and hinder private
investment, writes Julian Ozanne.
Israel's finance ministry, deeply critical of an earlier interest rate rise,
made no public comment but officials said the minister was furious with the
independent move by the Bank of Israel.
The Bank of Israel raised its prime lending rate from 10.5 to 11 per cent to
reach this year's annual inflation target of 8 per cent. Inflation last year
was 11.3 per cent and bank officials said data from the first four months of
this year showed inflation was running at about 10 per cent. Members of the
Knesset (parliament) finance committee demanded the central bank lower
interest rates by 1 per cent. They are preparing a law according to which
all future interest-rate decisions will be taken jointly by the central bank
and Finance Ministry.
Mr Dan Tichon, a member of the committee, said: 'To prove it exists, the
central bank is punishing the business sector and preventing continued
growth by unjustified rises in interest rates.'
Mr Dan Proper, chairman of the Israeli Manufacturer's Association, said
yesterday the 8 per cent inflation target was unrealistic and would defeat
the government's main aims of stimulating growth and fighting an
unemployment rate of more than 10 per cent.
'There will be a negative impact on investment, on the rate of exchange and
therefore on exports,' he said. 'We are going to lose the momentum of growth
and not gain anything.'
Mr Proper also hit out at Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel,
saying: 'The problem is that the Bank of Israel wants to show independence
at the expense of the economy.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's treasurer Mr Ralph Willis yesterday delivered a budget for the
1994-95 financial year which drew heavily on Australia's recent surge in
economic growth and expected about ADollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.15bn)-worth of
asset sale proceeds.
Financial markets were watching to see what economic assumptions the
government used to underpin its forecasts. In the event, Mr Willis took a
fairly generous, by no means outlandish tack, suggesting GDP would grow 4.5
per cent in 1994-95, against 4 per cent in the current financial year.
Employment, he suggested, would increase about 3 per cent, roughly in line
with market expectations, while unemployment should drop to about 9.5 per
cent by June 1995, against 10.3 per cent at present. Inflation should
average 2.25 per cent in 1994-95.
The budget predicted the government deficit for the current financial year
would be ADollars 13.6bn, ADollars 2.4bn less than originally forecast; next
year's deficit should roll out at ADollars 11.7bn (2.5 per cent of GDP).
The government believes it is still on course to have the deficit down to 1
per cent of GDP by 1996-97: Mr Willis said the figure should now come in at
0.9 per cent, with Australia moving into surplus shortly after that.
He also predicted business investment, which has lagged in the current
recovery, would grow 14.5 per cent next year. Such an upsurge could affect
imports, but the current account deficit should increase 'only slightly'.
The government's main new spending programme (the ADollars 6.5bn jobs
package) was outlined in a White Paper last week. Among the few new other
expenditure items was the ADollars 1.5bn 'land fund' for Aborigines who do
not benefit directly from the new Native Title legislation, although the
contributions will be spread over 10 years. Mr Willis also unveiled some
significant increases in health spending.
On the income side, the government plans to raise more than ADollars 2.4bn
from asset sales, notably the disposal of its remaining 75 per cent in
Qantas, the Australian airline. But in general, it hopes the higher tax
revenues stemming from the economic recovery, and a tightening of tax
recoveries, will fund expenditure measures and keep the deficit reduction
strategy on track. Earlier fears that there would be either a jobs levy or
an increase in the Medicare levy were not borne out.
Ms Cheryl Kernot, leader of the Australian Democrats (one of the minor
parties holding balance of power in the Senate) describing the budget as a
'tread water' one drafted with a view to the next election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France has redoubled its promises to try to win the Algerian government an
increase in new international aid and a decrease in the burden of repaying
old aid, amid new evidence that France is being used as a conduit for arms
to anti-government rebels in Algeria.
Mr Ahmed Benbitour, Algerian finance minister, met his French counterpart,
Mr Edmond Alphandery, this week to discuss the preparation of Algeria's
formal agreement with the International Monetary Fund, next week's
discussion by European Union finance ministers of the unblocking of a
Ecu150m (Pounds 115m) loan by the EU to Algeria, and the Paris Club meeting
of Algeria's official creditors in late May or early June.
Mr Alphandery told Mr Benbitour that, once it settles debt-relief terms with
the Paris Club, Algeria will get new bilateral aid from France, probably
equivalent to the FFr6bn (Pounds 697m) credit Paris granted last year.
The French finance minister has written to other members of the Group of
Seven, asking them, especially the US and Japan, to give Algeria maximum
debt relief. Algeria is said to want to reduce by Dollars 4bn (Pounds 1.9bn)
its 1994 debt service bill of Dollars 9.5bn.
The anti-terrorist unit of the French police yesterday took custody of an
Algerian arrested last Friday in eastern France.
He was said to have with him an arsenal of weapons in his car, including,
apparently, 129 sticks of explosive, 99 detonators, 5,000 rounds of
ammunition, three automatic pistols, one assault rifle, night-sights and
walkie-talkies.
He was suspected of smuggling the arms from Germany to Algeria, probably to
Islamic militants there.
But so far the French interior ministry remains convinced that the Islamic
Salvation Front's hold over the large Algerian community is relatively
slight.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Reserve Bank of India is set to move against soaring inflationary
pressures at its board meeting this Saturday.
But with industry only beginning to recover from two years' stagnation, Mr
C. Rangarajan, the governor, and his colleagues will be reluctant to clamp
down on the supply of funds to business.
'The RBI is in a difficult position. It is worried about inflation and lack
of private investment in the economy,' says Mr SL Rao, director of the
National Council for Applied Economic Research, an independent think-tank.
Figures this week show the inflation rate has risen to its highest level
since July 1992, with the wholesale price index for the week ending April 16
showing an annual increase of 11.1 per cent. Prices have been pushed up by
financial pressures and shortages in specific commodities, caused by poor
harvests.
The main financial pressure has been increased borrowing by the government
which saw the fiscal deficit for the year ending in March rise to 7.3 per
cent of GDP, against a target of 4.7 per cent. The target for the current
year is 6 per cent. Inflationary effects have been compounded by the large
inflow of foreign capital into India's financial markets, helping to take
foreign exchange reserves to a record Dollars 16bn (Pounds 7.6bn).
Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, said last week he expected the
inflation rate to fall after the next three months, because the current rate
of increase has been influenced by a round of rises in
government-administered prices for fuel and other commodities early this
year.
Inflationary pressures tend to ease in the autumn, when crops are harvested
in many regions.
The authorities are under pressure from industry to keep down the cost of
credit. Latest figures for industrial production at first glance appear to
show strong advances, with a year-on-year rise of 6.7 per cent recorded in
December; preliminary estimates indicate gains of 7.2 per cent and 7.6 per
cent in January and February.
But these figures, which follow marginal gains of 2 per cent or less in
earlier months, exaggerate the improvement, because industry was hit by
unrest following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in the same months in
1992-93. There was an underlying gain in output, but it was more modest.
One factor complicating the RBI's discussions is that demand for credit has
been generally weak. Large companies have been raising capital in domestic
and international markets and using it, not for new investments, but for
paying off expensive loans. The banking system is awash with excess
liquidity.
A tightening of credit policy, through an increase in interest rates or
curbs on loans, may have little effect. The central bank's other main option
is to increase the cash reserve ratio. The RBI board usually sets credit
policy in six-month cycles. But because of delays in forming the present
board, this week's meeting - for the period up to the end of September - is
being held late.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata yesterday appealed for opposition
support to help his minority government tackle the host of urgent issues
ahead.
In his first policy speech, Mr Hata asked for co-operation in completing the
political reforms agreed in January, passing a budget for the current year,
reforming the tax system and in defusing trade tensions with the US. But the
two main opposition groups, the Liberal Democratic party and Social
Democratic party, were unimpressed.
Mr Hata's speech was 'void of substance', Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, former LDP
prime minister, said. Both parties are considering a no-confidence motion
soon after the budget is passed by the end of June.
Mr Hata apologised to neighbouring countries for the offence created by the
former justice minister's denial of an infamous wartime massacre. 'It is
regrettable such a situation arose,' he said.
'Japan's wartime aggression and colonial rule caused unbearable suffering
and sorrow for many people.'
Despite the unpromising outlook for his government, Mr Hata promised to
continue business as normally as possible. His administration would use
'plain language,' listen 'even more attentively to the opinions of both
ruling and opposition parties' and seek 'as wide an agreement as possible'.
The prime minister laid out a busy agenda, sticking to the policy accord
agreed by the coalition before the SDP's walk-out three weeks ago. He
planned 'as soon as possible' to enact a bill to redraw Japan's electoral
boundaries, the final stage of the switch from the current multi-seat
constituency system, blamed for fostering corruption, to a mix of single
seats and proportional representation.
The aim was to hold the next general election under the new system, likely
to be in place by late autumn. This could be optimistic, given the growing
pressure among SDP politicians for an early election under the existing
system, on the grounds the party might do better than under the new rules.
It is unclear, however, whether the Liberal Democratic party, the largest
opposition group, would similarly benefit. The SDP would need LDP help to
vote the government down.
Mr Hata said his administration aimed to produce draft tax reform plans in
June, the main point of which will be a cut in income tax, seen as essential
to stimulate the economy, and a rise in indirect taxes, anathema to the SDP.
Legislation is planned by the end of the year.
On trade, Mr Hata would strive to re-open economic framework talks with the
US, stalled since February. 'It is important to make efforts. . . toachieve
a phased reduction of the current account surplus,' including deregulation
and measures to stimulate domestic demand.
The cornerstone of foreign policy would continue to be the security treaty
with the US. Japan could no longer be a mere onlooker in international
affairs, Mr Hata added.
Mr Hata said Japan would continue to try to persuade North Korea, through
dialogue, to open all its suspected nuclear sites to international
inspection, but would respect any United Nations decision, a reference to
possible sanctions.

A journalist from a German satirical magazine has cut off fugitive
real-estate tycoon Juergen Schneider from one source of cash - by ringing up
Schneider's credit card company and cancelling his account. The magazine
Titanic said journalist Bernd Fritz had telephoned the Eurocard company and
blocked the account by giving Schneider's name and date of birth. Mr Detlev
Buchal, Eurocard's managing director, said it was not easy to block an
account. Mr Fritz had given Schneider's date of birth, address, bank account
and private and office telephone numbers. Mr Fritz said he had just named a
bank at random. Eurocard said the name of the bank had in fact been correct.
Titanic said it planned to build on the Schneider experience by blocking
accounts of other prominent politicians and businessmen. Mr Schneider
disappeared over a month ago, leaving his property empire to file for
bankruptcy with DM5bn debts.

Iraq has agreed to repay a Dollars 1.5bn debt to Bulgaria, mostly with oil
supplies, after the United Nations embargo is lifted, Bulgaria said
yesterday. The debt was run up under the old communist regime when Bulgaria,
like other countries in eastern Europe, supplied Iraq with arms and other
goods on credit during the war with Iran. Under an agreement signed in 1990,
Iraq was to cover part of its debt by supplying Bulgaria with 4.75m tonnes
of oil by 1994 but the invasion interrupted the deal.

The United Nations yesterday said Bosnian Serb forces were flouting terms of
a UN 'safe area' accord in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde and warned them not
to test UN/Nato resolve. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi had written to
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to try to reverse 'a deterioration' of
conditions inside Gorazde's 20km weapons exclusion zone, a UN spokesman
said. Foreign ministers of major western powers and Russia will meet in
Geneva on Friday to discuss new peace moves for Bosnia but there seems
little hope they will find a quick way to end the war, diplomats in Geneva
said yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats are close to a
compromise agreement to allow former landowners in eastern Germany the right
to buy back some of their property in the five eastern states. The agreement
would end a bitter dispute within the CDU's ranks and pave the way for
investment and restructuring of agriculture in eastern Germany. Under the
terms of the compromise reached this week between eastern and western German
CDU parliamentary deputies, former landowners will be eligible to buy back,
at reduced price, some of their property. It is estimated that only 1,000 of
the 14,000 former owners will take advantage of this compromise. Until now,
the 1990 unification treaty had legally barred former owners whose property
was expropriated by the Soviet authorities between 1945 and 1949 from any
restitution or compensation. At the same time, the CDU is planning to
increase from about DM12bn to DM19bn a compensation fund for people whose
property was confiscated between 1933 and 1945 and between 1949 and 1990.

<TEXT>
A row between German ministries could delay any decision today on unilateral
action to ban British beef imports because of popular German fears about
human infection with 'mad cow disease'. The German health ministry insisted
yesterday that it was pressing its case for an import ban on public health
grounds, but other officials suggested the issue might be postponed pending
further negotiations in Brussels. The foreign ministry, economics ministry
and agriculture ministry have all expressed doubts over the practicability
of introducing a unilateral ban on British beef imports, and over its
political and legal consequences. One senior diplomat said the only way of
stopping British beef imports - which total no more than 2,500 tonnes a year
 -would be 'to close the Channel.' The German farmers' union has also argued
that it would be impossible to control. A health ministry official said
yesterday that veterinary experts from the 16 federal states had agreed
unanimously that the ban - on all cattle over three years old - could be
enforced.

<TEXT>
Anti-corruption magistrates in Rome have requested that 16 senior members of
the court of public accounts, the 132-year-old judicial body monitoring
public spending, be sent for trial on a string of charges related to abuse
of office and falsifying documents. The charges involve Mr Giuseppe Carbone,
the court's chairman, and Mr Emidio Di Giambattista, the chief prosecutor,
and relate to allegations of tampering with evidence in some of the most
sensitive financial scandals of recent years. Mr Carbone has claimed the
accusations are designed to discredit the operations of the court or relate
to investigations that have already been shelved.
The investigations began more than five years ago when two magistrates
renowned for their zeal spoke out in the court, saying they were being
forcibly transferred in order to stifle an investigation. An equiry was
opened only to be quietly shelved. The cases allegedly tampered with
included investigations into the conduct of the state-run railways in the
1980s, when controlled by Mr Lodovico Ligato (assassinated in 1989), and the
Enimont affair. to pronounce on the price being paid by ENI, the state oil
concern, for its purchase of the stake held by Ferruzzi-Montedison in their
joint chemicals venture, Enimont. The court said the price was fair even
though the market claimed it was 20 per cent higher than necessary.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Berlusconi picks a safe economic team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The economic team in the new Italian government led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi
has been the one area where all parties in the Freedom Alliance coalition
have found common ground.
This is less because the various members of the Alliance have identical
ideas on economic policy. Rather they were agreed on the type of
qualifications necessary for the three posts of the Treasury, finance
ministry and budget ministry.
Mr Berlusconi, as prime minister designate, found himself short of
experienced politicians in his own camp capable of handling these technical
portfolios. He also ran up against considerable reluctance among some of the
better known economists to enter a government that contained members of the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance.
He could have chosen his own economic adviser, Mr Antonio Martino, a
Chicago-trained economist teaching at the private Luiss University in Rome
and a committed free-marketeer. But Mr Berlusconi early on chose to place
him at the foreign ministry. Mr Berlusconi also approached Mr Piero
Barrucci, the outgoing minister, to stay on but the offer was turned down.
This left the field open for the top job of Treasury minister to Mr Lamberto
Dini, the 63-year-old director general of the Bank of Italy, with whom the
media magnate has been friendly for some time. The League initially raised
objections, claiming Mr Dini was too close to the discredited former
Christian Democrats. But these objections faded with the lack of a clear
alternative.
Mr Dini is well known internationally, having spent long years in the
International Monetary Fund. He is widely respected as having solid grasp of
both domestic and international monetary and financial issues, and is a
member of the European Union's monetary committee. Thus his appointment is a
clear signal to the financial markets that the new government will pursue a
sound economic policy, respecting the need to maintain tight budgetary
discipline.
By giving the main economic job to a non-politician in what is a political
cabinet - unlike the previous Amato and Ciampi governments - Mr Berlusconi
had to balance this with a politician in one of the other posts. With the
populist Northern League clamouring for recognition and sharing his
commitment to the free market, Mr Berlusconi has chosen Mr Giancarlo
Pagliarini, a League senator and a prominent accountant, as budget minister.
Mr Pagliarini, on the previous Senate's budget commission, is brimming with
energy and a fervent believer in deregulation and privatisation. The League
normally demands iron loyalty from its members and this may make it
difficult for him on occasions. But the League recognise him as their sole
expert on the economy and this should given him some margin of manoeuvre.
The difficulty of finding a finance minister from among the main Freedom
Alliance partners, led to the choice of Mr Giulio Tremonti, a former
Socialist tax expert who has just broken from the centrist Italian Pact of
Mr Mario Segni.
The major question now is whether Mr Dini will be treated by Mr Berlusconi
as a technician or as a key member of the cabinet taking the political
responsibility for economic policy. A secondary but important issue is the
fate of the team of Treasury officials built up over the past two years
under Mr Mario Draghi, the director-general. They have handled much of the
privatisation and also deal with all debt matters.
In private some at the Treasury have let it be known that they would find it
difficult to work with Mr Dini. At the same time members of the League and
the MSI have voiced concern at the power concentrated in Mr Draghi's hands.
However, Mr Dini would find it difficult to rebuild a new team quickly, and
Mr Berlusconi is anxious to move fast in the first 100 days.
Mr Dini's departure from the Bank of Italy also creates a potentially
awkward situation at the central bank both in terms of his replacement and
on the question of the institution's political independence. There is
already a precedent of former governor Guido Carli being Treasury minister.
But Mr Dini will now have to deal with Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank governor,
on policy issues when the two may not see eye to eye.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Tory Euro-debate echoed on Continent: Other parties have
doubts but none flirt with ideas of a withdrawal from European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ruling British Conservative party's dance of death over Europe is being
watched with a mixture of bemusement and trepidation inside the European
Union.
Experienced diplomats in Brussels find it hard to fathom the
self-destructive streak inside the Tory party; but there is a grudging
admission that, however distorted the British debate on the pace of European
integration, there are echoes on the Continent.
Whether these echoes portend a profound constitutional debate on the future
of Europe remains an open question; but the evidence suggests that the UK
Euro-sceptics are far from isolated.
In Italy, the new Berlusconi government unveiled last night included Mr
Antonio Martino, a Chicago school economist and prominent opponent of a
single European currency, as foreign minister.
In France, the Balladur government has bashed 'Brussels' ever since it came
to power last year. Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission,
complained this week that his fellow Socialists were deliberately ignoring
Europe's successes in the Euro-parliamentary election campaign.
In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has chosen to fight an election campaign
on a theme of more, not less Europe; but the jury is out on whether this
pro-European message will deliver a winning hand.
Yet it is important to stress that none of the mainstream parties or
political figures in Europe have veered so far as the Tory Euro-sceptics in
flirting with withdrawal from the European Union.
Nor has there been a call for a referendum on a single European currency, or
a plebiscite on the outcome of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to
review the Maastricht treaty.
Reluctance to embrace the idea of a referendum is linked to the painful
process of securing ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
When the Danes rejected Maastricht two years ago, the crisis was compounded
by the wafer-thin support in the French referendum three months later. 'The
lesson from France and Denmark is that people do not vote on the question of
a complicated international treaty, they vote on something else.'
In Brussels, the right-wing Tory campaign for a referendum on a single
currency looks like tilting at windmills. Even ardent supporters of European
monetary union concede that the prospects for EMU being achieved by the
first target date of 1997 look remote - though that does not mean that the
goal has been abandoned.
Similarly, British calls for a referendum on the results of the 1996
intergovernmental conference reviewing the Maastricht treaty look premature
 -the result of factional party infighting rather than a calculation of
vital British national interest.
'How can you support a referendum on a conference where the outcome is
completely unknown?' said one senior Eurocrat in Brussels yesterday.
A senior German official warned, however, that if Tory Euro-sceptics
continue to drive British policy on Europe, the 1996 conference would be a
write-off. That would upset plans to deepen co-operation on immigration,
crime and justice affairs, and it would make it much more difficult to plan
for the admission of the central and East Europeans - both of which are
Anglo-German priorities.
Moreover, debate in the UK appears to assume that 1996 will be a 'Big Bang'
conference which will deepen integration. Yet in Europe, senior French and
German diplomats make no such assumption. 'The public is simply not ready,'
said a French official.
Lastly, neither the pro- nor anti-Europeans appear to have taken sufficient
note of US views on the desirability of European integration. These were
expounded by Mr Raymond Seitz, outgoing US ambassador to the Court of St
James.
Mr Seitz, a noted Anglophile, made clear that the US wants the UK fully
involved in Europe. He offered little hope of Britain standing on the
margins dreaming about a special relationship with the US or even membership
of the Nafta free trade accord.
Characteristically, his farewell speech received little attention in the
British media.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's inflation falls below 1%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's inflation rate continued its fall from a March 1987 peak of 10.4
per cent a year to reach a new low of 0.9 per cent in April 1994. The
consumer price index rose by only 0.1 per cent in April from March and 0.9
per cent from April last year, according to the central statistics bureau.
The 0.1 per cent rise in consumer prices in April followed an 0.5 per cent
gain in March, the bureau said.
The Spanish government achieved its best budgetary performance this decade,
narrowing the deficit by a provisional 20 per cent to an accumulated
Pta599bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the first four months of 1994. This compares with
Pta744bn in the same period of 1993 and follows a surprise surplus of around
Pta14bn in April, the Finance Ministry announced yesterday.
The Bundesbank yesterday revised German M3 money supply growth through March
to a seasonally adjusted and annualised 15.4 per cent rate from the
preliminary 15.2 per cent rate reported last month.
The National Bank of Poland lowered its obligatory rate at reverse
repurchase auctions by 0.5 percentage points to 26.5 per cent for one day
deals. This signals that official interest rates will be cut, a senior
banker said yesterday.
French industrialists expect an increase in investment this year of 3 per
cent in value terms following a 15 per cent drop in 1993, the National
Statistics Institute said yesterday.

Norway's minority Labour government faces a vote of confidence this month
over its appointment last August of Mr Torstein Moland as governor of the
Bank of Norway. The 32-seat anti-EC agrarian Centre party said it would
table the confidence motion in parliament on May 24 and was willing to form
a new government should it gather enough support in the 165-seat parliament
to unseat Labour. Mr Moland, a former state secretary with an earlier Labour
government, took up his Bank of Norway post on January 1 but became
entangled in a tax controversy. Yesterday, majority support for the
confidence motion was far from certain though extremely close. To muster the
83-vote majority, backing is needed from the Socialist Left (SV) party's 13
members and four ex-members of the Progress party which were expected to
meet last night to decide their stand. The SV party in February called for
Mr Moland's resignation, saying his authority had been undermined. Karen

Several leading German economic research institutes yesterday warned against
any further credits to Russia, saying economic collapse there was
accelerating, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Three leading think-tanks said in a report commissioned by the German
government that despite some progress the Russian reform process was not
working. Far-reaching structural changes in the country's economy were
needed, they said.
'Given the causes of the acceleration of the economic slowdown it appears
ill advised at the moment to put new financial means at Russia's disposal,'
said the report, from Berlin's DIW, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy
and the Halle institute. They said a complete collapse of industrial
production in Russia was possible and that mass unemployment was inevitable.
They advised the Russian government to scrap its current credit system and
to reduce subsidies. They recommended a 'realistic wage policy and the
closing of resource-wasting, loss-making businesses'. Germany has supplied
more than half of all western aid to the former Soviet Union but has
recently refused to give more export credits until Russia improves its
investor and trade protection laws.
Separately, however, the eastern Europe committee of the Federation of
German Industry (BDI) said it expected a further improvement in trade
between Russia and Germany if Moscow continued to invest in key sectors of
industry.
It said German imports from Russia had totalled DM10.7bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in
1993 and imports to Russia were DM11.4bn. 'Against the background of the
unfavourable economic developments in Russia in 1993 - a fall in GDP of 12
per cent, a 16 per cent decline in industrial production, inflation rates of
800 to 1,000 per cent - this development is encouraging,' the BDI said.
Declines in petrochemical, oil and gas production in Russia had not shown up
strongly so far in trade figures with Germany.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Catalan chief names price for Gonzalez

Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan leader, wants 'substantial agreements' on
economic, labour and regional policies as a condition for continuing to prop
up Spain's minority Socialist government.
In an interview, he expressed confidence in the determination of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez's embattled government to tackle corruption. But he warned that if
it failed to take effective action 'we will have to withdraw our support'.
Mr Pujol is the guarantor of the government's survival as Mr Gonzalez tries
to overcome a serious crisis brought about by a succession of corruption
scandals involving members of his administration, including a former central
bank governor and a former head of the Civil Guard.
Mr Pujol, who is president of Catalonia's regional government and of the
Catalan nationalist party, Convergencia i Unio, took a calculated gamble
last week by reaffirming his backing for Mr Gonzalez in the midst of the
political crisis.
As long as his party's 17 deputies vote with the socialists, Mr Gonzalez is
assured of a narrow majority in the 350-member parliament. Mr Gonzalez also
received a pledge of support from the Basque Nationalist party, which is
similarly conservative in its economic views and has five seats.
Mr Pujol set out four priorities:
Further measures to support industry and exports, through tax policies. This
would include backing for research and development and special assistance
for small and medium-sized companies;
Labour deregulation. Mr Pujol left open the question of whether additional
measures would be needed after the government's current package of labour
reforms, due to be implemented shortly. 'We have to see how it works in
practice,' he said.
Transfers to Catalonia. Mr Pujol said he did not want to re-negotiate the
agreement reached last year under which 15 per cent of the income tax
normally raised by the central government in Catalonia is remitted directly
to the Catalan regional government. But he had specific demands on
arrangements for financing the region's health system and the building-up of
its own police force.
Stemming corruption. Mr Pujol said he had demanded that the government 'do
everything to control corruption', and added: 'I think it is doing it.'
He made clear that despite his renewed support for the government he would
not consider joining a coalition. Mr Gonzalez said last week that a
coalition - such as he tried to form after last year's general election -
would provide more stability than a parliamentary pact. However, Mr Pujol
said that being part of the government would leave his party with 'no
capacity for manoeuvre'.
'The truth is that we can be more useful outside the government than inside
it,' he said.
He would not set any time-frame for his alliance with the socialists.
The two parties will confront each other in municipal elections next spring
and in elections for the Catalan regional government in 1996.
'In two years we do not know what will happen,' Mr Pujol said.
Mr Gonzalez has, meanwhile, secured backing from his party to place one of
his moderate allies, Mr Joaquin Almunia, as its new parliamentary leader,
replacing the former economy minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, who resigned last
week.
Mr Almunia was labour and civil service minister in previous Socialist
governments.

<TEXT>
Zil, Russia's ailing truck manufacturer, said yesterday it had reopened
after a 10-day stoppage and much political furore over its troubles.
Executives at Zil, a Moscow-based enterprise with an old-style management
and 85,000 employees, said they proposed to reverse the company's fortunes
by focusing on recovering money from its debtors in the former Soviet Union,
and expanding its range of vehicles.
They also said Zil would take long-overdue steps to trim its work force.
Rather than begin painful restructuring and lower their prices to attract
customers, many enterprises, including Zil, have so far successfully put
pressure on the government to give them soft loans by threatening to close
down.
As part of the lobbying process, various ministries have issued dire
warnings of imminent closures and mass lay-offs, even if it is exactly such
results that the government has sought to achieve.
One illustration of continuing extravagance at Zil is provided by the fact
that it still runs one of the best hospitals in Moscow.
A recent patient was Mr Anders Aslund, a Swedish adviser to Russian radical
ministers who were forced out of office last winter. Mr Aslund had long
advocated bankruptcy proceedings for poorly-performing companies such as
Zil. Zil had earlier insisted that it needed cheap credits to reopen but
these were not mentioned by its executives yesterday.
However, Professor Yevgeny Yasin, the newly-named economic adviser to
President Boris Yeltsin, told the Financial Times that Zil had managed to
secure financial support from the Moscow mayor's office.
Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor, is fundamentally opposed to the radical
restructuring and privatisation policies pursued by the government.
It was not clear yesterday how the Moscow city authorities, who frequently
complain that the city is bankrupt, had managed to find money for Zil, but
the mayor was clearly unhappy at the prospect of the closure of such a large
industrial enterprise on his doorstep.
Prof Yasin stressed that the Russian government could not have afforded to
help Zil out. Zil was an exceptional beneficiary because the Russian
government, unlike the Moscow authorities, could not afford such help for
other troubled flagships of the former Soviet industrial machine.
He also distanced himself from comments by a less senior presidential aide,
Mr Alexander Livshits, who last week called for new financial injections
into ailing enterprises to 'compensate' for the government's tight money
policy and to prevent mass unemployment.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Russian defence spending to surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin, seeking to broaden his political support, has
agreed to a 66 per cent increase in this year's defence budget in the
biggest deviation yet from recent Russian fiscal commitments to the
International Monetary Fund, according to a senior parliamentarian.
A member of the lower house of parliament's defence committee told reporters
yesterday that the offices of Mr Yeltsin and the prime minister, Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, had agreed to increase defence spending from Rbs33trillion to
Rbs55trillion in the 1994 budget.
The increase appears to be part of efforts by the government to convince
parliament to finally adopt a budget when it returns to the issue today.
Mr Yeltsin appears keen to boost his domestic popularity and develop a
working relationship with the conservative parliament he ushered in with
elections and a new constitution last December.
But the increase in defence spending, if implemented, will run counter to
the spirit of the recent pledges of fiscal rectitude made by Moscow to the
IMF in return for release of the second half of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn)
reconstruction loan.
'If he cannot hold back the defence spending, Chernomyrdin will suffer a big
blow to his credibility,' said Professor Anders Aslund, a former economic
adviser to the Russian government.
Mr Chernomyrdin led the final round of loan negotiations with the IMF two
months ago.
The parliamentarian, who declined to be identified, said the new defence
figure was agreed during last week's parliamentary recess.
It had initially been negotiated between the president's national security
adviser and the defence and interior ministries.
The increase followed an appeal last week by Mr Alexander Livshits, an
economic aide to the president, for increased spending on defence factories
and research institutes.
Mr Livshits said this was necessary to 'compensate' for the government's
failure to implement a policy of selective support for strategic factories
and sectors.
He also sought to prepare the ground for such increases by calling on the
international community to react with understanding to Russia's inability to
keep promises on inflation and budget targets made to the IMF.
Mr Chernomyrdin had vowed to the IMF earlier this year that he would stick
to a tight money policy to drive down inflation, even if it meant
bankruptcies of enterprises which were a drain on the rest of the economy.
Accordingly, he sent a memorandum to the IMF setting the 1994 budget deficit
at Rbs53trillion - which, according to IMF officials, amounts, together with
local budget deficits, to 8 per cent of GDP.
But last month the government agreed to further increases in agricultural
subsidies which increased the deficit to Rbs68.8trillion. Unless cuts are
made elsewhere in the budget, the new defence spending - much of it likely
to be spent on new orders or subsidies to ailing defence plants - will
increase the deficit to Rbs80trillion.
It is not clear how the IMF, which is due to consider further loans to
Russia later this year, will react should the budget begin to diverge far
from its promised target.
'We cannot control the government on a day to day basis,' said one western
official. 'At the end of the day, it is up to them to deliver as best at
they are able to. The IMF can always give them absolution but then there is
the day of reckoning, and that is without appeal,' he said, referring to the
potential damage of putting off economic adjustment for very much longer.

FT  11 MAY 94 / EU curbs urged on cash card issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bank governors yesterday advised EU governments to prevent companies
other than banks from issuing electronic cards which can be used as a
substitute for cash. They said that this would help to protect consumers.
The European Monetary Institute council approved a study which called for
only authorised credit institutions to be allowed to issue pre-paid cards.
Banks hope that such cards may eventually take the place of notes and coins.
Several European banks and credit card issuers are working on schemes for
multi-purpose cash cards which consumers could load with money
electronically. They would then use the cards for small transactions in
shops and retail outlets.
The report by the EMI's working group on EU payments systems is the first
central bank response to the growth in schemes such as the Mondex initiative
launched by National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank and British Telecom. It
said that central banks would have to monitor the fraud prevention measures,
and might have to act if these were not satisfactory.
Some EU states already have laws preventing companies which are not licensed
credit institutions from issuing cash cards. However, an amendment to EU
legislation might be required to ensure that this policy applied in all
countries.
Although telecom companies and others now issue cards with cash values for
limited uses, the central banks' proposals would only apply to 'multi-use'
cards which are intended as a near-perfect substitute for cash.
Banks in EU countries including Portugal, Denmark, Belgium and France are
working on multi-use cash cards. Banks believe they could save substantial
amounts if they were adopted by consumers because they would have to handle
less cash.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Mandela takes the reins of power: Ceremony ends 300 years of
white rule in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PRETORIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
White South Africans handed over power to blacks, voluntarily and
peacefully, yesterday when Mr Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president in a
ceremony which formally ended more than three centuries of white rule.
The reality of the transfer of power struck home when jets from the most
powerful military machine on the continent paid homage to Africa's newest
head of state.
White South African generals joined black guerrilla leaders to escort their
new president to the podium to take the oath of office, signalling an
overnight shift in allegiance to the man they once hunted for terrorism.
As princes and kings, prime ministers and presidents from more than 140
countries listened, Mr Mandela (pictured above) pledged his own allegiance
to the South African state he once sought to overthrow.
'I do hereby swear to be faithful to the republic of South Africa and do
solemnly and sincerely promise to promote that which will advance and to
oppose all that may harm the republic . . . and to devote myself to the
well-being of the republic and all its people.'
As blacks struggled to sing Die Stem (The Voice), once the anthem of
apartheid, white South Africans haltingly sang the words of Nkosi sikele
i'Afrika (God bless Africa), the liberation hymn. Both are now official
anthems. Mr Mandela praised the man who opened the chapter which closed with
yesterday's ceremony - Mr FW de Klerk, the outgoing president and yesterday
installed as Mr Mandela's second deputy president.
'He has made for himself a niche in history. He has turned out to be one of
the greatest reformers, one of the greatest sons of our soil,' said Mr
Mandela, speaking from a giant bulletproof cage, where he stood flanked by
Mr de Klerk and first deputy president Mr Thabo Mbeki.
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, shared the fourth row of the
impressive Union Buildings amphitheatre with US vice-president Al Gore, his
wife Tipper and Mrs Hillary Clinton. Cuban president Fidel Castro, Palestine
Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat, Israeli president Ezer Weizman
and United Nations secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali were also in the
crowd.
Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini was moved to a place directly in front of Mr
Mandela when ANC officials realised they had failed to accord the monarch a
central seat.
After the ceremony, President Mandela treated thousands of guests to lunch
before dropping in, by helicopter, to a celebratory soccer match between
South Africa and Zambia, home to the ANC in exile.
Back at the Union Buildings, even the policemen and soldiers began to relax
and join in; military policeman stuck new South African flags in their gun
holsters and a soldier read a comic book atop an armoured car. They were,
for one day at least, Mr Mandela's 'rainbow people'.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Bank warns on interest rates and inflation: Concern at
increase in average earnings and monetary growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England warned yesterday that it would increase interest rates
if expectations of higher inflation led to a quickening in the pace of wage
and price rises.
In its latest quarterly inflation report, however, it said the most likely
outcome, assuming bank base rates stay at 5.25 per cent, would be for
underlying inflation to be between 3 and 3.5 per cent in two years' time,
within the government's target range of 1-4 per cent.
The bank believes underlying inflation, which is measured by excluding
mortgage interest payments from the retail prices index, will be slightly
higher in April, May and June than the 2.4 per cent rate in March.
Inflation fell in the first three months of this year because of a squeeze
on retail margins but is set to rise because of council tax changes and the
imposition of value added tax on fuel, both of which took effect in April.
Over 1994 as a whole, the bank expects inflation to be slightly lower than
projected in its February inflation report. But the bank revised upwards its
forecast of inflation next year. It now expects the rate to be flat rather
than move gently downwards.
The bank has revised its expectations of inflation because of two factors:
February's quarter-point cut in bank base rates and a faster than expected
increase in average earnings.
'If these (labour cost) pressures are maintained, this could translate into
higher inflation next year,' the bank warned.
The bank pinpoints three 'small early warning signs': Rates of monetary
growth have continued to increase. Although this is not a threat to the
inflation target at the moment, a continued increase in the months ahead
would have 'more disturbing' implications.
Inflation expectations have risen and are no longer coming down into line
with the target.
Average earnings growth accelerated to 3.5 per cent in February from 3 per
cent in November and may have been higher in March.
The bank is worried that higher inflation expectations will trigger higher
wage settlements. It said pay developments 'will need to be monitored
closely' and urged 'adherence to a firm monetary stance' to reinforce the
'fragile' credibility of Britain's inflation target.
The bank's report leaves the clear impression that it regards the February
cut in base rates as a mistake. 'The rise in gilt yields after that
announcement suggested that the market was revising its view of the
authorities' commitment to monetary stability,' it said.
Responding to the bank's report, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, last night told Channel 4 News he was 'determined to hit the
inflation target' and have economic growth that lasts.

FT  11 MAY 94 / CrossRail rejection leaves BR plans in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail's ambitious plans for improved transport links in London were
in disarray last night after the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project was blocked by
a Commons committee.
The small private bill committee decided by three votes to one that the
proposed tunnel linking Paddington and Liverpool Street main line stations
could not be justified. The decision is a severe embarrassment to Mr John
Major, who over-ruled earlier claims by Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief
secretary, that the project was not justified.
Mr Tony Marlow, the Conservative chairman of the committee, gave no reasons
for the decision, which ends months of uncertainty about the project.
However, the committee is believed to have been convinced by an engineering
consultancy report which said demand would not be enough until 2010.
Ministers had become increasingly concerned about the project's prospects
during the CrossRail committee hearings, held under the quasi-judicial
private bill procedure used for infrastructure projects which could damage
property rights.
Worries that the project might be blocked mounted as the two Conservative
and two Labour MPs on the committee put increasingly sceptical questions to
expert witnesses called by BR, Railtrack and London Underground, the joint
promoters.
Transport department officials are believed to have started talks with the
promoters several weeks ago on ways of rescuing the project if the MPs used
their judicial powers to stop it. The talks are believed to focus on
improving links between the tunnel under London and the proposed Heathrow
Express and Channel Tunnel high-speed line services. But a substantial delay
is inevitable because the government will be forced to introduce a fresh
enabling bill, starting the parliamentary process from scratch.
Mr Steven Norris, the minister for transport in London, said the committee's
decision was 'a blow'. But he added: 'It is not the end for CrossRail. The
project is certainly not dead.'
Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of Railtrack, the railway infrastructure
company, said it would 'continue to develop the scheme, concentrating on
(linking) Heathrow with the heart of London and beyond to East London and
Essex'. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said CrossRail needed
'a proper connection' with the Channel tunnel rail link and Heathrow
Express.
Tower Hamlets borough council, in East London, which led opposition to the
project, asked the committee to force the promoters to pay most of its
costs. It said the promoters had 'unreasonably' withheld evidence until near
the end of the 30-day committee hearing.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Major rejects Tory demands for referendum on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday rejected calls from Conservative Euro-sceptics to
commit his government now to a referendum on the next stage of European
integration.
But he sought to defuse Tory party tensions ahead of next month's European
elections by insisting he would adopt a tough stance against further
integration at the 1996 intergovernmental conference.
With his leadership again under fire, Mr Major also underlined his
determination not to be driven from office. He told MPs: 'We received a
five-year mandate to carry out our policies. I intend to exercise that
five-year mandate.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will seek to repair damage caused by
the row when he outlines the key planks of the Conservatives' European
manifesto to the Scottish Tory conference later today.
Mr Hurd will stress that the underlying forces shaping Europe point to a
flexible, multi-speed union, in which Britain can feel entirely comfortable
 -rather than to the centralised and uniform entity feared by Tory
Euro-sceptics.
After two days of confusion and division in Tory ranks, Mr Major responded
to opposition attacks by refusing to promise a referendum on the outcome of
the 1996 conference.
He left open the possibility that a future government might take a different
view if there was a move to a single European currency. But Downing Street
stressed that the referendum issue was off the agenda for the foreseeable
future.
Despite an upsurge in support for the referendum idea as a potential device
to unite the Conservatives before the June 9 European poll, Mr Major
indicated there is no question of such a proposal appearing in the party's
manifesto.
He had not changed his mind since voicing vigorous opposition to a
referendum on the Maastricht treaty. He agreed with Sir Terence Higgins, a
senior backbench MP, that such votes were 'an alien concept inconsistent
with our system of representative parliamentary democracy'.
Pledging not to agree to any new arrangements in 1996 which were
unacceptable to the British parliament, Mr Major added: 'I don't believe the
question of a referendum arises now and it certainly doesn't need to be
decided now.'
He dismissed calls from Tory Euro-sceptics for a commitment to call a
referendum on a future single European currency but in a nod in their
direction refused to rule out a change of heart by a future parliament.
Pro-European Tories, who have campaigned against any referendum commitment,
expressed themselves satisfied with Mr Major's stance while the sceptics
claimed he had not closed the door entirely on their referendum demands.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, taunted Mr Major for presiding over a
'hopelessly divided' cabinet.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia rises to SKr1.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmacia, the Swedish drugs group being privatised next month, yesterday
announced a big jump in first-quarter profits, after benefiting from higher
sales and cost-cutting.
Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.33bn (Dollars 172m), compared
with SKr486m in the same 1993 period.
The result was better than expected, and the A shares rose SKr3 to SKr130.
Analysts said the figures should assist the privatisation process, with the
government planning to sell a 47.4 per cent voting stake in the group. The
disposal is expected to raise around SKr10bn in Sweden's biggest
privatisation.
Group turnover rose 3 per cent, to SKr6.78bn. However, on an underlying
basis the increase was 6 per cent. Operating costs fell 2 per cent to
SKr5.12bn from SKr5.22bn.
The group benefited from one-off gains of SKr183m, compared with costs of
SKr308m a year ago. This helped lift operating profit to SKr1.38bn from
SKr577m. Excluding one-off items, operating profits were 35 per cent higher
at SKr1.19bn.
Financial costs, linked mainly to the financing of the group's acquisition
of the Italian drugs group Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice), dragged the overall
figures down. Net financial expense amounted to SKr49m, compared with
financial income of SKr170m in the first quarter of 1993.
The results contained some disappointments. Sales of the growth hormone
Genotropin fell 4 per cent to SKr654m from SKr684m, as good sales in the UK,
German and Italian markets were offset by weakness in Spain and Australia.
Healon, a substance used in eye surgery, saw sales drop 6 per cent to
SKr369m from SKr393m. There were lower sales in the US, Spanish and Nordic
markets. By contrast, anti-cancer drugs Farmorubicin and Adriamycin lifted
sales by 18 per cent.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Havas expects return to growth
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Havas, the French media and leisure group recently embroiled in the battle
for control of the Canal-Plus television company, hopes this year to return
to profits growth after sustaining a fall during 1993, according to Mr
Pierre Dauzier, chairman.
The group, in the throes of reshuffling its shareholder structure, was
affected last year by the economic recession and net profits fell 14 per
cent to FFr708m (Dollars 121.44m) from FFr823m in the previous year.
However, Mr Dauzier told an analysts' meeting in Paris that Havas expects
this year to be able to maintain stable profits on a strictly comparable
basis and to achieve an increase in total profits through disposals and the
benefits of strategic agreements.
He said the group might be able to achieve a higher increase in profits
during 1994 if its markets improved.
Havas is reshuffling its shareholding. Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, its partner
in CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcasting group, recently acquired a 3.59
per cent stake.
Mr Dauzier also signalled that Generale des Eaux, the French utilities
group, might increase its recently acquired 2.5 per cent stake in Havas.

FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alitalia faces tough cuts
instead of subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A tough restructuring plan to cut mounting losses at Alitalia, the national
carrier, will be the first test of the Italian government's resolve to avoid
subsidising state companies and prepare them for privatisation.
The plan has yet to be made public but the three-month-old board of Alitalia
unveiled its broad aims this week.
These included 'a sizeable reduction' in the group's 18,000 personnel,
mainly among ground staff; more flexible employment for pilots and cabin
crew; better use of the fleet; and 'decisive action' on spending.
The outgoing Ciampi government approved plans for paying 800 early
retirement pensions as a means of shedding staff. But the new restructuring
plan appears to be much more radical than this.
The tone of some members of the Berlusconi government suggests considerable
hostility to the instrument of early retirement as a way of balancing the
books. If this is translated into action, Alitalia could face a similar
confrontation with unions as did Air France.
Unless measures are agreed quickly to cut Alitalia's losses, the company has
warned it will have to call a special shareholders' meeting and might have
to write down some capital.
During the first quarter of this year losses reached L190bn (Dollars
118.75m) against losses of L345bn for 1993 as a whole.
On Monday, a company statement blamed the figures on a combination of the
depressed state of international economies, airline overcapacity, a drop in
business travel and fierce fares competition.
Last year Alitalia made L791bn worth of investments of which L580bn went
towards five new aircraft and L146bn in equity interests. This also helped
push up the company's debt which rose from L694bn to L1,645bn in 1993.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Four shipping groups plan global pact

Four of the world's top 10 container groups yesterday announced plans for an
alliance linking Japan, China, Europe and North America, the globe's largest
trading blocs.
Mitsui OSK of Japan, Nedlloyd Lijnen of the Netherlands, American President
Lines of the US, and Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line, said they
had started negotiations aimed at sharing capacity around the world. The
lines will not take equity stakes in each other.
The planned partnership is the latest in a series of worldwide agreements
between shipping companies as they seek to achieve economies of scale in an
increasingly competitive environment. The four aim to dominate the high
value-added segment of the container shipping market which involves greater
attention to customer service.
'This configuration will allow the four companies to use their ships more
effectively, improving use of capacity, offering more frequent, more direct
and faster sailings,' said Mr Hideyuki Sadamatsu, Mitsui OSK's deputy
general manager for Europe and Oceania.
The groups were still negotiating how many ships would be allocated to the
alliance which should be agreed within four months and implemented within
two years, he said.
Mr Simon Brough, finance director of Orient Overseas, said the alliance
would allow the partners to offer a frequent service to their customers.
Each company would, however, be responsible for its own marketing, sales and
service, he said. The new alliance could eventually include joint trucking,
logistics, warehousing and inland operations as well as ship-sharing.
In Rotterdam, Nedlloyd said the proposed alliance would enable it to improve
services to cargo customers. 'It means we can offer a greater frequency of
services, and more direct services to more harbours, than before,' Mr Hans
Teeuw, senior vice-president of Nedlloyd Lines, said.
He said the partnership was not aimed at bolstering freight rates but added
that Nedlloyd hoped that rates would recover. The recent stabilisation of
rates after sharp declines in past years, plus growth in cargo volumes, is
expected to allow Nedlloyd to return to profit in 1994 after several years
of losses.
The shipping industry, which is highly capital intensive, is suffering from
overcapacity and poor rates. This has forced operators into capacity sharing
agreements to make the most efficient use of assets and improve returns.
Last year, Hapag-Lloyd, Germany's biggest container company, Neptune Orient
Lines of Singapore, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Japan's largest containership
company, concluded an agreement to provide services between Asia, North
America and Europe. Mitsui, which previously had a partnership for
Asian-European trade with Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Hapag-Lloyd, severed its
links with these companies after the creation of the alliance.
American President Lines and Orient Overseas are the largest container
shipper on the trans-pacific route since forming an alliance in which they
share capacity, co-ordinate sailings and share container terminals. Mitsui
has teamed up with the Malaysian International Shipping Corporation,
Nedlloyd Lines and Compagnie Gene Maritime to provide scheduled services
between Europe and the Far East. The Japanese company said the latest deal
would not affect this arrangement, called the Tonnage Sharing Agreement.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Electronic road pricing system for Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore, which heavily taxes cars and restricts their entry into the
business district during peak hours, is launching the world's first
electronic road pricing system in a new attempt to reduce road congestion,
public works department officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Singapore.
'The system will permit a more flexible pricing structure and a more
effective way to control traffic,' said executive engineer Mr Lew Yii Der.
Under the system, now being tested in some areas in Singapore, selected
entry points will send a signal to an electronic card fixed to a vehicle
when it passes a marker to enter a restricted area.
The card will 'store' a certain amount of money and each time a vehicle
passes an entry point a fare will be automatically deducted. If the
stored-value card is absent or does not contain enough money, the system
will trigger cameras to photograph the rear number plate of the vehicle as
it passes.
Motorists driving to Singapore's busy shopping and business districts in
peak hours must now buy a permit or face a ticket from the island's
efficient traffic police.
Authorities fear tiny Singapore, just 42 km (26 miles) long and 23 km (14
miles) wide, will soon be clogged by a growing number of vehicles.
Rising affluence is prompting more Singaporeans to buy cars, despite
eye-popping price tags inflated by a stiff premium for new cars, decided
during government auctions - a new 1.6-litre Honda Civic, for example, costs
around SDollars 122,000 (Dollars 78,710).
Three groups of international telecom and electronic companies have been
shortlisted from 10 who originally bid for the project, officials said.
Teledata (Singapore) and Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone International
submitted the lowest bid of SDollars 193.4m (Dollars 125m).
The second consortium, with a SDollars 231m (Dollars 149m), bid for
comprises Singapore Electronic &amp; Engineering, General Electric Company (S),
Britain's GEC Traffic Automation and Italy's Marconi.
The third group with a bid of Dollars 268.9m (Dollars 173.48m) comprises
Philips Singapore and Miyoshi Electric of Japan.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Political rift in Lebanon jolts currency
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The paralysing stand-off between Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanese prime minister,
and President Elias Hrawi further jolted confidence in the country's
currency yesterday - forcing the central bank to sell an estimated Dollars
30m in US dollars for the second day running in local markets to hold the
pound steady.
The row between the leaders, ostensibly over who to appoint in a cabinet
reshuffle intended to boost Christian representation in government, appeared
likely to prompt direct intervention from Syria, which exerts considerable
influence in Lebanon. Local commentators said the dispute does not now look
resolveable without a wholsale change in Mr Hariri's 19-month-old
administration.
Mr Hariri, the Sunni businessman appointed prime minister by Mr Hrawi in
1992 to revive confidence in the country after its 17-year civil war,
remained ensconced at home yesterday, having 'withdrawn' from his duties at
the weekend after the dispute with Mr Hrawi, a Christian, and Mr Nabhi
Berri, the Shia speaker of parliament.
Both Mr Berri and Mr Hrawi appear to have opposed Mr Hariri's plan to bring
into the 30-member cabinet two senior Maronite Christians in a gesture his
supporters say was intended to 'enhance internal unity' amid deepening
bitterness in the Christian community over Mr Hariri's government style and
their perceived political marginalisation.
However, neither Mr Hrawi nor Mr Berri approved the men suggested;
politicians in Beirut said both wanted a far wider cabinet shake-out than Mr
Hariri had proposed, though neither was apparently pressing for the prime
minister's resignation.
The politicians said the row arose from a more general accusation that Mr
Hariri has appointed close aides to critical ministries - to which Mr
Hariri's backers have responded by accusing some ministers and other senior
political figures of 'hindering' and 'delaying' Mr Hariri's ambitious
multi-billion-dollar rebuilding plans for Beirut with their 'private
interests'.
They also suggested Mr Hariri had not been able to win 'basic' ministerial
co-operation with the present cabinet.
The row, the most serious yet between Mr Hariri and Mr Hrawi, comes amid a
more general souring of the optimism which initially greeted the billionaire
businessman's arrival in Beirut.
Although the flotation earlier this year of Solidere, the company created to
rebuild the city's shattered core, was a success, share distribution has
since been delayed and the company this week said it would take at least
'another month' before reconstruction work can begin.
Last week, Banque Audi also said in its economic bulletin that growth in the
first quarter had slowed and that only a 'huge investment effort' would
revive output.
Money in the country, the report said, was increasingly being directed into
money market placements rather than productive enterprises, partly the
result of high interest rates on the Lebanese pound.

FT  11 MAY 94 / Rivals say lobbying helped AT&amp;T win Dollars 4bn Saudi deal

Canadian and European telecommunications equipment suppliers which lost out
to AT&amp;T, the US company, in a Dollars 4bn Saudi contract earlier this week
claim political pressure by the Clinton administration cost them the deal.
The Saudi contract, one of the largest awarded in telecoms, provides for
wholesale upgrading of the kingdom's telecoms network over the next seven
years, including 1.5m new telephone lines and a new digital mobile cellular
network.
AT&amp;T hailed the contract as 'a big boost to our globalisation efforts'. It
is a staging post in the attainment of the company's goal of increasing the
non-US share of its equipment supply business from 20 to 50 per cent of
total turnover by the end of the decade. The company declined to comment on
the suggestion that political pressure had helped to win the deal.
The contract was bitterly fought between AT&amp;T and Siemens of Germany,
Alcatel of France, Ericsson of Sweden, and Northern Telecom of Canada. All
four non-US companies are believed to be aggrieved at the extent of lobbying
by Washington on AT&amp;T's behalf. Yesterday Ericsson claimed political factors
had been 'decisive.'
The group said its offer had been lower than its competitors, although it
declined to be specific. It noted AT&amp;T's eventual order at 1.5m lines was
bigger than specified in the original tender.
Mr Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive, said last year Ericsson was
losing orders because of its lack of political clout. 'We could easily
double our revenues if we had the same political and financial muscle as our
competitors.' he stated.
Stockholm analysts said the US role in the Gulf war and President Bill
Clinton's intervention in the contract talks had almost certainly helped
AT&amp;T clinch the order. But they believed Ericsson was well placed to recover
from the setback, particularly when a new batch of cellular mobile licences
are auctioned in the US later this year.
The group played down the impact of the loss on its overall business.
'The value of this order corresponds to roughly 2 per cent of our yearly
order intake; the volume of 200,000 lines per year should be compared to
Ericsson's annual deliveries of around 10m lines,' said Mr Bo Landin, a
senior vice-president.
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, cited the contract as a prime example
of the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's promotion of US
business.
Mr Brown visited Saudi Arabia in the past year to press the cause of US
suppliers - not only for the telecommunications contract, but also for
Dollars 6bn of aircraft orders won by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
The latest controversy follows strong complaints by European and other
manufacturers at the pressure exerted by the US on trading partners.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Winterthur lifted by non-life
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Winterthur, the Swiss insurance group, has reported a 31.3 per cent jump in
1993 consolidated net income to SFr324.4m (Dollars 231.7m), due to vigorous
growth in non-life business and substantial profits on investments.
The directors are recommending a 14 per cent rise in the dividend to SFr16 a
share.
Consolidated gross premiums rose 5.6 per cent to SFr16.4bn in spite of the
appreciation of the Swiss franc.
Pre-tax profit soared 29.5 per cent to SFr511.3m.
In the non-life business, gross premiums grew by 8 per cent and pre-tax
profit jumped 30.3 per cent to SFr346.1m.
Premiums in the life business advanced only 1.6 per cent, due to the
recession and exchange rate effects, but the pre-tax profit surged 27.8 per
cent to SFr165.2m, due to an 'excellent financial result' and an improved
expense ratio.
Swiss Life, a leading Swiss life insurer, said its consolidated surplus
income in 1993 rose 1.4 per cent to SFr1.4bn.
Earned premiums were up 10.4 per cent to SFr9.3bn and investment income
advanced 15.2 per cent to SFr4.2bn.
Swiss Life is a co-operative joint stock company and by statute must use its
surplus income to improve or reduce the cost of insurance cover.
The directors have agreed to raise the dividend on the quoted participation
certificates to SFr7 from SFr6.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and President Elias Hrawi locked
horns yesterday over a planned government reshuffle, Reuter reports from
Beirut.
The billionaire prime minister put off all appointments, stayed at home and
cancelled tomorrow'a regular cabinet meeting, emerging only to greet
hundreds of supporters who flocked to his Beirut residence in a show of
solidarity.
The two men agreed last week during a visit to Syria, the main foreign power
broker in Lebanon, to strengthen Christian representation in the cabinet but
have since disagreed over the extent of the reshuffle and the new names to
be brought in.
Relations between the Syrian-backed government and the once-dominant
Christian minority have been tense in recent weeks and the proposed changes
appeared an attempt to improve them by bringing in more representative
Christian politicians.
Political observers said Mr Hariri wanted to bring four new ministers into
the 30-member cabinet - two heavyweight Maronite Christian politicians
representing influential Christian political parties, a Sunni Moslem and a
Shi'ite Moslem.
He also wanted to swap several portfolios, including interior, defence and
information, among the present ministers. The observers said Mr Hrawi
objected to the names Mr Hariri was proposing. He was pressing for a broader
reshuffle amounting to a change in government that would reduce the strength
of Mr Hariri's supporters in the cabinet while increasing the Christian
representation.
Complicating the dispute, parliament Speaker Nabih Berri rejected Mr
Hariri's suggestions and insisted that a Shi'ite should be named finance
minister.
Mr Hariri, a Sunni Moslem, currently holds the finance portfolio with Sunni
Moslem Fouad Siniora, a close aide, as minister of state for finance.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Syrians turn to entrepreneurs for big returns: Frustration
at the slow pace of economic reform is forcing investors into the private
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every month, thousands of Syrian investors make their way to the centre of
Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria, to collect substantial dividends
on their savings. They pass the empty and dilapidated state-owned Commercial
Bank of Syria, and enter plush and computerised offices of Anas Trading
Corporation, run by a private sector entrepreneur, Mr Mohammad Kallas.
There they receive a handsome yearly interest rate of between 30 and 40 per
cent, paid in monthly instalments. Sums invested range from SPounds 5,000
(about Dollars 108) to SPounds 10m (about Dollars 217,400) and Mr Kallas has
more than 4,000 individual investors on his books.
While the Syrian government talks limply about opening a Damascus stock
exchange and reforming the banking system, Mr Kallas' thriving business is
already fulfilling such services.
Few Syrians deposit their savings in the government banks. Although interest
rates are between 5 and 12 per cent, annual inflation rates of over 15 per
cent means they would lose in real terms. Since it is illegal to take local
currency out of the country, ordinary Syrians frequently complain they have
few places to put their money.
Mr Kallas says he has a capital of more than SPounds 2bn from people of all
walks of life. He explains that depositors' money is invested in the
corporation's export-oriented industries, such as its clothes and cotton
processing factories, fruit juice plants, and engineering shops.
The interest paid on accounts is based on profit-margins and while a
provisional rate is paid each month, the final dividends are calculated at
the end of each year.
Unlike a bank, however, there are no government guarantees against losses.
There are no shareholder meetings, company reports, or regulations to
protect investors from fraud. Aleppo remembers only too clearly a number of
seemingly successful operations like Anas Trading which collapsed overnight
in the late 1980s. And there are plenty of others offering the same kind of
service as Mr Kallas who could go under anytime.
Thus, predictably, the market is ultra-sensitive to rumours. Mr Kallas
recounts that two months ago, speculation that Anas Trading had gone bust
spread through Aleppo like fire. In one morning, depositors demanded the
return of SPounds 60m which was paid the same day out of the export payments
account and Mr Kallas' own pocket. Once people realised they could get their
money back, however, most of it was re-deposited the next day, he says.
At the root of Mr Kallas' success is widespread frustration among Syrians at
the slow pace of economic reforms. Liberalisation of the economy began in
the 1980s, but the essential pillars of a command economy - a massive public
sector, over-valued exchange rate, trade restrictions and foreign exchange
controls - remain intact.
Although in many areas the private sector is doing well - benefiting
especially from the Encouragement of Investment Law No 10 of 1991 which
offers tax and import incentives - the regime remains cautious about
relinquishing too much control.
Privatisation of state assets is firmly off the agenda. The government says
it prefers to 'reform' the banking system rather than open up to private and
foreign banks, and the possibility of a Damascus stock exchange remains in
the balance.
Mr Rateb Shallah, president of the Syrian Chambers of Commerce, argues that
opening a stock exchange would not only ease the current liquidity problem
but allow more people to invest in the private sector.
With over 950 projects approved under Law No 10 there is no shortage of
private companies to enter a primary market. Mr Kallas says he would be the
first formally to float his company. Furthermore, a bourse would provide the
private sector with the kind of capital resources which domestic banks
cannot.
The draft bill for a stock exchange has been ready since last year for
presentation to the People's Assembly for approval. Problems of regulation
and control are cited as the main sticking point. But until the government
makes up its mind, individual investors will have no choice but risk
trusting their money with the likes of Mr Kallas.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Tapie's recovery unnerves Socialists: Surge in Euro-polls
has party big guns aiming at Marseilles' favourite son
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician and businessman,
yesterday sought to quash speculation that he might contest next year's
presidential election by claiming that his main political ambition was to
become mayor of Marseilles.
'The next election, the only one that interests me, is the Marseilles
election,' he said on French radio. 'None of the others interests me at
all.'
Mr Tapie, who holds a parliamentary seat near Marseilles and was briefly
minister of urban affairs in the last Socialist cabinet, has come under fire
from the Socialist establishment because of the success of MRG, his radical
left group, in the campaign for next month's European elections. MRG,
recently dubbed Les Tapistes by the French press, has risen steadily in the
opinion polls. It now commands the support of around 10 per cent of the
electorate, thereby jeopardising the Socialists' hopes of repairing the
damage caused by their defeat in last year's parliamentary elections by
building on their gains in this spring's local vote.
Ms Martine Aubry, a former Socialist minister who is the daughter of Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission and a contender for the
Socialist presidential candidacy, on Sunday accused Mr Tapie of having 'no
concrete ideas' to offer voters and of 'showering people with illusions'.
Her criticism was echoed by Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist first secretary and
Mr Delors' chief rival for the presidential candidacy, who said that he was
'in complete intellectual agreement' with Ms Aubry on the Tapie issue.
So far the opposition of the establishment appears to have enhanced Mr
Tapie's popularity with the French public, rather than detracting from it.
He has always cut a flamboyant figure in the elitist world of French
politics as one of the few self-made men ever to have made it to the top.
His popularity has even survived a series of scandals over his business
dealings. Mr Tapie has not only been implicated in the allegations of
match-rigging against Olympique-Marseille, his football club, but is under
investigation in a fraud trial. He was last week fined FFr1m (Dollars
170,000) by the French stock market authorities for releasing misleading
information about one of his old business interests.
These revelations, coupled with the recent decision by Credit Lyonnais, his
bank, to cal in his loans, have served to reinforce Mr Tapie's maverick
reputation and have helped fuel Les Tapistes' rise in the opinion polls. The
French media has been swift to draw parallels between Mr Tapie and Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Bankers Trust replaces chairman of WM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust, the US-based bank, has replaced the long-time chairman of WM
Company, its performance measurement subsidiary, with a senior banking
official in an effort to build a 'global' business selling its services to
other bank clients.
In particular, Bankers Trust would like to offer performance measurement to
clients of its global custody operations, which offer a safekeeping service
for securities. WM could expand its client list by offering performance
measurement to US and European pension funds for whom it is the global
custodian.
Mr Charlie Kiley, managing director of Bankers Trust Company and
vice-chairman of Bankers Trust International, will be chairman, replacing Mr
Dougald Eadie who will remain as a non-executive director. Mr Eadie, who has
been with WM since 1968, was chiefly responsible for developing its computer
systems and was instrumental in the company's success.
Mr Kiley will be dividing his time between WM and other duties.
Bankers Trust, which has been reviewing its London operations, has a
strategy of pursuing businesses along global lines. 'We made the changes
because we would like to use WM more globally, and knit it into services
such as custody more than it is,' the company said. WM Company, which it
acquired in 1987, has remained largely a UK business where it is a leading
provider of performance measurement services to pension funds.
Bankers Trust bought WM partly in the hope that its clients would use the
bank's index-tracking fund management services which are among the largest
in the US. However, the desired synergy did not materialise and Bankers
Trust sold its UK-based index-tracking fund management business to Invesco
earlier this year.
Index-tracking is a style of investment in which managers purchase stocks to
mimic the relative weighting of each in an index.
Fund management industry officials have said Bankers Trust efforts to
capitalise on its WM subsidiary have been hampered by fears among clients
that confidential information could be misused.
'We are very aware of the necessary autonomy that WM has to have as a
performance measurement company. We need to balance the independence against
the desire to integrate the businesses,' Bankers Trust said.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (1): An African test case for good
government - In spite of the legalisation of opposition parties and the
implementation of economic reforms, Kenya is still very much on probation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya has undergone such radical changes in the 1990s that the image which
it presents to the world is often discordant and confused.
The one-party state legalised the opposition and contested elections in
1992, while arguing it did not believe in democracy. President Daniel arap
Moi rebelled against the dictates of the International Monetary Fund last
year, and then implemented a comprehensive set of economic reforms which
have won plaudits from local and foreign investors. A new team at the
treasury is attempting to stem the misuse of public funds, but the culprits
remain politically powerful and above the law.
The Kenyan government shelters hundreds of thousands of refugees from
conflict in neighbouring countries, but tolerates the practice of ethnic
cleansing in its own backyard.
It is not always easy to decipher these conflicting signals, in part because
the international community's relations with Kenya have also changed. More
than any other country in Africa, Kenya is being held as a test case for new
donor policies linking aid to good government.
Since November 1991, when the World Bank, IMF and donor governments decided
to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of financial assistance as a
protest against mounting corruption and against Kenya's political and
economic failings, this lapsed African role model has been on probation.
The aid freeze proved to be the catalyst for much of the change that ensued.
A few days after the landmark donor meeting in Paris, President Moi
legalised opposition parties. In the elections which followed in December
1992, President Moi and his Kenya African National Union (Kanu) party
defeated a divided opposition.
The elections, however, failed to deliver the promise of democracy. Kanu
retains an absolute grip on power, which it wields arbitrarily. Since the
advent of the new multi-party era, police have developed a worrying fondness
for arresting and harassing opposition members of parliament. Twenty-five
MPs - almost a third of the opposition force - have been inside Kenyan jails
in the past year. Their most frequent offence has been to hold meetings in
their constituencies in defiance of police bans.
Kenya's lively and independent press is also under attack for reporting on
ethnic clashes in the populous Rift Valley - a highly sensitive conflict
pitting President Moi's Kalenjin clan and other pastoral tribes against
Kikuyu settlers, the largest ethnic group in Kenya. The clashes have caused
1,500 deaths and displaced 300,000 people since 1991, according to church
and human rights groups.
The government, meanwhile, is trying to impose a blackout on news about the
troubled region by charging reporters with subversion.
The government blames Kenya's recent social turmoil on the multi-party
system it adopted under duress. President Moi, a reluctant convert to
democracy, believes western-style political parties cannot work in Africa
because of their tendency to fragment on tribal lines.
But whereas the new political scenario in Kenya has thrown the tribal factor
into greater relief, the fissures were already evident under one-party rule.
Since 1978, President Moi has governed with a coalition of minority Rift
Valley tribes, who resented Kikuyu domination under the late Jomo Kenyatta,
Kenya's first president, and fear a revival of Kikuyu power.
While tribal arithmetic and mistrust have prevented genuine political
dialogue between government and opposition, the arithmetic of dwindling aid
dollars has made talking with Kenya's distrustful donors an absolute
imperative.
Kenyan officials are reluctant to spell out the cost of the two-year aid
freeze but it can be measured by the slump in economic growth, the decline
in per capita incomes and in the collapse of social services. During the
first year of the aid freeze, Kenya recorded its lowest growth rate since
independence: a meagre 0.4 per cent in 1992.
The economy remained stagnant in 1993, while the government ran up Dollars
700m in arrears on its external debt repayments. Unemployment affects 27 per
cent of the urban population. In Kenya's state hospitals, operating theatres
lie idle because of the lack of essential drugs and surgical equipment.
Children are being denied education because parents cannot afford school
fees. Roads, railways, power and water systems have fallen into disrepair.
In addition, the run up to the December 1992 elections saw some very curious
financial transactions thought to have benefited some who were uncertain of
their political future. New domestic banks were licensed to finance the
campaigns of Kanu politicians. Large quantities of gold and diamonds were
allegedly exported in order to qualify for generous government rebates.
Financial irregularities multiplied after the elections, involving the
Central Bank in the provision of billions of shillings of unsecured loans to
'political banks'.
By the time Mr Musalia Mudavadi, appointed finance minister in January 1993,
was able to stop the rot, the cost to the exchequer had been estimated by
independent auditors at Ks30bn (Dollars 430m), or approximately 10 per cent
of the country's gross domestic product. It was the biggest sum to go
missing from public funds in Kenya's history.
Heads rolled at the Central Bank, but, to date, no-one has been charged with
financial wrongdoing.
The enormity of the financial losses, however, appears to have jolted
Kenya's decision makers to their senses. A rapprochement was sought with the
World Bank and IMF. A new governor, Mr Micah Cheserem, was appointed to the
Central Bank. By mid-1993, Kenya was back on a serious reform track. Mr
Cheserem, a former senior accountant with Unilever, concentrated on
tightening banking regulations and supervision. At the Treasury, Mr Mudavadi
worked on the most rapid deregulation of an economy Africa has ever seen.
Import licences were scrapped. The Kenya shilling was devalued and then
floated. Exporters were allowed to keep their foreign exchange earnings.
Restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends were lifted. All
price controls, with the exception of petroleum products, were abolished.
The government opened to private traders the import and marketing of maize,
Kenya's staple foodstuff.
The private sector, long suffocated by government controls, is feeling
rather giddy in the newly liberalised environment. Exports responded to the
devaluation of the shilling, surging by 15 per cent last year to Dollars
1.1bn. Local manufacturers no longer have to queue and bribe to obtain
import licences and rationed foreign exchange. A majority of multinationals
polled by the East Africa Association are planning significant new
investments. The reforms have won Mr Mudavadi and Mr Cheserem a devoted
following among Nairobi bankers and businessmen. In November 1993, Kenya's
dynamic duo were rewarded with the restoration of fast-disbursing balance of
payments aid and encouraging words of support from a less sceptical donor
community.
Inside government, however, Mr Mudavadi is battling a formidable coalition
of opponents of reform, who resent the loss of patronage implicit in the
finance minister's agenda.
So far, Mr Mudavadi has stayed the course, thanks to President Moi's backing
and the absence of any credible alternative economic policy, but his
security of tenure is not guaranteed. Neither is success as he prepares to
tackle the daunting problems of a chronic budget deficit and parastatal
reform.
Donors worry that the finance minister's plans may be over-ambitious.
Neither inflation, running at an annualised rate of 50 per cent, nor
government expenditures are under control. The cost of servicing the
government's ballooning domestic debt leaves little room for investment in
Kenya's dilapidated social services. Few of the 400,000 school-leavers this
year will find jobs.
And yet, with elections not due for almost four years, there is hope that Mr
Mudavadi, backed by a strengthened private sector, may be given the chance
to put Kenya back on to the growth fast-track.
Perhaps a modern civic society will also be allowed to emerge as a
generation of political leaders, whose authoritarian instincts date back to
the struggle for independence, finally retire.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Darwin's Flood - Fringe theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Snoo Wilson's comedies - far-fetched, scatty-intellectual, black and often
scabrous - can hardly be an 'acquired taste', for one cannot imagine anybody
acquiring it. Either you find that you already had it, very possibly to your
surprise and embarrassment; or you sit there stony-faced; or you veer
queasily this way and that. The press-night audience for Darwin's Flood at
the Bush represented the entire spectrum. A few people, perhaps scandalised,
did nothing but wince; some others flinched and guffawed; still others - a
few at a time, never quite the same few - went into sudden spasms of
uncontrolled hilarity.
No critic could tell you where you might fit (I laughed a lot). Here are the
premises: - we are in Sir Charles Darwin's retirement home on the Downs,
soon to be inundated by the second Great Flood. The year being 1885, Sir
Charles is already dead, but he carries on bravely (in the person of John
Kane, disarmingly a-tremble with scientific detachment and decent concern),
though he doesn't want visitors.
Visitors come nonetheless, welcomed by his lusty young widow Emma (Alex
Kingston). First the philosopher Nietzsche, with his monstrous sister
Elisabeth (Rosemary McHale, faultlessly Teutonic and intense) and her
husband (Paul Bentall), who set out in 1890 with 150 dogged Swabians to
found a pure German colony in South America. Nietzsche (Bob Goody) is
already mad, speechless and virtually legless - Elisabeth wheels him in a
barrow - but since they are time-travelling backwards there is hope of a
retroactive recovery. She wants to verify the agreement of Darwinianism with
her brother's will-to-power, devil-take-the-loser philosophy before pressing
on to Paraguay.
Meanwhile Jesus Christ drops in, a chunky Ulsterman in biker's Lycra (James
Nesbitt) who performs the odd miracle between offstage sessions of prayer
and comfort with Mrs Darwin; and then red-leathered Mary Magdalene (Barbara
Barnes) with a mobile call-girl's phone, who soon finds herself flagellating
scraggy old Nietzsche in crucifixion pose and loincloth, to his hungry
satisfaction. Some viewers might find this in dubious taste. As one loopy
episode succeeds another, Robin Don's witty set disgorges surprise after
extravagant surprise, exceeding the little Bush arena's limits beyond
anything one might have imagined.
Though it must plainly be admitted that Darwin's Flood is a very, very silly
piece, its special kind of silliness is worth appreciating. Not
silly-intellectual, because Wilson never pretends to elevate the central
idea - the validity of 'social Darwinism', I suppose - into a Shavian
debate; instead it keeps prancing off into comical quicksand. Not
silly-facetious either (as the above summary might suggest, like almost any
summary of a Wilson play); because the undergraduate snook-cocking is just
scaffolding for his inspired flights of cogent, deadpan craziness for every
character.
They may not extend far - construction is not a Wilson strength, and his
second act falls short of the riotous climax of the first - but they keep
coming, knitted neatly into the airy texture and never far from the point.
Stokes's cast carry them off with unabashed bravado, abetted by Chahine
Yavroyan's hi-tech lighting and Simon Whitehorn's apocalyptic-romantic sound
as well as Don's sensational designs. The morning after, you may find the
details lost beyond recall but a delighted glow still lingering. Do not take
a maiden aunt.

FT  10 MAY 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Strasbourg awaits a
change of guard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strasbourg airport at dawn is a desolate place at the best of times. But for
many Euro-MPs, flying out early last Thursday from the final plenary session
of the European parliament before next month's Euro-elections, this is not
the best of times. The forlorn expressions on some MEPs' faces bore eloquent
testimony to widespread predictions that between half and two-thirds of them
are not coming back.
When the Parliament reassembles in July - as 567 members rather than 518
now, to reflect adjustments triggered by German unification - there will be
a lot of new MEPs. Less clear is how much of the 1994-99 intake will
represent genuine new blood.
Party barons in Strasbourg say there has been more intense competition for
Euro-seats than at any time since the parliament became a directly-elected
body in 1979.
But they acknowledge that, as in the past, many new members will be refugees
recycled from national politics, and some party lists will be headed by
figures who have no intention of setting foot in the parliament, except to
collect their credentials.
In France, for instance, a host of former Socialist ministers have emerged
at the top of two lists, one headed by by Mr Michel Rocard and Ms Elisabeth
Guigou, and another non-aligned list led by businessman-politician Bernard
Tapie and environmentalist Brice Lalonde. But this looks more like an
attempt to salvage something from the wreckage of last year's Socialist
defeat. In Italy, by contrast, where past list leaders such as the disgraced
former Socialist prime minister, Mr Bettino Craxi, or the former Communist
leader Achille Ochetto, hardly ever turned up, the victor of the March
election, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, is contemplating heading several lists for
Strasbourg.
It can be safely predicted that the new parliament will be more socialist in
complexion and more German in accent. Germans will almost certainly lead the
Christian Democrats and the Greens, and could lead the Socialists too.
As witnessed in recent months, notably over ratification of EU enlargement,
the Strasbourg assembly will also become more assertive of the new
legislative rights it won through the Maastricht treaty.
The Socialist Group, already a dominant force with 197 MEPs, is expected to
gain beyond 220 members. Its main rival, the Christian Democrat European
People's party group, is likely to see its representation fall from 162 now
to about 150.
In the outgoing parliament, the two big blocs collaborated closely,
parcelled out the key positions, and even shared the presidency. The current
incumbent, German Christian Democrat Egon Kelpsch, succeeded Spanish
Socialist Enrique Baron halfway through the five-year term.
But this bipartisan approach looks less assured with a probably larger and
more cohesive Socialist bloc, and a more fragmented right.
The main axis of the Socialist Group will be Anglo-German. The UK Labour
party, already the largest national group at Strasbourg, with
disproportionate influence, appears likely to win 60 or more seats from 46
now. With the increase in Germany's allocation from 81 to 99 seats, the SPD
should get around 45. 'An Anglo-German deal in the Socialist Group is
vital,' says one senior parliament official, not only for the cohesion of
the Group, but for the smooth running of the assembly.
The leadership of the socialist bloc is the single most influential position
at Strasbourg, and both Labour's Pauline Green and the SPD's Klaus Hansch
want it. A possible compromise might see the job go to Ms Guigou, European
affairs minister in the last French Socialist government.
The group leaders as a whole - assembled as the Conference of Chairmen  -
have become the driving force of the parliament, with increasingly
professional staff, and a cadre of experienced rapporteurs to steer
legislation. But the other great prizes are the chairmanships of the most
important committees.
Parliament has the right to veto most legislation passed in Council by
qualified majority vote, and to reject the new European Commission due to
take over next year. The ability to turn these blocking powers into
legislative influence will depend on the skills of committee chairmen and
secretariats and on the apparats of the political groups.
Bodies such as the parliament environment committee, headed by UK Labour MEP
Ken Collins, already wield real legislative influence, and are among the
most heavily lobbied units in the EU power structure. The struggle to
control them will be fierce, but the parliament as a whole is beginning to
set store by having experienced people in charge of them.
As a condition for approving entry for new members Austria, Sweden, Finland
and Norway, the parliament has won political pledges that MEPs will have a
voice in the 1996 review of EU power-sharing.
As a body, Strasbourg is moving closer to the centre of EU decision-making.
If all four applicants join next year, increasing the parliament's size to
639 members, MEPs may even get their wish to move to Brussels, the seat of
EU power.
France has persuaded its partners to make Strasbourg the assembly's
permanent seat, but the existing parliament building there is too small.
Building work on a new chamber in Strasbourg has started, but parliament has
alsoacquired a huge building in Brussels that could fit in everyone - an
environment of vaulted prominence matching the assembly's new ambitions.

FT  10 MAY 94 / They're all in this together: How long will South Africa's
spirit of reconciliation last under Mandela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa has been stunned by its first brush with democracy. For
citizens of mature nations, to whom democracy is an old and devalued friend,
voting is a banal political act uninspired by higher emotion. But South
Africans came to the polls as political virgins: with their naivety and
their faith, they cast their ballots overwhelmingly for the ideal of one
nation, undivided by race. More than anything else, South Africa's future
will depend on the success of efforts to realise that ideal.
Nelson Mandela, who will today be inaugurated as the first president of a
united South Africa, has devoted his life to that goal. He never lets the
subject drop: every speech, including yesterday's address in Cape Town after
he was elected president, stresses the need to reconcile South Africans to a
common destiny.
Constantly, he repeats the words he first uttered from the dock during the
Rivonia treason trial 30 years ago: 'I have fought against white domination
and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a
democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony
and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to
achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.'
Mr Mandela did not have to die; outgoing President FW de Klerk had the
wisdom and vision to prevent such a disaster. But it was a close-run thing:
Mr Mandela is nearly 76, and without the adrenalin and excitement of his
release and the subsequent four years of political change, he might well
have begun to fail. But Mr de Klerk knew that no other black leader would
offer whites a better deal, and he desperately feared a race war. So he took
the first inevitable step to racial reconciliation; the rest is up to Mr
Mandela.
The legacy of the recent elections will be no small help to him in this
task. For as the chairman of the discredited Independent Electoral
Commission, Judge Johann Kriegler, pointed out, the exercise had more to do
with reconciling people than reconciling votes. (A convenient excuse from a
man who proved completely unequal to the job of running a modern election,
but true even so.)
So ballots were not reconciled, and their legitimacy could not be proved.
Perhaps that was just as well, for it gave political leaders the excuse to
do their own kind of reconciliation: sharing out power more as they thought
the voters ought to have done, than as they probably did; providing what one
political insider called a 'designer outcome' to a messy and chaotic
election. One local newspaper called it 'a dream come true'; those less
given to hyperbole nonetheless thanked God (who pops up often in South
African political discourse) for such a neat and happy outcome.
For despite the electoral bungling and administrative farce which attended
the birth of South African democracy, the politicians have delivered a
result which stands a good chance of guaranteeing stability in years to
come: a deal which binds all the major parties to the constitution, and
leaves only the tiniest fringe to the left and right in extra-parliamentary
opposition.
The African National Congress is strong, but not dominant: it did not gain
the two-thirds of the national vote which would have made it simpler to
force through its ideas on a new constitution. And crucially, it did not win
control of two important provinces, KwaZulu Natal, with a fifth of the
country's population, and the western Cape. True to form, Mr Mandela
welcomed his party's failure to pass the two-thirds threshold, hoping this
would allay white fears of black domination. That was an essential part of
the 'designer outcome': the ANC could not be allowed to win too many votes,
or national reconciliation would be jeopardised.
The National party passed the 20 per cent psychological barrier needed to
give the party the power base from which to argue for minority interests
within the government of national unity. And the Inkatha Freedom party won
the province of KwaZulu Natal with a fraction more than 50 per cent of the
vote, giving the party a one-seat majority in the 81-member provincial
assembly.
The ANC surrendered Natal - where some 15,000 people have died in the past
decade in fighting which the ANC blames on the IFP - in the interests of
peace. This was almost certainly the wisest course: for with Inkatha running
well ahead in the polling (however crooked the results), the party of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi would never have accepted defeat. Inkatha is likely to
prove much less belligerent within government than outside; and it now has a
vested interest in the success of the new order.
The result has left South Africans in a pleasurable state of shock. The
unimaginable is constantly made fact; sad old truths have been forgotten and
the twin burdens of guilt and oppression lifted from the national spirit.
The momentousness of what has happened - long foreseen but not quite grasped
 -strikes home in the images of the new South Africa. Mr Mandela addresses
the media from the steps of Tuinhuis, the elegant Cape Dutch mansion which
houses the presidential offices; in this building five years ago, he took
tea as a prisoner with outgoing President PW Botha, returning to his cell
after tea was served. He poses for photos on the steps of the tri-cameral
parliament constituted expressly to exclude blacks, and places his hand over
his heart in allegiance as an official band plays Die Stem, the anthem of
apartheid (now one of South Africa's two national anthems).
In the historic Raadsaal (council chamber) in Bloemfontein, capital of the
Orange Free State (last used at the turn of the century to house the
parliament of the Orange Free State Boer republic), Patrick Lekota of the
African National Congress is sworn in as premier of the new province of the
same name. Five years ago, Lekota was serving a 12-year sentence for treason
against the South African state. Now he is one of the most powerful men in
the land.
This scene is repeated throughout the country, as former prisoners take the
salute from their captors. And every provincial premier conveys the same
message: the need for racial reconciliation and investment to build a new
South Africa. That is Mr Mandela's vision: the miracle is that his
subordinates seem truly to have taken it to heart.
Perhaps the spirit of reconciliation will not survive the new government's
first five-year term in office; perhaps it will expire long before. But to
hear the new ANC premier of the Johannesburg-Pretoria region, Mr Tokyo
Sexwale, plead with the white right wing to join in the new South Africa -
and not to closet themselves away in some forgotten corner of an arid
homeland - is to believe that the new government's intentions are good. Mr
Sekwale has even said he will forego the traditional triumphal act of
African liberation: changing the names of streets and buildings to deny the
European past. He understands the impact this would have on the white
psyche, and seeks to avoid it.
It is hard to see how such generous impulses could have survived the
depredations of apartheid, but they have done: only 1.25 per cent of the
electorate voted for a party whose appeal (though not its official platform)
is based on black revenge, the Pan Africanist Congress. And though 400,000
whites voted for Gen Constand Viljoen and his dream of an Afrikaner
homeland, this is far more a cultural than a racial concept. Overwhelmingly,
South Africans voted against racism.
But surely the best is now over: Nelson Mandela's inauguration brings to an
end the era when the ANC was unquestionably on the right side of history. It
must now dirty its hands with the politics and not just the rhetoric of
nation-building. Mr Mandela's good intentions will be sorely tested in this
phase. For there is a contradiction inherent in the twin goals of his new
government: reconciliation and improving the living standards of the black
population. If blacks advance too rapidly at the expense of whites, whether
in terms of job opportunities or government spending, racial relations will
be strained; if they continue to lag behind, the same will happen.
In the end, race relations will worsen or improve as the economy fails or
prospers, within parameters which may be set by the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund. For once equality is achieved at the ballot
box, economic equality becomes the next target: no new nation can be built
if the whites all leave because of economic decline, or if blacks languish
forever in poverty. That is why Mr Mandela constantly appeals to whites to
stay in South Africa, or return if they have left.
Despite his best intentions, however, strains could quickly develop within
the government of national unity. Though Mr Mandela tried to include several
parties in his cabinet - even those who did not qualify for seats under the
power-sharing constitution - this could work more to his advantage than
theirs. In government, collective cabinet responsibility will force them to
stifle criticism except in matters grave enough to provoke resignation.
In his victory speech last week, Mr Mandela made clear that his definition
of a government of national unity is one in which he gives the orders and
others obey - especially when it comes to implementing the ANC's plan for
black upliftment, the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Under the
constitution, Mr Mandela is required to try to seek consensus on cabinet
decisions; but if he cannot find it, he may act alone. When faced with a
conflict of interest between his core constituency, blacks, and white
privilege, he will have a hard choice to make.
The carefully crafted gestures of reconciliation which marked his election
campaign will then be tested for content as well as form: the hand stretched
out to Mr de Klerk in their televised debate, the embrace for Chief
Buthelezi on the floor of the new national assembly, provided the visual
equivalent of sound bites. The next few months will tell whether they were
indeed genuine, if not quite spontaneous.
In the months and years to come, he will be called upon to implement the
promises made from the dock 30 years ago: 'It is not true that the
enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination. Political division,
based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the
domination of one colour group by another. The ANC has spent half a century
fighting against racialism. When it triumphs it will not change that
policy.'
Perhaps these will go the way of all politicians' promises, and be withdrawn
by a President Mandela, toughened and strengthened by power. And ironically,
racial relations could actually worsen rather than improve with the end of
apartheid, as heightened black expectations are inevitably frustrated and
affluent whites take the blame.
But luckily for South Africa, reconciliation does not in the end depend on
the good intentions of one man and his organisation. South Africa's
disparate peoples may share nothing in the way of race, language, ethnicity
and ideology, but they recognise a common danger which unites them: the risk
of mutually assured destruction. A capricious history brought them from
Holland, India, England, Scotland, France and other parts of Africa; but
over the past two weeks they have finally come to ac-knowledge that they
share a common fate.
As the benevolent glow of the past two weeks fades from memory, that fact
will remain. Mr Mandela, the statesman, Mr de Klerk, the pragmatist, Gen
Constand Viljoen, the soldier, and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the chief, all
accept a common truth: they cannot live without each other. They may not
like the new South Africa, but they are stuck with it. There is no turning
back.

FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich and Vienna both hit new
lows for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As bourses waited apprehen-sively for the US Federal Reserve to act on
interest rates, yesterday was agonising for those of them, such as Zurich
and Vienna, which are deeply influenced by attitudes to defensive stocks,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Both Swiss and Austrian equities hit new lows. The Zurich market held out
until early February against the prospect of lower US interest rates, said
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and
even enjoyed a 'bubble' in financial stocks early this year.
Since then, Germany, strong in cyclicals, has taken over the running and the
Swiss correction has been savage: 'from bubble to rubble in three months,'
said Mr Bell.
ZURICH saw heavy selling in Roche and growing worries about the weak dollar
and the soft domestic bond market as the SMI index dropped 71.9, or 2.7 per
cent, to 2,569.5, down 19.5 per cent from its January 31 closing high.
Roche certificates fell SFr150 to SFr6,300, while the bearers dropped SFr500
to SFr12,100.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer, at Bank Sal Oppenheim, said today's press conference
and next week's analysts meeting would allow the company to justify the
price it has paid for the Syntex acquisition in the US. Meanwhile, the
takeover has been presented as defensive and this, in itself, has cast doubt
on Roche's long term growth potential.
Turnover was said to be high, close to Friday's near SFr2bn level.
Representing dollar stocks, Nestle dropped SFr45, or 4 per cent, to
SFr1,085; in financials, CS Holding finished SFr26, or 4.45 per cent, weaker
at SFr558.
VIENNA also saw heavy volume, and weakness in utilities, financials and
construction stocks as the ATX index dropped 22.35 to 1,053.6.
Mr Frank Jonuschat at James Capel noted pressure on EVN and Verbund in
utilities, the former dropping Sch48, or 3.6 per cent, to Sch1,300; domestic
brokers said that investors were making room for next week's VA Tech
flo-tation.
FRANKFURT lost a relatively modest 0.8 per cent, the Dax index closing 18.14
lower on the session at 2,218.88, holding its ground in the post bourse in
spite of the morning decline on Wall Street.
Turnover fell again, from DM7.1bn to DM6bn, and traders detected no great
pressure to sell.
Daimler consolidated Friday's post-bourse drop on DVFA losses of DM70 a
share for 1993, losing DM12.50 at DM879; and profit-taking in the
engineering sector saw Deutsche Babcock, amid a list of declines, DM3.20
lower at DM259.80.
PARIS managed to pick up some of the ground lost early in the day, but the
CAC-40 index still closed the session with a loss of 18.80 to 2,139.42.
The market has continued to disappoint analysts, with a comment recently
from Kleinwort Benson being typical. The investment bankers, recommending an
underweight position within a European portfolio, noted that while the
outlook for corporate earnings remained good and was improving, momentum had
been stalled by the large number of rights issues and privatisations, both
completed and forthcoming.
Euro Disney featured among the active issues, hitting a 1994 low of FFr29.75
at one stage before closing off FFr1.65 at FFr30.00 as investors awaited
details of the capital increase.
AMSTERDAM weakened as the market kept its attention focused on a possible
interest rate rise in the US. The AEX index shed 5.32 or 1.3 per cent to
406.03, slightly above the session low.
Among the day's news items, Ahold put on 10 cents to Fl 47.00 as the
retailer reported a rise in sales over the first four months of the year.
KLM was another of the day's risers, improving by 50 cents to Fl 52.50 on
reports, later denied, that co-operation talks with Swissair might be
reopened.
Unilever declined in line with the trend, finishing off Fl 4.50 at Fl
199.70: the multinational is due to report first quarter results later in
the week.
Profit-taking was also evident among some recent strong performers such as
DSM, off Fl 4.80 at Fl 138.70.
MILAN continued to wait for the formation of the new government and turnover
was reported as moderate. The Comit index advanced 5.43 to 806.37.
The insurance sector moved ahead with some investors seen switching out of
recently strong areas, such as industrials and finance. Generali, for
instance, added L1,850 to L47,950, following its announcement last Friday
that it was to lift its ordinary dividend. Fondiaria put on L340 to L17,550
amid continued speculation that Generali might be planning to strengthen its
ties.
MADRID fell again but it was almost a relief, in the afternoon, for the
market to be concerned as much with weakness on Wall Street as with Spain's
political woes.
The general index closed 3.81 lower at 314.41 in turnover of Pta15.1bn.
Banks, utilities and communications all suffered with BBV down Pta80 at
Pta3,110, Iberdrola Pta17 lower at Pta925 and Telefonica Pta50 lower at
Pta1,725.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (22): Disease strikes at the heart of
business - A report predicts a huge increase in deaths from Aids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may not yet be as severe as in some of its neighbouring African states,
but one of the most dangerous threats to economic growth and social
stability in Kenya is Aids.
To the casual visitor, evidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is
limited - a TV advertisement warning, 'Say no to unwanted sexual advances;
say no to Aids'; a poster with a prostitute tempting a well-dressed Kenyan,
her face a grinning skull offering the prospect of death.
To the policy-makers, the concern runs far deeper. A recent report prepared
by the National Aids Control Programme of Kenya suggests that one in every
18 adults aged over 15 is HIV-positive. In urban areas, the proportion is
twice as high at 10 to 11 per cent, or 220,000 people.
It estimates that more than 130,000 Kenyans have developed Aids, and that
two years ago about 730,000 people were carrying the human immunodeficiency
virus that causes the disease - most of whom are expected to develop Aids
and die within the next 10 years. This includes 30,000 children.
The report projects that, by 2005, there could be 1.9m HIV-positive Kenyans,
and that the cumulative number of Aids deaths would increase from 100,000
today to over 2m in the same period.
A vicious corollary of Aids, not seen elsewhere in the world, is that the
deaths caused by the disease may often be the result not of esoteric
ailments but of common and highly infectious tropical killers such as
tuberculosis. This not only conceals the fact that Aids may be the root
cause, but also risks engendering a national TB epidemic among those not
infected by the disease as well as those who are.
Equally, some researchers believe that the relatively high incidence of
other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis within
Kenya may boost HIV-infection rates by between 10 and 100 times.
One problem is that many who are HIV-positive do not know they are infected,
since it can take several years before any signs develop. In the meantime,
they may continue to transmit the virus to others.
There is certainly some stigma to the discussion of homosexually-transmitted
Aids in Africa. However, it appears that in Kenya most transmission comes
through heterosexual contact, particularly in groups where the social
structure has broken down: it spreads along trucking routes, in war zones
and among rural migrants to cities. More controversially, some academic
researchers believe there is a higher incidence of infection among
uncircumcised men - a growing group representing about 20 per cent of the
population.
A smaller proportion may come through blood transfusion where screening
systems and equipment break down, although the government insists that most
blood is now screened for HIV.
More worryingly, many children are becoming infected from their mothers  -
either during pregnancy or through breast-feeding. Up to half of the
children of infected mothers in Kenya are estimated to be infected.
Those children who are not infected do not escape the effects of the
disease: many will become so-called Aids orphans, being left without parents
by the time they are 15. Official estimates suggest there will be 600,000
such orphans by 2000 and almost 1m by 2005. This will place additional
burdens on extended families, boost demand for support services and trigger
unstable social structures.
Aids is beginning to have a fundamental impact on the economy more
generally. Three-quarters of cases affect the most economically productive
group within the population: adults aged 20-45. Companies may be threatened
with survival, and agricultural systems disrupted.
A study by US researchers two years ago suggested that the average cost of
hospital care for an Aids patient was Ks27,200, and the average length of
time in hospital far more than for other ailments at 60 days. Aids patients
were estimated to be occupying up to 15 per cent of all hospital beds in the
country.
At current growth rates, this suggests total hospital costs on Aids Ks3.7bn
by the year 2000, and Ks4.8bn by 2005 - up to half of public expenditure on
all health care, and about half of all hospital beds, in a threat to
provision of services to the rest of the population. Separately, a 1992
World Bank study on AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa suggested that if Aids
affects the better-paid, better-educated economic elite, and consumes
medical and funeral costs from savings, investment and economic growth will
suffer.
As to the future, the government says it estimates 'conservatively' that
adult HIV prevalence will stabilise at about 9 per cent by 2000. Some
practitioners remain rather more pessimistic. Dr Francis Plummer, a visiting
lecturer at the University of Nairobi over many years, says: 'There is no
evidence that infection rates are slowing. There is still exponential
growth.'
He says that surveys within Kenya suggest that education has been remarkably
effective, with a high degree of knowledge of Aids. But this has not been
translated into changes in sexual behaviour, except in some limited groups
such as prostitutes.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (24): Invisible energy from 'the hot sun' -
Andrew Jack on the informal economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mwangi drives his battered green Peugeot between Nyeri and Nairobi four
times a day, squeezing in eight passengers - plus additional children
wrapped around the gear lever - at Ks200-250 each in his high-speed 'matatu'
or shared taxi.
He pays a commission of about Ks100 a trip to the office, which provides his
customers, insurance of Ks24,000 a year and a road licence fee. He hopes in
a few years to have saved enough to open a butcher's or a car repair shop.
He also pays no tax.
Mwangi is one of hundreds of thousands of Kenyans not readily visible to the
authorities in their business activities, and yet who are responsible for
much of the heat of the economy.
Drive around any city, and the presence of the informal economy is
ubiquitous: the presence of the informal economy is ubiquitous: hawkers,
hovering in the road at traffic-lights or street corners, offering flowers
or magazines for sale; temporary lean-to shacks in industrial areas selling
food and drink at lunchtimes; sellers of secondhand clothes lined up in
makeshift markets.
There is even a Swahili phrase for the sector: Jua Kali. Literally, it means
'hot sun' - a reference to the sheet-metal workers and car mechanics who
traditionally have bashed away at road-side stalls or under trees, hardly
protected from the heat.
But there is an enormous official ambivalence towards the sector. On the one
hand, the government has recognised in innumerable documents and plans that
the jua kali sector is an essential element within the economy, and one that
needs to be fostered.
On the other, there are innumerable instances in practice of the premises of
jua kali workers being demolished and the individuals concerned driven away
by city councils in response to demands by landowners to clear patches of
land.
'Most entrepreneurs see the city as their enemy, not as city fathers. If you
drive a city van into the jua kali areas, everyone runs away,' says Kimanthi
Mutua, managing director of the Kenyan rural enterprise programme, a charity
which has provided more than 16,000 loans totalling over Ks160m in the past
four years.
Part of the problem is that the phrase is now used so widely - to encompass
the original mechanics, retailers, the informal sector or black market, or
all 'micro' or small and even medium-sized enterprises  - that it is
impossible to readily summarise its characteristics.
'It is unfortunate that jua kali is sometimes used to mean something
sub-standard,' says Mr Mutua. 'These workers serve a big proportion of the
population. They are an important source of quality employment and a nursery
for larger businesses.'
However, it is a sector that is little understood and defies easy
enumeration. A study completed in March attempted for the first time to
assess the significance of micro and small businesses within the country.
The 'Gemini' study (Growth and equity through microenterprise investments
and institutions) concluded that previous calculations had under-estimated
the size by more than a third.
It suggested that there are 910,000 such enterprises, occupying 2m people,
many based in people's homes and 99 per cent with one to 10 workers. Most
are agriculturally-based and in rural areas. Nearly half are controlled by
women, and few seek formal sources of credit. They are adding 270,000 jobs a
year, and 38 per cent are expanding.
These figures are borne out by the work of a number of non-government
organisations which have been providing support to the sector. Promotion of
Rural Initiatives and Development Enterprises (Pride) has been offering
credit-support and training to the sector since the late 1980s.
Jonathan Campaigne, managing director, stresses that he sees himself as an
entrepreneur first, and that Pride's activities are essentially commercial
and profit-making. He despairs of the approach of some to encourage
enterprise, when he believes it is already available in abundance within the
country through the informal sector.
An increasing number of development agencies are now focusing attention on
the informal sector, including the US Agency for International Development -
which helped fund the Gemini study - and the UK's Overseas Development
Administration. More controversially, the World Bank has approved a Dollars
24m programme of vouchers to assist training for the sector.
'Recognition of the jua kali sector is overdone,' says Mr Mutua. 'We are all
crying for action.' He highlights three areas of greatest political need.
The first is premises, and ways in which the authorities allocate and
recognise land where workers can build workshops. 'I am convinced the
shanties in the cities would disappear if they were given land,' he says.
The second is licensing. 'There needs to be streamlining to recognise the
needs of the sector, rather than two or three different departments with
contradictory requirements,' he says, adding that licences are generally
seen simply as a costly hindrance to many traders.
Third is what he calls measures to develop an 'enabling environment' for the
sector: incentives, financial support, anti red-tape measures and
legislation to tackle hindrances to the support of small business. Other
than that, he says, government might do best to 'leave well alone'.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (23): 'The filling in the sandwich' - Asians
have a powerful grip on many sectors of the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What could sum up better the powerful intermingling of Asian and African
cultures on the east coast of Africa than a restaurant in Mombasa called the
Swahili Curry Bowl?
Long-standing residents, economically indispensable but regarded with
suspicion and sometimes hostility, Kenya might best be seen for the Asians -
to borrow an American phrase - as less of a melting pot and more of a salad
bowl.
Some observers talk about Asians as 'the filling in the sandwich',
conveniently providing a political buffer to prevent greater economic
domination of the country by the Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe.
It does not take long to see the influence of the group. The ubiquitous
black African faces in many organisations belie ultimate control by an Asian
or white. Asians have a powerful grip on many sectors of the economy,
notably in leisure and tourism, finance, construction and general commerce.
The economic strength of the community is far out of proportion to their
numbers. At the latest census Asians accounted for an estimated 59,000 out
of a total population of more than 26m: the largest single ethnic group but
far smaller than the black majority.
Yet take an internal flight, eat in a higher-priced restaurant or stay in a
comfortable hotel within Kenya, and the proportion of Asian faces rises
substantially above these levels.
Given the proximity to the Indian sub-continent, the east coast of Africa
was a logical entrepot over many centuries for Asians - who are often
referred to as 'Indians' by black Africans regardless of their country of
origin.
Many of the ancestors of today's settlers came from the states of Gujerat
and Punjab, and arrived in Kenya as indentured construction workers to help
build the railways in the country in the late 19th century for its British
colonisers. Others came to settle with the encouragement of the authorities
after the second world war.
They tend to live in relatively closed communities. There is little social
mixing with other Kenyans and they rarely intermarry. 'It would not work,'
says one Sikh with an arranged Indian marriage whose father came to the
country from Punjab in the 1940s. 'We are from different religions,
cultures, and backgrounds.'
Many have shied away from politics, and often sought support from within
their extended family and religious networks for financial backing rather
than turning to the banks. 'All the banks want is interest and charges,'
says one Indian businessman.
As a result they are far more closely associated with business than any
other aspect of Kenyan society. 'They have set the moral tone for the
government,' says one black Kenyan.
The stereotypes can be overplayed. Yet the Asian community has certainly
often proved the scapegoat at times of political crisis within Kenya. While
escaping the severe persecution and mass flight that took place under Idi
Amin in neighbouring Uganda during the 1970s, many remember tense periods.
Asians point to the 'Africanisation' taking place at that time, when Asians
 -particularly those without Kenyan passports - found it difficult to obtain
licences and permits to trade. There was harassment of individuals,
confiscation of property and Asian-controlled businesses were taken over.
More significantly, they recall 1982, the time of the attempted coup, when
there were reports of riots, looting of shops and rapes. It was this
perception - as much as any real risk - that caused many families to send
their women to relatives in Tanzania and elsewhere during the elections in
1992.
'We keep ourselves separate,' says an Indian Muslim. 'The Africans are a
very different people. They have the intelligence but don't like taking the
responsibility.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (20): Further sites are planned - Export
processing zones: have the benefits faded?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to enthusiasm for a government programme, Silas Ita is hard to
beat. The chief executive of Kenya's export processing zones (EPZs)
authority enthuses about their likely success. 'We have had more than 300
inquiries,' he says.
EPZs were created by law in 1990. The aim was to offer companies
ready-to-occupy units, with all necessary infrastructure and a series of
incentives, such as exemption for 10 years from income tax, value added tax,
import duties and withholding taxes on dividends.
Other benefits included: no exchange controls, on-site customs clearance,
unrestricted employment of foreigners in senior and skilled positions, and
no restrictions on management or technical procedures or the level of
foreign investment.
Sameer Industrial Park, the first EPZ to open, is privately owned by
Firestone East Africa. Clyde Tabor, managing director, says 12 companies
have leased nearly all the space on the 45-acre site, and that he expects to
cover all costs within 10 years. 'It's been a good investment.'
Firestone had decided to develop an industrial park in Nairobi beside its
existing site, and took advantage of EPZ designation once the legislation
was mooted. Sameer provides security and maintenance services, for which it
charges Dollars 3.20 a square foot annually.
Mr Tabor highlights one of the principal benefits for companies locating in
Kenya as the quality and cost of the labour force; and the biggest problem
as the infrastructure.
A further five private EPZ sites have been planned, while a significant
investment in the country has come from Thomas de la Rue, the security
printer, which has been granted the status for a factory on the outskirts of
Nairobi.
Two large government EPZs are also under way with support from the World
Bank and the African Development Bank: the Athi River Zone, near Nairobi's
international airport, which opens this year; and the Mombasa EPZ, in two
phases, construction of which is expected to begin this year.
A number of business executives, who preferred not to be named, are rather
more sceptical of the attractions of the government's EPZ sites and how
rapidly or completely they will be filled. Some of the initial benefits have
faded as liberalisation has reduced the advantages over operation in the
rest of the country. One of them questioned whether the rents charged would
be sufficient, or the level of services adequate.
Another, from a company long established in the country, said: 'We looked at
the idea of moving into one of the zones, but we found we would just be
substituting high customs duties for high rents.'
Mr Ita is frank about some of the shortcomings. 'We are still moving slowly
on how we interface with other organisations,' he says. He highlights goods
to or from EPZs being delayed at customs, which should not be handling them.
He says there are problems with VAT being charged on telephone calls and
electricity bills, in spite of the exemption.
Looking forward, he says he wants to see the government's EPZs privatised,
though this may fall short of a full sale and amount rather to handing over
management, or possibly a lease on the sites, to the private sector.
He says there are no plans by the government to develop additional EPZs, but
that it is considering turning Mombasa into a free port, to compete with
other centres, such as Rotterdam and Dubai, as 'bulk-breaking' centres for
repackages large consignments for re-export.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (18): A fresh start after the storm -
Conservation is about people as well as wildlife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To many observers, Richard Leakey's stormy departure from the Kenya Wildlife
Service revealed the sinister side of Kenyan politics.
His success in saving Kenya's wildlife from the clutches of ivory poachers,
and his fund-raising efforts abroad, put Leakey on a collision course with
those in government who envied his independence and coveted the aid dollars
flowing into KWS conservation projects.
Before Mr Leakey's appointment in 1989, Kenya's wildlife was being decimated
by gangs of armed brigands who roamed the country with impunity.
Three-quarters of the elephant population and almost the entire rhino herd
had been slaughtered. Attacks on tourists were on the rise.
Mr Leakey began the new regime at KWS by sacking 1,640 staff suspected of
corruption. He re-introduced a shoot-to-kill policy against game poachers,
and campaigned for an international ban on the ivory trade. He believed
Kenya's wildlife, which underpins a Dollars 350m-a-year tourist industry,
could be managed in a profitable and sustainable manner. Donors, including
the World Bank and Britain's Overseas Development Agency, backed his plans
by pledging Dollars 300m for KWS projects over 10 years.
To foreign donors, Mr Leakey represented the new face of public service. He
was a man who had taken over a corrupt and dispirited government department
and transformed it into a dynamic parastatal, with the freedom to cut
through red tape and resist political meddling.
Suddenly, in January, he came under attack for arrogance, racism and
corruption. He was told he faced a secret government probe into the workings
of KWS. Neither President Moi nor the KWS board of trustees rallied to his
defence as senior government figures, led by William ole Ntimama, the
minister for local government, called for his resignation.
Mr Leakey believes the smear campaign was orchestrated by 'land-grabbing'
politicians, whom the KWS had frustrated in their attempts to appropriate
vast chunks of Kenya's wildlife sanctuaries to develop hotel resorts or
mining concessions.
He left the director's post in January, was recalled by the president in
March, and resigned again barely two weeks later, saying the government had
placed impossible restrictions on his job.
Mr Leakey's acrymonious departure dismayed conservationists in Kenya and
abroad. It also raised alarm bells in the donor community, who began to fear
their conservation grants might fall prey to political predators.
The government appears to have acknowledged their concern, for instead of
naming a politician to head KWS, it appointed another white Kenyan with
solid credentials in the field of conservation.
David Western has a tough act to follow.
He must persuade the donor community that their conservation funds are in
safe hands. He must avoid charges of empire-building while being in control
of an area the size of Northern Ireland. And he must maintain the trust of
government to be allowed to command an irregular army of game wardens,
reconnaissance vehicles and surveillance aircraft.
He is also aware of the political machinations which hounded his predecessor
from office, and says land-grabbing politicians will have no better luck
with him.
Significantly, Mr Western obtained the reversal of two presidential
directives which caused Mr Leakey to resign: the armed Wildlife Protection
Unit will no longer be placed under the authority of the commissioner of
police; and KWS will regain its financial autonomy from the Tourism and
Wildlife Ministry.
Mr Western, however, believes that, under Mr Leakey's stewardship, KWS had
laid itself open to charges that it was more concerned about animals than
people.
An acute shortage of arable and grazing land, coupled with Kenya's rapid
population growth, have brought communities to the borders of wildlife
sanctuaries. Elephants trample crops. People are maimed, sometimes killed,
by predators. A ban on culling means that wild animals and farming
communities live in increasingly uneasy coexistence.
'There was a lack of sensitivity to how critical the issue had become,' Mr
Western says. He intends to redress the issue by focusing on the 'people
side' of conservation.
He wants to promote landowners' associations, and encourage them to present
their proposals for community-based conservation projects. He believes
certain policies, such as the introduction of culling or hunting licenses,
might be less controversial if they came from local communities.
But the bottom line is money. Local communities, and local politicians in
particular, feel they are not getting their fair share of wildlife revenues.
For Mr Western, juggling the competing financial demands of wildlife and
people will be the toughest act of all.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (19): Enjoying the high life - The delights
and frustrations of a tourist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travelling overnight by train from Mombasa to Nairobi, dining at dusk,
sleeping in a first-class cabin and waking to breakfast as the central
plateau bush rolled past seemed like an elegant way to travel.
Doing so at the peak of the rainy season was the problem. Just a few miles
outside Mombasa, through both sittings for dinner, the train sat for more
than four hours. There was no air-conditioning or lighting. There was no
explanation from staff either, simply a casual shrug as they prepared for a
long delay.
No doubt due in part to the presence of three politicians, the district
controller from Mombasa arrived by car a little before midnight to see what
was happening, while the guard had a chance to blame the British for their
railway tracks, which he said caused the delay because they were sinking as
a result of the rain.
It was the sort of small, quirky incident, endearing after the event, that a
visitor to Kenya might come across during a holiday. And certainly there are
many visitors now coming: more than 650,000 in 1992, and accounting for an
estimated Ks21bn in revenues last year or nearly one third of all export
earnings.
Fears over political turmoil, machinations at the Kenya Wildlife Service
following the resignation of Richard Leakey, and reports of violence against
tourists - including a number of murders such as that of the British nurse
Julie Ward - may all have contributed to declining numbers from a peak in
1990 of nearly 900,000.
But the government has responded with tougher security measures in the
national parks. The appreciation of the Kenyan shilling in the past few
months at a time of relative economic stability may now seem to be as great
a threat to renewed expansion in the number of visitors.
A tempting option for the more adventurous visitor is to climb Mount Kenya,
complete with porters, cooks and guides (a mandatory requirement for entry
to the park). Past the grazing buffalo and elephants, through the sticky
delights of the 'vertical bog' before the scramble through rock and snow
begins, most rise early to avoid afternoon rains and stagger the trip over
three or more days in mountain huts to alleviate the effects of altitude
sickness.
The final ascent of Point Lenana, the highest feasible trek without serious
climbing equipment, at nearly 5,000 metres, typically begins by moonlight at
2am or 3am, to allow for arrival at the peak for sunrise.
In spite of the difficulties, a remarkable number of trekkers make the
attempt often inappropriately dressed in loafers, while their guides gallop
up in Wellington boots carrying only conventional umbrellas for rain gear.
For an extra frisson of fear, do the trip to Mount Kenya by 'matatu' or
shared taxi by night, experiencing local driving at its most adventurous
without seat belts, as the driver lights one cigarette after another in a
petrol-reeking car while overtaking and tail-gating traffic without lights.
These experiences are a far cry for those who seek simpler forms of
relaxation. To them, Kenya means little more than the beaches running north
and south from Mombasa, with hotels offering packages at prices more
attractive than in many other resorts around the world.
At the more expensive end of the market are niche hotels such as Hemingways,
named after the novelist, which specialises in offering deep-sea fishing
trips, or the equally luxurious Lonrho-owned Mount Kenya Safari Club.
For the urbanite, Nairobi offers a large range of cosmopolitan cuisines
including French, Thai and Mongolian, as well as the more indigenous grilled
zebra and wildebeest.
For those tempted to sample a more distinctly African experience, there are
safaris in abundance. Herds of tourists in four-wheel drive vehicles now
trek across the country's game reserves each year in search of wallowing
hippos, hunting cheetahs and mating lions.
At one extreme, visitors can arrange their own safaris or join organised
groups to drive around and camp in the country's parks. At the other end of
the scale, they can stay in high-priced 'tented camps' where they sleep
under canvas.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (21): Noteworthy decision - Why De La Rue
located in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Thomas De La Rue, the security printing company, to open a
significant operation in Kenya was the culmination of a liaison with Africa
dating back more than 130 years.
The British-based company's first bank-note printing order was in 1860, from
Mauritius. In 1988, it finally resolved to shift production into a continent
that has long provided it with substantial business.
Six years later, the first batch of 10m bank notes has just been despatched
to the Central Bank of Kenya from the gleaming new marble-and-steel building
on the outskirts of Nairobi. A second batch is under way, and notes for
another East African country are also being printed.
But why did the company decide to locate in Africa, and in Kenya, with a
site on which it has spent Pounds 10m - an investment it expects to recover
within the next four years?
David Chapplow, general manager, says that growing world demand for the
company's note-printing abilities from its factory in Gateshead, in the
north-east of England, forced it to open a second plant in Malta in 1974. It
gradually moved towards decentralised printing, opening other sites in
Singapore, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. 'We realised in the mid-1980s that our
printing seemed to moving to the Far East, but we had a major customer base
in up to 40 African countries,' he says. 'We wanted to make a significant
investment to strengthen our commitment to our African customers.'
Political stability, economic growth, geographical location and an educated
English-speaking working force were among the temptations that drew the
company to Kenya. 'It had been quite a success story since independence,' Mr
Chapplow says.
In addition, the company then heard that Kenya was planning to develop
export-processing zones, and applied for permission to obtain one, granting
it access to a deferral on taxes and a series of other benefits.
Mr Chapplow has no qualms about the results. 'I've got to say that the
nature of our product is recognised as of sufficient importance that the
government recognises we require some special attention,' he says. 'Delays
have been kept to a minimum, and we've been very impressed by the
co-operation we've received.'
He is sensitive to concerns that other African countries may be reluctant to
buy from a company based in Kenya. 'Once people know we're here to stay, we
hope there would be an African continent pride in having a De La Rue factory
here. We hope to use it as a showplace for Africa.'
The company's building has been designed to expand easily by 30 per cent,
and to have room in the existing space to house a second set of printing
machinery. It already has the capacity to print 1m illion bank notes a day,
and employs about 100 Kenyan staff.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (17): Self-sufficiency a remote goal - Bad
weather and low prices have hit agricultural production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although agricultural production is expected to be a key beneficiary of the
government's market-based reforms, Kenya is unlikely to recover
self-sufficiency in food production in the near future.
The population explosion and the scarcity of arable land mean that
agricultural expansion will have to come from increases in productivity.
Many believe it was the dismal performance of agriculture - mainstay of the
economy and only source of livelihood for 20m people (80 per cent of the
population) - that finally persuaded the government to implement reforms.
Agricultural production contracted by more than 6 per cent between 1991 and
1993, the worst decline since independence. Unfavourable weather and low
world prices for coffee, a significant export commodity, were partly to
blame; but so, too, were policies which subsidised urban consumers at the
expense of farmers, and the inefficiency and corruption within the state
marketing monopolies for staple crops.
When change came, it was sudden and dramatic. Until October 1993, it was
illegal for private traders to import maize into Kenya; until December it
was illegal to move it around the country. Both are now actively encouraged.
Price controls on maize were lifted at the end of 1993, raising the cost of
this foodstuff by 40 per cent in Nairobi.
Contrary to government fears, there were no food riots. But economic
hardship is severe, and is limiting what Kenyans can afford to eat. In the
countryside, the US Agency for International Development believes most rural
families are surviving on a diet of maize, tea, cabbage and potatoes or
cassava. Sugar has become scarce, and when available is scarcely affordable.
For city dwellers, maize flour now accounts for 70 per cent of the daily
caloric intake. Bread has become a luxury, while most families are
struggling to maintain their consumption levels of vegetable oil, milk and
sugar.
The National Cereals and Produce Board, the former grain marketing monopoly,
has begun to privatise some of its warehouses. Eventually, its role will be
confined to maintaining strategic grain reserves and acting as a buyer and
seller of last resort. But it will remain active in the import and marketing
of grain, while the private sector finds its feet in the newly liberalised
environment.
The price and marketing reforms were all the more remarkable, in that they
were implemented during Kenya's worst drought of the past 10 years. In the
heavily populated Eastern Province, the failure of the December rains wiped
out half the maize crop. Maasai herdsmen in the Great Rift Valley have lost
more than 275,000 head of cattle. The government says 5m people - one-fifth
of the population - are in need of emergency food handouts.
About 1.7m tonnes, or just over half the national maize consumption, will
have to be met by a combination of commercial imports, government purchases
and food donations. And although the rains returned in April, meteorologists
say it is too early to assess their impact on the September harvest.
Other factors have depressed agricultural production. Ethnic clashes have
forced an estimated 300,000 people of the mainly Kikuyu farming community to
abandon their homesteads in the Rift Valley, according to church
organisations. Human rights groups have blamed government politicians for
instigating the conflict between Maasai and Kalenjin herdsmen and the
Kikuyu. The repercussions of the conflict go well beyond a decline in
agricultural output. Many Kenyans fear the countryside could slide into
civil war unless the government undertakes greater efforts to restore peace.
Agriculturalists are also concerned about the marked decline in the use of
fertilisers since prices were liberalised in 1992. The government is
considering the reintroduction of subsidies for fertilisers and agricultural
credit to reverse this worrying trend. The distribution of sub-standard
planting seed by the state-owned Kenya Seed Company - another parastatal
plagued by mismanagement and corruption - has also lowered productivity.
All these factors are making self-sufficiency in food production an ever
distant goal. The government estimates that maize production would have to
rise by 4 per cent a year to eliminate the need for imports by the turn of
the century. Only significant improvements in yields could achieve this
growth, as Kenya's marginal agricultural land offers only limited potential.
At the same time, the need to import increasing quantities of maize, wheat,
rice, sugar and vegetable oil to feed a rapidly expanding population has
eroded Kenya's agricultural trade surplus. The positive trade balance fell
from nearly Dollars 500m in 1990 to Dollars 288m in 1992, and is estimated
to have fallen further in 1993.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (15): Brewing up new ways to boost
production - Tea and coffee are crucial elements of the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evian Muriu, group manager for the central tea and coffee group of Brooke
Bond Kenya, points proudly to a series of small rectangular pits recently
dug in the ground between rows of tea bushes in a plantation in central
Kenya.
The staggered holes are a simple method that could have a powerful effect in
preventing soil erosion. Their creation is one of a number of recent
measures designed to boost productivity at the Mabroukie tea estate, and on
other plots controlled by many different farmers around the country.
It is a reminder of the importance placed by growers on investment in tea,
at a time when the drought of the past few months has threatened a sharp
drop in productivity for one of Kenya's main generators of foreign exchange.
Last year, tea sales to other countries earned an estimated Ks18.6bn, or 28
per cent of all exports.
It was second only to tourism at Ks21.3bn as a source of foreign exchange,
and contributed an estimated 10 per cent of the world's crop.
In a measure of the traditional significance of tea and coffee to the Kenyan
economy, a national law forbids farmers to pull up any bushes of either crop
to convert land to other uses. The most recent National Development Plan -
while calling for self-sufficiency in food - continues to urge the
maintenance of the cultivation of export crops such as tea.
Companies such as Brooke Bond stress their continued commitment to tea, and
point to a new breeding programme for 'the golden clone' of high-yielding
varieties. They say their main restriction is lack of access to new land to
plant for additional tea crops.
More challenging is boosting productivity in some of the smaller farms,
which account for about 55 per cent of the crop spread between some 200,000
producers. According to a recent report by the US agricultural attache in
Kenya, an increase in monthly advance payments and elimination of a 5 per
cent presumptive tax on growers have helped boost incomes, while a remaining
problem is inadequate processing capacity during peak periods.
Productivity - achieved through a combination of rising yields and growing
land under cultivation - has continued to rise consistently in the past few
years, increasing almost uninterrupted from 56.7m kilos in 1975 to 211.2m
kilos last year. In 1994, month-on-month figures have been down sharply on
last year following drought, although rain in the past few weeks has begun
to restore confidence.
Liberalisation has brought substantial changes to the sector. There are now
no price controls on tea, factories can market their output without
government involvement, and exporters can hold on to earned foreign
exchange. At least half of all production must still be sold by auction,
which has converted from shilling to dollar sales.
One challenge for Kenyan tea is to diversify its markets - something that
marketing efforts have failed to achieve. About 60 per cent of tea consumed
in the UK is Kenyan, and represented last year more than 39 per cent of all
foreign sales. A further 26 per cent went to Pakistan and 15 per cent to
Egypt, with little spread of market share in the past few years. Foreign
sales have not grown as fast as increased production.
While tea remains highly lucrative, coffee has until recently undergone a
substantial slump which has forced many growers away from the crop - if
necessary simply neglecting their bushes if they do not want to risk pulling
them up. Coffee output in 1992-93 dropped to 73,000 tonnes from 90,000
tonnes a year earlier.
Once it was a mainstay of the economy responsible for a boom in the country,
reflecting the high quality, premium-priced arabica beans it produces. Then
world prices collapsed. Last year it accounted for just Ks11m or 16 per cent
of exports.
Some observers are optimistic that things are now beginning to recover.
Export earnings can now be retained in dollars, and producers can receive
proceeds of the sales of their own crop rather than simply taking their
proportion from pooled sales organised by the Coffee Board.
At least equally important, world coffee prices are beginning to recover.
But it will take several seasons before a consistently improved price will
be reflected in higher yields.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (16): A garden of plenty - Horticulture is a
vital source of foreign exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I doubt whether most people who buy carnations realise where they come
from,' says Richard Fairburn, indicating with a wave of his hand an expanse
of greening stalks growing under the hot sun.
Nor probably do many buying green beans and Brussels sprouts from the
shelves of Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK know that the single largest business
supplying fresh produce is based just a little further up the same road.
Yet the area around Lake Naivasha, in central Kenya, has been turned into
one of the largest areas of privately-owned floriculture and horticulture in
the world - and a vital source of foreign exchange for the country. It
claims to have, for example, more roses under cultivation than in the entire
UK.
Floriculture - a world market worth an estimated Pounds 16bn last year  -
has traditionally been dominated by the Dutch. Dutch companies were among
those that began growing flowers outside Europe to meet fast-expanding
demand in the 1970s; and one of these, Oserian, is now among the largest
Kenyan-based suppliers.
Mr Fairburn is director of cut flowers for Sulmac, the other large Kenyan
producer, which was bought by Brooke Bond, itself now ironically owned by a
partly Dutch company, Unilever. He highlights a number of benefits of
growing flowers in Kenya.
Of primary importance is the climate. Year-round high temperatures mean that
supplies are available outside the European growing season. Of course, it
can also produce during the European summer - and Sulmac is already
cultivating flowers for eight months each year.
Growing in Kenya also offers low capital and labour costs, access to freight
(which is full southbound and needs cargo for the return journeys northward
into Europe), a relatively stable political environment and no export
tariffs.
On the other hand, Mr Fairburn points out that international communication
can be difficult, pests and diseases haunt the tropical climate, the
infrastructure is poor, imports are costly, there is no local research and
development facility, and the image of Kenyan produce is variable.
Perhaps the most important hindrance is freight rates. Given the need to
rush flowers and vegetables to market, they must be air-freighted, which
accounts for half or more of total production costs.
George Roy, finance director of Homegrown, which produces and prepares both
flowers and vegetables for UK supermarkets such as Marks &amp; Spencer, says
that the government reduced aviation tax in response to concerns from
growers, but that the airline companies have yet to respond by lowering
rates.
In spite of the climate, cultivation is still not easy. Flowers require
water every day, and Kenya's supplies are erratic.
The heat creates other problems. Homegrown has introduced pink-tinted
greenhouses - to keep out the sun and reduce the risk of colours fading.
The heat also means that the flowers must be scrupulously protected once
picked. The cuttings have to be quickly chilled and kept in insulated
containers.
A number of smaller suppliers, relying on shipping to move their produce,
have run into difficulties, seeing their flowers rot on the quayside in
Mombasa, or have been unable to negotiate cold storage and rapid freighting.
Many of the same issues apply to the production of vegetables in the region.
Homegrown is developing links with a number of the UK supermarkets. However,
demand is much more specialised than for flowers. 'British consumers like
their vegetables pre-prepared,' says Mr Roy, contrasting the position with
those elsewhere in Europe, such as the French, who prepare vegetables in
their raw state.
Equally, Alan Wood, managing director of Brooke Bond Kenya, warns that,
while a few years ago horticulture and floriculture were proving highly
profitable, growing competition is now making the field far tougher for both
new and existing growers.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (14): Living with low consumption - Industry
has been forced to look to export markets for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing industry, emerging from three difficult years of sluggish
growth and escalating inflation, is restructuring to face the challenge of
increased foreign and domestic competition.
Kenyan industry has traditionally played second fiddle to agriculture in
terms of employment and contribution to GDP, and been in third place behind
tourism in foreign exchange earnings.
Manufacturing accounts for more than 13 per cent of GDP - about half that of
agriculture - and 13 per cent of wage employment, compared with
agriculture's 19 per cent. In 1991, its foreign earnings were estimated at
Dollars 250m, way below agriculture's Dollars 620m and easily outstripped by
tourism's Dollars 440m.
The sector is dominated by food-processing, beverages and tobacco, which
between them account for 40 per cent of value-added. Drought and weak
agricultural performance impacts directly on manufacturing in two main ways
 -reduced volumes for processing, and depressed rural demand for locally
manufactured consumer goods.
With sliding domestic living standards, mounting unemployment and depressed
levels of investment, industry has been forced to look to export markets for
growth opportunities. In 1992, manufactured exports accounted for less than
20 per cent of the total, but preliminary central bank numbers for last year
suggest an increase to over 25 per cent.
In 1991, more than 90 per cent of Kenya's imports were raw materials,
intermediate goods and capital equipment. Almost 40 per cent of imports were
industrial supplies, underlining the extent to which industry was vulnerable
to import curbs. While liberalisation and devaluation have made these more
costly, access to inputs has improved dramatically. As a result, production
scheduling and inventory management are more efficient.
Industrialists have two main complaints: infrastructural deterioration, and
the absence of a level playing-field. The latter is chiefly a reference to
corruption at customs - the evasion of tariffs and VAT by importers, who are
able to bring in and market finished goods at prices well below those of
Kenyan manufacturers who pay duty in the normal way. Government hopes that
the introduction of pre-shipment requirements for imports will close this
loophole. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM) is also seeking a 25
per cent to 30 per cent duty differential between raw materials and imported
finished products.
In a recent paper on the problems that deter investment in manufacturing,
the KAM pinpoints infrastructural inadequacy. It wants the management of
Kenya Railways - like the airline - to be entrusted to 'management experts'
in the short term, followed by privatisation. The same formula is advocated
for the ports.
A third cause for complaint is the legislation precluding manufacturers from
owning and operating their own distribution networks. Bata, the
multinational shoe manufacturer, says it could bring down costs and prices
in the Kenyan market if it were allowed to operate its own retail network.
Bata is less critical of the infrastructure than other industrialists.
'We've not had to stop working because of power cuts,' says the managing
director, Mr A. Fernandez, though he agrees that the roads are poor and that
it's often easier to make an international telephone call than to get a
Nairobi number.
Other industrialists speak in similar vein. As market growth has slowed, so
companies are finding new, more cost-effective, ways of reaching customers.
Output growth, which averaged 5.5 per cent annually in the late 1980s, fell
below 2 per cent in the 1991-93 period, forcing industry to re-engineer its
domestic market strategy as well as to seek export outlets.
To succeed in a low-consumption economy, says another manufacturer, is not
to downgrade technology, but to make it more functional 'so that we can
deliver what people want at a lower price'.
Some, such as Glaxco, investing Pounds 4m in a plant to manufacture its
ulcer drug Zantac for the African market, also see Kenya as a favourable
location for new investment, infrastructural deficiencies and political
imponderables notwithstanding.
Interestingly, there is little enthusiasm among established industrialists
for export-processing zones. 'They are only a gimmick,' says one, adding:
'If you have a level playing-field and reasonable taxes, as we do here
(profits are taxed at 35 per cent), free zones don't add any value.'
There is still much to be done to create the necessary enabling investment
climate. A recent World Bank report notes that a company needs an average of
15 licences a year, the processing of which costs an average of 233
man-hours annually. Large businesses need 49 licences at a processing cost
of over 800 man-hours.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (13): Consultants initiate recovery - Kenya
Airways may be privatised within the next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eighteen months ago, privatisation of Kenya Airways would have been
dismissed as sheer fantasy, but with the airline turning in a profit in the
year to March 1994, a sell-off this year or next is on the cards.
The remarkable turnround at Kenya Airways is reassuring evidence that
parastatal reform is not as elusive as most African experience might
suggest.
In 1991, the government appointed a new board, charged with commercialising
the airline that had accumulated losses to March 1993 of some Ks6.2bn
(Dollars 110m). Two years ago, the board appointed Speedwing Consultants,
the independent consultancy arm of British Airways, to advise how the
airline should be commercialised and prepared for privatisation.
Speedwing produced a hard-hitting report which recommended that the airline
be run on strictly commercial lines. This would mean eliminating political
interference, sweeping management changes, a major overhaul of the
commercial division with a new focus on customer service, and tight
financial controls.
The report was accepted, and three highly experienced airline executives,
who had worked for small, low-cost airlines in the UK, were appointed on
three-year contracts as chief executive, and to head the commercial and
finance divisions.
The new management team has stuck closely to the consultants' report. In
classic turnround mould, top management was restructured, with political
appointees being replaced by professionals. Eleven managers were retrenched
and about 9 per cent of the workforce allowed, or encouraged, to take early
retirement. Conscious of the need to develop a customer-first culture, in
the course of a month the entire workforce of some 2 700 people was put
through a day-long course, 'Putting People First'.
The new team targeted foreign exchange costs, concluding that it could
provide 90 per cent of the required services with just 60 per cent of the
existing aircraft capacity. Accordingly, one leased aircraft was returned to
the lessors at a saving of some Dollars 18m over five years. Other
hard-currency costs were pared to the point where, today, the airline's
foreign currency earnings exceed forex costs.
Management found it could provide 110 per cent of previous volumes with 60
per cent of aircraft capacity. This was achieved by a combination of volume
growth and increased market share - not higher fares in international
markets. In the domestic market, devaluation and rapid inflation forced the
airline to double fares over the past year; domestic services are now
breaking even, while foreign routes are profitable. In the year to March
1994, Kenya Airways exceeded its break-even target, earning a surplus of
Ks450m. 'We were able to send the minister of finance a cheque for Ks280m,
becoming the first parastatal to give money back to the government,' says
chief executive Brian Davies proudly.
Profitability is not everything; Kenya Airways is also giving customers a
far better service. Management set a target of 80 per cent of departures
leaving within 15 minutes of schedule, achieving an average of 75 per cent
in 1993-4, compared with less than half previously. 'Indeed,' says Mr
Davies, 'some weren't departing at all]' A recent travel survey named the
airline as runner-up (with BA) to South African Airways as the best carrier
to Africa.
With the airline in the black, the next step is privatisation. Mr Davies
says this could be done by the end of 1994, in line with the programme
agreed with the IMF and the World Bank. For this to happen, the government
will need to clear up the balance sheet by writing off over Ks4.5bn of debt.
While no firm plans have been settled yet, the likelihood is that the
government will hold on to a significant minority stake, drawing a major
European airline into a coalition, also with a sizeable minority holding.
The rest of the equity could be placed among Kenyan institutions; the
airline staff, through an employee share ownership scheme; and a share issue
on the Nairobi Stock Exchange. That would ensure that well over half the
equity was held in Kenya.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (12): Confrontation looms - Privatisation is
ahead of schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parastatal reform in Kenya is a many-headed hydra. It has three distinct
dimensions: the technical and financial, the political and the managerial.
Each is horrendously challenging.
Reform of public enterprise cannot be achieved without head-on confrontation
with the political mafia, for whom the parastatals remain one of a
diminishing number of sources of patronage.
Nor can the problem be tackled without getting to grips with the parastatal
sectors' endemic financial weakness and heavy indebtedness. Above all,
reform requires far-reaching change in terms of corporate culture - finding
a new breed of suitably-qualified, experienced and appropriately-rewarded
public enterprise managers. Men and women must be appointed for their
professionalism, and not because they represent a particular ethnic group or
powerful family.
These are tall orders, and it is hardly surprising that parastatal reform is
at the eye of the storm, given the impossibility of sustaining structural
adjustment without root-and-branch parastatal restructuring.
Kenyan officials agree that little progress has been made in restructuring
the 33 'strategic' public enterprises - railways, ports, electricity, water,
posts and telecommunications - but the turnround at Kenya Airways and the
remarkable transformation of the Central Bank of Kenya, underscore the major
contribution to reform achieved by personnel change at the top.
Officials insist, however, that reform is ahead of schedule in liquidating
and privatising the 207 'commercially oriented public enterprises with
direct or indirect public ownership'.
Three years ago, the government published a two-dimension classification of
its 240 public enterprises:
StrategicNon-strategic
Viable RetainSell
Non- RestructureLiquidate
viableand retain
By April 1994, 31 companies had been liquidated, including 27 that were
either dormant or insolvent. A further seven had been sold by the receivers,
five by competitive bidding and 15 sold under pre-emption rights, allowing
other shareholders to increase their equity stakes.
Heightening the public perception that the sell-off is going slowly, only
five have been privatised through the Nairobi Stock Exchange: Bamburi
Portland Cement (in 1991); partial sales of the government's controlling
equity stake in the Housing Finance Company and Uchumi Supermarket (in
1992); and CMC Holdings and East African Oxygen last year.
In total, 63 companies - about 30 per cent of the government's non-strategic
portfolio - have been divested, in four cases, partially. Another 33,
pushing the number to just under half the total, are being processed, with
15 having reached the point of sale. These include some of the better-known
businesses in which the state has a stake that are being sold under
pre-emption rights agreements: Carnaud Metal Box, Chloride Exide (UK),
Everready Batteries, Associated Battery Manufacturers and Firestone East
Africa.
By the end of this year, the government says, it will have sold another 25
parastatals, including Kenya Airways, at least two sugar factories, all
cotton board ginneries and the freight-handling services at Nairobi and
Mombasa airports. Over half the remaining non-strategics will be sold in two
roughly equal tranches in 1995 and 1996.
The policy framework paper, agreed with the IMF last year, commits Kenya to
'significant and irreversible public sector reform' - an armslength,
transparent owner-management relationship between the government and the
management of strategic parastatals.
The government has promised to eliminate indirect subsidies to parastatals
(which averaged 5.5 per cent of GDP during the 1989-1992 period) by 1997.
Public utilities will be given tariff autonomy, subject to appropriate
regulatory controls for monopolies and individual performance contracts must
be n place by mid-1995.
A corporate plan has been approved for Kenya Railways, including the sale of
peripheral activities, limiting freight services to 23 main-line stations,
and staff retrenchment. The posts and telecommunication functions of the
Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation are being separated, and a
performance contract is due by mid-year.
Given Kenya's record, the temptation to write this programme off as
hopelessly ambitious would be overwhelming, but for the success achieved -
in remarkably little time - at Kenya Airways. But whether the politicians
and other vested interests are willing to allow other parastatals to follow
Kenya Airways through rehabilitation and eventual privatisation is
problematic, to say the least.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (11): A spanner in AVA's works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dave Williamson gives short shrift to the 'briefcase merchants' of the
International Monetary Fund, and other advocates of Kenya's recent switch
towards the economic liberalisation which he believes has helped to
undermine his company.
'They are quite happy to travel here first class and sit in a five-star
hotel in Nairobi where they can get good meals and draught beer without ever
seeing the country,' he says. 'They're totally divorced from what Kenya
actually needs.'
It is a criticism he also levels at some Kenyan politicians, who he feels
have often been reluctant to come and see the effects of their policies and
practices on the operations of Associated Vehicle Assemblers (AVA), a part
government-owned and entirely Kenyan-based vehicle assembly plant.
Mr Williamson is works director of AVA, based in Mombasa, which assembles up
to 40 different types of car and truck on contract. The company was founded
in 1977 with shareholdings from the state-controlled Industrial Development
Bank, the treasury, Lonrho and Inchcape (which later sold its stake to
Marshalls).
Production volume peaked in 1987 with just over 9,000 units assembled. Last
year it had slumped to fewer than 1,500, with staff numbers cut from a high
of nearly 700 in 1979 to 152. 'If we go any lower, we're in serious
trouble,' he says.
Yet AVA says it is still making a profit. It has done so primarily by
cutting staff and maintaining a pay freeze for three years. In the past few
months the plant has also been closed for weeks at a time to save costs.
However, the company's combined bill of corporation, pay-as-you-earn, local
authority taxes, duty and VAT has in many years equalled or exceeded the
recorded level of pre-tax profits.
What Mr Williamson most objects to is the fact that, while AVA produces
locally with Kenyan staff and Kenyan investors cars tailored for the local
market, what he calls 'the disaster' of liberalisation seems primarily to
have benefited car importers.
He resents the 'privateers' in the informal sector who, he believes, avoid
paying any duties or taxes on cars. Some claim imported cars are for
personal use, and others that the vehicles are secondhand, making them
subject to lower duties. 'There are an awful lot of new-looking Mercedes
driving around with old number plates on,' he says.
'On the day in the budget last year when they changed the duty structure to
allow the importation of commercial vehicles, the ro-ro ships started
arriving,' he says. 'There was a dramatic change. The cake was suddenly
divided into a million pieces rather than a thousand.'
Equally, he says that very few Kenyans have sufficient income to buy cars,
while those that can tend to favour anything built overseas to local
manufactures. Attempts to export to African countries have proved equally
frustrating with reluctance by its neighbours to buy from a direct rival.
AVA encompasses a number of low-technology approaches. It has refused to
switch from packing crates to container boxes for parts arriving by sea, for
example. He says crates are more flexible, cheaper to freight, and can be
simply stored outside at the factory.
To meet the demands of the car manufacturers, AVA has computerised storage
of the 40,000 components which arrive each day. 'The only other thing
computerised is payroll - and I still think we could do that as easily by
hand,' he says.
Periodic electricity shortages during the afternoon means that the company
has now shifted all working hours into the morning and lunchtime to avoid
power cuts.
While it takes five times as many staff-hours to assemble a car in Kenya
than a western assembler, Mr Williamson is sceptical of the value of
automation - particularly when he says he can obtain and train high quality
staff to do the work unhurriedly.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (9): Brooke Bond's lasting brew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The changes in the Kenyan economy during the past two years have been good
news for Brooke Bond Kenya, the Unilever subsidiary which produces tea,
coffee and flowers within the country.
'The new financial regime within the government has done a superb job,' says
Alan Wood, managing director. 'I can't think of anything more you could
really ask for.'
While political systems have come and gone - colonialism giving way to
independence, Africanisation, single-party and now multi-party rule - the
plantations now controlled by Brooke Bond in Kenya have remained, dating
back as far as the 1920s.
The company has three tea estates - the largest at Kericho covering 7,000
hectares - and altogether accounts for about 14 per cent of Kenyan tea
production. It has a smaller operation - of about 500 hectares - under
coffee cultivation.
In addition, in the late 1970s it expanded into horticulture with the
acquisition of Sulmac, which produces carnations, roses and other flowers at
Lake Naivasha for export primarily to Western Europe. 'The European market
has been able to absorb almost anything you send,' says Mr Wood.
One of the biggest challenges facing the company in Kenya in the past has
been inflation, which has been running at above 35 per cent a year. Until
recently, the company has also had to cope with the effects of devaluation
of the Kenyan shilling. 'Devaluation became a significant management
challenge,' says Mr Wood.
The effects were magnified because - like other exporters - the company had
restrictions until recently on the amount of foreign currency it could
retain. 'Your costs are instant, but there is a delay of some time between
production and sale - we have a 33-day target - during which you can incur
an exchange gain or loss,' he says.
In response to inflation and currency problems, Brooke Bond and other
businesses carried stock at what he calls 'fairly high levels' with working
capital 'more than strictly appropriate'.
The position has now eased, with companies allowed to retain their foreign
earnings, a shift in the coffee auction prices from shillings to dollars, an
apparent stabilisation in prices, and recently even a revaluation of the
shilling against other currencies.
As a result, the company had to develop treasury and cash management skills
not previously required. 'We are dealing with a changing environment where
we used to have a stable environment over the years,' says Mr Wood. 'We pay
more attention now to where the cash is and how to use it to best
advantage.'
Other important changes brought by liberalisation that he highlights as
significant are the relaxation on distributing dividends, the introduction
of market exchange rates, the removing of import licences, and the abolition
of price controls on commodities.
He says that Brooke Bond does not plan additional investment in Kenya purely
because of liberalisation, but stresses that in no way reflects the
company's lack of commitment to the country. 'We have been here for 60
years, investing steadily throughout. We have confidence in the tea
industry. Liberalisation has reaffirmed our commitment.'
He says the company's main restriction has been acquiring new land for
expansion. Consequently, its efforts have been focused on boosting yields
and productivity through breeding programmes.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (8): Tough, but Barclays shines - How is the
private sector adjusting to the government's economic reforms? FT writers
provide four illustrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS and FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with exporters, the financial sector has been the main beneficiary of
liberalisation - a development underlined in the sparkling 1993 results
reported by Barclays Bank of Kenya. Pre-tax profits more than doubled in the
year to December 31 with earnings per share up 88 per cent.
Three main factors account for this impressive performance at a time of
stagflation in the economy. Income was boosted by high lending rates - a net
interest margin between overdraft and deposit rates, averaging 7.4 per cent
(according to official Central Bank of Kenya figures), while lending was up
28 per cent over the year.
More important was the return on money market operations - windfall gains
from holding a substantial portfolio of high-yield treasury bills. Retail
banks with a large customer base, were able to source funds from current and
savings deposits at average rates of 18.5 per cent and 14.75 per cent,
reinvesting them in treasury bills at an average rate of 57 per cent between
April and December. This did not apply to banks forced to source funds from
the interbank market, where rates were higher than on treasury bills.
The third factor was the substantial increase in the volume of foreign
exchange business, arising from the liberalisation of exchange controls, the
requirement for tourist operators to make payments in foreign currency and
the scope to exploit profit opportunities in highly volatile market
conditions. Barclays targeted firms with foreign currency revenues. There
were windfall profits to be made, says Barclays Kenya managing director Bob
Bird, 'provided you got it right and didn't take undue risks'.
Even so, 1993 was a tough year. Most of the participants in the country's 26
banks had never operated with market-driven exchange and interest rates.
Barclays got its timing right, bringing in a foreign exchange dealer from
London in November 1992 to prepare for liberalisation.
Business volumes - and costs - expanded dramatically as the Central Bank
delegated the issue of import licences to the banks. At the same time bank
systems were simply not geared to cope with foreign exchange accounting
forced on them by the introduction - and subsequent expansion - of
retentions accounts. 'We anticipated liberalisation,' says Mr Bird, 'but
with the rapid growth in volumes and inward inflows of foreign exchange, we
ran up against infrastructural problems. We had to train managers and staff
to be more market responsive, while alerting them to the pitfalls of foreign
currency exposure.'
The nature of bank lending changed, too. The pre-reform period was one of
hand-to-mouth reliance on scarce letters of credit (LCs), but as Kenya's
short-term credit rating improved and reserves rose to reach four months
import cover while customer demand fell, it became far easier to open LCs.
At the same time, the name of the business game had changed. In a controlled
system inventory management by importers and manufacturers was based on
'just-in-case' principles. With long supply lead times, due to the
cumbersome import licensing process and foreign exchange scarcity,
management was forced to carry huge inventories. With liberalisation, lead
times shortened dramatically and, faced with high borrowing rates and
falling domestic demand, business has run down its stocks and its bank
borrowing.
One might have expected the roller-coaster business conditions of the past
year to result in a fair number of corporate failures, but that has not
happened. Mr Bird says there have been 'remarkably few' corporate failures
and some surprisingly good results, given the difficult business climate.
'Nobody from the top 200 seems to be suffering too much, perhaps because a
lot of them have switched heavily into exporting.'
Barclays' 1993 performance will be a hard act to follow. Money market
margins are far slimmer today, and more traditional overdraft lending is a
better bet, with the spread between retail deposit and lending rates up to
16 per cent in February, according to Central Bank figures. But demand is
relatively weak, and there is the danger of being caught by the reversal in
the forex market if - later in the year - the shilling overshoots again, as
it did last year, and starts to depreciate.
Bankers say that one of the most important changes of the past year has been
the rehabilitation of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). Until the appointment
of Micah Cheserem, an accountant formerly employed by Unilever, as governor,
the central bank, and with it monetary policy and bank supervision, was in
disarray. There was little communication between the banks and the CBK, bank
supervision was virtually non-existent and the economy was rocked by a
series of financial scams, estimated to have cost the country - and the
government - tens of millions of dollars.
Mr Cheserem changed all that, revamping CBK's top management, stamping out
corruption, strengthening supervision and tightening monetary policy, first
by mopping up liquidity through the issue of treasury bills and subsequently
by raising the statutory cash ratio of the banks from 8 per cent to 20 per
cent of their deposits, thereby squeezing their lending capacity.
Money supply growth of 26 per cent during 1993 is still too high. Although
lending to the public sector declined 11 per cent last year and private
sector borrowing was flat, money supply grew strongly, fuelled by the inflow
of foreign exchange as exports increased and capital flight was reversed by
the combination of foreign payments liberalisation and high nominal domestic
interest rates. Kenya's net foreign asset position swung from a negative
Dollars 100m in April to a plus number of more than Dollars 330m by the
year-end.
Despite these gains, the imbalance between a loose fiscal and a restrictive
monetary stance means that the banks will remain in the frontline of the
battle against inflation over the next year. Getting rid of the T-bill
mountain, maintaining positive real interest rates - they are substantially
negative at present - and managing foreign currency positions in a year in
which the exchange rate overshoot can be expected to reverse itself suggests
that 1994 will be another busy, though almost certainly, less spectacular
year for the banks.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (10): Bamburi's profits reinforced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the near-continuous and deafening noise of the kilns and grinders,
there is suddenly an unusual silence at the Bamburi cement plant. A power
cut has halted the heavy machinery.
Periodic failures in the supply are a costly, frustrating and frequent
problem for the factory, which consumes the largest single share - up to 5
per cent - of Kenya's electricity generation capacity.
However, Robert Brenneisen, managing director of Bamburi Portland Cement,
who joined the company at its creation in 1954, is more optimistic than he
was during the previous decade. He welcomes a series of radical economic
reforms that have improved its ability to make a profit in the past three
years.
The company was formed as a joint venture of Cementia Holding of Switzerland
and Amalgamated Roadstone of the UK, which was replaced in 1964 by Blue
Circle. The government holds 16 per cent of the equity through the National
Social Security Fund, and a further 10 per cent is quoted on the Nairobi
stock exchange. It now produces 1.2m tonnes a year, much of which is sold
locally, and the rest exported to countries including Mauritius, Reunion,
Sri Lanka and the Seychelles.
'We were suffering for many years from price control,' says Mr Brenneisen.
He points to a six-inch-thick pile of documents on the shelf behind his
desk. 'All these are submissions to the government to raise prices or remove
price control.'
Price control was introduced in 1972, and for several years the cap
increased in line with rising costs. But by the early 1980s, the rises came
too late and too small. 'We were subsidising the building industry for years
but it nearly crippled the company,' says Mr Brenneisen. 'We only just
survived. It was only possible because we had very tolerant shareholders.'
The controls were finally lifted three years ago, and he says the company
has since been investing in capital expenditure and paying off its debts to
make good the losses of the 1980s.
In comparison, Bamburi's other difficulties are more trivial. Like many
others, the company has benefited from the removal of restrictions on
holding foreign currency. Since it constructed its own port facility and has
staff working full-time on customs clearance, it has had less trouble than
many in handling imports and exports. However, Mr Brenneisen still raises
concerns over delays until recently in granting import licences and duties.
'As a business we are impatient with the parastatals,' he says. 'We like to
see things done yesterday. They take their business with a far too casual
stride. They can't use excuses all the time.'
The company has struggled to obtain sufficient rolling stock for internal
transport of its cement from Kenya Railways, and has had to ship some cement
at greater cost by road. It has also suffered from a lack of fresh water as
a result of drought.
Given an abundant supply of low-cost, motivated labour, the company has not
seen the need to invest heavily in automated processes. It employs about 870
staff, although a similar capacity plant in Europe could do the same job
with about 150. Mr Brenneisen says: 'The factory compares very well in
performance with any in the world. We feel it is not morally justified to
automate.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (7): Financial profligacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest five-star hotel to open in Nairobi has been seized by the Kenya
Central Bank in an attempt to recoup billions of shillings that went astray
in the run-up to the December 1992 elections and their aftermath.
Kenyans are only beginning to count the cost of the financial profligacy
which linked senior Kanu politicians, Asian businessmen, a group of local
banks and the former top management at the central bank.
One confidential report into the complex series of financial transactions
estimates the cost to the public purse was Ks30bn (Dollars 430m), or about
10 per cent of gross domestic product.
The central bank began to lose its grip on monetary policy when banking
licences were liberally awarded in 1992 as a vehicle for financing the
re-election campaigns of ruling politicians. The 'political banks' engaged
in dubious money-spinning ventures, relating to the construction of
glamorous buildings in Nairobi and claiming generous government rebates for
alleged exports of gold and diamonds.
Emboldened by their early success, some of these banks then obtained more
than Ks17bn from the central bank in exchange for a promise to repay the
unsecured loan in dollars at a later date. The loan was never repaid. In
addition, the central bank is investigating the theft of Dollars 117m of
foreign exchange bearer bonds from its vaults and the possible forgery of
other central bank certificates.
Micah Cheserem, appointed central bank governor last July, is trying to
clear up the mess and recover as much public money as possible.
Three commercial banks are under liquidation.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (6): The conditions get tougher - Aid donors
find themselves in an uncomfortable role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six months after the restoration of fast-disbursing aid, Kenya's donors face
an awkward dilemma.
Most are torn between the wish to continue supporting finance minister
Musalia Mudavadi's economic reforms and growing alarm at Kenya's
deteriorating political environment. A mid-year review of Kenya's overall
progress is likely to be as difficult as a Solomonic judgment.
If the assessment leans too heavily on the government's political
shortcomings, anti-reformers could have fresh ammunition to undermine Mr
Mudavadi and his programme. Kenya's aid partners, however, have come to
believe that the harassment and incarceration of opposition politicians,
ethnic cleansing in the Rift Valley, and the government's crackdown on the
press are not random occurrences, but the actions of a regime which has not
shed its authoritarian instincts despite the formal trappings of democracy.
Since November 1991 - when donors suspended about one-quarter of Kenya's aid
flows, in protest against official corruption and human rights abuses - the
policy linking aid levels to good government has transformed the donor
community into the final arbiters of Kenya's political and economic
progress. It is an uncomfortable role.
The government of Kenya clearly regards some aid conditions as an
infringement of its sovereignty, while opposition parties think foreign aid
can and should be used as a lever to extract more political reforms.
It seemed no accident that President Daniel arap Moi legalised opposition
parties only days after the suspension of balance-of-payments aid in
November 1991. But having failed to dislodge President Moi from power in the
1992 elections, the opposition felt betrayed when donors restored
balance-of-payments aid in November 1993.
It was not, however, an unqualified victory for the Kanu government.
Donors pledged Dollars 850m for 1994 - significantly below aid levels
prevalent before the 1991 freeze - and the money is likely to be disbursed
by drip-feed as the list of conditions gets longer. Donors expressed
cautious support for Mr Mudavadi's reforms, but said they wanted to see a
consistent record before considering more handouts. They also told officials
the government should prosecute corruption cases.
'The government clearly expected a bigger trade-off from adopting a
multi-party system and toeing the IMF and World Bank line,' says one
ambassador in Nairobi. 'The restoration of aid did little to ease the
confrontational mind set between Kenya and its aid partners.'
Some donors feel it is time to rethink the relationship. Japan, Kenya's
largest bilateral donor, is destined to play a greater role in the shaping
of aid policy. Tokyo's international aid charter shares the same goals as
western donors - market-based economic reforms, the respect for democracy
and human rights, good government - but its approach to reform appears to be
infused with the millennial patience of the east.
'We understand the process of co-ordinating political and economic reforms
can be difficult and complicated,' says Masahiko Horie, first secretary at
the Japanese embassy in Nairobi. 'There are no absolute yardsticks. We must
look at the whole process and support positive trends.'
Japan was the first country to resume fast-disbursing balance-of-payments
aid to Kenya last year. It released Dollars 77m in October, on the eve of
the donor consultative group meeting in Paris. The unilateral action, which
melted the donors' two-year aid freeze, sent a strong signal of support to
the Kenyan government and effectively set the tone for the Paris
discussions. Mr Horie says Japan acted with the knowledge and approval of
fellow donors.
It has not, however, been plain sailing for the Kenyan government since
then. In February, Britain's Overseas Development Agency cancelled a Pounds
12m grant for forestry conservation after failing to receive assurances from
the Kenyan government that it would end the illegal allocation of protected
forest areas to members of the ruling party and their acolytes.
'What we are looking for,' says Baroness Lynda Chalker, Britain's overseas
development minister, 'is effective action to improve open and accountable
government, including dealing with corruption, reducing tribal tensions,
strengthening law and order . . . and enhancing press freedom. These remain
the benchmarks which we shall be employing when we come to review progress.'
Britain is not alone in cutting back aid. Denmark, aid partners since
Kenya's independence, and the US, have curtailed projects citing increasing
co-operation problems with Kenyan authorities. Even the World Bank will only
present one new Dollars 22m project to its board this year.
Norway, which renewed diplomatic ties in February after a three-year break,
has no plans to resume financial assistance. 'We have told Kenya that when
we need to speak out, we will do so forcefully,' says Arman Aardal, the
Norwegian ambassador.
Kenya broke off relations with Norway in 1990 over Oslo's criticism of the
detention and trial of Koigi wa Wamwere, a prominent dissident. Soon after
the reopening of the Norwegian embassy in Nairobi, Mr Wamwere was again
being dragged before the courts. The irony has escaped few Kenyans.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (5): Punch-ups in political arena - The
government regards democracy as bothersome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year into the new multi-party era, politics in Kenya is about punch-ups.
In parliament, at opposition conventions, inside Nairobi city hall, the
willingness of elected representatives to come to blows is symptomatic of a
broader malaise: the lack of political dialogue in Kenya.
The government, from the president down, makes no secret of the fact it
regards democracy as a bothersome foreign imposition with dangerous social
repercussions. Its relations with the opposition are non-existent.
'Multi-party elections were forced upon us by the donor community,' says
John Joseph Kamotho, education minister and secretary-general of the Kenya
African National Union (Kanu) party. 'Given the choice, we would have
proceeded more slowly.'
Having ruled since independence, and won the December 1992 elections, Kanu
has had little cause to change its ways. It has continued to jail critics,
deny permits for opposition political rallies, ban independent trade unions
and stifle the media as in the days of one-party rule. Kanu makes no
distinction between the party and the state. It therefore regards all
criticism as a treasonable offence.
Twenty-one parliamentarians - almost a quarter of the opposition force  -
were jailed during 1993. The arrest and harassment of opposition leaders has
intensified during 1994. The time spent in court fighting charges, not to
mention time spent in jail, has been a significant drain on the opposition's
energy and resources.
Journalists have been detained and charged with sedition or subversion for
reporting on matters which the government considers inflammatory. Books and
magazines are occasionally banned. At the state universities, lecturers have
been on strike for five months to demand the legalisation of their
professional union. Mr Kamotho, the education minister, says the union will
not be recognised.
'The elections legitimised a regime that does not believe in democracy,'
says Mr Paul Muite, an opposition member of parliament.
And yet, the election results came as a rude shock to Kanu leaders.
President Daniel arap Moi, standing for re-election, mustered only 36 per
cent of the vote. Kanu also failed to win a single parliamentary seat in
Kikuyu or Luo land - home of two of the country's largest ethnic groups -
undermining Kanu's claim to be the only true national party in Kenya.
The election results crystallised what a one-party state could conceal: that
President Moi, a member of the Kalenjin clan, leads a government of minority
tribes which has deliberately marginalised the larger ethnic groups.
President Moi's coalition, in power since 1978, fears the arithmetic of
majority rule because it would bring back Kikuyu political domination.
Happily for President Moi, the opposition is in disarray. Divided by
personal rivalries in the run-up to the elections, the defeated opposition
has continued to fragment on tribal lines.
The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), which campaigned so
effectively for the legalisation of opposition parties, split into two camps
after failing to agree on a single presidential candidate. The late Jaramogi
Oginga Odinga, who died in January, took his Luo community into Ford-Kenya.
Kenneth Matiba, a prominent Kikuyu leader, founded Ford-Asili with Martin
Shikuku, whose Luhya community forms the country's second largest ethnic
group.
Now Mr Matiba is being challenged by Mr Shikuku for the leadership of the
Ford-Asili. The two men have exchanged ugly words in public. Their
supporters have exchanged blows.
Ford-Kenya was in disarray even before Mr Odinga's death. Several
parliamentarians have all but resigned from the party. A third opposition
force, the Kikuyu-led Democratic Party, has failed to make any impact in or
outside parliament.
Having failed to dislodge President Moi from power, some opposition leaders
have lost faith in a political game which they say is stacked against them.
Mr Matiba, the runner-up in the presidential contest, has refused to take up
his parliamentary seat in protest at an election which he believes was
rigged. Mwai Kibaki, the DP leader, appears to be absent in mind and spirit.
With so much political in-fighting, the opposition has failed to make its
mark on the two burning issues of post-election Kenya: the corruption
scandals linking 'political banks' to senior members of the Kanu leadership,
and ethnic conflict in the Rift Valley.
A spirited anti-corruption campaign led by Mr Muite of Ford-Kenya fizzled
into thin air when his leader, Mr Odinga, admitted to receiving donations
from the owner of one of the scandal-tainted banks.
Tribal clashes between the president's Kalenjin tribe and Kikuyu farmers
have caused 1,500 deaths and displaced more than 300,000 people since 1991,
according to church and human right groups.
Although the turmoil in the Rift Valley pales in comparison to the recent
killings in Rwanda, church organisations say the clashes represent Kenya's
most serious crisis since independence. They are frightened by the
underlying threat of chaos and social disintegration in a country with more
than 40 ethnic groups and an acute shortage of farmland.
Three independent reports, including one written by a parliamentary
committee when Kenya was still a one-party state, pointed to government
complicity or involvement in the violence. Government officials and close
associates of President Moi were named as the principal instigators of the
Rift Valley clashes.
The government denies any involvement in a conflict which recently began to
take the form of ethnic cleansing - the removal of all ethnic groups except
the Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu from the Rift Valley.
The clashes have brought church-state relations to an all-time low in Kenya.
'We have buried the victims of tribal clashes. We understand the impact of
financial scandals on our dwindling incomes. We are with the poor every
Sunday, not just for election rallies. How do you expect the church not to
take a political stance?' says the Rev Mutava Musyimi, general secretary of
the National Council of the Churches of Kenya.
Church groups have also thrown their weight behind opposition calls for a
national convention to redraft Kenya's constitution.
For while the advent of a multi-party system has brought the tribal factor
into greater relief, Kenya's existing institutions, including an
all-powerful presidency, have been unable to accommodate the aspirations of
the country's disparate ethnic groups.
'The culture of violence that is taking root has made real the alarming
possibility of civil war in Kenya,' the human rights group Africa Watch
warned late last year.
Perhaps this very real danger might make an intransigent government and a
fractious opposition come to their senses.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (4): Indigestion inhibits growth - The
private sector is carrying the can for public sector inefficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of complaining that implementation of Kenya's reform programme
has been too slow, donors are now warning of 'overload' and 'indigestion'.
Overload is the consequence of weak public sector managerial skills on one
hand, and pervasive political intervention and obstructionism on the other.
After a year in which many of the constraints on the economy  - especially
those affecting prices, foreign trade and payments and the financial sector
 -have been swept away, Nairobi is now under pressure on two main counts:
public sector reform, including parastatal restructuring; and macroeconomic
stabilisation.
The two are closely interlinked; price and exchange rate stability will be
restored only when the budget deficit and credit creation are brought under
control. The current macroeconomic policy stance is the now-familiar
counter-productive mix of fiscal expansion, partly offset by monetary curbs.
As fast as the government pumps liquidity into the system, so the central
bank mops it up with treasury bills and increased statutary cash reserves.
As a result, the private sector - the obvious engine of growth - is carrying
the can for public sector inefficiency. Investment is being constrained by
parastatal inefficiency and a weak infrastructure, while government
profligacy is crowding out corporate investment, forcing firms to pay higher
nominal interest rates.
This has to change. In the ambitious policy framework paper (PFP), agreed
with the IMF late last year, the government has promised to cut the budget
deficit to a targeted 6.1 per cent in 1993-94, from 10.5 per cent last year,
with further reductions to 3 per cent in 1994-95 and 2 per cent the year
after. When grants are included, the budget should be in balance by 1995-96.
Some slippage is inevitable given the difficult political environment and
the enormity of the task in the public sector. The signs are that Kenya will
overshoot the deficit target by over 1 per cent in the year to June 30, and
this could turn out to be optimistic as hitherto unknown public sector
spending commitments and borrowings continue coming to light.
The 1994-96 PFP targets increasing revenue from 22 per cent of GDP to 24 per
cent by 1996. Some maximum tax rates will be lowered, but the tax-base will
be broadened by abolishing tax exemption for parastatals, improving revenue
collections and expanding VAT to cover services.
Government spending is to be reduced from 29 per cent to 26 per cent of GDP
by 1995, by eliminating subsidies to the National Cereals and Produce Board,
civil service retrenchment, and cuts in security spending and interest
charges. The latter looks a forlorn hope at a time when domestic interest
charges are absorbing over a third of the budget and foreign payments a
further 7 per cent.
The civil service is shedding 26,000 jobs - over half of them unfilled posts
 -in the current year, reducing its workforce by some 5 per cent to 250,000.
A further 48,000 jobs will go over the next three years at the rate of
16,000 annually.
Price controls have been virtually eliminated, with one significant
exception - fuel prices. These are due to be deregulated by July, though
important technical issues relating to the refinery remain to be resolved.
Far-reaching reforms are proposed for agriculture, including strengthening
research and extension services, the privatisation of some
government-provided services such as tractor hire and veterinary services,
increased cost recovery, and a new, much-diminished role for the NCPB, to
maintain and manage a strategic maize reserve of some 3m 90kg bags.
The PFP programme is costed out at Dollars 2.4bn, of which Dollars 800m
would come from existing grants and loans, leaving a Dollars 1.6bn gap. The
fact that new aid commitments over the 1994-96 period are estimated at only
Dollars 300m underscores the changed financing environment that Kenya is now
experiencing. No longer can aid be relied upon to close the gap, and Kenya
will need 'exceptional financing', including the refinancing of arrears,
totalling Dollars 1.3bn over the next three years.
The two-year politically-driven donor freeze on balance-of-payments aid,
estimated at Dollars 700m, cost Kenya dear. Not only was it partly
responsible for the 1992-94 slowdown in the economy, but because foreign
interest payments were missed, Nairobi lost its position as one of the
select few of African countries that has avoided debt restructuring.
Although Kenya secured generous refinancing terms from the Paris Club of
official creditors, its external debt burden remains uncomfortable. Interest
arrears will be repaid in seven instalments over eight years, with a
one-year grace period. Five per cent of the arrears are payable in 1995,
rising to 25 per cent in 2001, and negotiations are to be held later with
commercial creditors, with a view to obtaining similar terms for Dollars
100m of arrears.
In the three years to 1992, Kenya's debt-service ratio averaged 32 per cent
of exports; and, while it fell to around 25 per cent last year, when
interest was not being paid, and will remain in the mid-20s in 1994-95, the
respite will be shortlived. By 1996, debt-service will be absorbing 29 per
cent of export and tourism earnings.
Debt-service could be less of a burden if last year's impressive balance of
payments performance is repeated. Strong export growth, sluggish imports, as
business ran down its inventories, the freeze on interest payments, and the
return of flight capital as confidence recovered and residents took
advantage of high yields in the treasury-bill market, gave rise to healthy
surpluses on current, and especially capital, account.
Provisional central bank estimates put the current account surplus at
Ks7.2bn last year, compared with a deficit of Ks3.6bn in 1992. Healthy
growth in tourism and service income more than offset the wider trade gap.
Capital inflows, conservatively put at over Ks20bn, pushed the overall
surplus to Ks27.5bn, with gross reserves up more than Ks45bn at Ks58bn or
seven months' import cover. With aid flows down and almost certain to remain
so, export growth and private capital investment from abroad are the keys to
a healthy balance of payments.
Once import demand starts to recover, as economic growth accelerates and
investories are rebuilt, the shilling will come under selling pressure; and,
on purchasing power parity and monetary considerations, the recent
appreciation of the currency will reverse. Last year's 15 per cent export
growth is unlikely to be sustained for long, underlining the need for a new
financing strategy, focusing on attracting the private capital necessary for
steady growth, from abroad.
Exchange rate stability will remain a mirage unless inflation is tackled.
The single-digit target by end-1994 is unrealistic, but the rate could be
brought below 20 per cent during 1994 if the necessary combination of
political will and improved public sector management can be brought to bear.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (3): The old guard can offer no alternative
 -Economy / Kenyan business is emerging from a traumatic period in the
doldrums, but reforms promise respectable growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS

<TEXT>
If big-business sentiment is a reliable guide, the Kenyan economy has turned
the corner and is poised to return to respectable growth rates in the latter
half of the decade, though 1994 will be flat.
Kenyan business is emerging from a traumatic period in the doldrums - 100
per cent inflation, 70 per cent devaluation, an epidemic of damaging
financial scandals, record interest rates, drought, a freeze on donor funds
and sudden, unpredictable shifts in macroeconomic policy.
Yet such is the economy's resilience that GDP stayed fractionally ahead of
the game, with real output rising 0.4 per cent in both 1992 and 1993 and
forecast to grow by 2 to 3 per cent this year.
But business sentiment is notoriously fragile and volatile. A leading
businessman admits to 'a nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach' that at
least some of the sweeping reforms of the past 12 months will be reversed.
Another believes that the scales are so finely balanced between reform and a
return to controls that the outcome is too close to call.
The most immediate challenge is political. Clustered around President Daniel
arap Moi is a clutch of old-guard politicians for whom structural
adjustment, deregulation, privatisation, the World Bank and the IMF are
dirty words. They are unlikely to acquiesce in the loss of privileged access
to wealth and patronage at the behest of, and under duress from, the donor
community.
That said, this anti-reform group does not have much going for it, given the
failure of its policies. However, it can point to falling living standards
and the limp supply response to reform, other than exports. With a
population growing at 3.4 per cent annually and stagnant GDP, real incomes
have fallen some 8 per cent since 1990; unemployment has worsened and wage
awards have fallen far behind inflation. Urban unemployment climbed from 16
per cent in 1986 to 23.5 per cent by 1991, and is now estimated to be in the
region of 27 per cent, while rural unemployment is put at 12 per cent.
The critics are on weak ground, however, when it comes to policy
alternatives. The old guard has nothing to offer in its place. There is no
constituency for a return to the bad old days of price and import controls,
overvalued exchange rates and pervasive state intervention. With no
elections due for almost four years, the reformers have a window of
opportunity to get Kenya back on to a 5 per cent growth track  - fuelled,
this time, by a structurally healthy economy, rather than one dependent on
aid and volatile commodity prices than.
A survey of multinationals by the East Africa Association finds that the
majority of the 37 respondents (to date) have significant investment plans.
Only one is disinvesting. The government's Investment Promotion Centre has
had 120 investment inquiries so far this year, and about 20 per cent of them
have been translated into firm project proposals. The country's first
privately-owned industrial park and export processing Zone (EPZ) is fully
subscribed, while officials claim good support for Athi River EPZ, due to
come on stream later in the year.
This - largely anecdotal - evidence suggests that there are at least the
stirrings of an investment supply response, while exports have already
responded significantly to devaluation and 100 per cent earnings retention.
In dollar terms, exports surged 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn.
Industrialists attribute increased exports of manufactures to devaluation,
strengthening economies in (and improved trading ties with) Uganda and
Tanzania, and some shift of commerce from informal to formal channels.
Clothing, textile and footwear firms, some in the EPZ, or utilising the
manufacturing-under-bond scheme, are penetrating European and North American
markets
Reform has done wonders for the financial sector, too - though not yet for
insurance groups. Barclays Bank of Kenya doubled its profits last year,
while share prices doubled on the Nairobi Stock Exchange in the first two
months of 1994, though they have since fallen by a quarter.
Business has also been encouraged by the opening up of constructive dialogue
with the government, and especially with finance minister Musalia Mudavadi
and central bank governor Micah Cheserem. Private enterprise played a
leading role in staging the Nairobi investment conference last week, and
will be prominent at the London investment conference scheduled for
November, being organised with Confederation of British Industry.
Not everyone is upbeat. The donor community, marching to a different drum,
is stuck in wait-and-see mode. Its caution stems partly from its
understandable preoccupation with political conditions, memories of having
been misled by the Kenyans in the 1980s, and current concerns about
macroeconomic management.
The challenges here are formidable: per capita incomes will fall again this
year for the fourth successive year; inflation, which had fallen to 16 per
cent on a three-month moving average basis by December last year, from a
peak of 101 per cent in mid-year, is back above 50 per cent; bank lending
rates of 33 per cent are substantially negative in real terms and set to
move higher; and the exchange rate, having overshot (it fell to a low of
Ks70 to the dollar late last year), has now appreciated to the point where
exporters are beginning to complain that their competitive edge is under
threat.
This year, too, the economy will pick up the tab for the fiscal and monetary
expansion associated with the December 1992 elections and the subsequent
banking and financial scams that cost the country literally hundreds of
millions of dollars. The authorities managed to slow money supply growth to
26 per cent last year, from 33.6 per cent in 1992, by driving treasury bill
yields above 70 per cent to drain liquidity from the system at enormous
interest cost to the exchequer. The volume of bills outstanding more than
quadrupled during 1993, to reach Ks59bn at the end of the year, and
increased by a further 35 per cent in the first quarter to Ks80bn in early
April.
The high nominal interest rates used to mop up liquidity now threaten to
destabilise the economy, fuelling rapid monetary growth as capital flight is
reversed, resulting in a substantial 1993 current account balance of
payments surplus and a firmer shilling. Managing the T-bill mountain will
tax the authorities' ingenuity, forcing them to lengthen borrowing
maturities, or incur a budgetary surplus to repay debt.
The latter option is not on the cards. The budget deficit is forecast at 7
per cent of GDP this year (to June 30), due to heavy interest charges,
external debt-restructuring notwithstanding. Interest costs account for 42
per cent of recurrent spending - 35 per cent domestic and 7 per cent
foreign.
It is clear that structural adjustment is not going to succeed without
radical public sector reform. Civil service reform, in terms of freezing
posts and retrenching staff, is on target, but this is only the tip of the
iceberg. The real challenge is to improve accountability, transparency and
efficiency right though the public sector, and especially the parastatals.
Re-engineering the parastatal sector is arguably the most formidable
challenge facing the government, since public enterprise inefficiency and
infrastructural decay are both a heavy burden on the budget and major
deterrents to new investment.
Fiscal policy and the associated problems of monetary management and
inflation top the policy agenda, and it is here that the scope for (and
danger of) slippage is greatest, under pressure from big-spending ministers.
The government is caught in a fiscal bind - stagnant revenue, reduced aid
inflows, expenditure overruns, escalating interest costs, and the need to
write off debt to clean up parastatal balance sheets.
Over the next two years, the deficit must be trimmed to 2 per cent of GDP,
implying both revenue enhancement and spending cuts. There are high hopes of
the former, following the appointment of three pre-shipment import
inspection agencies, whose prime task will be to monitor customs and VAT
payments, thereby levelling the playing-field for local manufacturers facing
competition from importers, paying bribes rather than duties to get their
products into the country, while simultaneously boosting government revenue.
Estimates suggest that anything for 25 to 50 per cent of taxes and duties
are being evaded/
But it is impossible to reconcile heavy investment in the country's rundown
and deteriorating infrastructure with fiscal stringency and domestic debt
repayment, especially in a country forced to live with the withdrawal
symptoms of reduced aid dependence. Traditionally, Kenya was able to rely on
donor funding for development, with net disbursements of over Dollars 1bn
annually in 1989-90. But those days have gone: Kenya's aid reliance ratio
(aid as a percentage of GNP) fell from 13.7 per cent in 1989-90 to 7 per
cent in 1991-92, when inflows declined to Dollars 780m.
To achieve social stability, the economy must grow at 7 per cent annually
into the next century, creating 165 000 new wage-sector jobs each year. This
is a tall order, given declining rates of investment.
The reforms of the past year have created a platform for self-sustaining
growth, but there is a long way to go to overcome the political doubts of
the recent past, to rehabilitate the public sector and create the enabling
environment necessary for Asian-style growth rates.
The jury is out on the sustainability of Kenyan reform, but with private
enterprise markedly more bullish than before, the investment response
lacking in so many parts of Africa may materialise in the latter half of the
decade.

<TEXT>
With the results season about to get under way, the drinks sector attracted
plenty of speculative buying but little overall volume. NatWest Securities
attempted to pre-empt proceedings, reiterating its positive stance on
Allied-Lyons, ahead 11 at 583p, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, up 9 at 530p.
Another NatWest favourite, Grand Metropolitan, was once again the subject of
speculation over the fate of its Inntrepreneur pub subsidiary, run as a
joint venture with Courage. Suggestions that GrandMet will use its results
on Thursday to announce that Inntrepreneur may be broken up, or even
floated, were not believed by all analysts. GrandMet jumped 16 to 483p.
Guinness, subject to persistent activity on inter-dealer broking screens,
was in focus with a big order in the options market. The stock edged up 2
1/2 to 484p.
Market gossip circulated around Wembley, the indebted stadium group, with
talk of a predator waiting in the wings. Speculation that the company would
be willing to sell its Wembley stadium showpiece was denied by the company.
The shares added 1 1/2 at 12p. Rank Organisation was one name linked to
Wembley. The shares slid 9 to 408p, with Hoare Govett said to be making
negative noises.
There was disappointment over the share reorganisation at Associated British
Foods, where some in the market had hoped for either a share buyback or a
big acquisition to put the company's large cash pile to work. Instead, the
company is offering a special dividend of 10p to shareholders. The stock
retreated 15 to 584p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was easier in early trade on speculation in the
Sunday press that it was poised to take a stake in or buy McKesson, a US
drugs wholesaler. The shares rallied later to close a penny off at 562p.
Both companies refused to comment on the rumours, fuelled by the latest deal
between SmithKline Beecham and DPS, of the US. SmithKline, which filed a
suit against a US group, saying it would violate trademark laws with a
launch planned for next week of a form of Tagamet, the ulcer drug, put on 3
at 397p.
Healthcare company Smith &amp; Nephew held firm at 147 1/2 p after announcing a
US joint venture deal.
British Gas rallied to end the session 1 1/2 firmer at 285p after the joint
report on gas pricing prepared by the Department of Trade and Industry was
published yesterday.
Oil shares made strong progress, buoyed by recent gains in crude oil prices
and ahead of expected good results from Royal Dutch/Shell tomorrow. BP
touched a record 412p before closing 6 1/2 up at 409 1/2 p. Shell added 7 at
739p and Enterprise Oil 13 at 444p.
Courtaulds fell 16 to 533p as one leading securities house issued a sell
note.
A broker's recommendation boosted Avon Rubber ahead of tomorrow's interim
figures. The shares rose 8 to 637p, with Panmure Gordon urging investors to
buy the stock.
Bus company Go-Ahead made an impressive market debut. The shares were issued
at 120p, opened at 126p and closed at 125p.
Weekend press reports suggesting Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel is
planning to build another tunnel through which travellers will be able to
drive cars hit the shares and they tumbled 28 to 422p.
Coats Viyella saw heavy turnover of 4.3m shares in the run-up to an auction
of around Pounds 11m of scrip dividend shares by BZW. The stock eased a
penny to 228p.
USM-quoted Phonelink, the computing services company, fell 46 to 384p on
profit taking.

The revival of rumours that Cable and Wireless could be considering a
flotation for its Mercury telecoms subsidiary triggered a strong rise in C&amp;W
shares, largely at the expense of its two UK telecoms rivals, BT and
Vodafone.
Dealers said the Mercury flotation story was one that cropped up regularly
and had been circulating in the market late last week. They also pointed out
that C&amp;W shares had underperformed the market by almost 11 per cent since
the turn of the year, as part of a general underperformance by UK telecoms.
BT shares have underperformed by some 15 per cent since the year-end.
Adding to C&amp;W's woes have been the marked weakness of the Hong Kong dollar,
which is linked to the US currency, and the steep decline in the Hong Kong
stock market.
'C&amp;W were due a bounce and the press reports have given the market an excuse
to do it,' said one trader. The stock closed 8 up at 444p. BT fell 7 1/2 to
364 1/2 p and the partly-paid 8 1/2 to 245 1/2 p. Vodafone, unsettled by
press comment, slipped 7 1/2 to 537 1/2 p.

<TEXT>
Growing optimism in the market that Royal Bank of Scotland will be the next
big FT-SE 100 constituent to deliver a 20 per cent-plus dividend increase
saw the bank's shares produce the leading index's best individual
performance. They settled a net 21 higher at 428p, a rise of 4.9 per cent,
following relatively large turnover of 3.1m shares.
RBOS's interim results are expected tomorrow, with analysts looking for
pre-tax profits at least double the Pounds 91m achieved last year. A big
rise in earnings from Direct Line, the bank's insurance by telephone
business and one of the jewels in the bank's crown, is expected.
But it will be the size of the dividend increase that will determine the
market's response to the results. Most bank sector analysts are looking for
an interim rise of at least 20 per cent and there will be some
disappointment if the increase does not match the 25 per cent increase in
the payout total last year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest slide in gilt-edged stocks, plus renewed worries about the
forthcoming regulatory reviews, brought renewed pain to the electricity and
water sectors. Last month the utilities provided 14 of the 20 worst
performers in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index and the seven poorest performers in
the FT-SE 100 Index.
Both sectors closed well above the day's lowest levels after a modest rally
in gilts triggered bargain hunting.
In the 'recs', Eastern finished 7 1/2 off at 577 1/2 p and Southern 17 1/2
weaker at 548 1/2 p. The generators were equally punished, with more US
selling hitting PowerGen, finally 15 off at 455p.

FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures rallied off the bottom towards the close to finish above
the June Footsie 3,100 support level, after a session dominated by weakness
in gilts and further political uncertainity, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was struck at
3,095. Goldman Sachs executed an order for around 400 contracts shortly
after the opening, and June fell back after its completion.
The release of higher than anticipated UK consumer credit figures led to a
further retreat as lingering hopes of a reduction in interest rates faded.
June then traded in a tight range of 3,074 and 3,080 for the next few hours
before renewed selling followed the opening on Wall Street.
However, firmness in US bonds, together with reports of a big trade in
'over-the-counter' options brought a rally just before the official close
and the June contract finished at 3,101, just ahead of its fair value
premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume amounted to 12,394 lots.
Traded options saw business of 35,436 contracts in total, of which 10,808
were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,585 in the Euro FT-SE.
A big trade in the Guinness calls and puts made it the day's most active
stock option with a total of 5,312 lots. Argyll Group and BP were also busy.

FT  10 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Concerns over US rates depress share
prices - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market staged a successful rally towards the close of a
depressed session yesterday which was dominated by weakness in British
government bonds and also in sterling as political tensions increased.
Markets kept a close eye on the US dollar, worried that any renewed setback
might prompt the US Federal Reserve to tighten credit policy more harshly
than previously in the present cycle. Yesterday's money market action by the
Federal Reserve came after the London close.
The disclosure that domestic consumer credit had jumped by Pounds 516m in
March, far above market expectations, gave a further blow to any lingering
hopes for a cut in base rates but brought little relief to either bonds or
sterling.
The FT-SE 100 Index was 25.3 down at the day's low when Wall Street had
opened sharply off and global bond markets were drifting easier. But London
rallied as the loss on the Dow Average was cut to 9.5 in early trading. At
its final reading, the FT-SE 100 showed a net decline of 8.2 at 3,097.8.
The late recovery in the blue chip leaders was fuelled by the expiry of two
over-the-counter option contracts believed to have been operated by leading
houses. These houses were thought to have been operating heavily in the
Footsie future towards the close of the trading session as the share option
contracts expired.
Trading volume in UK equities was not heavy yesterday but the concern over
US interest rates overshadowed all other considerations. Markets across
Europe were concerned that the Federal Reserve might take action ahead of
this week's refunding of US government securities.
UK equities crumbled in early trading behind a fall in stock index futures
and also in gilt-edged securities. There were suggestions from political
sources that Mr John Major's Conservative government, hard hit in the
opinion polls following last week's UK local elections, was under pressure
to hold a national referendum on policies towards the Economic Union.
Unimpressive trading volume indicated that share losses reflected cautious
marking down operations by marketmakers rather than any undue selling
pressure. The loss of the Footsie 3,100 mark yet again was unhelpful and the
consumer credit data underlined the market's resignation to the fading of
base rate hopes - as well as raising fears that the next move in domestic
interest rates might be upwards.
However, the day's Seaq trading volume total of 480.6m shares was nearly 27
per cent down from Friday's figure, which was worth Pounds 1.24bn in retail
worth, at the lower end of recent daily averages.
The picture among the second-line stocks was much the same as in the
Footsie-listed issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index failed to share in the late
rally and closed with a fall of 28.9 points at 3,742.1.
The setback in the UK equity market was less than those recorded by other
leading European markets, although UK gilts were significantly weaker than
other bond markets because of the political factors in London.
Weakness in gilts has continued to undermine UK equities for the past two
months, and there was little sign yesterday that share prices were yet ready
to disengage from the gilts market and to respond more confidently to the
growing indications of recovery in the UK economy.

FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil slips 6% after new currency is
announced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil
Equities fell 5.8 per cent as investors focused on the presidential race
more than on President Itamar Franco's announcement that Brazil's new
currency - the real - would be introduced from July 1.
The Bovespa index finished 885 points lower at 14,218. Volume totalled
Cr236.8bn (Dollars 165m).
Analysts remained confident that the introduction of the real would bring
Brazil's 45 per cent inflation down. But the strength of leftist
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva in recent opinion polls
continued to weigh on share prices.
Several details about the changeover - future policy on the real's exchange
rate with the US dollar, for example - will not be announced until next
month.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, the finance minister, said final decisions on monetary
and exchange rate policy were being finalised. It is expected that the real
will be backed initially by Brazil's foreign exchange reserves.
The market has been depressed in recent weeks awaiting details of the
government's anti-inflation policy. Equities have fallen by some 10 per cent
in dollar terms so far this year.
Mexico
The bolsa ended a lacklustre session lower as it tracked the drop in the US
markets and investors held back awaiting Mexico's first presidential debate
in modern history later this week.
The IPC index retreated 29.12 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 2,147.58 in very
light volume of 25.3m shares.
Heavily weighted Telefonos de Mexico 'A' and 'L' shares dropped 1.96 and
1.09 per cent respectively, while its ADRs lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 5/8
on the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls as bond yields set
a fresh high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices fell sharply yesterday after bond yields had risen to new
highs amid disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not, contrary to
expectations, lift interest rates to cool the rapidly expanding economy,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.46 at 3,629.04,
near its low point for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
dropped 5.50 to 442.32, while the American Stock Exchange composite weakened
4.31 to 435.42 and the Nasdaq composite was 9.90 lower at 722.96. Trading
volume on the New York SE was 250.9m shares.
Typically, a tightening of monetary policy by the Fed is seen as negative
for stocks, because higher interest rates undermine confidence in corporate
earnings and the attractiveness of equities relative to other financial
assets. However, yesterday was different, because the bond market was
convinced that the Fed would raise interest rates during the morning session
to prevent the economy from overheating and fuelling a revival of inflation.
When the Fed did not raise rates as expected, bond prices fell further from
their early lows, in the process pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year
issue up to 7.62 per cent, its highest since mid-1992. That increase
prompted heavy selling of stocks. Analysts said shares also fell because the
Fed's decision not to tighten policy was only likely to prolong the
uncertainty that will unsettle financial markets until interest rates are
raised again.
Among individual stocks, Kemper jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 in
heavy trading after the financial services group put itself up for sale
following GE Capital raising its bid to Dollars 60 a share. The reaction of
the market suggests that investors do not believe that a counter-offer will
be made higher than GE Capital's takeover terms. General Electric, GE
Capital's parent, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 94 7/8 .
McKesson climbed Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 78 after it was confirmed that
Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals giant, was in talks to possibly acquire part
or all of the US drugs distribution group.
Drug stocks as a group, buoyed by the recent merger activity, bucked the
trend, with Schering-Plough adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 64, Pfizer
firming Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 59 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb rising Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 53 3/4 and Johnson &amp; Johnson holding at Dollars 40 3/4 .
Tobacco shares were the most heavily traded sector of the session. RJR
Nabisco declined Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 5 3/4 in volume of 3.2m shares and
Philip Morris fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 amid growing concern that a new
round of lawsuits was likely to be filed against the tobacco industry in the
wake of recent reports that company executives knew for a long time that
cigarettes caused lung cancer.
Canada
Toronto was weighed down by interest rate fears and stocks closed sharply
lower after light trading.
The TSE 300 composite index tumbled 74.9 points, or 1.76 per cent, to
4,179.1. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 583 to 183 and volume came
to 48.8m shares valued at CDollars 539.5m.
All 14 sub-indices closed lower, with 12 of the groups dropping more than 1
per cent. Conglomerates had the biggest decline, off 3.4 per cent, as
Canadian Pacific fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 20 3/4 . Forestry lost 3.1 per
cent and real estate 3 per cent.

declines in thin turnover

<TEXT>
Tokyo
Uncertainty over fluctuations in the yen, US interest rates and the knock on
effect from New York's embattled bond and stock markets prevailed in Japan,
and the Nikkei 225 average lost moderate ground in very low volume, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Small-lot, arbitrage-linked selling left the index 75.51 easier at 19,786.96
after a day's high of 19,820.86 and low of 19,721.04. Volume was 150m
shares, against Friday's 175m.
Investors looked for excuses to remain on the sidelines, said a Japanese
trader. The settlement for index-futures options this Friday was cited as a
further, domestic reason for the inactivity; and some market participants
were said to be wary of the corporate earning reporting season, which starts
this week.
Fears over the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy and its possible
negative impact on US financial markets pushed down the dollar. The currency
closed Y0.69 off from Friday at Y102.67. Investors continued to be wary of
the yen's rise and its adverse affect on corporate earnings.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 4.85 to 1,610.84 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 0.66 at 294.94. Falls led rises by 666 to 307, with 185
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.24 to 1,308.06.
Export-oriented, high technology shares were lower on the rise in the yen.
Sony fell Y90 to Y5,610. Toyota Motor also declined, by Y20 to Y1,960.
Individual investors continued to trade speculative favourites. Brother
Industries, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y2 to Y675 and
Wakachiku Construction shed Y3 to Y667 on profit-taking.
Higher commodity prices helped some sectors. Petroleum issues were higher on
gains in crude oil, Showa Shell Sekiyu putting on Y30 at Y1,410 and General
Sekiyu Y30 at Y1,250. The rise in gold bullion supported mining shares,
Sumitomo Metal Mining rising Y5 to Y901.
Arbitrage selling hurt bank stocks, Industrial Bank of Japan declining Y20
to Y3,200 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,930.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 69.53 to 22,027.33 in volume of 18.7m
shares.
Roundup
Uneven trading characterised the Pacific Basin's markets yesterday. Manila
was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG fell 2.3 per cent in lower than average turnover, although bargain
hunting later in the day helped to trim the losses. The Hang Seng index shed
198.57 to 8,421.70. Turnover amounted to HKDollars 2.3bn, against Friday's
HKDollars 3.6bn.
Property and financial shares were selling targets. Brokers said
uncertainties about plans to cool the overheated real estate market deterred
purchases.
Cheung Kong was the day's most active issue, losing HKDollars 1.25 at
HKDollars 34, followed by HSBC, off HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 81.50.
SINGAPORE retreated a further 1.5 per cent as the market continued to
consolidate after testing the 2,300 level last week.
The Straits Times Industrial index shed 33.79 to 2,222.40 in turnover of
SDollars 438.8m. Brokers said weakness across the Pacific Rim undermined
sentiment to push the index lower for the fourth session. Natsteel dropped
30 cents to SDollars 5.00 on news of a cut in domestic steel prices. SEOUL,
in contrast, rose for the fourth consecutive day in increased trading. The
composite index added 3.74 at 940.15.
TAIWAN performed strongly and the weighted index gained 15.07 at 5,996.80,
but after a session high of 6,054. Turnover fell to TDollars 66.5bn from
Saturday's TDollars 77.4bn.
Ruentex Industries closed the day's limit up at TDollars 31.80 on news that
it could earn more than TDollars 1bn in coming years on land development
projects.
KUALA LUMPUR was marked down by 2 per cent, the falls led by foreign selling
of blue chips. The composite index shed 20.94 to 990.63.
AUSTRALIA closed higher on firmer commodity prices. The All Ordinaries index
rose 5.0 to 2,009.3. Turnover totalled ADollars 307.0m.
Higher gold and base metals prices offshore helped to boost the prices of
most mining issues, while industrial stocks continued to be depressed by
worries over a possible rise in US interest rates.
WELLINGTON recovered from an early 20-point fall and the NZSE-40 capital
index closed off 4.93 at 2,043.49.
BOMBAY maintained Friday's momentum, with the BSE 30-share index adding
40.33 at 3,755.90. Brokers said that overseas fund managers had begun to
pick up some blue chip stocks.
KARACHI lost 2.5 per cent as many investors unloaded stock to square
positions before today's clearing day.
The KSE 100-share index fell 58.84 to 2,307.42. with Lever Brothers off Rs75
at Rs1,325.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges ponder dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges spent yesterday in fruitless anticipation of a tightening
of US monetary policy that never arrived, writes Philip Gawith.
The weakness of the dollar last week, combined with stronger than expected
April jobs growth, has convinced the market that it is a question of when,
rather than if, the US Federal Reserve raises rates again.
Many had expected a move yesterday, ahead of the Dollars 29bn quarterly
Treasury refunding that takes place today and tomorrow. A weak dollar and
unstable US assets markets were seen as obstacles to foreign participation
in the refunding.
The dollar finished lower in London at DM1.6579 from DM1.6661 but it closed
against the yen at Y102.875 from Y102.780. In New York it ended at DM1.6540
and Y102.85.
Elsewhere, sterling failed to gain any support from strong April credit
figures, and slid lower against the background of political uncertainty. It
closed in London at DM2.4801 from DM2.4859.
In Europe, the D-Mark finished mostly weaker. It closed in London at
FFr3.427 against the French franc from Friday's FFr3.429. Against the
Italian lira it was down to L958.9 from L961.
The release of Japan's March capital account figures shed considerable light
on recent dollar weakness. The Dollars 21.92bn capital surplus was the
highest on record. The Ministry of Finance said it was the result of
Japanese companies selling US and European bonds ahead of the March
year-end, as well as foreign buying of Japanese stocks which hit a record
high in March.
Combined with a large current account surplus, this provides a key
explanation for recent yen strength - although figures for March show a 16
per cent fall from a year earlier in the current account surplus.
If the capital account figure proves to be a one-off phenomenon, as some
analysts are suggesting, and the current account surplus falls in the second
half of the year, the combination could prompt the revival of the dollar
against the yen.
Analysts said the failure of the Fed to act yesterday merely meant that the
market would continue each day to await a move, expected at the latest after
next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
What the market is hoping for from the Fed is that it will act sufficiently
boldly so as to be able to declare that rates have reached the 'neutral'
level. This should stabilise asset markets as it will allow investors to
re-enter equity and bond markets without the fear of another policy
tightening hanging over them.
Some clarity will emerge today on what sort of succour the dollar can expect
from the Bundesbank. Decisive confirmation that German rates are on a
downward path is seen as one way of supporting the US currency.
The Bundesbank will announce the terms of its weekly repo operations. Ms
Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, is
expecting a 4 to 6 basis-point cut in the repo rate from its current 5.41
per cent. Call money yesterday was trading at 5.35/50 per cent, which
suggests a fairly small reduction is likely.
There has also been speculation that the Bundesbank might lower its discount
rate when the council meets on Wednesday. Ms Cottrell said that, on balance,
she did not expect a move. The spread currently between the discount and
repo rate is standard, and will not complicate money management.
Sterling started the day weaker with the exchange rate index opening at 79.2
compared to Friday's close of 79.5. Analysts said the pound's opening level
of DM2.4750 was the lowest this year. Analysts attributed sterling's weak
performance to a delayed reaction to the Conservative's poor showing in last
week's local elections, aggravated by negative weekend press coverage.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'On
the basis of recent economic data, which has almost uniformly been stronger
than expected, the pound should be significantly stronger. In spite of this,
the extent of Tory party losses do now, however, tend to rule out a
significant rally in sterling over the coming month as political
considerations continue to dominate.'
In the money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 360m of assistance
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. The overnight rate traded in a
3 1/2 to 5 1/16 per cent range.
Sentiment soured in the sterling futures market, with contracts losing
ground across the board. In light trade, the June future closed at 94.56,
from 94.59 on Saturday. The December contract fell 10 basis points to 93.66.
Mr Brian Durrant, head of research at brokers GNI, commented: 'Although the
market is in principle oversold, there is nothing for buyers to bite on.'
Buoyant consumer credit figures failed to help sterling, or interest-rate
markets. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) reported March net consumer
credit up Pounds 516m, ahead of market forecasts of about Pounds 350m.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Crop
worries put wheat market through the mill - World stocks remain tight and
harvest prospects now seem less bright than they appeared at first
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the ash comes out before the oak, they'll be a soak. But if the oak comes
out before the ash, they'll be a splash.
This year, in Norfolk anyway, the buds on oak trees came out first,
indicating, according to that usually reliable sore that the coming summer
may be characterised by occasional light showers rather than steady
downpours.
Should that turn out to be the case cereal yields will be adversely
affected. For in spite of the freshening rain of last weekend - which was
itself a crop-saver on many farms - soils will quickly dry out as
temperatures increase and plant transpiration rates rise.
Add to that the legacy of the wet winter, which left many arable fields
scarred and bare in places, where lakes of rain water stood for weeks on end
and it is hardly surprising that optimism in this area is in short supply
this spring.
But it is very easy for a farmer to make judgments on prospects for the
entire harvest on the basis of the few fields around his house. Last week I
travelled south and west and was surprised to find that in Hampshire,
Wiltshire and Dorset winter sown cereals were looking a lot better than
those at home, with growth about a couple of weeks further forward. Perhaps
the UK harvest will not be a total disaster after all.
These days, however, as the reform of the European Union's common
agricultural policy progresses and guaranteed prices decline, the value of
UK cereals is coming to rely far more on supply and demand both in the EU
and the rest of the world. Current trends suggest that the gap between these
factors is narrowing.
Last week, for instance, the UK ex-farm spot wheat price increased by Pounds
4 to Pounds 119 a tonne and that for June by a similar amount to Pounds 120.
Both levels were a few pounds above the EU buying in price - and that in
spite of recurring stories throughout most of last winter of sizeable,
unsaleable surpluses in British barns, which were likely to have to stay
there through the next harvest.
Some of the bearish sentiment was undoubtedly inspired by merchants talking
down the price. But there was apparent evidence to support their case and
many cereal growers who sold early must now be kicking themselves.
Forward prices for next harvest have also risen above support levels. The
November intervention price for feed wheat, for instance, is Pounds 97 a
tonne delivered to the store. But last week it was possible to sell forward
to merchants at Pounds 98.50 a tonne ex-farm. Bread wheat, or common wheat
as it is now known, could be sold for November at Pounds 112.50 a tonne,
compared with an intervention price of Pounds 107.
So, why the turnround? One reason must be that EU-wide domestic demand has
increased now that guaranteed prices are lower. It must be assumed too that
estimates of the outturn of last year's EU harvest were exaggerated.
But it must also have something to do with the tightness of world cereal
supplies. According to the April report from the Rome-based Food and
Agriculture Organisation, a decline in world wheat output this year may be
countered by a recovery in the maize crop. And although availability should
be adequate to meet demand stocks will remain close to minimum safe levels.
The report shows that stocks as a percentage of world cereal consumption are
expected to decline to 18 per cent this year having been between 19 and 21
per cent during the previous 3 years. Moreover the 1994 figure is similar to
the stock level of 1990 and indicates that supplies have been bordering on
the critical for at least 4 years.
The FAO has the responsibility to tell of starvation risks around the world
so might, perhaps, be accused of stressing potential problems. The
International Wheat Council, however, has more commercial priorities and its
forecasts coincide with those of the FAO for wheat while painting a worse
picture for maize. According to the IWC world maize stocks are set to
decline by about 5 per cent this year.
There are reports, moreover, of poor growing conditions for winter-sown
cereals in Russia and Ukraine, while shortages of inputs have also caused
problems with spring sowing. Canada and China are both expected to produce
lower tonnages this year and there are frost problems across the high plains
of the US, which may have damaged spring plantings. A useful guide to future
world prospects for wheat can usually be gained from the USDA's decision on
the level of set-aside, or acreage reduction, it imposes on farmers wishing
to qualify for crop loans. The decision for 1995 is expected within the next
two to three weeks and rumours from Washington are already suggesting that
the set-aside for wheat will, as last year, be zero.
Meanwhile, in spite of obviously tightening supplies, most British and
European arable farmers will again have to set-aside 15 per cent of their
cereal land. But they are now becoming reconciled to it, and as long as they
continue to be compensated for leaving land uncropped and the market for the
crops they do grow stays as lively as in recent weeks they should not
complain too much.

FT  10 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee gains consolidated - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE traders had a more subdued day than of late, as markets on both sides
of the Atlantic consolidated recent gains.
Futures prices opened firm, boosted by Friday's strong close in New York,
and then light trade and fund buying pushed a thin morning market up Dollars
58 to a high at Dollars 1,848 a tonne for three months metal. But New York's
failure to break 105 cents a pound prompted scattered profit-taking and the
London price eased to Dollars 1,812 at the close, up Dollars 22 on the day.
The London COCOA market had a positive morning but trading remained
technical and lacked the underpinning of solid industry buying. The July
delivery position at the London Commodity Exchange closed at Pounds 933 a
tonne, up Pounds 4.
At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM capitalised on copper's strength (see
story above), working back above the Dollars 1,330 a tonne level for three
months delivery, and setting itself up for another test of the resistance in
the mid-Dollars 1,330s.
PRECIOUS METALS retained most of their weekend gains after New York opened
modestly lower in line with expectations.
The GOLD price closed in London at Dollars 381.25 a troy ounce, up Dollars
5.95 from Friday's close, while SILVER ended with a 21 cents gain at Dollars
5.41 1/2 an ounce. PLATINUM was up Dollars 7.65 at Dollars 397.15 an ounce.
Dealers said there was some follow-through buying in New York by the
investment that had sparked the late rally on Friday. Some dealers had been
concerned that New York might sell-off if it opened at more or less
unchanged levels.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further reform of common
agricultural policy 'inevitable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy is
inevitable in the next few years, although it is unlikely to be radical,
according to the chief economic adviser to Lloyds Bank, one of Britain's big
four high street banks.
Writing in the May issue of Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin, Mr Patrick Foley
argues that the farming lobby will grow weaker as more agricultural jobs
disappeared. This will encourage politicians to take action beyond the 1992
MacSharry reforms.
At the same time, increasing cereal yields are likely to mean that
subsidised exports from the European Union remain too high to meet the
requirements of the Uruguay Round world trade deal, necessitating further
internal CAP reform.
He says public pressure for change will also grow because the current
reforms have increased the transparency of subsidies to farmers. CAP support
in one form or another accounts for half the gross income of a typical
100-hectare cereal farm.
Mr Foley points out that the 1992 reforms encourage production to remain
high - the opposite of what was intended. 'Because compensation is per
hectare, there is an incentive for farmers to keep the maximum possible
amount of land in production, subject to set-aside.'
Land prices are also likely to remain buoyant for the next few years,
because of the set-aside programme and financial incentives for less
intensive livestock production.
'It is possible that the 15 per cent set-aside could increase land prices in
the short term, as some farmers may choose to buy more land to enable them
to maintain past levels of production,' he says.
'Equally, beef farmers wishing to change to a more extensive type of farming
would need to buy more land.'
Evaluating the routes that further reform could take, Mr Foley says a bond
compensation scheme may be politically unacceptable, even if economically
justified, because of the likely large-scale job losses and sharp fall in
land prices that it would entail.
He suggests there will be a mixture of more price support cuts and more
set-aside, together with greater limits on inputs such as fertilisers.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India expected to miss its
foodgrain target despite good monsoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's foodgrain production during 1993-94 is expected to be 179.1m tonnes,
falling short of the target of 188m tonnes, and marginally lower than last
year's record production of 180.01m tonnes, despite a good monsoon for the
sixth consecutive year.
The ministry of agriculture said in its annual report released yesterday
that an uneven distribution of rainfall with very wet periods at the
beginning of the monsoon season followed by long dry spells in August over
north-west India, had resulted in most targets not being met.
Production of some oilseed crops has been affected, with the groundnut crop
in the Saurashtra and Kutch regions suffering from a deficient south-west
monsoon. But a bumper soyabean crop is expected to boost oilseeds production
to 20.5m tonnes from 20.27m tonnes last year.
Floods in nine Indian states in the north and the east, and inadequate
rainfall in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh at the beginning of the season have also
played havoc with cash crops. The production of jute and mesta during
1993-94 is expected to fall to 8.3m bales (of 180kg each), from 9m bales
last year. Cotton production is also expected to be lower than last year's,
falling to 10.6m bales from 12.5m bales. Sugar-cane production is likely to
remain at last year's figure of 231.01m tonnes, falling short of the target
of 250m tonnes.
The ministry has initiated a series of programmes to help state governments
to increase crop productivity, for wheat, maize and millet, rice, cotton and
jute.
Farmers are being encouraged to use new, high-yielding varieties and
environment-friendly pesticides.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper boosted to 13-month peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculative buyers boosted the copper price to a fresh 13-month peak in late
London trading yesterday. Copper for delivery in three months touched
Dollars 2,078 a tonne, nearly 10 per cent ahead of the price only a week
ago.
The market also moved into a modest backwardation, where a premium has to be
paid for metal for immediate delivery - evidence, according to some
analysts, that physical metal is not as freely available as present high
stock levels would suggest.
Three-month copper earlier closed in London at Dollars 2,056.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 29.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, says in his latest Weekly Futures
Report that, 'everyone we speak to wants to buy (copper) at 85 cents a pound
(Dollars 1,874 a tonne) which means in reality that prices are most unlikely
to move that low'.
He says there is evidence that some consumers are giving up just-in-time
policies and building modest stocks. And one week of stock held by American
and European semi-fabricators would be equivalent to 180,000 tonnes of
copper. If end-users also added a week's stock, that would be another
180,000 tonnes.
However, Mr Stephen Briggs at Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services, said
today's copper price could not be justified by the fundamentals. MMRS
forecast a supply deficit of 75,000 tonnes this year following a surplus of
200,000 tonnes in 1993. Next year there would be big increases in copper
mine output, a legacy from the last recession when prices also held up
reasonably well and encouraged new production. With 456,400 tonnes still in
LME stocks, 'consumers don't have to panic'.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall after Fed decides not to
tighten policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices fell yesterday as traders and investors showed their
disappointment at the Federal Reserve's decision not to tighten monetary
policy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 83
31/32 , yielding 7.619 per cent. Prices were also lower at the short end of
the market, with the two-year note down  1/4 at 98 5/8 , yielding 6.234 per
cent.
Under normal circumstances, a tightening of Fed policy would trigger a
sell-off in the bond market. However, the market plunged late last week
after signs of a strengthening labour market had deepened concern that an
overheating economy would eventually fuel a revival of inflation. Over the
weekend, market participants were looking to the Fed to raise interest rates
early this week as a measure to slow the pace of economic growth.
Consequently, when the Fed funds rate inched up from 3 3/4 per cent to 4 per
cent yesterday morning in anticipation of a policy tightening, the market
expected the Fed to signal that it was happy with the new, higher rate.
The Fed, however, did just the opposite. During its normal intervention
period, the central bank added reserves to the banking system via overnight
system repurchase agreements, a manoeuvre designed to push the Fed funds
rate back down to 3 3/4 per cent. The Fed's actions were interpreted as a
sign that it was not ready to raise interest rates.
In spite of the losses, traders said activity on the market was relatively
light, but warned that prices would be prone to further weakness so long as
the Fed puts off a rate increase.
European government bonds opened on a weak note in response to the decline
in the US Treasury market on Friday afternoon, and spent most of the day
'Fed-watching' in the expectation of seeing a hike in short-term US interest
rates.
European bonds ended down from their previous close, and dealers said the
focus this week was likely to remain the strong likelihood of a rise in
short-term US interest rates and the prospect of further declines in the
most keenly-watched German interest rates at the repo today and at the
Bundesbank council meeting on Wednesday.
In Germany, the Bundesbank issued DM3bn of the Treuhand's new 10-year bond
which has a 6 3/4 per cent coupon. The bonds were placed at an issue price
of 100.40, yielding 6.69 per cent.
Dealers reported switching out of existing 10-year Treuhand and Federal
paper in response to the cheap pricing of the new issue, but added that
there were no signs of new cash coming into the market.
The focus for the bund market today will be the announcement of the
Bundesbank's weekly repo result. The market expects to see a further 5-10
basis points shaved off the repo rate - which is currently at 5.41 per cent
 -with the prospect of a follow-up cut in the discount rate (now at 5.00 per
cent) on Wednesday at the Bundesbank council meeting.
The bund futures contract opened at 94.15 and touched a low of 93.96 early
in the session, then climbed up to 94.34 and traded at around 94.28 by late
afternoon.
In France, the central bank left key rates unchanged at yesterday's repo,
but dealers said that if the Bundesbank cuts at today's repo this could pave
the way for a further cut in French interest rates.
UK government bonds opened sharply down in response to Friday's US Treasury
bond sell-off, but then clawed back some of their losses leaving long-dated
gilts to close about  3/8 of a point lower on the day. Trading volume was
relatively thin, however.
The release of strong UK consumer credit data for March yesterday showed
that the economic recovery remains healthy, dealers said. With a Pounds 516m
rise in net consumer credit, they point out that the chances of another cut
in the base rate in the immediate future have diminished still further.
The main focus for the gilt market on the domestic front is the release
today of the Bank of England's Quarterly bulletin and inflation report. This
is expected to show that inflationary pressures remain subdued.
Japanese government bond prices held up well and closed higher on the day,
helped by domestic buying as investors returned from the Golden Week holiday
yesterday.
While cash bond and futures prices suffered losses initially on the back of
Friday's US payroll figures, the market later made up for lost ground. The
June futures contract opened at 112.26 and fell to a low of 112.13, then
ended at 112.73.

EGAP (Czech Export Guarantee and Development Corp) is planning international
bond issues to provide long-term funds which Czech companies can draw upon
to support international trade operations, Reuter reports from Prague.
'We will definitely issue bonds on the international capital markets,' Mr
Arnost Bohm, EGAP vice-general-director said.
EGAP is to launch an export credit bank this week. The bank, Ceska Exportni
Banka, was expected to begin with Kcs1.5bn (Dollars 51m) in basic capital,
two thirds provided by the National Property Fund and one-third by the Czech
National Bank.
A change in Czech banking laws, to allow for the operation of an export
bank, has yet to be passed. Mr Bohm said government ministers would probably
send the law to parliament by the end of this month.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Schroder Ventures raises
Dollars 100m for healthcare fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroder Ventures has raised Dollars 100m for a venture capital fund to
specialise in life sciences including biotechnology and healthcare services
companies.
The International Life Science Fund is Schroder Ventures' first fund to
invest in several countries and in a specific industry, said Dr Henry Simon,
a partner and head of the investment team.
The vehicle is a 10-year closed-end fund. About 60 per cent of investors are
in the US, 27 per cent in the UK and the remainder in continental Europe and
the Middle East.
The Dollars 100m was raised over an 18-month period. This was longer than
expected, conceded Dr Simon. He said that US investors had been cautious
about an international fund, and Europeans were wary of venture capital
vehicles. All had concerns about the impact of healthcare reforms on the
profitability of the sector.
Nevertheless, Schroder Ventures succeeded in raising almost twice as much as
last month's Rothschild Asset Management's International Biotechnology Trust
which secured less than Pounds 40m, compared with a target of Pounds 100m.
The Schroder Ventures trust will invest in several sectors within healthcare
in Europe and North America.
Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology should take about 40 per cent of the
total. The fund will seek companies researching into disease areas such as
cancer and virus infections, and those involved in technologies such as gene
therapy and transplants.
Between 5 and 10 per cent will go into each of:
Healthcare services, such as specialised clinics;
diagnostics, such as home tests;
medical devices including scanners and monitoring;
and environmental products and services such as biochemical waste treatment
The fund will invest a significant proportion of its capital as seed money
and early stage investment.
UK companies will be a high priority.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for Toyota Motor Credit
Corp Y50bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Primary activity was subdued and most investors remained on the sidelines as
the markets continued their tense vigil for the US Federal Reserve's next
monetary tightening move.
Only the Euroyen sector saw a spurt of activity, prompted by the return of
Japanese investors from last week's Golden Week holiday and arbitrage
opportunities.
The largest of the day's four new issues, Y50bn of 3 1/2 per cent bonds due
September 1997 for triple-A rated Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, received
a positive market response. Most traders said the bulk of the deal would
likely be placed in Japan, but lead manager Merrill Lynch also reported good
demand from non-Japanese accounts. The issue was deemed to be generously
priced. 'They paid due respect to current difficult market conditions,' said
one trader.
Other yen issues included Y15bn of four-year bonds for De Nationale
Investeringsbank via IBJ International, Y10bn of two-year paper for the
Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden via Nomura, and Y10bn of three-year bonds for
Sony Capital Corporation via IBJ.
In the French franc sector, Credit Local de France, the triple-A rated
French municipal financing agency, issued FFr1bn of 7 1/4 per cent nine-year
bonds via Caisse des Depots et Consignations and UBS France, which took
about three-quarters of the issue. According to UBS, the deal saw strong
demand from French institutional investors. Yielding 21 basis points over
the 99.59 re-offer price, the issue was deemed to be fairly priced.
Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein decided to tap recent retail demand for
short-dated dollar paper by issuing Dollars 200m of two-year bonds. Lead
manager Lehman Brothers reported good demand from Benelux and Swiss retail
investors attracted by the 6 3/8 per cent coupon and the short maturity, but
other dealers said the issue would be slow to place amid uncertain market
conditions.
The sterling sector today is expecting a Pounds 400m bond issue for Lloyd's
Bank, split into a 15-year fixed-rate tranche and a floating-rate tranche.
Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and S. G. Warburg are tipped as joint leads.
Otherwise, primary activity is expected to remain thin this week,
overshadowed by nervousness regarding US interest rates and Thursday's
Ascension holiday in most parts of Europe.
Caja de Madrid, Spain's second-largest savings bank, today is to sign a
Dollars 1bn debt programme, arranger Morgan Stanley said. The flexible
multi-currency facility will allow Caja de Madrid to issue both public
transactions in the Euromarkets as well as small private placements. The
dealer group will include Caja de Madrid, Chase Investment Bank, Citibank,
First Chicago, Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley, SBC and UBS.

Now Mr Tajudin is one of Malaysia's leading entrepreneurs, with
multi-million dollar interests in telecommunications, tourism and transport.
Last week Celcom, a unit of Mr Tajudin's listed Technology Resources company
(TRI), announced it had won a licence to set up international
telecommunications links.
Celcom already has a more than 60 per cent share in Malaysia's fast growing
cellular communications market.
A private company controlled by Mr Tajudin is also in the satellite
business: it has bought and launched two Russian communications satellites
with the idea of leasing space to regional users.
Now, Mr Tajudin's Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS) a locally listed
company, has plans to take over the running of Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the
country's national carrier and one of south-east Asia's biggest airlines.
Mr Tajudin is one of Malaysia's most closely watched businessmen. His
activities are the talk of Kuala Lumpur boardrooms. However, there are
growing concerns that Mr Tajudin is trying to expand too fast.
'No one can keep control over such a fast growing business empire,' says one
Kuala Lumpur analyst. 'He's taken on too much - hardly a day goes by without
some new deal being announced.'
Malaysia and Thailand are the fastest growing mobile phone markets in the
world. In spite of competition from new system operators, the number of
subscribers to TRI's Celcom unit network is expected to increase by between
8,000 and 9,000 a month over the next two years.
Brokers and investors seem generally optimistic about TRI. TRI made a
pre-tax profit last year of MDollars 103m (USDollars 38.9m) compared with
MDollars 16.8m in 1992. Over the last 12 months TRI shares have risen from
MDollars 1.46 to MDollars 11.50 on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
However there are doubts about Mr Tajudin's move into Malaysia Airlines.
'Like telecommunications, airlines are primarily about service,' says Mr
Tajudin. 'There is a big shake-up coming at MAS. I will be concentrating on
the airline from now on.'
In what was one of the biggest deals in Malaysian corporate history, it was
announced late last year that Bank Negara, the country's central bank, would
sell a 32 per cent stake in MAS to the Tajudin-controlled MHS. The cost of
the stake was estimated at MDollars 1.79bn.
However, final clearance for the MHS/MAS deal seems to have been delayed.
The original purchase proposal was to have been funded through the issuing
of 112m new MHS shares at the then market price of MDollars 16 a share. But
the Kuala Lumpur stock market has fallen by more than 20 per cent since the
beginning of the year and MHS shares have dropped to around MDollars 11.
With underwriters shying away from the deal there is talk of a restructured
MAS takeover package.
MHS is a relatively small company specialising in support services to
Malaysia's oil and gas industry. Pre-tax profit in the year to end-1993 was
MDollars 21m, down from MDollars 31m the previous year.
Recently MHS has been on an aggressive acquisition hunt. Last year it
purchased a 33 per cent stake in the Schriener Aviation group of the
Netherlands for Dollars 4.8m and a 25 per cent stake in World Airways, the
US charter operator, for Dollars 27.4m. It has been involved in protracted
takeover negotiations with Bristow, the UK helicopter operator.
While Mr Tajudin says he wants to build MHS into an international aviation
company, doubts persist about its financial strength and its ability to
manage such a large and complex operation as MAS.
The Malaysian carrier has recently been flying into some financial
turbulence. An over-ambitious fleet expansion programme in the 1991-96
period, involving the purchase of 72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars
10.6bn, has placed severe strain on the balance sheet. At the same time
passenger numbers on many routes have dropped.
Pre-tax profit for the six months to September 1993 was MDollars 6.4m, a 96
per cent drop on the equivalent period the previous year.
There is also a political dimension to Mr Tajudin's business dealings. Mr
Tajudin is a protege of Mr Daim Zainuddin, Malaysia's former finance
minister and a close confidant of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime
minister. Mr Daim is known as one of Malaysia's wealthiest businessmen and a
corporate wheeler dealer.
Mr Tajudin's business rivals say Mr Tajudin used his political connections
to win lucrative telecommunications licenses. In return, the government
asked the entrepreneur to reorganise MAS.
Mr Tajudin shrugs off such rumours, saying he merely responded to
opportunities offered to him.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the present finance minister, has become involved in
increasingly public wranglings with the influential Mr Daim, while
Malaysia's regulatory authorities are said to be unhappy with some aspects
of Mr Tajudin's business activities.
But Mr Tajudin insists everything is going to plan. 'At various times people
have said I was mad, putting money into companies like Celcom and MHS. But I
have proved them wrong. You have to have vision, that is very important.'

Burns Philp, the Australian group which has been disposing of non-core
assets to concentrate on its food ingredients business, said it made a
profit before interest and tax of ADollars 46.4m (USDollars 32.6m) in the
third quarter to end-March.
This compares with ADollars 39m in the same period a year ago, but includes
ADollars 12m profit on asset sales. Without those, earnings would have
declined 12 per cent.
After-tax profits for the quarter were ADollars 20.5m, against ADollars
21.4m, and for the nine months, ADollars 96.8m, against ADollars 75.9m.

Tongaat-Hulett, the South African food, industrial and consumer products
group and the largest company in Natal province, reported a strong second
half as a result of successful rationalisation and restructuring.
After-tax profits for the year ended March rose 15.8 per cent to R159m
(Dollars 32.1m) from R137.3m.
The results were helped by a decline in net financing costs to R55.2m from
R77.4m and a drop in taxation to R52.1m from R55.3m.
The balance sheet was stronger as overall borrowings were down to R364.6m
from R388.9m, while total net borrowings dropped to R25.3m, a reduction of
R107.9m, largely due to proceeds from the sale of 50 per cent of the group's
Consumer Foods operation to CPC International.
Turnover increased 2.7 per cent to R3.97bn from R3.87bn and a final dividend
of 58 cents was declared, making the full-year dividend 13.7 per cent up on
last year, at 83 cents.
Mr Cedric Savage, managing director, said the improvement held across all
divisions and improved liquidity and cash-flows would allow the company to
take advantage of expected infrastructural spending by the new government.
He singled out the group's brickmaking and aluminium divisions as
particularly well placed for growth. The sugar division, recovering from a
two-year drought, is expected to benefit from deregulation later in the
year.
Tongaat has also continued with capital expenditure, spending R180m on
various irrigation, glucose and aluminium projects. The group is also
undertaking feasibility studies for a proposed R1.6bn hot rolling aluminium
mill expansion.
Mr Savage also said anticipated growth and higher liquidity left the company
well placed for new investments, perhaps in foreign markets.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Meridien Biao plans African
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's transition to democracy is encouraging at least one
pan-African banking network to expand its business through the continent.
Mr Andrew Sardanis, chairman of the Luxembourg-based Meridien Biao,
yesterday established a commercial holding company in the US as a vehicle
for raising additional capital to extend his chain of commercial banks and
insurance companies in Africa.
The holding company, Meridien Corporation of the USA, is capitalised at
Dollars 50m. 'We are hoping to attract new shareholders to Meridien
Corporation at some future date,' Mr Sardanis said yesterday in Nairobi.
Mr Sardanis is enthusiastic about the potential expansion of regional trade
following South Africa's multi-racial elections. He hopes his network of
banks in 20 African countries will act as co-respondents for South African
banks in financing the expected increase in trade. In the future he says, he
may apply for a banking licence in South Africa.
For many years, the Cypriot-born businessman was banned from entering South
Africa for being a Zambian citizen and a one-time member of former president
Kenneth Kaunda's government, which actively supported the African National
Congress.
Meridien Biao is a newcomer to the African banking scene. The banking group
is the result of a merger in 1991 of Meridien banks in anglophone countries
and much of the Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidental, a troubled
network of banks in francophone Africa.
Its assets, following the devaluation of the CFA franc in January, are
valued at Dollars 950m, down from Dollars 1.45bn before the devaluation. Net
income in the year ending September 1993 was a meagre Dollars 3.3m, which
the chairman attributes to reorganisation costs.
The establishment of the Meridien Corporation holding company has
effectively separated Mr Sardanis' banking interests from the mining,
trading and construction companies grouped under ITM international.
'After the BCCI affair,' says Mr Sardanis, 'I decided it was important to
separate the banking operations from the rest of the group in the interests
of greater transparency.'
To date, however, neither British nor French banking regulators have granted
Meridien Biao a banking licence.
'Most OECD countries are reluctant to undertake supervision of a large
network such as ours; they are concerned at the remoteness of the continent
and have adverse perceptions of Africa,' Mr Sardanis wrote in his annual
report. However, he hopes this state of affairs might be redressed by
seeking a listing for Meridien Corporation in one of the US stock exchanges,
bringing his group of companies under the Securities Exchange Commission
rules.

A strong performance by offshore operations helped Plate Glass and
Shatterprufe Industries, South Africa's largest glass company, to a 71 per
cent increase in after-tax profits for the year to March, to R207.9m
(Dollars 58m) from R121.9m.
Attributable income more than doubled to R158.6m from R79.1m, and a dividend
of 56.8 cents was declared, up from 37.1 cents in 1993.
Mr Ronnie Lubner, chief executive, attributed the results to offshore
subsidiary Belron International, which serves the automotive glass
replacement industry in 11 countries, and which contributed 36 per cent of
earnings.
Belron benefited from a strong showing from Autoglass in the UK. Continental
Europe (except Germany and Italy) and Australia also did well.
Mr Lubner was particularly pleased with the group's American operations,
Windshields America.
Group turnover increased by 17 per cent to R3.2bn from R2.77bn while net
financing costs dropped to R28.5m from R32.6m on strong cash flow.
Mr Lubner was 'cautiously optimistic' about the South African economy in the

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Difficult first year for Traub
and Heckert - The union of two German machine-tool makers was never going to
be easy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody said the marriage between two German machine-tool manufacturers would
be easy.
Not only had it taken place against the background of one of the worst
recessions in recent years - late last month Deckel Maho, another
machine-tool group, filed for protection from its creditors. But the
marriage involved Traub, the west German tool-turning manufacturer in
Stuttgart, and Heckert, the east German tool-milling enterprise in Chemnitz,
once the heart of Germany's machine-tool industry before the second world
war.
When the two enterprises joined forces last September, both companies had
undergone radical restructuring programmes. Traub, saddled with losses the
previous year of DM47.9m (Dollars 28.75m) and a turnover which had fallen 8
per cent to DM270m, had cut its workforce from 1,800 to 1,000.
'Our labour costs were too high. The only way we could save money and become
more efficient was through shedding jobs,' said Mr Theodor Zimmer, a board
member of Traub. 'We are slowly coming out of the tunnel,' he said.
Pressure from its banks also forced the company to adopt a leaner and
tougher strategy. Last year, they agreed on a financial package aimed at
reducing Traub's debt by DM80m, while the family-owned company would
increase its share capital in 1993 by DM10m to DM47m.
'The business culture is changing. You can no longer rely on producing and
expect orders to follow. You have to work harder to find your markets and
keep costs down at the same time,' said Mr Manfred Hekeler, head of
marketing.
As part of the restructuring plan, Traub wanted to complement the
turning-machine division with a milling-tool production unit. Heckert seemed
to fit the bill. But the Chemnitz enterprise was also in trouble.
For some time, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which in 1991 had taken
over the giant Kombinate, or state-owned enterprise, had been searching for
a buyer of a plant which since 1951 had had a monopoly in supplying the east
European and Russian markets.
Then called the Fritz-Heckert-Werk, it had employed 27,000 people spread
over 17 workshops, and had been producing 2,500 milling-tool units a year
with production running around the clock. It was east Germany's flagship.
But the ship could hardly sail once these markets collapsed after the
introduction of German monetary union. The Kombinate was broken up. The
4,300 workers in the milling-tool section was reduced by a tenth to 430,
while the Treuhand pumped money in, picking up losses, environmental
liabilities and redundancy costs totalling DM100m. Like Traub, it was now
lean. All it required was a new owner.
'We had been looking for a company like Heckert for some time,' said Mr
Zimmer. 'We wanted to have turning and milling under one roof, without any
overlap.' With the acquisition of Heckert, along with that of Hermle, which
manufactures milling machines for use in mould-making and small series
production, Traub's new strategy was in place.
'We now have an attractive site for production purposes and sales
activities,' explained Mr Zimmer.
But the marriage has had difficulties. Mr Wolfgang Sittig, the manager at
Heckert, says one of the greatest problems facing the Chemnitz plant is
finding ways to finance sales to the former Soviet Union which continues to
have a huge demand for Heckert's products.
'Because of (Russia's) financial problems, we have to finance the whole
production until we receive payment on delivery. Our problem is not cash
flow. It is revenue,' he explained, adding that he either depends on Hermes,
Germany's export guarantee mechanism, or on counter-trade.
'The point is that we cannot throw away the markets in eastern Europe or
Russia. They will have purchasing power sooner or later. This firm has built
up contacts over the years and we want to maintain them.'
More than 35 per cent of Heckert's turnover, which last year amounted to
DM70m, is backed by Hermes. The remaining sales are now targeted at western
markets. Losses, which last year totalled DM17m, are expected to stabilise,
while turnover this year will reach DM97m.
Inevitably, there will be a time lag before Heckert can reap the benefits of
Traub's capital investments of DM60m. Since Traub acquired five of the 11
manufacturing halls last September, three have been completely modernised.
'Heckert's union with Traub has many advantages. Heckert gains management
know-how and can ride on the back of Traub's worldwide marketing network,'
said Mr Sittig. Exports account for 35 per cent of Traub's turnover. In
return, Traub gains more production and capacity space, potential markets in
the east and - for the moment - lower wage costs.
However, the workers in Stuttgart, still reeling from the affects of the
redundancies, show little solidarity with their east German brothers.
'We are afraid of internal competition,' said Mr Manfred Suss, 50, a member
of the workers' council. 'How can we be sure that Traub will not shift some
of the production from Stuttgart to Chemnitz, especially since the wages
over there are about 30 per cent lower than over here?'
The workers at Heckert, who regard themselves as fortunate to have a job,
are not surprised about such views.
'We know the Stuttgart people are a bit worried,' said Mr Dieter Kupsca, a
40-year-old engineer. 'But through working for this western firm we just
have to be flexible. The old days of sticking to the monthly production plan
are over. We have to respond quickly to new orders and a new way of doing
things.'
The marriage between the workers' councils in Stuttgart and Chemnitz may
take time to consummate. But for Messrs Zimmer and Sittig, the union of two
of Germany's machine-tool manufacturers, forged after difficult
restructuring programmes, may help both ride out the recession and emerge
stronger when it is over.

Denman project in New South Wales' Hunter Valley. This is a 50:50 joint
venture with Agipcoal Australia.
MIM said the deposits were in 'an advanced state of evaluation' and
contained around 1bn tonnes of coal resources, suitable for domestic and

Attributable income more than doubled to R158.6m from R79.1m, and a dividend
of 56.8 cents was declared, up from 37.1 cents in 1993.
Mr Ronnie Lubner, chief executive, attributed the results to offshore
subsidiary Belron International, which serves the automotive glass
replacement industry in 11 countries, and which contributed 36 per cent of
earnings.
Belron benefited from a strong showing from Autoglass in the UK. Continental
Europe (except Germany and Italy) and Australia also did well.
Mr Lubner was particularly pleased with the group's American operations,
Windshields America.
Group turnover increased by 17 per cent to R3.2bn from R2.77bn while net
financing costs dropped to R28.5m from R32.6m on strong cash flow.
Mr Lubner was 'cautiously optimistic' about the South African economy in the
new political climate.

Hindustan Motors, India's second largest carmaker and a GP Birla group
company, confirmed its recovery from recession for the year to March 31 by
making a net profit of Rs176m (Dollars 5.6m), against a loss of Rs305m in
the previous year.
With higher car sales and improvements in the earthmoving equipment and
power products division, turnover rose to Rs6.44bn from Rs5.04bn.
The company, which is in talks with General Motors of the US about a
possible joint venture in India, said it had been able to reduce costs
during the year and there would be further savings with the ongoing
modernisation of car production facilities.
MRF, India's biggest producer and exporter of tyres, recorded a 15.1 per
cent increase in net sales to Rs5.38bn for the six months to end-March from
Rs4.68bn in the same period last year.
The company's tyres met with greater demand from motor vehicle manufacturers
and also in the replacement market. However, because of higher input costs,
gross profit was up only 2.8 per cent to Rs420m.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Berliner Bank to raise dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Berliner Bank, which earlier this year merged with two others to form
Germany's sixth-biggest bank, will increase its dividend by DM7 to DM9
following last year's high partial operating profits and operating results.
At the same time, Mr Wolfgang Steinriede, spokesman for the board, said the
the group's net profits before risk provisions would total about DM1.2bn
(Dollars 612m), similar to last year.
Partial operating profits, without trading, for 1993 rose by 60.7 per cent
to DM372.4m (Dollars 223.5m), while full operating results rose by 120 per
cent to DM303.2m. Net profits rose by 71 per cent to DM121.1m. Net interest
receipts rose by 34.3 per cent to DM1.33bn, while commission fees increased
by 24.3 per cent to DM254.6m.
Last year's results confirm the bank's success in integrating the Berliner
Stadtbank, its east Berlin counterpart. The takeover of this bank after
German unification included DM7bn of government-guaranteed loans and an
additional capital of DM550m.
However, this year's performance will be anchored on the new structure,
called Bank Gesellschaft Berlin, which for the first time in German banking
brings together the private and public sector.
BGB includes Landesbank Berlin, which owns the saving banks, Berliner
Hypotheken und Pfandbriefbank (a property financing institution) and
Berliner Bank (a commercial bank). All three institutions are owned by the
State of Berlin. Currently, Berlin holds a 78 per cent stake in the BGB.
But Mr Steinriede yesterday said the Berlin Senate intended to reduce its
stake in BGB by about 10 per cent in 1995. By the end of the first quarter
of this year, BGB's total share capital amounted to DM8.3bn.
Berlin's decision to reduce its stake was partly prompted by financial
reasons - the city had a budget deficit of DM7bn - as well as the need to
push Berlin towards becoming a financial centre.

<TEXT>
Losses at Alitalia, Italy's national airline and number four in Europe with
more than 20m passengers a year, soared to L343bn (Dollars 214m) in 1993,
from L17.6bn in 1992, agencies report from Rome.
Revenues in the period rose 9.8 per cent to L5,900bn.
The Alitalia airline subsidiary lost L345.6bn, against a deficit of L16.8bn
in 1992, the company said.
The carrier also noted that results for the first quarter of 1994 show the
company lost L190bn.
Alitalia said that because losses last year and in the first quarter this
year had exceeded one-third of its capital, its shareholders' meeting would
have to discuss the company's capital structure.
Under Italian law, Alitalia will have to give a special report on the
company's capital structure. A recapitalisation will become mandatory if
this year's losses do not fall by one-third.
Alitalia blamed 1993's results on a number of factors, including a generally
depressed international economy; overcapacity in the industry; a strong
concentration of demand in business travel; and price wars which were
'without precedent'.
Measures the Alitalia board listed as necessary to improve the airline's
condition included a 'notable' reduction in staff; improved client service;
a strengthening of its activity in northern Italy; an examination of
subsidiary assets; a 'decisive' intervention into costs generally; and a
re-examination of cockpit work rules.
Alitalia registered a 5.3 per cent rise in international passengers in 1993,
but a sharp 10 per cent drop in domestic boardings, which reflected the
recession in Italy, the company said.
The transport of goods rose 4.8 per cent.
Gross operating results for 1993 showed a loss of L129.5bn, while operating
results swung to a loss of L80bn from a positive L155bn in 1992.
Last year, the company made L791bn worth of investments, of which L146bn was
in equity interests and L580bn in equipment, the carrier said.

The Jamaican government has sold 70 per cent of Air Jamaica to a consortium
of local and Canadian investors for USDollars 26.5m.
The disposal is the first of what is expected to be a series of sales of
several of the Caribbean's loss-making carriers. A further 5 per cent of Air
Jamaica will be offered to employees with the government retaining 25 per
cent.
The government will take responsibility for all liabilities which exceed the
value of the current assets, said Mr P. J. Patterson, Jamaica's prime
minister. 'Liabilities far outweigh assets and the government will be
writing off a significant amount,' said a company official.
The consortium taking control of Air Jamaica says that the carrier will be
capitalised at Dollars 52.5m, and that the funds will be raised from
Jamaican and Canadian sources.
The government has been seeking a buyer for Air Jamaica for four years. The
airline has recorded continuing losses, including a deficit of just over
Dollars 20m last year.
The deal coincides with a move by several other Caribbean governments to
merge their airlines. They have invited British Airways to take a 25 per
cent stake in the venture. Regional officials say that BA is carrying out a
feasibility study of the scheme.
The governments intend to start with the merger of the operations of Air
Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago Airways, which runs BWIA International. The
new regional company will later be expanded with the inclusion of
Bahamasair, the Guyana Airways Corporation, and Leeward Islands Air
Transport, an island-hopping commuter airline which is owned by several
governments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of France's largest insurance
groups, has chosen to forge closer links with Societe Generale after its
privatisation, rather than Credit Lyonnais.
Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais have for some months been competing to
become AGF's strategic partner in the banking sector. Both banks have
cross-shareholding agreements with AGF, which yesterday confirmed it had
plumped for Societe Generale.
The news is blow to Credit Lyonnais, which is still reeling from controversy
over its recent announcement of a FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.7bn)
government-backed rescue package. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the bank's new
chairman, had made no secret of wanting a closer liaison with AGF as part of
his long-term recovery strategy.
Societe Generale yesterday affirmed plans to raise its 1.7 per cent stake in
AGF when the insurer is privatised later this year. It has yet to decide how
big its eventual stake will be. Societe Generale increased its stake in the
Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company from 1.8 to 5 per cent at the time of its
recent privatisation.
Societe Generale said it was still considering whether to develop
operational links with AGF. The bank has ruled out the possibility of
joining forces in life insurance, as it already has interests in that area.
But it said AGF might form part of its eventual expansion into damage
insurance.
The liaison between AGF and Societe Generale forms part of a trend in French
finance. Union des Assurances de Paris has used its privatisation (now
nearing completion) as an opportunity to strengthen its long-standing links
with Banque Nationale de Paris.

<TEXT>
Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group, is planning
to buy back 4.5m of its shares in a deal worth more than Dollars 200m.
Like other financial services stocks, Transamerica has been hit by rising
interest rates in recent weeks. Its shares ended last week at Dollars 51 1/8
, down from a high of Dollars 62 3/8 .
News of the buy-back spurred a rise in the stock in New York yesterday
morning, to Dollars 52 5/8 .
The company announced a Dutch auction for the stock, under which holders are
being invited to tender their shares at between Dollars 48 and Dollars 55.
Transamerica will then pay a single price for the stock it buys, set at the
lowest level which allows it to reach its target of 4.5m shares.
The offer remains open until June 6.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency, said the company's capital structure
would remain strong even after paying out cash for the shares, and
reaffirmed its single-A senior debt rating for the group.

Regional governments will have a minority stake in the new company which
will run the airlines. The plan is for large airlines and regional private
business to hold a majority of the new company's equity.
A study commissioned by the Caribbean Community indicated that a
rationalisation of the region's air transport, with shared services and a
single company running the five airlines, would lead to savings of Dollars
60m a year.
None of the airlines has been an attractive proposition, mainly because they
have no record of financial viability. There is little to indicate that
their operational efficiency can be significantly improved.
Air Jamaica has a fleet of eight. It plies routes between the island and
several eastern and south-eastern US cities. BWIA has a fleet of 11. Its
accumulated losses over the past six years have been put by company
officials at 'about Dollars 165m'.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Advisers seek higher offer for
Kemper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to Kemper, the US investment group, were contacting other possible
bidders for the company yesterday in an attempt to elicit a higher price
than the Dollars 60 a share offered by GE Capital.
Kemper's board bowed over the weekend to pressure from GE Capital to agree a
sale, after the financial services arm of General Electric raised its bid
from Dollars 55 a share.
'We are hoping that we will get more than Dollars 60 a share - possibly much
more,' the company said. It added that it had received 'several approaches'
from potential bidders after GE Capital first announced in March its
interest in acquiring the company, though it was premature to judge whether
any of these companies would make a formal bid.
In a sign that few stock traders think the investment group will attract a
higher offer, however, Kemper's share price failed to rise above Dollars 60
yesterday. It reached GE's bid level in the morning, before closing at
Dollars 59 1/8 , a gain on the day of Dollars 1 5/8 .
The mix of Kemper's business, and the fact that GE Capital has offered
Dollars 2.4bn in cash, has left many traders convinced that the GE financial
services arm will win control.
Kemper's prize assets are its life insurance business and its mutual funds,
but its Dollars 1.7bn property portfolio and a struggling stockbroking
network make it unattractive to many financial groups, which are still
shaking off the effects of the late-1980s property crash.
Travelers, the financial services group headed by Mr Sanford Weill, has been
seen as the most likely rival bidder. Mr Weill recently said he foresaw
further consolidation among US insurance and fund management groups, and did
not rule out Travelers out as a buyer. However, the company is still
digesting two big acquisitions made recently - Shearson, the retail broker,
and the shares it did not already own in Travelers insurance.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: CS Holding goes cold on bank
deal - Frustration as Austrian government stalls on Creditanstalt stake sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding, the big Swiss international financial
group built around Credit Suisse, may well be wondering if he has been used
by Austria's financial establishment.
Speaking in London earlier this month, Mr Gut put an end to months of
speculation in Vienna by confirming that his group was interested in buying
from the Austrian finance ministry a large part of its controlling stake in
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the country's second-largest bank.
He went further, saying that if CS bought, say, a 28 per cent stake
initially, it would ultimately like to take full control of the bank. As he
put it: 'I do not like to be half pregnant.'
That brought a dusty response from Creditanstalt's chief executive, Mr Guido
Schmidt-Chiari. 'We would be the only leading commercial bank in the
developed world that would be controlled from abroad,' he said.
The bank's new supervisory board chairman, Mr Walter Fremuth, chimed in. 'We
do not need to find a partner. We can live without one.'
It has long been known that Mr Schmidt-Chiari would like the finance
ministry's stake to be widely dispersed among domestic and foreign
investors.
He and his colleagues put together a proposal to do just that last autumn,
when Creditanstalt shares were still among the most popular on the Vienna
stock exchange.
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, rejected the proposal, even
though he needed funds from privatisation to prevent the public deficit from
reaching unacceptable levels.
Mr Lacina has little confidence in Creditanstalt, and believes that a strong
partner is needed to prevent it from getting into trouble again.
The bank has suffered huge losses twice in the past 15 years.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, seems to share Mr
Lacina's view. It said last week that loss of government control of
Creditanstalt, if not replaced by a strong controlling shareholder, might
have a negative impact on the bank's rating.
Creditanstalt directors, aware of Mr Lacina's view, have tried in recent
months to rally an Austrian consortium, built around EA-Generali, the
insurance group, to buy a large part of the government's holding.
This is an outcome that could also satisfy Mr Lacina, as it would eliminate
complaints of a foreign sell-out.
However, as with other recent attempts to mobilise Austria's conservative
financiers to action, progress has been slow, to say the least. Mr Gut's
intervention may have been just the thing to galvanise them into action. The
word from the EA-Generali camp yesterday was that a formal offer would be
made at the end of this week.
Even if an Austrian offer does not materialise, it is unlikely that CS will
pursue its suit. An official said the group would not want to get involved
with a bank whose management did not want it.
CS's recent acquisitions in Switzerland, including the big SFr1.6bn (Dollars
1.1bn) takeover last year of Swiss Volksbank - which, coincidentally, is
only slightly smaller than Creditanstalt - have shown that integration can
be difficult even when the top management of both sides are fully
supportive.
Without that support, a takeover can be disastrous.
Again, Standard &amp; Poor's seems to share that view. It said on Thursday that
an involvement by CS with Creditanstalt would probably have an adverse
effect on the rating of Credit Suisse.

<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch-based food retailer, has forecast an improvement in
first-quarter net profits against last year's result. The prediction follows
the release of figures yesterday showing that sales, excluding value added
tax, rose by 8 per cent, to Fl 8.6bn (Dollars 4.6bn), in the first 16 weeks
of the year.
The company, which is due to publish quarterly figures on June 16, said its
supermarket operations in the US, the Netherlands and other parts of Europe
were expected to post higher operating profit.
Sales in the US, which accounts for about half of turnover, rose by 5.5 per
cent in the quarter. In the Netherlands, turnover was up 3 per cent, while
sales in the rest of Europe, which are small compared with US and Dutch
turnover, jumped by 48.3 per cent, reflecting recent acquisitions in
Portugal.
Mr Cees van der Hoeven, president, speaking ahead of yesterday's annual
shareholders' meeting, said two of the group's five US chains, Finast Ohio
and Edwards, were expected to return to profit in 1994 after losses in 1993.
Ahold's three other chains, Bi-Lo, Tops and Giant, were profitable last
year.
The company recently acquired a sixth chain, Tennessee-based Red Food
Stores, for Dollars 124m plus Dollars 5m in debt. Red Food will not
contribute to Ahold's 1994 profits.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nabisco expands Spanish side

<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday exercised its option
to buy the remaining 50 per cent of RJR Alimentacion, the Spanish food
company that it has managed for the past year as a joint venture with
Tabacalera, Spain's state-controlled tobacco corporation.
The purchase of the stake, which values the company at Pta17.25bn (Dollars
125m), signals the end of an ill-fated attempt by Tabacalera to diversify
into food production.
The US multinational had until March 31 1995 to exercise its option for the
rest of the joint venture. Its decision to act now is part of a plan to
strengthen its European food businesses.
RJR Alimentacion markets Royal Brands products in Spain. These include
leading biscuit and powdered puddings brands.
The core Royal Brands products were bought by Tabacalera from Nabisco when
the US conglomerate sold off extensive operations, among them its European
businesses, in the late 1980s. The sales were designed to pay off debts used
to finance a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street
investment firm.
Tabacalera spent some Pta53bn building up a food division around Royal
Brands, taking on canned vegetable units, processed meat firms and juice
companies, before deciding that it was more profitable to concentrate on
tobacco. In July last year, it transformed its Royal Brands units into RJR
Alimentacion, a Nabisco-managed joint venture.
Having disposed of its food division earlier than planned, Tabacalera, which
is 38 per cent-owned by foreign institutions, is expected to step up a
streamlining programme involving staff cuts and the closure of three of its
14 plants.

FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Holderbank in agreed bid for
French cement group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Holderbank, the Swiss-based international cement and aggregates group, is
making an agreed bid for the cement, ready-mixed concrete and aggregates
operations of Ciments et Engrais de Dannes et de l'Est (Cedest), for
FFr2.6bn (Dollars 456m).
The takeover, which is subject to approval by the French and European Union
authorities, would double Holderbank's cement capacity in France. It would
also raise its market share in northern France from 25 per cent to 35 per
cent. However, it would still leave the group ranked third after Ciments
Lafarge and Ciments Francais.
The plan is for Holderbank to acquire 84.1 per cent of the share capital of
Cedest from Compagnie Generale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP), at
FFr2,000 per share ex-dividend for a total of FFr3.6bn.
Holderbank would simultaneously sell the abrasives and fertilisers business
units of Cedest back to CGIP for FFr1bn.
Then, once official approval was achieved, it would make an offer on the
Paris bourse to Cedest minority shareholders at the same price.
Holderbank said the acquisition would 'round off' its holdings in France.
Cedest is France's fifth-largest cement producer with a total annual
production capacity of 2.7m tonnes. It also owns a cement grinding station
on the island of La Reunion with annual capacity of 400,000 tonnes.
In 1993, it sold 2.1m tonnes of cement, 1.7m tonnes of ready-mixed concrete
and 3.2m tonnes of aggregates.
For CGIP, the Cedest deal forms part of a programme of asset sales. The
French group has for some months been trying to generate capital to
replenish its resources, following a deal last year which lifted its holding
in CarnaudMetalBox, the Anglo-French packaging group.
CGIP has a string of other investments, including a stake in Cap Sogeti
Gemini, the computer services concern. The group earlier this year raised
FFr994m from a convertible bond issue.
The Cedest disposal has left CGIP with a 'war chest' worth around FFr3bn,
according to the company. It said it planned to use its cash to 'further
develop' its role as an 'entrepreneur investor' in manufacturing industry
and the service sector.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle, the world's largest foods group, is buying a substantial minority
stake in Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream of Oakland, California, for Dollars 106m.
Nestle has agreed to buy 3m Dreyer's shares at Dollars 32 a share, plus
warrants to purchase a further 2m shares at the same price later.
The 5m shares would give Nestle a 22 per cent stake in Dreyer's, which is
quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market.
The first part of the transaction would cost Nestle Dollars 106m and give it
the right to name two Dreyer's directors.
The two companies have agreed that Dreyer's will distribute Nestle frozen
novelties and ice cream in selected markets from next year.
Dreyer's, which sells under the Dreyer's and Edy's brand names, had
consolidated net sales for the 13-week period to March 26 of Dollars 112m, 9
per cent higher than in the comparable period. Net income for the first
quarter was down 25.7 per cent to Dollars 1.58m, or 11 cents per common
share.

<TEXT>
Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse (First Austrian) has joined the local
consortium formed to bid for a large minority stake in
Creditanstalt-Bankverein from the Austrian government, writes Ian Rodger.
Earlier this month, CS Holding was confirmed as the finance ministry's
preferred buyer for a large part of its 49 per cent holding of
Creditanstalt's capital (with 70 per cent of the voting rights).
This sparked renewed efforts in Vienna's business community to prevent
Creditanstalt, the flagship bank of Austria's 'black' (Conservative)
partisans, from falling into foreign hands.
First Austrian, the country's fourth-largest and also a 'black' bank, said
yesterday it was ready to buy 'a few per cent' of the Creditanstalt shares
as part of a consortium led by EA-Generali.

quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCP, the Swedish consumer products group which Volvo is to sell, yesterday
announced a SKr296m (Dollars 38.44m) profit after financial items for the
first three months.
The result compares with a profit of SKr333m in the same period last year
when the result was boosted by a SKr350m gain from a disposal.
BCP was formed in late 1992 after the break-up of Procordia, a drugs-to-food
group jointly controlled by the Swedish state and Volvo. Volvo owns 74 per
cent of the company and has launched a bid for the balance. It then intends
to sell the group - to focus on transport.
BCP includes Swedish Match and many of Sweden's best-known food and drink
brands.
BCP's first-quarter group income fell 4 per cent to SKr4.85bn, reflecting
the sale of Swedish Match's confectionery activities. Operating income
dropped to SKr322m from SKr410m.
Swedish Match saw sales fall to SKr1.77bn from SKr1.96bn, but profits from
continuing activities more than doubled to SKr255m from SKr118m. The
improvement stemmed from a recovery in Swedish tobacco sales.
Procordia Food &amp; Beverages, the group's other main division, saw sales
expand to SKr2.34bn from SKr2.24bn, but profits from continuing operations
fell marginally to SKr59m from SKr62m.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Costain's coal activities in US hit by bad
weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Costain, the construction and mining group, fell almost a tenth
yesterday following a warning that US coal profits had been hit by bad
winter weather and operational problems during the first three months of
this year.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, told the annual meeting that it would not
be possible to recover the profit shortfall during the remainder of the
year.
Costain's share price fell from 33p to 30 1/2 p. The group said later that
it had suffered from some minor geological problems which now had been
resolved.
Costain returned to the black last year making pre-tax profits of Pounds
68.7m compared to a Pounds 204.6m loss in 1992. All but Pounds 200,000 of
the 1993 figure arose from the sale of the group's Australian coal mining
business to Peabody, part of Hanson, the industrial conglomerate.
The sale, together with proceeds from last autumn's Pounds 83.9m rights
issue, enabled Costain to reduce net debt from Pounds 331m to Pounds 83m and
gearing to 37 per cent of increased shareholders' fund of Pounds 228m.
Since the year-end the group has sold its remaining Australian property
interests for ADollars 27.1m (Pounds 12.8m), making a small profit on the
deal. The engineering and construction division had also won some valuable
new contracts, Sir Christopher said.
Nonetheless, conditions remained very difficult in the UK and overseas. UK
construction margins, in spite of reports of increased orders won by the
industry, remained slim. As a result Sir Christopher said short-term
profitability remained under pressure.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Parkland returns to black with Pounds 2.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parkland Group, the Bradford-based textile company, yesterday announced its
return to profitability in the year to February 27, helped by the write-back
of provisions and a 19 per cent increase in sales from continuing
operations.
Pre-tax profit amounted to Pounds 2.2m, compared with a Pounds 1.6m loss a
year earlier. However, the 1993 figure was hit by a Pounds 704,000
provision, of which Pounds 694,000 was written back in the latest results,
following the disposal of Maitland.
The management is predicting more modest sales growth in the current year.
It expects to achieve further reductions in its cost base, but in the longer
term it could be affected by increasing raw material costs, primarily wool.
The share price fell 18p to 220p, as a result of yesterday's cautious
trading statement.
Last year Parkland disposed of its remaining garment manufacturing
businesses to refocus on its core area of spinning and fabric production.
Total turnover for the year was down from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 54.8m, but
sales from continuing businesses increased sharply from Pounds 44.1m to
Pounds 52.5m.
Parkland has made a substantial push to expand its export markets, and
export sales increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 11.4m, representing 22 per
cent of total sales from continuing businesses.
Gearing has been reduced from 31 per cent to 16 per cent, and Mr Bryan
Lodder, chief executive, said the company would increase capital expenditure
from Pounds 2.5m in 1994, to maintain its position in an increasingly
competitive market.
The company is proposing a final dividend of 3p, making a total of 5p for
the year, compared with 2p in 1993.
Earnings per share on a net basis amounted to 19.7p, against losses of 19.3p
last time. On a nil basis they emerged at 21.1p (18.7p).

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Unit trust sales help Pearl to Pounds 130m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearl Group, the life and general insurer, achieved a 40 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 130.3m for the year to end-December, helped by
a steep rise in unit trust sales which offset a sharp fall in single premium
business.
Mr David Gordon, chief actuary, said the prime cause for the fall in single
premium products was the closure of Pearl's intermediary sales unit, as the
company focused on its core business areas of the home service operation -
selling products through branches and home collection.
The fall in new single premium business had a sharp impact on the total
premium income of the ordinary branch business which fell from Pounds 942m
to Pounds 786.4m . Industrial branch business held up rather better,
slipping only from Pounds 203.2m to Pounds 195.9m.
Mr Gordon said the group had made 'appropriate' provisions in respect of its
possible exposure to compensation as a result of mis-selling of pension
transfers. Pearl, a part of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, has a
large share of the pension transfer market, with an estimated 50,000 cases.
Total premium income fell to Pounds 982.3m (Pounds 1.15bn), with new single
premium business dropping to Pounds 407.8m (Pounds 619.8m). New annual
premium business stood at Pounds 107.1m (Pounds 109.7m).
Profits from general insurance rose from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 21.3m while
profits from unit trusts rose from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 6.3m.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pausing for breath at B&amp;J
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the lossmaking Poundstretcher
chain of discount stores, will have several weeks to weigh rival offers for
the group, which yesterday revealed a further recent deterioration in sales.
An extraordinary general meeting called to approve a capital injection by
the Weisfelds, the millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants
discount clothing chain, was yesterday unanimously adjourned so that
shareholders could also receive details of the latest rescue proposal, from
Pepkor, South Africa's biggest retail group.
The Weisfelds had offered to inject an initial Pounds 6m, in return for a 19
per cent stake and two seats on the board. If their investment had reached
its maximum of about Pounds 28m, their stake would have reached 42 per cent.
Pepkor has proposed injecting an initial Pounds 20m, but will receive a 63
per cent stake if it puts in the full Pounds 56.2m proposed.
Mr John Jackson, B&amp;J's chairman, said yesterday's meeting was being held in
'slightly unusual circumstances', in that the board had initially
recommended the Weisfeld scheme, but had then switched its support to the
Pepkor offer, which was only agreed late on Friday.
Mr Gerald Weisfeld said: 'What this company needs is not just cash, but
expertise and individual experience in this sector.'
Mr Weisfeld also said that B&amp;J had not given satisfactory assurances that Mr
Philip Green had not and would not become involved with the Pepkor offer. Mr
Green was chairman of Amber Day Holdings when it bought WEW from the
Weisfelds in 1990, but the couple resigned the following year after policy
disagreements.
Mr Jackson said he had received categorical assurances from Pepkor that
neither Mr Green, not any other third party, was involved in the South
Africans' proposal.
Yesterday's egm was adjourned until May 31, when the Weisfeld offer seems
likely to be voted down. Another egm to consider the Pepkor offer will be
called three weeks after a circular detailing the South African offer is
posted, which is likely this week.
B&amp;J said that its current financial difficulties had led to some creditors
delaying supplies and in the last four weeks like-for-like sales were 10 per
cent below last year's level.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Confident of adding some pep - The
rationale for Pepkor's interest in Brown &amp; Jackson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pepkor believes the strategy which has built it into South Africa's largest
retailer will help it turn round Brown &amp; Jackson, the troubled British
retailer which it is seeking to control.
'We've felt for a long time that our 'Pep retail formula' would be
applicable anywhere in the world with a large, low-income mass market,' says
Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's executive chairman.
'We have a lot of experience in running a large number of relatively small
retail outlets over a wide geographical area with a highly simplified and
effective distribution system that we think will be applicable to the UK
market,' notes Mr Wiese.
Building off its domestic base, Pepkor has been focusing on overseas
expansion for several years, and by the end of last year its Scottish chain,
Your More Store, had grown to 45 outlets.
Operations have been relatively successful to date, with 13 new stores
opening in the first half of financial 1994 and another three in the second.
Despite the costs of the expansion programme, the group has managed to break
even and states that most of its stores are profitable.
However, Pepkor's management has long had its eye on expanding into England,
especially the north, with a declared long-term target for a 200-store
chain.
The acquisition of Brown &amp; Jackson, with its 230-store Poundstretcher chain,
would more than satisfy that goal and turn Pepkor into the biggest player in
this sector of the British retail market.
Turning Poundstretcher around will be a tall order, but Mr Wiese and his
team are confident they can do the job. And although there is some concern
over whether the company has sufficient management breadth to digest these
acquisitions without diluting management for its domestic questions, the
company is sure this will not happen.
'We have sufficient management depth to help Poundstretcher return to
profitability without any problems for our southern African operations,'
says Mr Wiese.
Pepkor, which is Africa's largest retailer with annual sales for R8.24bn,
(Pounds 1.13bn) has been a star stock over the past five years, posting
annual earnings per share gains averaging nearly 20 per cent despite a
four-year recession in its home market.
It owns 1,700 stores and has 40,000 employees throughout southern Africa. It
focuses on mass-market retailing in food, clothing and business materials
industries, and has some manufacturing of semi-durable goods related to its
own activities.
The group's main division is Pep stores, with more than 1,100 outlets. It is
a mass market retail group that primarily targets the country's black
consumer base.
In this area of down-market retailing the company's long-term performance
has been spectacular, and no other South African company has been able to
match it.
And although its most recent year was a difficult one, as operating profit
declined 8 per cent due to a combination of low consumer activity and
destabilisation in the black townships in the run-up to the elections, this
is expected to improve significantly over the next year.
Through much of the 1970s and 1980s Pepkor was regarded as something of a
backwoods group, reflecting its origins as an Afrikaaner dominated company
concentrating on small towns. But over the past few years it has catapulted
over some of its blue-chip competitors with a string of acquisitions.
In addition to taking over Cashbuild, the building materials company, and
Smart Centre, the clothing group, it has also bought Shoprite/Checkers, the
supermarket chain, and managed largely to turn around the ailing company.
Its manufacturing operations have long worked at full capacity, and profit
growth has been dependent largely on productivity increases, which the
company has consistently achieved. It is this kind of management attention
and marketing skill that will be transferred to Poundstretcher if the deal
goes ahead.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: DCC advances 49% to IPounds 22.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DCC, the private Dublin-based industrial holding company which plans a
public flotation at the end of this month, has reported a 49 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 22.2m for the year ending March 31
1994.
The advance was achieved on turnover up 36.7 per cent from IPounds 246m to
IPounds 336m, including associated undertakings. The 1993 results are
restated putting the accounts on a fully consolidated basis.
The company has spent IPounds 33.4m on acquisitions in the past year, making
a total of IPounds 76.8m spent on its acquisition programme over three
years.
In addition, capital investment of IPounds 37.1m has been undertaken over
the same period. Net debt at the year-end is reported as IPounds 1.5m,
representing 1.8 per cent of shareholders' funds of IPounds 100.8m.
Mr Jim Flavin, chief executive, said 'This has been achieved without any
recourse to shareholders in the past three years, and demonstrates the
profit and cash generative quality of the business'.
The company has not given a detailed profit and turnover breakdown by
division, but its flotation prospectus is due out this Thursday.
A 5-for-1 share split was carried out last March, making a total of 71m
shares in issue, 95 per cent of which are held by institutional investors.
Bank of Ireland sold off its 20 per cent stake in the group last December
for IPounds 10 per share, before the share split.
The company expects to raise less than IPounds 25m in the flotation, its
main purpose being to obtain a listing in London and Dublin. A flotation
price in the range of IPounds 2.50 to Pounds 3 range is anticipated, which
will give a post-flotation market capitalisation in the region of IPounds
250m.
Earnings per share were 19.56p (16.82p) and a second interim dividend of
3.896p makes a total for the year of 5p (2.3p).

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Disposal helps API to 54% interim growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The disposal of its heating and ventilating business helped API Group, the
packaging, coatings and office products company, to lift interim profits by
54 per cent.
Pre-tax surplus for the six months ended April 2 rose from Pounds 1.97m to
Pounds 3.01m, while turnover improved 14 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds
32.8m), with Pounds 1.39m (Pounds 1.78m) from discontinued activities.
Mr Michael Smith, chief executive, said he was pleased with the growth
adding that the second half was traditionally stronger. The group had the
capacity to make sales of Pounds 100m 'with very little capital
expenditure'.
Operating profits were Pounds 2.81m (Pounds 1.97m), including Pounds 185,000
from Diffusion Environmental Systems, the heating and ventilating business
sold in February for Pounds 1.5m cash, giving a profit of Pounds 815,000
after expenses.
Earnings per share rose from 6.4p to 9.55p. The interim dividend is lifted
from 3.35p to 3.7p.
The foils and laminates division, which makes packaging, reported operating
profits up from Pounds 1.37m to Pounds 2.11m on turnover of Pounds 24m
(Pounds 20m). Mr Smith said the division had benefited from new products and
growth in market share. It had also worked hard to keep stocks down and to
speed up response times.
The coatings and office products division improved sales from Pounds 11m to
Pounds 12m, with operating profits just ahead at Pounds 1.17m (Pounds
1.14m). The division suffered from the volatility of the Swedish krone,
which had a negative effect equivalent to Pounds 230,000 on Tenza, based in
Sweden.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Prowting land price warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply rising land prices are threatening to undermine returning
profitability of housebuilders, Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive of
Prowting, warned yesterday.
The south of England housebuilder has only just returned to the black making
pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.12m during the 12 months to the end of February.
This compared with losses of Pounds 4.87m during the previous 12 months.
Mr Roydon said that land prices in southern England had risen by an average
of 20 per cent in the past year. Much of this increase had occurred since
January 1 as builders had begun to spend proceeds from rights issue.
Increased land costs could only be justified if house prices were to rise
more rapidly.
Prowting owned 6,000 housing plots with planning permission equivalent to
six years' supply at current rates of building. The company, which last year
sold 664 homes at an average price of Pounds 88,000, plans to increase sales
to about 1,100 in the current year.
Recovery, Mr Roydon stated, had been aided by the acquisition last
September, for Pounds 22.6m, of Galliford Homes, which contributed gross
profits of Pounds 5.51m from the sale of 284 homes during the second half.
Overall gross profits rose from Pounds 6.8m - before exceptional debits of
Pounds 4.9m - to Pounds 10.4m as the group's existing housebuilding
operations benefited from the housing market recovery. Profits from holiday
homes in Portugal rose from Pounds 205,000 to Pounds 278,000 in a difficult
market.
The absence of provisions, following write-downs of Pounds 4.93m in 1992-93,
and lower interest charges of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 4m) also helped the
group's return to pre-tax profits.
As promised last September the company is paying a maintained final dividend
of 1.7p making a same-again total of 3.4p for the year. This is just covered
by earnings per share of 3.5p (7.9p losses).
COMMENT
Prowting's land bank, including 2,000 plots acquired with Galliford, is in
the books at an average cost of Pounds 11,400 per plot, or Pounds 130,000 an
acre - a slightly higher price than 12 months ago but enough to provide a
more than healthy margin of 17.2 per cent. To replace this land would cost
Pounds 250,000 an acre at current prices. Few housebuilders will achieve
better margins. The company's virtues, however, are already recognised in a
share price which has outperformed the sector by a fifth during the past 12
months. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m would put the company on 21 times
earnings which is high enough given Prowting's justifiable concerns over the
mismatch between land and house price increases.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: N Brown rises 18% but cautious on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
N Brown, the Manchester-based direct mail-order group which specialises in
clothing for older women, yesterday reported an 18 per cent increase in
full-year pre-tax profits.
For the 52 weeks to February 26 profits were Pounds 22.5m, against Pounds
19m, on turnover ahead 9.3 per cent to Pounds 186.8m (Pounds 170.8m).
Earnings per share were 17 per cent higher at 20.83p (17.74p), and a final
dividend of 5.75p makes a total of 8p (7p).
The company also announced plans for a 1-for-1 bonus share issue to improve
the shares' liquidity.
The shares closed up 2p at 477p.
Sir David Alliance, chairman, said the current financial year had started
well but he remained cautious about the rate of general economic recovery
and its impact on the business.
The profit improvement reflected sales gains by the core home-shopping
business and a turnround in the financial and property services operations.
Overall operating profits grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 24.7m (Pounds
22.1m). The home-shopping business increased its contribution by 8.5 per
cent to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 22.6m) on sales up 9.4 per cent to Pounds
179.8m (Pounds 164.3m.)
Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said the sales increase reflected a 2 per
cent gain in the total number of customers and a 7 per cent increase in
their average spending.
The group's long-established catalogues for older women accounted for 77 per
cent of group turnover, while Fashion World and Candid, both introduced four
years ago and targeted at the growing number of consumers in the 35-50 age
range, increased their turnover by more than 40 per cent.
Financial and property services reported a Pounds 427,000 operating profit,
compared with a Pounds 273,000 loss on turnover up 7 per cent to Pounds
7.05m (Pounds 6.59m).
The pre-tax figure was also helped by a sharp decline in interest costs to
Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 3.3m) reflecting lower interest rates and reduced
borrowings.
Year-end gearing fell from 37 per cent to 28 per cent.
COMMENT
Despite the chairman's cautious remarks Brown's results were at the top end
of analysts' forecasts and the core mail-order business continues to perform
well by emphasising product range, value and customer service. The group
claims 23.1 per cent of the Pounds 836m a year direct home-shopping market,
and ranks sixth in the combined Pounds 4.4bn agency and direct home-shopping
market, leaving plenty of room for domestic organic growth. Demographics are
working in the group's favour and this, coupled with the introduction of new
catalogues aimed at a slightly younger customer, should keep sales moving
ahead. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 25.25m look possible producing
earnings of about 23.4p. The stock's 20.4 prospective multiple looks high,
but it is deserved.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: APH listing this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Automotive Precision Holdings, a precision engineering company that exports
80 per cent of its products to North America, is planning to come to the
market later this month with a valuation of around Pounds 50m.
The company was bought by the management four years ago for a total of
Pounds 5.7m from Hunting, the defence, aviation and oil group. Mr Stefan
Petszaft, managing director, said the team of five managers in the buy-out
team were expecting to retain 50 to 55 per cent of the equity after
flotation. The company would receive only Pounds 2.5m of the new money,
which would be used for costs, repayment of borrowings and additional
working capital.
APH was breaking even on turnover of Pounds 14m at the time of the buy-out.
Last year profits before non-recurring items were Pounds 4.9m on turnover of
Pounds 17m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.9m.

Shares in Maid, the business information supplier, rose by 4p to 74p
yesterday after the group, which came to market via a placing in March at
110p, issued a bullish trading statement.
Maid's board said trading results for the current year 'are ahead of budget
and significantly ahead of the same period in 1993'.
The statement added that, 'new clients have been acquired at a rate
considerably in excess of last year and the high rate of renewals has been
maintained.'
Mr Dan Wagner, the chairman, said that the statement had been issued in
response to a broker note forecast, issued by Hoare Govett, the group's
stockbroker, which he stated forecast a Pounds 1m profit this year and a
Pounds 5m profit for 1995.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Babcock ends year with Pounds 41m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Babcock International, the engineering contracting and materials handling
group, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 41.2m for the year ended
March 31, compared with a profit of Pounds 21.1m last time.
The result is exactly in line with preliminary estimates announced on April
21, when Babcock unveiled a 4-for-7 rights issue to raise about Pounds
78.6m, a new three-year corporate plan and a major restructuring of its
energy division.
The shake-out, involving 420 more job cuts at Babcock's Renfrew plant in
Scotland, produced a Pounds 25m provision for restructuring, the main reason
for the sharp fall into loss.
There was also a Pounds 7.9m provision on discontinued businesses in South
Africa, offset by credits totalling Pounds 3.4m.
Before the exceptional items, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 11.7m (Pounds
34.1m profit). Turnover rose from Pounds 748m to Pounds 805m, of which all
but Pounds 3.7m came from continuing businesses.
As stated last month, Babcock is not paying a final dividend - it paid no
interim either. The board said it would resume payments once the group's
performance has improved in line with the expected benefits of the new
corporate plan.
After tax and minorities, the retained loss for the year was Pounds 45.5m,
compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.02m in 1992/93. Losses per share, on a
net basis, were 8.46p, compared with earnings of 1.72p.
Babcock also yesterday issued a pro-forma balance sheet showing the effect
of the rights issue as if it had been received on March 31. This assumes
that Pounds 41.3m of the proceeds has been set off against borrowing and the
remaining Pounds 37.3m has been added to cash and bank balances.
Net assets on the pro-forma balance sheet are Pounds 126m, compared with a
reported Pounds 47.3m at March 31 and Pounds 92.9m in 1993.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sidlaw shares fall 11p as margins are
squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sidlaw fell 11p to 338p after the Scotland-based packaging, oil
services and textiles company said it was suffering margin pressure.
Turnover leapt from Pounds 71.5m to Pounds 150.4m in the six months to March
31, thanks mainly to a full contribution from the flexible packaging
business which it bought for Pounds 79m from Courtaulds last July.
Group pre-tax profits rose 49 per cent to Pounds 6.9m and operating profits
were 68 per cent higher at Pounds 8.8m.
Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said he was pleased with the progress made
by all three divisions. In particular, the recently acquired flexible
packaging business had met expectations so far and had been comfortably
integrated.
The packaging division's sales rose from Pounds 20m to Pounds 83m and
operating profits increased from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5.5m. Although sales
and orders held up well, the group said price pressure was relentless and
affected profits performance.
Oil services increased sales to Pounds 52m (Pounds 34m) and operating
profits by 2 per cent to Pounds 3m. The results included a loss of Pounds
274,000 in the Supplylink joint venture set up in 1992 to offer logistics
services internationally.
Mr Morrow said that he now expected Supplylink to break even next year - a
year later than expected. Without that loss, the division would have shown
profit growth of 7 per cent.
The textiles division increased operating profits by 9 per cent to Pounds
326,000.
Earnings per share rose to 9.1p (8.8p) and the interim dividend was 4.5p
(4.25p).

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: All change on the Weston front - Maggie
Urry looks at the reorganisation plans for AB Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complexity of the rearrangement of Associated British Foods' ownership
belies the simplicity behind the plan.
The need of the majority owners - the 40 or so members of the Weston family
 -is to make their tax planning easier, while the minority shareholders of
AB Foods, with 37.3 per cent of the company, need to be assured that they
are not being disadvantaged in any way.
The answer will be to transform George Weston Holdings, the current
immediate parent of AB Foods, into an exact replica of its subsidiary, get a
listing for its shares and change its name to Associated British Foods.
Minority shareholders will end up with exactly the same number of shares in
a company with exactly the same assets, and exactly the same board of
directors. One layer of the hierarchy of ownership will have been removed.
The deal requires approval from 75 per cent of those minority shareholders
who vote at a special meeting on June 20. For their trouble, shareholders
will receive a 10p a share special dividend, which compares with AB Foods
15p total payment last year. The entire cost of the exercise, which runs
into millions of pounds, will be borne by the family.
Lazard Brothers is advising the Weston family and Robert Fleming is advising
AB Foods and its minority shareholders. Fleming said yesterday it was sure
that these shareholders would be no worse off through the deal.
One difference that the rearrangement may make, though, is that trading in
the shares could become more liquid. Part of the Weston family's holding
will in future be a direct 11.8 per cent stake in the quoted company.
Another is that AB Foods will in future comply with the Cadbury code on
corporate governance. Two non-executive directors are to be appointed and
audit and remuneration committees set up. This suggests at least a formal
bow to institutions' desire to see a board shaped more in the 'normal'
public company mould.
However, Mr Garry Weston, chairman of AB Foods, appears to have a dim view
of the Cadbury guidelines. He says the two non-executives would 'do the job
the institutions want done. The KGB job'.
He says that AB Foods 'has been run for the benefit of shareholders because
the family are the shareholders. There are no Rolls Royces, no chauffeurs. I
don't think we need to be taught anything about corporate governance.'
And he insists the family intends to retain control of the quoted company.
He believes that family ownership has given AB Foods a long-term investment
timescale, and allowed it to grow organically from a market capitalisation
of Pounds 91m when he took the chair in 1967 to Pounds 2.7bn now. Over the
same period the family has increased rather than cut its stake, and no new
shares have been issued.
But the reorganisation could be a small step on the road to an eventual
reduction in the family stake below 50 per cent. If that happens, AB Foods
could lose the advantages Mr Weston sees in family control for the sake of a
becoming a company with which institutional investors feel happier.
The reorganisation will make the ownership structure slightly less complex
than the one set up by Mr Weston's father.
At present, GWH holds a 62.7 per cent stake in AB Foods, and holds other
assets worth about Pounds 300m. These comprise Pounds 230m of cash, mainly
dividends accumulated from AB Foods over the years, plus a controlling stake
in Fortnum and Mason, the Piccadilly department store, and some property
investments. This company has been regarded as the 'family money box' but
the family has been unable to get its hands on the cash.
The plan is for GWH to sell the non-AB Foods investments mainly to its
parent, Wittington Investments, and buy in 10 per cent of its share capital,
paying Pounds 100m in cash to family members in the process and increasing
the stake in GWH held by Wittington and by the Garfiel Weston Foundation, a
charity. GWH will also pay a dividend to its shareholders and sell its
non-AB Foods assets to Wittington.
That will leave GWH with its stake in AB Foods and about Pounds 60m in cash,
which will cover the Pounds 45m cost of a 10p special dividend to
shareholders, and the costs of the reorganisation, including stamp duty.
The share capital of GWH will then be reorganised to replicate that of AB
Foods, and GWH will make its 1-for-1 share offer to AB Foods shareholders.
AB Foods listing will terminate on Friday July 29 and the renamed GWH will
obtain a listing with the shares due to start trading the following Monday,
August 1. The special dividend will be paid on October 14.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BMA links up with Air Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Midland Airways yesterday announced a commercial link-up with Air
Canada, which will allow the airlines to offer seats on each others'
services.
The code-sharing arrangement, which will require government approval in
Canada and the UK, is due to start on June 1.
BMA's announcement follows the deal last month between Virgin Atlantic
Airways and Delta Air Lines, the third-largest US carrier, based on a
similar code-sharing agreement. However, Virgin and Delta also announced
their intention to take up block bookings of each others' seats, which BMA
and Air Canada will not be doing.
The link will allow Air Canada to connect with BMA from Heathrow to Glasgow,
Belfast, Edinburgh, Leeds, Bradford and Teesside. Passengers will be able to
collect their connecting flight board passes and select seats at the point
of departure.
BMA began similar code-sharing arrangements with United Airlines of the US
in April 1992, and with American Airlines in November 1993, and yesterday
said it would be pursuing further such deals.
Meanwhile, Mr John MacGregor,the transport secretary, yesterday confirmed to
the Commons that he had recently put new proposals to the US in an attempt
to break the deadlock in talks over the liberalisation of air services.

FT  10 MAY 94 / State-owned airline prepares to leave the nest: How the
reorganisation of Germany's Lufthansa is cutting costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is nothing Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman of Lufthansa, dislikes more than
hearing the German airline described as 'state-owned'. 'It suggests that we
are inflexible and bureaucratic,' he fumed as he explained his privatisation
plans in Frankfurt last week.
After a massive reorganisation over the past two years, with further
rationalisation to come, the airline no longer deserves the stigma of state
ownership, Mr Weber claimed.
Indeed, his dream of a private sector Lufthansa will shortly become a
reality as a result of a complex deal with the government over pension
arrangements for the airline's employees completed last week.
The mechanism for the move away from state control will be a rights issue in
which the government will not participate. By forgoing its rights to new
shares, the government's stake will fall from 51.42 per cent towards 40 per
cent. The rights issue is likely to take place soon after the airline's
annual meeting in early July. Later in the year, the government will start
to sell off its remaining stake, said Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister.
Mr Weber says that Lufthansa will undergo a metamorphosis as spectacular as
that of British Airways, the former UK state-carrier privatised in 1987
which is now one of the world's most successful airlines.
Mr Weber believes that by the end of the century, the world airline industry
will be dominated by a few internationally competitive airlines. A private
sector Lufthansa will be one of the survivors, he maintains.
The restructuring began in 1992 after the airline incurred a pre-tax loss of
DM300m (Pounds 121m) the year before. 'We were on the brink of running
aground,' Mr Weber said. 'It was essential to put the ship back on the right
course.' Mr Weber's three-pronged strategy for guaranteeing the airline's
survival is: Cost-cutting. Lufthansa reduced its costs by DM1bn in 1992 and
by a further DM500m last year, leading to a 15 per cent increase in
productivity.
The airline trimmed its workforce from 48,000 at the beginning of 1992 to
below 40,000 now. The aim is to cut costs by another DM500m a year by 1997.
The airline introduced new measures to boost revenue, ranging from
encouraging higher standards of customer service to introducing products
such as the frequent flier programme. These measures helped raise the number
of passengers carried last year by 3.8 per cent and the volume of freight by
5.4 per cent. This offset falling prices, and turnover for the parent
company was flat at DM15bn. A new approach to partnership arrangements with
other airlines. The most tangible example of the new strategy was the
link-up with United Airlines giving Lufthansa a long sought-after
transatlantic partnership.
The full impact of these measures on the airline's financial position will
become more clear next week when Lufthansa releases its 1993 group-wide
figures.
A hint of what is in store came in March when Lufthansa announced that the
parent company cut its losses last year from DM296.9m in 1992 to DM50m last
year while net losses dropped from DM372.8m to DM110m.
Mr Weber said last week that the airline enjoyed better than expected
results in the early part of 1994 and was on course to break even at an
operating level for the full year.
'With the government as majority shareholder, the airline is still operating
with one hand tied behind its back,' said Ms Nuala Corry and Mr Graham
Moynes at NatWest Markets in London. 'One gets the feeling that they are
itching to do a lot more to reduce costs.'
Mr Andrew Barker at SG Warburg in London says further cuts are necessary as
costs are still high by international standards - at Dollars 54,440, labour
costs per employee are 15 per cent higher than BA and 19 per cent higher
than at KLM.
Aware of the political sensitivities of cutting jobs, Mr Weber says that the
main impact of privatisation will be 'the psychological effect on employees
and customers', not the opportunity to cut costs. But he is acutely aware of
the harsh competitive environment in which airlines operate and a
private-sector Lufthansa is likely to make further swingeing job cuts.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher chairman given 52% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, executive chairman of retail group Kingfisher, enjoyed
a 52 per cent increase in total remuneration to Pounds 1.31m last year to
make him one of the UK's highest-paid directors.
The company's annual report revealed yesterday that three other executive
directors - Mr Alan Smith, chief executive, recruited from Marks and Spencer
last April, Mr James Kerr-Muir, finance director, and Mr Nigel Whittaker,
corporate affairs director - earned between Pounds 410,000 and Pounds
640,000, excluding pension contributions.
Mr Whittaker and Mr Kerr-Muir earned between Pounds 285,000 and Pounds
375,000 the previous year.
Sir Geoffrey has gained a reputation as one of the UK's most astute
retailers through his stewardship of Kingfisher group - which includes
Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworths and Superdrug - and his view that retailing must
become more volume-driven rather than margin-driven.
But Kingfisher's shares have fallen this year amid fears that the lacklustre
performance of some of its UK chains reflected the failure of Sir Geoffrey's
'everyday low pricing' strategy.
His total remuneration included an increased pension contribution from
Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 264,000 after an actuarial valuation revealed a
funding deficit. After that, Sir Geoffrey's pay rose from Pounds 773,000 to
Pounds 1.05m, or 36 per cent.
His basic salary rose 2.6 per cent, from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 622,000,
but his bonus almost doubled from Pounds 167,000 to Pounds 323,000.
Kingfisher said the bonus reflected the 51 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits - from Pounds 205m to Pounds 309m - and 28 per cent increase in
earnings per share in the year to January 29. Moreover, an 'important
strategic objective' had been achieved through the takeover of Darty,
France's largest electrical retailer.
Sir Geoffrey also received a long-term incentive payment of Pounds 105,000.
'Geoff is recognised as one of the leading business figures in the country,'
Kingfisher said. 'We have to encourage the retention of key people.
Headhunters do tend to swarm around Kingfisher.'
The company would not disclose exact figures for Mr Kerr-Muir and Mr
Whittaker's pay, but said their basic salaries rose 5 per cent on average.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Daimler plans Dollars 250m Singapore placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, is planning to place
Dollars 250m-Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) worth of new shares in Singapore
when it holds its long-awaited rights issue later this year, the group's
finance director said yesterday.
Speaking before Daimler-Benz was today due to become the first German
company to acquire a listing on the Singapore stock exchange, Mr Gerhard
Liener said the planned share placement would be part of the car to aircraft
group's strategy of internationalising its shareholder base.
Last year Daimler overcame German industry's traditional objections to
US-style accounting disclosure and became the first German company to obtain
a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest capital
market. The group plans further listings in Madrid, Milan and Shanghai, Mr
Liener said in Singapore yesterday. 'With Singapore we have decided to
introduce our stock on the most dynamic capital market in this region of the
world.'
Mr Liener explained that Daimler-Benz hoped to raise up to Dollars 2bn from
the issue of new shares, of which at least 10 per cent would be placed in
Singapore. The cash is required to finance the group's growth and the issue
would take place later this year, Daimler disclosed recently.
While 30 to 35 per cent of Daimler's shares are owned outside Germany, the
group is pursuing further internationalisation partly to support
geographical expansion of its car business. Mr Liener hoped the listing
would support its rapidly growing sales in south-east Asia - revenues in the
region rose 36 per cent to DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) last year.
As part of its expansion, Daimler is planning to open a Regional Parts
Centre in Singapore. This would provide support for the group's commercial
vehicle activities in the region.
Mr Liener said the group expected to double its sales of commercial vehicles
in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines this
year. The group has also received official permission to start assembling
buses and commercial vehicles in Vietnam, Mr Liener said.
German private and public sector institutions are making increasing use of
foreign investors as a source of finance. The most recent example is
Dresdner Bank's international placing of new shares to raise DM1.14bn,
concluded last Friday.

FT  10 MAY 94 / AB Foods plans big share reorganisation: Minorities to get
stock plus 10p dividend as Weston family seeks better financial planning

Minority shareholders of Asso- ciated British Foods are to be offered
equivalent shares in a newly quoted company and a 10p a share special
dividend as part of the reorganisation of the group's ownership. The
milling, baking, sugar and other food products group is controlled by a
hierarchy of private companies and trusts and a charitable foundation.
The reorganisation is part of the Weston family's desire for better
long-term financial planning. Much of the family's substantial wealth is
tied up in two unquoted companies, Wittington Investments and George Weston
Holdings, the latter having Pounds 230m in cash which cannot be passed to
family members in a tax-efficient manner.
The plan will release Pounds 130m to the family and give its members some
shares in the new quoted company which will replace AB Foods. They have
promised not to sell shares for two years, except in special circumstances.
The Garfield Weston Foundation, a charity which is the ultimate controller
of AB Foods, will increase its indirect stake in the company from 36 to 40
per cent.
AB Foods was founded after the First World War by Mr Garfield Weston, son of
Mr George Weston, a Canadian businessman. Mr Garfield Weston had nine
children, all of whom are still alive. The fourth of these is Mr Garry
Weston, chairman of AB Foods, and himself the father of six children, three
of whom work for AB Foods. About 40 family members are involved.
Mr Garry Weston has just turned 67. His younger brother, Mr Galen Weston,
53, heads George Weston Foods, a separate Canadian company. Apart from Mr
Garry Weston and his children, virtually all the family is resident in
Canada or the US. The increasing ages of the nine siblings have made the
need for financial planning more urgent.
Mr Garry Weston said yesterday the family intended always to retain control
of AB Foods.
Analysts expect him to remain chairman of the company for at least another
four years, by which time he will have served 50 years with the company and
31 as chairman. They believe he will be succeeded by Mr Guy Weston, his
eldest son and currently managing director of Ryvita, the job Mr Garry
Weston held when he was 23.
The plan did not meet a warm reception in the stock market and AB Foods
shares fell 15p to 584p. Some ascribed this to disappointment that AB Foods
was not announcing a large takeover deal to use its substantial cash
holdings.
Mr Garry Weston said the business had largely grown internally, rather than
by acquisition, and would not be forced into doing a deal. He admitted the
group was looking at an acquisition in the US, and 'other things in other
places'.
He said one of the advantages of being a family controlled company was that
'you can take decisions based on your timing not somebody else's'.
