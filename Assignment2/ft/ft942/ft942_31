FT  10 MAY 94 / AT&amp;T wins Dollars 4bn Saudi telecoms contract

AT&amp;T of the US has won one of the largest contracts in telecommunications
history with a deal worth more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) to modernise
Saudi Arabia's telecommunications.
The contract, announced last night, marks a significant advance in AT&amp;T's
drive to expand outside North America. The company said that the project was
'a big boost to our globalisation efforts'.
The order is also in part the fruit of intensive lobbying by the US
administration. President Bill Clinton wrote to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
urging that AT&amp;T be chosen ahead of international rivals, which included
Siemens of Germany and LM Ericsson Telephone of Sweden.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, welcomed the contract as an example
of the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's promotion of US
business.
'This intensely competitive process and the size of the contract has
commanded top priority from this department and this administration over the
last eight months,' Mr Brown said in Johannesburg, where he was attending
the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela.
Mr Brown has shuttled backwards and forwards to Saudi Arabia over the last
year as part of efforts to cajole the kingdom into picking US suppliers not
only for the telecommunications contract but also for Dollars 6bn of
aircraft orders secured by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
Mr Alawi Kayyal, Saudi minister of Post, Telegraph and Telephone, said:
'AT&amp;T was the best, both technically and in cost.'
The seven-year Saudi plan includes the installation of digital switching and
fibre-optic equipment for 1.5m new phone lines. The project includes a new
wireless network, aimed initially at providing cellular phone and wireless
data services to 200,000 subscribers.
When completed, the project will nearly double the country's fixed-wire
telecommunications capacity. The order builds on AT&amp;T's existing base in the
Middle East, which includes a contract to supply half a million phone lines
to Egypt and a new cellular mobile network to the United Arab Emirates.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Mandela ends journey from prison to power

<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela yesterday completed his journey from prison to the
presidency when South Africa's newly elected parliament chose him as the
country's first black head of state.
The characteristic sounds and symbols of Africa echoed through the
legislative chamber. Women ululated with joy from the African National
Congress benches and a traditional Thembu praise singer, clad in skins and
beads, chanted the new president's honour. Erstwhile rivals embraced and
apartheid's former defenders saluted their new chief. Men and women
convicted of treason swore an oath of loyalty to the new state.
Mr Mandela stood hand on heart as a military band played 'Die Stem' (The
Voice), anthem of apartheid South Africa. A white policeman saluted as the
same band played the liberation hymn, 'Nkosi sikele i'Afrika' (God bless
Africa). Both are now official anthems.
Mr Ronnie Kasrils, newly elected ANC member of parliament once known as the
scarlet pimpernel for his efforts to elude the law, spoke for many when he
said of the spectacle: 'I have to keep pinching myself.'
Shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange rose 2.5 per cent as political
euphoria dominated market sentiment.
For the day at least, old enmities were set aside. Mr Mandela appeared
delighted to spot Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi in the chamber,
and crossed the floor to embrace him. He also went out of his way to greet
General Constand Viljoen, leader of the rightwing Freedom Front, and Pan
Africanist Congress leader Mr Clarence Makwethu.
The government of national unity neared completion with the announcement of
six ministers from the outgoing National party government. Mr Pik Botha,
former foreign minister, becomes minister of mineral and energy affairs, Mr
Roelf Meyer, chief constitutional negotiator, was named minister of
provincial affairs and constitutional development, and Dawie de Villiers,
Cape NP leader, was appointed minister of environment.
Mr Mandela made his first public address as president from the spot where in
February 1990 he spoke after his release from 27 years in jail. He told
thousands outside Cape Town city hall: 'Today we are entering a new era.
Today we celebrate not the victory of a party but a victory for all the
people of South Africa.
'We place our vision of a new constitutional order on the table not as
conquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to
heal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order
based on justice for all."
Mr Mandela pledged a social order 'which respects completely the culture,
language and religious rights of all sections of our society and the
fundamental rights of the individual'.
They're all in this together, Page 17

FT  10 MAY 94 / Germany may ban British beef imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany will tomorrow consider a unilateral move to ban the import of
British beef because of public concern over 'mad cow disease', in defiance
of the European Commission and the rest of the European Union.
A draft regulation to control beef imports will be submitted to the German
cabinet by Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, on the grounds that a
form of the disease - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) - may possibly
be communicated to humans.
The German government is pressing ahead with the ban, in spite of warnings
from Brussels that it will face injunctions and legal action in the European
Court of Justice.
Its own experts have also expressed doubt that any unilateral ban can be
effectively enforced because of the open borders in the EU. But health
ministry officials insisted yesterday that the measure will be enacted and
can be put into effect.
In London, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the British agriculture minister, said a
unilateral ban on British beef by Germany would be unjustifiable and illegal
under the Treaty of Rome.
Britain would take court action if necessary against Germany for creating an
unfair trade barrier, but it looked to the European Commission to take
action in the first instance, she said.
Mr Dieter Vogel, for the German government, said yesterday: 'We have always
said we would prefer to find a common solution for this BSE problem.
'If that is not possible, then we have to find a unilateral solution. It may
be that the cabinet will decide on this on Wednesday.
'We are not in favour of unilateral solutions, but in the worst case we will
have to find one.'
EU agriculture ministers considered further measures to restrict the
circulation of British beef at their last meeting in Luxembourg, but EU
members other than Germany were satisfied with Britain's response.
The ban being proposed by Mr Seehofer would affect the import of all British
cows more than three years old, and any younger animals which come from
herds which have not been certified BSE-free for at least four years.

FT  10 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having failed to tighten monetary policy yesterday, the Federal Reserve has
little leeway before the end of the week. Barring a rate increase first
thing today, it could not act without disrupting the Treasury's Dollars 29bn
bond market refunding operation which takes place over the next two days.
Concern about the impact on the bond market of another rate increase may
have held up any move yesterday, but the Fed is between a rock and a hard
place. If the dollar falls because the authorities have done nothing to back
up last week's intervention, the bond market will probably weaken anyway.
Indeed, the nervousness of both currency and bond markets argues
increasingly for a substantial tightening when it finally happens. At
current yields, US bonds offer fundamental value, but overseas investors are
reluctant to jump in because of the Fed's gradualist approach. Only when the
tightening process is perceived to be complete are overseas buyers likely to
return in force. The resulting capital inflow might help the dollar too.

FT  10 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Kemper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kemper's decision to open its books to bidders looks wholly pragmatic.
Management must have reasoned that it would be better to bow out gracefully
than run the risk of being evicted by supporters of GE Capital's bid at the
shareholders meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow. Yet it is difficult
to see where a white knight will come from.
Mr Sanford Weill's Travelers would have been an obvious suitor. But its
recent acquisition in insurance and sagging share price must have dulled its
appetite for big deals. Kemper's business mix complicates matters. Any US
bank interested in mutual funds would have to divest the life insurance
operation for regulatory reasons. Neither is there a long list of potential
European bidders. Banco Santander, which already has a small stake in
Kemper, has its hands full with the rescue of Banesto. Most European
insurers with ambitions in US retail savings are either too small or have
other strategic priorities.
It is always possible that the investment bankers will find a way of
dismembering Kemper, especially if a buyer for the troubled property
portfolio can be found. But splitting the group is unlikely to release much
value for shareholders. The breadth of Kemper's product range may actually
be an asset, allowing it to sell both mutual funds and annuities depending
on market conditions. On that reasoning, the group is worth more to GE
Capital than the sum of its parts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it was because the market was expecting an appetising deal from
Associated British Foods - in the form, say, of the acquisition of
Allied-Lyons' food business - that its shares fell more than 2 per cent
yesterday. The restructuring of the Weston family holding has no bearing at
all on the company's operating performance. Outside shareholders are being
offered a 10p sweetener from the family's coffers to persuade them to read
and act on the thick documentation that accompanies the deal. Admittedly,
the ultimate effect on the share price may be marginally negative. After two
years, family members will be free to sell their shares and the overhang may
reduce their rarity value.
Yet all this is still a long way off. Similarly, the recognition that the
family ownership structure needs to be adjusted to meet the needs of a new
and younger generation also serves as a reminder that Mr Garry Weston will
not be at the helm for ever. But there is no question of the family
relinquishing control. The long term approach which has characterised
management decision-making in the past seems set to continue.
Mr Weston was keeping his own counsel yesterday on the subject of
acquisitions. ABF itself, though, will have just as much cash after the deal
as it did before: the cash which is flowing back to family members comes
from their GWH holding company rather than ABF.
Having already accumulated Pounds 500m, ABF cannot afford to keep on piling
up cash indefinitely. On the basis of April's purchase of Bibby's feed
mills, the US agribusiness looks more enticing than Allied's food business
which would make ABF more vulnerable to margin pressure from supermarkets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, has been true to her word. Not
only has she put an end to the government's dithering over publishing their
joint consultation document on how the domestic gas market should be opened
to competition. More important, the framework set out in the document
constitutes, as promised, a level playing field. British Gas's rivals will
not be able to 'cherry pick' the best customers. The company will, of
course, have to cut costs even faster if it is to earn reasonable profits
from this market once its monopoly is abolished. But rivals will not be
given the same regulatory assistance that they received when the contract
gas market was opened to competition.
At the heart of the document is a political fix: Gas's transportation arm
will levy on both Gas's supply arm and its rivals an annual standing charge
of Pounds 25 per customer. This level has been chosen so that, once the
supply arm's fixed costs are taken into account, it will not have to put up
its standing charge to customers of Pounds 37. So ministers do not need to
worry about granny facing a higher gas bill. But the fix also means that the
margin on supplying all classes of customer will be the same rather thin
one. If there is any cream to skim, rivals will have collect it with skill
rather than scooping it up in ladles.
All players will have to meet the same regulatory requirements as Gas on
matters such as security of supply and disconnection. That should keep the
quick buck cowboys out of the market. And though Gas's transportation arm
may retain back-up roles for safety and security of supply, it will be paid
a commercial rate for doing so. Gas's prospects still depend on a further
Ofgas document setting out the price formula for transportation. But the
bull case is unlikely to alter. Ms Spottiswoode has shown herself to be
rational and fair once. She can be expected to do so again.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Yeltsin upset by plans for Berlin farewell

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the west not to humiliate
Russia after a row blew up in Germany over plans to exclude Russian troops
from a farewell parade of Allied forces from Berlin.
American, British and French troops are due to mark the departure from
Berlin with celebrations organised by the city authorities on June 18,
nearly 50 years after Berlin surrendered to the Red Army.
But the Russians have been told they cannot take part. And Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has excluded them from the federal government's send-off due to be held
in Berlin on September 8.
The German government and western allies have agreed on separate ceremonies
on the grounds that the role of the Russian troops as an occupying force was
very different from that of the west.
The planned farewell celebrations will be discussed by Mr Kohl and Mr
Yeltsin, who arrives in Germany tomorrow for an official visit, and final
details are due to be settled this week.
Russia has been offered two civilian ceremonies in Berlin and in the
southern city of Weimar on August 31, which Mr Yeltsin will attend. Moscow
has made clear it sees plans for a separate send-off as shabby treatment.
President Yeltsin, reflecting hurt national pride, said yesterday during
Victory Day celebrations in Moscow: 'It is important to remember just one
thing.
'Russia must always be addressed in a tone of respect because our people
will never accept anything else from any country, such is the will and
testament of those who died defending the honour and independence of our
Motherland.'
It is clear from the differing reactions in east and west Germany that the
Russian role is seen differently in both halves of the country.
Divisions erupted yesterday within Germany's opposition Social Democratic
party, which split along east-west lines on how to say goodbye to the
remaining 46,000 Russian troops, who will officially leave on August 31.
East German leaders of the opposition Social Democratic party want the
Russians to be included in the ceremonies with the three western allies in
the name of peace and friendship. The cold war, they say, is over.
But the west German SPD leadership, including Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD
leader, says the Russians must march alone. Mr Scharping yesterday backed Mr
Kohl's government, arguing that a joint ceremony would confuse the role of
western troops with Moscow's virtual occupation of east Germany.

<TEXT>
Hungarian voters shrugged off attempts to revive bitter memories of the 1956
Budapest rising against Soviet-imposed socialism as they voted over the
weekend. In the first round of a complex two-part election they deserted the
conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum which steered the country through
the first four painful years of post-communist readjustment. Instead, like
their counterparts in Poland and Lithuania, they voted heavily for a
revamped socialist party led by men who received their political training
and wielded power in the former communist regime.
In three weeks the electorate will return to the polls for the final round
of voting which will determine the shape of the next government. This will
most probably be a coalition between the Socialists and the Free Democrats.
But three weeks is an awfully long time in politics. The Free Democrats, a
liberal grouping which emerged as the second party with just under 20 per
cent of the votes against the socialists' 32 per cent, have made clear that
they will use it to attract the votes of those who want to ensure that the
socialists will be constrained by a strong coalition partner.
Such a coalition, with a secure parliamentary majority and basic commitment
to continuing the market-based economic reforms which have attracted Dollars
7bn in foreign investment to date, would be well placed to benefit from a
rising tide of economic prosperity which is now in prospect after the
sacrifices demanded over the last four years.
The slow pace of recovery for an economy saddled with more than Dollars 20bn
of foreign debt inherited from the former communist regime was one of the
main factors leading to the loss of support for the ruling Forum. The party
served Hungary well. It provided political stability for the entire
four-year life of Hungary's first post-communist parliament.
But now that Moscow no longer projects its shadow over central Europe, a
substantial vote for a party that calls itself socialist and promises more
professional government and a slightly greater degree of income
redistribution raises no fears. The important thing is that voters have
chosen to keep to the centre ground, albeit shifting it slightly to the
left.
Participation in the vote was high, voting took place calmly, and above all
voters avoided alarming their neighbours in Slovakia and Romania by voting
for those who talked of regaining Hungary's former dominant position in the
Carpathian region.
By ignoring the siren songs of both the nationalist right of Istvan Csurka
and the hardline communists on the left, Hungarians have helped the cause of
stability in the region. They have thus improved their own chances of doing
what Hungary's rulers failed to do during the 50 years when socialism was
imposed from outside: narrowing the gap between their living standards and
those of their western neighbours.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Rules of the new gas game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Had it not been so long delayed, yesterday's consultation paper on the
future of the UK gas market would probably have earned only routine comment.
Most of it contains technical proposals for fleshing out last year's
decision to abolish British Gas' monopoly; it is about detail rather than
principle.
Instead, the Department of Trade and Industry spent much of the day fending
off accusations that its plans will trigger sharp increases in gas prices,
and result in the poor and elderly being cut off from supplies. It has only
itself to blame for this. But now that the consultation process is finally
under way, the pace must be maintained because there is not much time if
liberalisation is to be achieved by the 1998 deadline.
The test of the document is whether it points the way to a competitive
market without sacrificing safety or diluting the social obligations that go
with a domestic gas supply.
The basic organisational proposals look sound. There is to be a transitional
phase during which competition will only be introduced in small measure, and
some regulatory controls may continue beyond 1998 to prevent abrupt changes.
British Gas may end up playing a special part for some years yet because of
its market dominance and ownership of the transportation system. But it
would be compensated for this.
New suppliers would have to demonstrate financial strength and access to gas
supplies before they could be licensed. They would also have to take on
British Gas-style obligations to supply all-comers in their chosen franchise
regions. A new Network Code would ensure that the players in the new game
behaved. If one of them failed, the rest would pick up the pieces under a
proposed bonding or insurance scheme.
Where the document is less clear, and therefore less convincing, is over
pricing. It acknowledges that, as the cross-subsidies in British Gas's
present prices are squeezed out, there will be a process of 'rebalancing'.
Furthermore, consumers who live a long way from the gas terminals could end
up paying more because of the greater role that transportation costs will
play in the new regime.
The government's answer to these concerns is its faith in the market's
ability to drive prices down. That faith will be strongly challenged in the
confrontational climate which has greeted the document, and the government
appears to have anticipated this by hinting that published tariffs may be
required and that price controls could be extended.
It is reasonable for the government to be concerned about preventing the
entry of unreliable operators into the supply of a basic fuel, but the tone
of the document betrays a worrying nervousness about price liberalisation.
Independent gas suppliers were less than enthralled by what they saw
yesterday. As it firms up the rules, the government will need to ensure that
they are sufficiently attractive to draw in the new competitors without whom
deregulation will fail.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Leading Article: School testing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's proposals for streamlining the national curriculum in
English schools, published yesterday, have been welcomed by teachers and
educationalists. Mr John Patten, education secretary, has broadly accepted
the reforms recommended by Sir Ron Dearing, his astute curriculum adviser.
It remains to be seen, however, whether he can deliver the other half of the
package: comprehensive and objective testing to ensure that all children
achieve higher educational standards.
In line with Sir Ron's recommendations, the new national curriculum aims to
fill no more than 80 per cent of school time for most children. It is
closely focused on basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. The
controversial technology curriculum has also been revised to emphasise the
importance of work skills and specify a coherent body of knowledge.
There remain, however, disquieting signs of Mr Patten's recurrent desire to
harness schools to populist causes. The streamlined curriculum gives greater
weight to team games and competitive sports, even for older children who
might prefer fitness activities or individual pursuits. And Mr Patten's
repeated interference in sex education has irritated health professionals
who say that his guidelines will do nothing to curb the growth in teenage
pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.
This penchant for publicity-grabbing initiatives alienates teachers and
alarms parents. And it unnecessarily draws education into short-term
political controversy. That makes it harder to win acceptance for the
curriculum proposals which are essential to raising the quality of
education. Successive reports have indicated the failure of English schools
to equip a large minority of school-leavers with even basic skills.
Inspectors' reports too often find that pupils are not sufficiently
challenged by the teaching they receive, particularly in inner-city schools.
Getting the curriculum right is only one step in addressing these
shortcomings, however. It is just as important to ensure that schools are
teaching the new curriculum properly. The new independent schools
inspectorate can contribute to that with its more frequent inspections and
well-publicised reports to parents. Equally important is the regular testing
of schoolchildren to see whether they are reaching satisfactory standards.
Yet testing remains disrupted by a boycott by the National Union of
Teachers, the largest teachers' union. The boycott is largely ideological in
motive - it is against the principle of objective, external testing. Unlike
last year, it is opposed by unions representing the majority of teachers.
Yet this year's tests appear to have been severely disrupted by the
minority's action. Mr Patten's priority now must be to restore momentum to
the testing programme so that parents and employers can have confidence that
the national curriculum is more than just good intention.

A tip for society hostesses preparing for the arrival in London of Admiral
William Crowe, the new ambassador to the Court of St James. President Bill
Clinton's recent problems mean that Arkansas jokes are in poor taste, but
jokes from the neighbouring state of Oklahoma are perfectly acceptable -
provided they are told by the admiral, a native of that state.
Here's one of Crowe's favourites. A widow attending her husband's funeral is
taken aback by the enthusiastic eulogy the preacher is delivering.
She turns to her son and says: 'Just take a look in the casket and see if

The troubles of the UK Tory party may have helped paper over the cracks in
Britain's opposition parties.
But a brief skirmish at yesterday's annual meeting of MSF, Britain's fifth
biggest trade union, suggests that Labour party leader John Smith ought to
enjoy his honeymoon while it lasts.
The MSF rescued Smith last year, when he was in danger of losing his battle
over one-member, one-vote in selecting parliamentary candidates. Yesterday,
'Red' Ted Knight, once Labour leader of the rebel Lambeth council, along
with a comfortable majority of MSF members, passed a motion condemning the
MSF delegates who had helped bail out Smith at the last moment.
Standing up and being counted alongside Red Ted was Dave Nellist, the former
Coventry MP expelled from the Labour party, and Jim Mortimer, the Labour
party's former general secretary.

What's the connection between Pope John Paul II's broken hip and the

No joke this, but high-level diplomacy. It turns out Hawaii's governor was
due to attend a beatification ceremony in Rome on May 12 of the Belgian
priest, Damien de Veuster, who established Hawaii's leper colony on the
island of Molokai in 1873.
But now the pontiff has mobility problems he has cancelled the ceremony,
costing some London hacks a promising lunch at the Hawaii Visitors Bureau in
London. The governor had hoped to brief them on his domain, but decided to
abort his mission after the Pope cried off.

Britain's Foreign Office can perhaps be forgiven for drawing a blank in
trying to contact British nationals by telephone in Aden, southern Yemen,
where a confusing battle has been raging.
For the southern Yemenis, in a highly effective 'communications offensive'
against their northern enemies, have changed all telephone area codes to
their pre-unification digits. They have also declined to tell anyone what
the new/old codes are.
This cunning plot fell foul of a non-digitalised telephone exchange worker
in Aden. He informed a British Airways employee, who in turn contacted
London. There, the news spread swiftly to the small community of Indians
originally from Aden, one of whom informed the Foreign Office.
The moral? You never know when you might need your cleft stick.

So there is an after-life for spit-roasted chief executives. James Robinson,
former boss of American Express, has resurfaced - on the board of a
rotisserie chicken chain. From a renowned southern family himself, Robinson
should know all about finger-lickin' chicken. The job complements Robinson's
other directorship, at Coca-Cola.
In business for 2 1/2 years, Robinson's new interest - the Kenny Rogers
Roasters, named after the country music star - has 144 outlets. Its aim?
Why, to become the US's biggest rotisserie chain - in competition with
Boston Chicken, of course.
Robinson rubs shoulders with some alluring names on the Roasters' board: JP
Bolduc, chief executive of WR Grace; Drew Lewis, a former Reagan transport
secretary; and Darien Iacocca, wife of former Chrysler boss Lee.
He could also pick up a few tips from another board member, Harvey Mackay,
who lists among his book credits 'Swimming with sharks without being eaten
alive'.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Women in management' is also a
little-understood issue for men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SUSAN CLAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Is it not time to face the fact that 'women in management' is not just
a women's issue? The male-dominated working practices that Lady Howe refers
to ('Resources must not be wasted', May 6) are created by men, not out of
anti-feminism, rather out of a different way of relating to the world (Hedda
Bird's letter of May 6). 'Women in management' is as much a men's issue]
There is very little inquiry into understanding how men really view women
coming into management, or the issues this throws up for men. What efforts
are there to support and challenge men on the new position that they find
themselves in?
For example, can men admit to feeling threatened, do they understand the
skills that women bring into management, do they actually want to understand
these skills? Do men trust the intuitive skills that women can bring into
management? In getting to grips with strategy, do men appreciate the
strengths that women bring; their abilities to identify the values of the
organisation and its commercial environment?
When we begin to face up to the real problem, there are many unanswered
questions and many questions never asked.
One way of dealing with the problem is to encourage men and women to ask
questions and express their positions face to face; to dispel myths about
each other and gain a real appreciation of their different ways of
operating; to discover their complementary qualities as well as those that
conflict.
Only then will men and women executives engage with each other at a level
that can make a positive and permanent difference to men and women together
in management.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Courting the customer: Judy Dempsey says city centres in
east Germany are fighting back to attract western retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Germany's city councils have had enough. For three years, they have
watched large west German retailers invade the east, setting up furniture,
home improvement and liquor stores in out-of-town outlets which occupy vast
tracts of land, miles from the urban streets full of cranes used in building
refurbishment.
It was a golden opportunity to escape the rigid west German planning system.
Department stores and city retailers, supported by Germany's Association of
Retailers, as well as a battery of planning legislation and the city
councils, made it virtually impossible to build on 'greenfield' sites. These
are out-of-town developments on unused land which are often subject to
strict environmental controls.
'The entire retailing sector is under-developed in west Germany,' said Mr
Guy Barker from Knight Frank Immobilien Consulting in Dusseldorf.
East Germany offered scope for expansion. Before unification in 1990,
retailing in the east had been monopolised by the Konsumgenossenschaft
co-operatives, comprising supermarkets and small shops; and the
Handelsorganisation, the state-run department stores. Compared to west
Germany, which has maintained a level of 1-1.2 square metres of retail space
per person for several years, there were only 0.3 sq m per person in east
Germany before 1989.
Once the unification treaty was signed, west German retailers rushed in.
But, unlike in the west, they found city centre sites unsuitable for
development - many were too expensive, and many were subject to labyrinthine
property claims stretching back decades.
So they snapped up plentiful rural sites which had investment incentives in
the form of tax write-offs and state grants of up to 50 per cent. The
result? 'The expansion has been quite incredible,' said Mr Hubertus Tessar
from Germany's Association of Retailers, who reckons there are now 3 sq m of
retailing per person in east Germany.
The retailers had hungry customers. East Germans demonstrated an insatiable
demand for consumer goods, especially for home improvement items. Mr Tessar
said turnover in east German retailing last year totalled about DM120bn,
compared with about DM88bn in 1992. For instance, Hornbach, the
do-it-yourself west German chain store, this year expects its four outlets
in east Germany to account for a quarter of its total turnover, which last
year was DM750m.
However, Mr Tessar expects only 1 per cent retailing growth this year
largely because the attraction of greenfield sites may be diminishing. There
are three reasons. The city councils are beginning to adopt a strategy aimed
at correcting the imbalance between retailing outside city centres and in
cities. The current ratio is about 85:15, unlike in west Germany where it is
about 50:50.
Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg, for example, have already
adopted strict planning regulations for anybody wanting to develop retailing
outlets on greenfield sites. Leipzig, in the southern state of Saxony, has
followed suit and may try to block planning permission for Ikea, the Swedish
furniture store, to build a plant in the region.
City councils are not primarily interested in the consumer, however. Rather,
they want to recoup lost tax from the retailing sector.
Under current legislation, tax on a percentage of stores' turnover goes to
the local councils on whose land the shops are located. For example, the
small local council of Gunthersdorf, west of Leipzig, which has a population
of 650, can expect to flourish from the revenue derived from from the
100,000 sq m Saale Park shopping complex which is expected to achieve a
turnover of DM850m next year. Mr Ralph Kausch, a retailing expert at
Leipzig's Chamber of Commerce, reckons that the city of Leipzig is
substantially losing tax income from an estimated annual DM900m turnover by
retailers on greenfield sites.
'A struggle is taking place between the city government and local councils.
That struggle is about how to win back consumers to the inner cities,' he
said recently.
Pressure on out-of-town retailers is building from another quarter. As
property disputes are resolved in city centres, so more buildings will
become available. Mr Barker of Immobilien Consulting believes department
stores and small supermarkets geared towards convenience shopping, are
poised to take on the giant retailers.
Finally, the retailers in greenfield sites confront economic problems that
are a long-term result of unification. Although the east German economy is
expected to grow about 7 per cent this year - after a fall in gross domestic
product of about 30 per cent between 1991 and 1992 - consumer spending is
slowing down as more east Germans save to provide a cushion against
potential unemployment. Some retailing experts believe that as shops in city
centres improve, consumers will reduce their out-of-town expeditions.
The cities, however, have some way to go to make shopping in the centre
attractive. There is a dearth of parking facilities, and entering most city
centres is like negotiating the gateway to a fortress. Roads are blocked by
bulldozers being used to modernise the infrastructure.
More crucially, in their attempt to fight back, east German cities may be
starting to adopt the outmoded practices of west German retailers. For
example, instead of introducing more flexibility, restrictive shopping hours
are being introduced; and instead of a competitive pricing policy, many
stores are accepting the Rabattgetesz, a law dating back to 1933 which
prevents retailers lowering their prices by more than 3 per cent except at
designated sales times.
'Its all very well the cities trying to compete with the greenfield sites,
but perhaps they could start thinking about the consumer for a change,' said
Mr Barker.
Until they do, any resurgence in city centre shopping will get off to a slow
start. Consumers have acquired a taste for choice in products and a range of
services which cities are struggling to fulfil. Mr Cy Schluter, a
Frankfurt-based retailing expert, said: 'That was the great thing about the
initial expansion of the greenfield sites in eastern Germany. Retailers
tried to break the old-fashioned pattern of the west German planning system.
'Even if the cities in east Germany fight back, there's no doubt that the
giant retailing outlets are here to stay.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / The right question time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yes, there should be a referendum on Europe. It could be held in 1997, if in
the preceding year the European Union acquires central control over its
member states. Alternatively, it might come on a hypothetical date in the
wild blue yonder - say the day before a British government concludes that
sterling should be melted down into a single pan-European currency, if there
is one. There is no principled case for a poll now, and even less for a
ballot in which the question would be, as Mr William Cash puts it, 'Do you
want a federal Europe?' That would be as sensible a barometer of opinion as
'Should we eat the firstborn?'
A quickie summer referendum whose purpose was to save the Conservative party
would be pointless. No constitutional precept would justify it. Beyond
possibly buying a little time, it would not save the Tories. It is true that
the then Harold Wilson achieved a (temporary) ceasefire in the Labour party
by calling a plebiscite on Britain's membership of the 'common market' in
1975, but four years later a sorely divided Labour government was out of
office. It has not been back since.
Mr John Major may be tempted to try his luck, but he will be aware that any
give on a referendum today might legitimise the already open
faction-fighting in his cabinet. Supposedly disciplined ministers thump
their own tubs quite enough already. Heaven help the Tories if they are
freed to answer questions on the single currency. The riposte canvassers are
meeting on the doorsteps - 'which Conservative party are you from?' - would
become universal.
Yet there is a practical case for promising a plebiscite in certain
circumstances. Promising because nothing is about to happen this year or
next. Such a long-term undertaking would be of limited value, since no party
leader can bind his or her successor. Against that, statements by leaders
can act as markers.
The Conservatives should say, and mean it, that a commitment to hold a
referendum on strengthening the EU will be in the next general election
manifesto. They should do this on principle, not expediency. Such a strategy
would be forced on them anyhow, if substantive, centralising, constitutional
changes were agreed at the intergovernmental conference of 1996 - or, as Mr
Norman Lamont intimates, if Britain's monetary policy was about to be
controlled by a European central bank. An unconsulted public could not be
expected to support the government in either endeavour.
There is no getting away from this. Important constitutional proposals
should be submitted to the voters for a decision. The establishment of the
European Union on the basis of the Maastricht treaty was endorsed by the
general election of April 1992. That was then. Next time might be different.
Suppose that in 1996 the EU crosses the line laid down by its nation states,
and acquires self-sustaining sovereign powers. That would be a huge
alteration in the way in which people are governed. As presently set up,
even after Maastricht, the EU is a congeries of states, in constant debate
about an almost infinite series of treaties and sub-treaties, ever trying to
agree on pan-European rules for this and that. After the 1996 conference, it
could become an embryonic super-state, the stuff of English nightmares and
continental fantasies.
As Mr Paddy Ashdown has said, that would be the time to consult the people.
In such a circumstance, as Mr Ashdown has not said, a general election would
be an insufficient method of gauging the popular verdict, since the
character of the EU would be permanently altered. There is no problem about
what question should be asked. The leader of the Liberal Democrats has this
one right. The entire package agreed by the member states should be put
before the public. 'Do you accept it?' they would be asked. 'Yes or no?'
When a change is significant enough to warrant mass consultation, the
question usually sets itself. Should Scotland have its own parliament?
Should the first-past-the-post system of voting be changed? If so, to what?
Should Maastricht II be enacted?
This last proposition is acknowledged by passionate British advocates of a
federal Europe, such as the European Movement. You will appreciate the
flavour of the EM if you reflect on the choice of Sir Edward Heath to
deliver the keynote address at its weekend 'rally for European democracy'.
The meeting was called to debate a text for British Europhiles, published
last week under the title 'Reform of the European Union'.
We may rest assured that Mr Major will not take up this package. He will be
aware that the EM's proposals could only be put forward by a Conservative
prime minister on his last day in office. There is no need to go into
detail. Just note that the movement would streng-then the European
Parliament and place the administration of justice, as well as foreign and
security policy, under the central control of an evolving quasi-state. Whoa
there. Justice and security are the separate 'pillars' for which Mr Major
fought so hard at Maastricht.
On one point, however, the EM might find all sides in agreement. It proposes
that the new constitution should not come into force until it has been
approved . . . 'in referenda to be held simultaneously throughout the
Union'. As it says, 'such a constitution requires a large consensus among
the citizens, as well as very thorough preparation by its drafters'. The EM
does not believe this will be achieved by 1996, so we can assume that its
proposed referenda might not take place much before the close of the
century.
This prolonged timetable has been used as camouflage by Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, as it has been by ministers who seek cover while the flak
flies all around them. Scarred, perhaps, by his experience of the Scottish
referendum of March 1979, Mr Smith has been consistently against a
Maastricht ballot. 'Normally decisions are taken by Parliament,' he said
yesterday. 'But this is a decision that is so far ahead that we can consider
all these matters carefully much nearer the time.' Translated, that means:
'I'm still keeping my mouth shut, and watching the Tories destroy
themselves.' Some Conservatives admire this Trappist strategy but the voters
may not reward him for it. Mr Smith has proffered a referendum on
proportional representation, to keep his party together. He should think
about promising one on a centralised Europe, or a single currency. Why?
Because it would be right.

Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R. IAN WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I think Lex (May 4) is somewhat premature in congratulating Lloyd's on
its proposals for a market in syndicate participations.
In order to have an efficient market, all the participants must have access
to the relevant information. If Names are denied information on their
trading, then we shall have a false market. At the moment, for instance,
only a limited number of syndicates issue interim reports, and some of them
only produce them after the year is over. To add insult to injury my agent
informs me - in the nicest possible way - that I have no right to see the
interim reports, such as they are, and that he only sends them to me (when
he can find the time) out of the goodness of his heart. From time to time -
and particularly about now - one hears or reads in the press that syndicates
have issued profit warnings.
The individual Name is not sent these warnings, but has to wait for his
agent to send the annual consolidated statement. It is all very reminiscent
of the situation of the small investor in the stock market 40 years ago. No,
Lloyds has got a long, long way to go yet]
Finally, it is intriguing, is it not, to see that (single) corporate
syndicates will be allowed one-year accounting. So it can be done after all?

FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Short-termism a political fault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP TURNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A future Labour government 'would seek to reform companies law to
counter the culture of City short-termism which the party believes is
harming industry', according to David Owen's article, 'Labour vows to combat
City 'short-termism'' (May 3).
The Conservatives, too, it seems, have identified 'short-termism' in the
City as a weakness.
Is this not a case of the pot calling the kettle black? All too often,
politicians' horizons seem to be limited to the next election. Expenditure
commitments made to court short-term popularity lead to an excessive tax
burden in the future. Cheese paring today to keep the expenditure numbers
down only results in higher spending later.
What is seen as short-termism by company managements is often a response to
their owners' wishes. Is this such a bad thing? It is certainly better than
allowing managements to become unaccountable, as the record of the public
sector shows. If investors seem to place too much emphasis on the short
term, this is in part unavoidable: after all, the near future is more
foreseeable than the distant future. Managements can help the many investors
who do try to take a longer view by taking care to keep them properly
informed of future plans.
For both managements and investors, long-term planning is more difficult
than it should be because of constant changes in government policy: the
stop-go economy and the ever-shifting taxation rules. Major, Smith and Co
should deal with their own short-termism before they blame the City.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Decisions are for others to make
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN PIERCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his excellent article 'On the road to procrastination' (May 4),
Adrian Furnham details the six most favoured methods of avoiding decisions,
all of which are important techniques for the up and coming manager.
However, there are three others well worth a try:
The 'Haven't got time/tear jerker' method. Here, the decision-maker will
state plainly that he/she hasn't got time to consider the problem, but
cleverly manages to come up with a reason which makes the requester feel a
schmuck. For example: 'The CEO has just asked for a report. I'm probably
going to have to work the whole weekend as it is.' Absence or resignation of
a key member of staff also works.
Failing any internal excuse to latch on to, a close relation just admitted
to intensive care is usually a winner.
The 'Pass the buck' method. For example: 'Do ask John, he has the latest
figures' or 'that will have to go before the board. Pity you've just missed
the last meeting, next one is in a couple of months.'
The 'I'm glad you called' method, followed by a swift change of subject and
ending with the requester being given something to investigate. The
decision-maker should speak quickly and, where fitted, should turn down
his/her hearing aid. It works best on the telephone so that persistent
requesters can be cut off with, 'I must go, John's just arrived for a
meeting,' or as a last resort, a phone malfunction.
It would be interesting to hear other experiences from your readers.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Three-point solution to Turkey's ills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor S THEOFANIDES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a pragmatic solution to Turkey's economic problems ('No
delight at Turkish central bank plan', April 28):
1. Reduction of the unproductive military expenditure to 1 per cent of gross
national product - the level of nearly all countries. This will be the best
therapy for budget deficits and chronic inflation. The reallocation of
resources for productive uses will speed up growth - another important
national goal.
2. Withdrawal of Turkish military forces from Cyprus following the United
Nations plan. This will give Greece the green light for freeing EU funds to
Turkey which are needed for the external economic stability of the country.
3. Offer complete autonomy to the Kurds in the framework of a federal
organisation following the Treaty of Sevres (1920). This will promote
domestic and international stability - a necessary condition for progress.
Athenian Lysistrata could teach Mrs Tansu Ciller, Turkey's prime minister,
it is better to make love and not war.

<TEXT>
Attitudes among the chattering classes towards Islamic fundamentalism
suggest that a liberal is someone who is incapable of taking his own side in
an argument. The appalling nature of these fanatics is as clear from the
newsreels showing children being taught to hit their own heads until they
bleed as it is from the fatwa against Salman Rushdie. Yet it is rare in this
country to hear Hizbollah condemned as mad, bad and deeply uncivilised. It
will be interesting to see what image emerges from Assignment's report on
'Allah's Army' (7.45 BBC2).
Last week's opening episode of Once Upon A Time In The North received some
remarkably good reviews. To me it looked like just another desperately
contrived sitcom, with the usual sit (widely diverse family group, Mum a a
heroine with common sense, Dad a hypocritical, ineffectual prat) and far too
little com (8.30 BBC1).
Whatever you may think of what is said on Without Walls you cannot deny that
they keep on coming up with interesting topics. Today Blake Morrison
considers attitudes towards childhood (9.00 C4).

FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Business abounds in 'The Rivals' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chichester has launched its season with a robust, energetic, and
strongly-cast production of Sheridan's 1775 classic, The Rivals. It has been
too long since England had a major account of this play - few of us have
seen it since Peter Wood's illustrious 1983 National Theatre staging (with
Geraldine McEwan, Michael Hordern, Fiona Shaw, Edward Petherbridge, Tim
Curry) - and everything about it delights the Chichester audience. So much
so that I hardly like to add that this production is over-busy and, in
several respects, vulgar.
Mrs Malaprop, the play's most celebrated character, is affected, so Patricia
Routledge plays her as an 18th-century version of her own famous TV role,
Hyacinth Bucket. But the main joke about Mrs Malaprop is that she is
intellectually affected. Yes, she muddles her words, but both the words she
means and those she says reveal that she is trying to be clever.
Routledge, though she brings the role an appealing energy, plays it as a
silly old harridan. An undisciplined performance, marked by exaggerated
facial reactions and an excessive range of vocal effects. And disappointing:
Routledge has often been a most stylish comedienne.
What a relief to turn from her to Timothy West, who plays the explosive Sir
Anthony Absolute with perfect economy. Self-contradiction is the keynote of
The Rivals's main characters; and it is West who catches this best,
furiously attacking his calm son for displaying fury, stonily nosing out his
son Jack's tricks and stratagems. When Jack's efforts to woo Lydia Languish
as two different suitors are being uncovered, it is West's way of barking
out (stock still) 'Who the devil are you?' to his son that provides the
evening's great comic pay-off.
Abigail Cruttenden brings to the pettish proto-romantic Lydia Languish just
the right hothouse over-cultivation. She has porcelain prettiness, an absurd
(school of Sara Crowe) laugh, and all the necessary spoilt charm, so that
you laugh at her without taking against her. Emily Raymond, however, as her
cousin Julia, the play's most rational and touching role, is a lovely bore
who loses one's attention during her every extended speech. Adam Goldley is
a lightweight, puppyish Faulkland; the role's ludicrous romantic agony has
little force. As Jack, James Simmons has mischief and virility nicely
compounded.
The director is Richard Cottrell, who paces everything with a welcome
briskness. But he has allowed, or encouraged, several actors to overdo
things. Characters keep pacing four yards away from each other amid intimate
conversations for no good psychological reason. Lucy (Caroline Holdaway)
nods her head rapidly whenever she is listening. The music, by Mark Warman,
is not only cheaply scored, but is introduced, distractingly, to underline
certain big speeches, as if in a movie. Business, in the most literal sense,
abounds.
In repertory at the Chichester Festival Theatre, until June 23

FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Russian weight and brilliance - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stormwinds of Soviet change blew the Russian National Orchestra into
being in 1990 - the first orchestra to be wholly separate from the state in
Russia since 1917 - and already it sounds as seasoned in style, as
effortlessly well-balanced and accurate of ensemble as one of the great
orchestras of the world. That is not so surprising since the players count
among the country's best, many of them soloists in their own right, all
ready to muster at the founder-conductor Mikhail Pletnev's call, even if
this meant abandoning prestigious positions.
Pletnev wanted to create an orchestra with the highest ideals and free from
bureaucratic imposition; one, you might say, that would restore Russian
musicians to their purest native musicality, untainted by ideology. Once
Gorbachev gained power, the dream became a possibility; and the combination
of Tat'yana Sukhacheva's business skill and Pletnev's immense musical
authority - he won the Gold Medal of the Moscow International Piano
Competition when only 22 (in 1978) - proved galvanising. Soon the new
orchestra was travelling the world. Three years after playing Tchaikovsky's
Manfred Symphony in Moscow at its first concert, the RNO was recording it
for Deutsche Grammophon.
For its Festival Hall concert on Sunday night, the orchestra offered
Tchaikovsky and Weber and secured a large audience. Romeo and Juliet
overture was a fine advertisement for their sound, which, like that of the
best Russian orchestras, is a compound of weight and brilliance. The stormy
passages for rushing string octaves and crashing chords had all the decisive
Russian despatch you would expect, and the lyrical music was mellowly,
thoughtfully executed; but the true delight of the performance was perhaps
the exact weighting of inner parts such as the roving thirds of the slow
introduction or the throbbing woodwind triplets - just sufficiently audible
in their own right - at the glowingly expansive reprise of the lyrical tune.
For all its quintessential Russian virtuosity, the orchestra refrains from
exaggeration, and such sensible musicality is made visible in Pletnev's
unshowy, hugely effectual platform manner. Wonderful pianist though he may
be, he seems a natural as a conductor. In a brilliant and discreetly
tongue-in-cheek performance of Weber's vapid Konzertstuck in F minor he came
before us in both roles. In Tchaikovsky's fourth symphony he conclusively
demonstrated that colour and architecture are one. The recurrent fateful
brass fanfare can rarely have sounded so blindingly brilliant, and thus as
structurally effective, as this. And what cello resonance (near the close of
the Andantino)] what flute agility (for the descants in the finale)] what
violas] In the encore of a Dvorak Slavonic Dance, the latter sounded every
bit as sharply characterful, as reedy, as the oboes they were playing with.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Arts: Committed to reality rather than concepts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five Protagonists is a somewhat portentous title for what is, in the event,
a long-overdue and salutary exercise in critical rehabilitation. Indeed,
modest in scale though not in scope, it offers a gentle and timely rebuke to
our curatorial masters for their enduring neglect of so many of our most
distinguished artists, for no greater a crime than their failure to toe the
official avant-garde line.
Here is a show by its very nature more appropriate to a public institution
than a private commercial gallery: and here are painters at least as serious
in their address and rewarding in their accomplishment as any post-modern,
neo-dada, carcass-celebrating conceptualist, still wet behind the ears. And
would Euan Uglow ever be offered the British Pavilion at a Venice Biennale
ahead of, shall we say, an Antony Gormley, or Patrick George be given a
first retrospective at the Tate in place of Richard Hamilton's third, or
Myles Murphy be asked to choose a show at the Serpentine instead of Damien
Hirst? No comment.
But Protagonist? Here perhaps lies the problem. The Shorter Oxford
Dictionary gives protagonist first as 'the chief personage in a drama; the
principal character . . . etc': its second, and more indefinite, meaning as
'a leading personage in any contest; a champion of any cause.' And here we
have these five painters, all of whom were taught one way or another by
William Coldstream - Patrick George and Anthony Eyton at Camberwell just
after the war; Euan Uglow, Myles Murphy and Craigie Aitchison at the Slade
in the early 1950s. All were friends, united by shared houses and common
interests. Above all they maintained then, and retain now, their commitment,
drawn from Coldstream, to the direct response to the visible world.
Since then they have gone their several ways; Aitchison withdrawing into a
private and idiosyncratic symbolism; Eyton moving towards a more directly
gestural and expressive response; George developing a delicately measured
impressionism; Murphy reconciling the monumental and descriptive to the
painted flatness of the canvas; and Uglow ever measuring and looking, and
measuring, looking again with preternatural precision. It is one of the
delights of the show that we may follow such individual development by the
examples shown, early, middle and late.
But where is the drama of which even one of them should be chief personage,
where the contest, where the common cause to champion? The short answer is
that there never was one, and each artist was only ever the chief actor in
his own play. Would their story have been different had they made common
cause, issued manifestos, proselytised and campaigned - in short persuaded
the powers that be they were a force to reckon with and take seriously? The
Young post-art-school Turks of today hardly need the telling. The
unconscious irony of Five Protagonists is that it is precisely because its
heroes were never protagonists at all that they suffer their present
comparative neglect. Successful they may be in the private and local market,
but on the scale of international critical values they scarcely register at
all. Better after all to have been hung together than to hang alone.
And yet an artist such as Euan Uglow remains what he has manifestly been
these 20 years, and always was in prospect, one of the best and most
interesting artists of his time. His paintings take on the ambition not of
current notoriety or fad, but rather of the great humanist tradition in
western art of which he and his kind represent the enduring vigour. His work
is important and, forgive the jargon, relevant to us now, not because it
proposes some trivial conceit or intellectual by-play, not because it is
about fashionable ideas of process or identity, not because it is about
anything, but only because it is what it is, as it is achieved on the
canvas. Here is the human figure, scrutinised long and hard in its physical
reality, for us to contemplate in our turn, in the light of our own
experience of the world.
What may be said of Uglow may said as well for George, Murphy and the rest
of them - and they are not alone. In the generation at least of artists now
over 50, who had the luck to train before the study of the figure was
abandoned for the study of ideas and concepts, there are any number of truly
serious, figurative, modern painters, more and of a higher quality perhaps
than anywhere else in the world. The only scandal is that we do not
celebrate them as we should.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Technology: Tapping in to third world telecoms - The market
is waiting to be exploited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The developing world is becoming a holy grail for the global
telecommunications industry. The potential of untapped markets in the poor
but populous countries of the third world is enormous.
India alone has unsatisfied demand of at least 10m lines. Some countries
such as Nepal or Burkina Faso have bought state-of-the art fibre and digital
systems that rival those in the US and Europe.
Economic liberalisation is sweeping the developing world, tearing down the
regulations and trade barriers that once kept multinationals out. In many
countries the cost of inefficiency and corruption is becoming too heavy to
bear, and governments cannot afford to upgrade networks alone.
New lines installed by state companies in Africa, for example, cost Dollars
6,200 (Pounds 4,300) on average, according to the International
Telecommunications Union. In Latin America, the figure is Dollars 2,900,
although privatisation has lowered this figure in some countries. But a
multinational can install a new line for less than Dollars 1,000.
Ministers take liberalisation seriously because the link between
telecommunications and development has become incontrovertible: the better a
country's telecommunications network, the wealthier it is likely to be. This
single theme dominated a recent Buenos Aires conference organised by the ITU
and sponsored by the United Nations.
It was the ITU's first conference aimed at the needs of the developing
world. Seminars drove home the lesson to industry executives and ministry
officials that private-sector participation and liberalisation are the only
way poor countries can modernise and expand telecommunications.
This is easier said than done. Edward Salia, Ghana's transport and
communication minister, agrees the era of state-controlled
telecommunications is over, but says: 'Telecommunications are national
assets. Are we going to allow unrestricted entry?'
Previous warnings by the ITU that the developing world was being left behind
in the telecoms revolution had no effect. Between 1983 and 1992, telephone
lines per head in the industrialised world rose by 10 per cent. But the rise
in the rest of the world was only 1.4 per cent. The ITU says global
telecommunications service and equipment sales last year rose by 8 per cent
to Dollars 535bn, but three-quarters of this was spent in the developed
world.
While heavy investment in telecoms will not alone spur economic growth,
privatisation and liberalisation have had positive results. Latin America is
in the forefront of telecommunications privatisation. Argentina, Chile,
Mexico, Peru and Venezuela have all privatised their networks.
Only Brazil seems to have no time for liberalisation. Brigadier Adyr da
Silva, president of the Telebras state telecommunications company, says:
'Brazil, in terms of plant, investment and technology, is in the first
world. If (telecommunications) are such a good deal for us, why should we
give it to the Americans? There is an immense campaign going on. Everyone is
trying to force their way into (foreign) markets. Those who are in are
fighting to keep the others out.'
The introduction of technologies such as cellular telephony, digital systems
and data networks passed the poorest countries by in the 1980s. But the
future of some new technologies could depend on demand in third world
markets.
Inmarsat, the international communications satellite organisation, already
has briefcase telephone systems that can provide low-cost satellite phone
services for every village in a poor country. It says the future of mobile
satellite communications will depend to a large extent on take-up in poor
countries.
In March, it successfully tested a cellphone-sized handset that transmitted
a taped Wilbur Smith novel to one of its satellites.
However, it admits this system is at least four years from becoming
commercially operational and will require a new generation of satellites. US
companies such as Motorola, AT&amp;T and Microsoft plan to introduce similar
technologies.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Technology: Weightless, but gaining ground - Leyla Boulton
examines Russia's attempts to convert space anddefence projects into
civilian money-spinners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether it is to make mashed potato flakes at a top-secret weapons
installation or simulate zero-gravity for tourists, Russia is bursting with
plans for turning its cash-strapped space and defence industry into a source
of lucrative civilian projects.
Some are capital-intensive and have yet to attract investment, others are a
reality.
One is the bizarre experience of weightlessness training, originally
designed for astronauts and now made available to anyone who can pay.
'Military pilots - you must always remain in a state of combat-readiness,'
reads the faded billboard at an airfield outside Moscow as a busload of
Japanese travel agents and US journalists arrives for a gravity-suspending
flight.
'Welcome on board this Ilyushin-76,' says Victor Rein, chief of the Russian
Space Agency's micro-gravity unit, as his 15 foreign passengers clamber on
to a transport plane specially equipped for simulating weightlessness. They
are about to sample a 90-minute out-of-mind experience on offer to any
potential 'space-tourist' with Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 2,740) to burn.
With an individual trainer to instruct and watch over each 'tourist', the
seatless aircraft, complete with padding for a soft-landing after each burst
of zero-gravity, simulates weightlessness by performing undulating flight
manoeuvres in the shape of a parabola.
It is the movement of passengers relative to that of the aircraft at the
'apogee' of the parabola which creates the feeling of free floating. Some 14
parabolas are flown, generating as many weightlessness sessions, each
lasting 30 seconds, during which passengers can pretend to fly like
Superman, or simply hang to the handrails while the rest of their body goes
up in the air.
While Nasa and the European Space Agency have only one such aircraft each,
the Russians have three but a dwindling number of astronauts to train in
them. A cut in the once-lavish state subsidies means the agency is eager to
use the space programme's excess hardware to generate extra revenues as well
as advertise Russian technological prowess.
In an attempt to reach a wide audience, the agency is marketing the
weightlessness flights in the west through a Florida-based company called
MIGs Etc, which already has a track record offering tourists the chance to
fly over Moscow on MIG-29 fighter planes.
The same financial crunch has hit the Russian defence industry which for
decades produced masses of weaponry for the state without regard for its
cost.
But after more than five years of talking about the need to convert excess
defence capacity to civilian output, industry has experienced mixed
successes in its efforts to carry out so-called conversiya.
The main obstacles have been not so much the cost of such projects but
Russian authorities' inability to create a welcoming investment climate and
managers' dearth of marketing skills. Many managers have trouble both
selling existing output and putting together attractive investment
opportunities for would-be investors.
'Our people have golden hands,' an official from the defence-dominated Urals
industrial region told western bankers last month in what was meant to be a
serious pitch for western investment. 'They can make everything except
money.'
In a self-interested attempt to help, a group of Russian entrepreneurs and
bankers recently put together a consortium called the Russian Aerospace
Corporation. Konstantin Borovoi, one of the organisers, says the aim is to
match Russian investment resources with promising opportunities in the
defence and space industries.
In a renewed attempt to attract western capital to previously top-secret
reaches of Russian industry, Russia is presenting 14 investment projects at
the Central and East European Technology and Investment Exhibition at Earl's
Court in London this week.
Yuri Tichkov, the deputy atomic energy minister in charge of helping part of
the Russian nuclear weapons industry switch to peaceful purposes, will be
heading the delegation. 'We are trying openly to describe directions of
conversiya in this sensitive area,' he says.
He believes that the projects, five of which are based in 'closed cities'
where nuclear weapons are made, are attractive because of the high-quality
workforce and technology available at the plants in question.
The government is offering foreign investors a 50 per cent stake in joint
ventures which it sees as important for creating jobs and restructuring
industry to the needs of consumers. Using the big numbers of which Russian
officials and old-style factory managers are fond, he says one project
requires Dollars 100m to set up manufacturing facilities for fibre-optic
cable on equipment designed at the closed city of Chelyabinsk-70.
Other projects are aimed at producing special materials such as pure
aluminium, silicon and gallium arsenide for the electronics industry. At a
plant in Tomsk-7, a closed city which was the site of a small nuclear
accident last year, the aim is to make high-energy magnets instead of
weapons-grade plutonium.
Also on display in London is 'Project Potato' - a pilot project launched
with a US food processing company called Concord - to produce machinery to
save Russia's potato harvest from going to waste by converting surplus
potatoes into instant mashed-potato granules.
A first example of successful conversiya in a closed city is Krasnoyarsk-45,
which last year set up production facilities to make 30m video-cassettes and
25m audio-cassettes with some help from the Russian government and from
BASF, the big German chemical group.
But recognising that Russian officials and managers had so far done a poor
job in attracting investors - 'we are still lousy as market operators' -
Tichkov hopes that the Russian government will make the projects
irresistible by attaching special tax breaks to them in a few months' time.
Acknowledging that many western companies were not interested in projects in
which they could not have the controlling interest, he also said the
government would let foreigners have control if they offered 'really good
terms'.
He shied at the question of why Russian investors had not already flocked to
take advantage of the projects, saying their 'mentality was geared towards
short-term profits'.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Floating charge hits
rough sea - A look at plans which may improve the company rescue provisions
of Britain's insolvency laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PBR Solutions, a supplier of office electrical systems, went bust last year,
its bankers calling in receivers after 16 years of successful trading.
The story is a familiar one; with sales of Pounds 7m, PBR's bank had
confirmed an overdraft of Pounds 800,000 in late 1991 only to cut it six
months later. The owner-managers, Bill and Jane Pickering, refinanced the
company with funds they had tucked away for their retirement.
Six months later, one of PBRs' large contracts was cancelled, another
postponed and the directors foresaw a sharp fall in sales that would last
for two months. To avoid trading while insolvent, the Pickerings called the
bank and asked for receivers to be appointed.
Last October the Department of Trade and Industry decided this might not be
the best way to deal with companies in difficulty. Inviting suggestions on
changes to company voluntary arrangements and administration orders, the DTI
made a number of proposals that could improve the company rescue provisions
of the 1986 Insolvency Act.
For the Pickerings, any changes to insolvency law will come too late. But if
the changes are adopted, many other companies - and their unsecured
creditors - may stand a better chance of rescuing their assets if they get
into trouble.
One of the DTI's proposals relates to company voluntary arrangements between
companies and their creditors that have been used very little since they
were introduced in the 1986 Act. One obstacle has been the lack of a
moratorium on creditor's rights; the DTI suggests introducing a moratorium
of 28 days, extendable to three months, that would bind all creditors.
But the DTI's consultative document has raised the lid on a much bigger
hornet's nest by questioning whether the long-established rights of floating
chargeholders - normally banks - should be curtailed to give administration
orders more chance of success. The floating charge is the unusual mechanism
by which banks can take a charge over a company's changing assets, such as
its inventory. It is only used in the UK, Australia and Canada of the
industrialised countries.
The trouble with administration is that directors of companies which seek
its protection know their banks have the whip hand. As the law stands, a
floating chargeholder can veto an administration order and appoint an
administrative receiver.
Under present rules, an administrative receiver is not obliged to take into
account the interests of unsecured creditors or shareholders. The receivers
are often accused of being concerned with minimising losses for the banks
rather than looking at whether there is a viable future for the company.
Taking an altogether more radical approach, the Small Business Bureau has
called for the total abolition of the floating charge. In a reply to the
DTI's consultative document, Barry Baldwin, head of the policy unit at the
SBB, says abolition would change the emphasis of insolvency. 'The objective
of any insolvency process should be to make the company as valuable as
possible for the benefit of all creditors, secured or unsecured, and the
shareholders,' he says.
'The UK urgently needs to find some form of cultural structure which would
at least give financially distressed companies a fighting chance of
survival.
'Elimination of the floating charge may well lead to a re-assessment of
lending criteria, with less reliance on security, and increased emphasis on
the ability of companies to achieve the cashflows necessary to sustain the
costs of supporting debt.'
Not surprising, the banks have vigorously rejected the DTI suggestions that
floating chargeholders' rights might be diluted. If the value of bank
security, and in particular the floating charge, was undermined, it would
'lead to increased costs to cover the added risk, and it could also
discourage lending generally, especially to smaller businesses and for
company start-ups', the British Banking Association says in a submission to
the DTI.
'The proposals set out in the consultative document would change
fundamentally the current legal environment by shifting the balance of power
towards debtors (the borrower) at the expense of secured creditors,' the BBA
says.
The association says the DTI in any case is placing too much emphasis on
rescuing corporate entities rather than the underlying businesses. And it
says the biggest single contributory factor leading to insolvency is that
companies lose their markets.
Groups like the Association of British Chambers of Commerce are reluctant to
tinker with the floating charge if banks consequently become more reluctant
to lend.
But one of the underlying weaknesses of smaller corporate Britain is its
reliance on overdrafts. The floating charge may be partly to blame. By
mortgaging everything that moves, companies have avoided operating from an
adequate equity base and banks have frequently paid too little attention to
the underlying strength of their clients' businesses.
At least reducing the value of the floating charge might result in better
quality lending to sounder businesses.
The names of PBR Solutions and its directors have been changed as legal
proceedings continue between directors and the receivers.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Will the bait be tasty
enough? - Ewen Macpherson asks whether venture capital trusts, launched last
November, can encourage private investment in unlisted companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EWEN MACPHERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has high hopes for venture capital trusts. By creating
'conditions for new businesses to become established and for small
businesses to grow', VCTs are seen as a key to cutting unemployment.
The strategy - offering tax breaks to channel longer-term capital into
unquoted companies - makes sense. Everyone accepts now that unquoted
companies tend to create more jobs than quoted ones. But success depends on
answers to two questions.
Will the VCT rules attract investors to come up with the money? And will the
money find its way to dynamic businesses?
Of course, the viewpoints of investors and of managers of dynamic businesses
are not always identical. There is a lot of squaring of the circle to be
done before the VCT scheme, still at the discussion stage, takes final form.
A strength of the VCT scheme is to draw on the skills of those with
experience of investing longer-term capital in unlisted companies. First,
however, there is a basic question to be asked about the pattern of shortage
of longer-term capital.
Ask an entrepreneur looking for Pounds 250,000 to set up a high-tech
business, and he will tell you that capital is in very short supply. On the
other hand, go to the managers of a substantial subsidiary company where
there is going to be a management buy-out from a large industrial group and
they may tell you that several venture capital companies are vying for the
privilege of backing them.
There is no case for tax concessions to attract investment to
multi-million-pound buy-outs, which in the past decade have been a
profitable market for the venture capital industry. The Inland Revenue's
consultative document on VCTs addresses this point by suggesting a size
restriction. VCTs would be allowed to invest only in companies with gross
assets of less than, say, Pounds 10m. A Pounds 10m limit seems high if the
aim is to help new and smaller companies.
But one can see the government's reasoning. Allowing a trust to invest in
fairly large as well as small companies might achieve a portfolio mix more
attractive to investors. It can be argued that a better bait would be more
substantial initial tax advantages for investors, rather than encouraging
the trusts to move away from the core of the scheme - to provide funds for
entrepreneurial businesses.
A more appropriate limit on the size of eligible companies might be gross
assets of Pounds 2m. But size is not the only issue. If the VCT scheme is to
achieve its full potential for encouraging economic growth, those drafting
the rules should recognise that there are two quite distinct categories of
investment in the private equity market.
One category finances growth - directly. This includes the funding of
start-ups and provision of capital to fledgling businesses trying to get
established.
It also includes - though it is sometimes overlooked - the scope for
investing in companies already established. They need capital to enable them
to re-equip, enter new markets or expand in other ways, which often simply
cannot be financed by overdrafts. Such growth calls for risk capital - the
private company's equivalent of the quoted company's rights issue.
The second category consists of investment in changes of ownership. This
includes management buy-outs, management buy-ins and other restructuring
operations. Restructuring - a feature of the 'enterprise revolution' of the
1980s - can bring about a valuable shakeout in the economy, but there is a
significant difference between that and specific investment in immediate
growth plans.
Change of ownership represents a 'churning' of existing assets, and already
there is enough capital chasing these deals.
It could be stipulated as a condition of VCT status that the trust's
portfolio should contain a majority of the first type of investment. There
could be a minority of the second - 'churning' - type if the trust's
managers wanted a more balanced portfolio. MBOs are perceived to be less of
a risk, which is why they already attract so much investment.
Arguably, though, the problem is not so much overall lack of capital as lack
of demand. If small companies are held back for want of long-term capital,
the reason sometimes seems to be that they are unaware that such capital
exists - or that they are reluctant to use it. Directors of family
businesses, for instance, may refuse to dilute their equity.
If more of Britain's smaller companies strengthen their competitive edge by
strengthening their balance sheets with capital from the VCTs, it could
contribute significantly to job creation. But if VCT money goes largely to
management buy-outs and buy-ins, the government will not get what it is
hoping for.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Banking gloom for small
businesses - in a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's smallest businesses are unlikely to have an easier time dealing
with their banks in the coming years.
Their loan applications will be more carefully scrutinised; the interest
margins they pay may well rise; and they will increasingly pay a commercial
and visible level of fees for services like arranging loans.
Small businesses will remain a core market for most banks already focusing
on the sector but customers must expect to pay more realistic rates for the
service.
These predictions emerge from a report* into the banking industry's appetite
for servicing small businesses with sales of up to Pounds 1m, commissioned
by National Westminster Bank and compiled by Graham Bannock &amp; Partners, the
consultancy.
'The lending decision is going to have to involve a fuller exchange of
information between banker and customer,' says Terry Bryan, of NatWest's
small business service unit. 'We increasingly will want to lend against the
viability of the business plan. Progressively there is recognition that the
lending has been underpriced in this sector,' he says.
From a macro-economic point of view, the report recognises that banking has
become closely linked to the property cycle, with a high proportion of
lending to companies and individuals secured on property. 'This accentuates
the tendency of bank lending to fuel booms and deepen recessions,' the
report says.
The main challenge banks face is to reduce bad debts.

FT  10 MAY 94 / People: Prime movers give clout to Chinese exploration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Palliser, 72, a former head of the British diplomatic service,
has joined the board of the Exploration Company of Louisiana, a small
loss-making US oil company which has been raising money in the London
market.
Sir Michael, vice chairman of Samuel Montagu, is a former director of BAT
Industries, Bookers, Eagle Star, Shell and United Biscuits. Given his age,
there is some surprise that he is taking on additional directorships.
However, he is two years younger than Arthur Hummel, a former US ambassador
to China, who has also joined the board.
Henderson Crosthwaite, the UK brokers to the company, which has a
substantial UK investor following, played down the age of the new directors.
Exploration Company of Louisiana, which has until recently been exploring
for oil and gas in the US Gulf coast area, has started looking for oil in
China.
It raised Dollars 25m earlier this year to help finance the drilling of
three wells in the Zhao Dong block in China's Bohai Bay. The recruitment of
a couple of well-connected septuagenarians is designed to give the company
some boardroom clout in a part of the world where businessmen often do not
reach their prime until they pass their 70th birthday.
Sir Michael and Hummel join a board which already includes an ex-mayor of
Houston and a descendant of the New Orleans banking family which invented
Tabasco sauce.

FT  10 MAY 94 / People: New editor for Investors Chronicle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ceri Jones, 35, has taken over as editor of the Investors Chronicle, a
weekly magazine owned by the Financial Times. She replaces Gillian O'Connor,
one of the longest serving editors of the Investors Chronicle, who became
the FT's personal finance editor earlier this year.
Jones, who read English at Liverpool University, started her career as a
graduate trainee with Midland Bank but a year later switched to financial
journalism. After stints with Planned Savings and Pensions Management, she
has edited Financial Adviser, another FT weekly magazine, for 5 1/2 years.
The magazine, which has a free circulation of 44,000, claims that it is the
most widely read title among financial intermediaries, and Jones has been
given the task of substantially increasing the IC's circulation. Last year
it rose by 24 per cent to 56,000 and by more than doubling the promotional
spend, sales have increased to around 65,000 copies a week. Mark Van de
Weyer, publisher of Financial Times Magazines, says that with additional
investment an ultimate target of 100,000 copies per week 'should not be
regarded as over-ambitious'.

One of the side effects of the change of control of USBORNE, the grain
trading and pig production company whose chairman is Lord Cecil Parkinson,
is that chief executive David Frame has stepped aside rather earlier than
his planned retirement on reaching 60 in July this year.
Michael Adams, the director responsible for the group's grain trading
operations, has taken over as group managing director.
Frame, who last week sold a 36 per cent stake in the company to David
Thompson, a shareholder, is staying on as a director of the company until
July and thereafter will act as a trade adviser to Usborne Grain.
Financial problems hit the group early in April, forcing the suspension of
its shares. Thompson's company, Thompson Investments, now controls just over
50 per cent of Usborne's equity.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Supreme Court to review high punitive
awards - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court has accepted another products liability case for
review, giving it a further opportunity to set constitutional limits to
excessive punitive damages awards. US products liability lawyers were
disappointed last year when in the TXO case the justices upheld the
constitutional basis of a punitive damages award 526 times the amount of the
compensation awarded.
Since the TXO case, state courts have had to rely on other grounds for
curbing excessive punitive awards which, in most products liability and tort
cases, are still exceeding compensatory damages by multiples of 10 or more.
In March, however, the Supreme Court accepted for review the Oberg case from
the Oregon Supreme Court, concerning a products liability award against the
maker of an all-terrain vehicle. The jury awarded the plaintiff Dollars
900,000 in compensatory damages and Dollars 5m in punitive damages. The
Oregon constitution, in preserving the right to trial by jury, appears to
prevent any court from interfering with jury verdicts. The defendants, Honda
Motor Co, argue this, in effect, prevents any court from reviewing a jury
damages award and therefore violates federal due process. Lawyers hope the
Supreme Court will use the case to set out constitutional limits to punitive
damages awards.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Legality of an obligation to buy -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An exclusive purchasing obligation, forcing local electricity distributors
to purchase all their electricity from a regional company, could be lawful
provided such a restriction was necessary to allow the regional company to
fulfil its public service obligations, the European Court of Justice ruled
recently.
Local electricity distributors in the Netherlands brought a case against
their regional electricity company. Under Dutch law, electricity is
distributed by regional companies to local distributors, which in turn
ensure the supply of electricity to individual clients in their areas.
However, certain end-users, notably those in rural areas, are directly
supplied by the regional companies. Regional distributors have a
non-exclusive statutory right to distribute electricity in their region.
Between 1985 and 1988, the regional distributor concerned prohibited the
local distributors from purchasing electricity from any other source. There
was a corresponding obligation on the regional company to sell electricity
only to the local distributor companies. These companies, in turn, imposed
an obligation on the final consumer to purchase electricity only from them.
The regional companies also had to purchase their electricity from the
national generators.
From January 1 1985, the regional company imposed a surcharge on the local
companies in order to compensate for the difference between the higher cost
of distributing electricity direct to rural consumers and the lower costs of
distributing electricity to the local companies for use by urban consumers.
The local companies made a complaint to the European Commission. The
Commission ruled that the restriction imposed by the national generators on
the regional distributors was unlawful under the Rome treaty. It also held
that the restrictions on the end-users breached competition rules and could
not be justified under Rome treaty rules on public service undertakings. The
restrictions between the regional and local companies were not explicitly
dealt with by the Commission.
However, before complaining to the Commission, the local companies had
started arbitration proceedings to decide the legality of the surcharge
imposed by the regional companies. A tribunal found that the surcharge was
lawful. The local companies appealed to a national court which sought a
preliminary ruling from the ECJ on, among other things, whether a
prohibition on the importation of electricity such as existed in the present
case was contrary to Rome treaty rules covering state monopolies and
competition.
The ECJ first held that European state monopolies rules were not relevant to
the present case, as the regional distribution company did not have an
exclusive right to distribute electricity in the relevant territory.
The ECJ then found that the import prohibition restricted competition and
affected trade between member states, as it partitioned the Dutch market
from other European Union markets.
But the ECJ left it to the national court to determine whether a collective
dominant position actually existed between all the regional companies in the
Netherlands. The ECJ said if it did, the tying-in of electricity purchasers
in the way described would constitute an abuse of that dominant position.
The ECJ finally examined the Rome treaty provisions on public service
undertakings which provide that restrictions on competition imposed by such
companies are lawful to the extent which they are necessary for the
performance of the relevant services of general economic interest carried
out by those companies.
The ECJ said it was for the national court to determine whether the import
restriction was necessary for the regional company to distribute electricity
in its territory. It stated that, in determining this question, the national
court should take into account the costs borne by the company, in particular
regulatory costs relating to the envi-ronment.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Borderline cases - The pros and cons
of becoming a national law firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Norton Rose/M5 group of English law firms recently surprised the legal
services market by deciding not to merge its operations into a single
national partnership.
The trend in recent years has been to extol the merits of national law
firms, such as Eversheds and Leeds-based Dibb Lupton Broomhead, which say
their geographic spread and structure make them more flexible to client
demands. But a review carried out by the Norton Rose/M5 group revealed no
'business case' for merging its seven firms.
According to Mr Peter Smith, the group's chief executive, clients of the
individual firms could see no significant advantage in their lawyers
becoming a national partnership with offices in the main commercial centres
of England and Wales. What mattered to them was the continuation of the
relationship they had built up with a law firm or individuals within it.
The question is whether this finding was specific to the Norton Rose/M5
group, or whether it is the typical reaction of business clients.
Mr Barry O'Meara, deputy group solicitor for ICI, the UK chemicals group,
says that whether a firm has a national network of offices is not a factor
in choosing outside lawyers. Two years ago ICI 'outsourced', or contracted
out, its litigation and conveyancing work. For the litigation side, it
needed a firm well represented in the north of the country - which is ICI's
heartland - and in London, Mr O'Meara says. It chose Hammond Suddards of
Leeds.
For conveyancing, the company's view was that, while most of the work was in
the north, it could be done from anywhere. It chose City solicitor Field
Fisher Waterhouse.
The rest of the group's company and commercial work is handled by the
in-house team. Only for specific jobs, such as the Zeneca demerger, would it
instruct outside lawyers. In such cases, its policy is to instruct the best
firm for the job. For the demerger, ICI used Linklaters &amp; Paines.
Similarly, Ms Gillian Budd, group senior legal adviser at Cadbury Schweppes,
the food and drinks group, can see no significant advantage in a law firm
having a national network. Her company would not choose a law firm just
because it had one. The different divisions within Cadbury Schweppes tend to
use lawyers they know at a local level.
Mr John Elliott, a senior legal adviser at 3i, the UK's largest venture
capital company, says he believes some national law firms 'overestimate the
importance to clients of their networks'.
Nevertheless, it can be a factor when choosing a firm, says Mr Peter Bevan,
British Petroleum's group general counsel, but it is not usually decisive.
On rare occasions, BP has used a firm because of its spread of offices, but
in general the company's worldwide policy is to choose firms for specific
jobs.
According to Mr Julian Collins, solicitor to the British Coal Pension Funds
and chairman of the Law Society's commerce and industry group, there is no
significant demand from commerce and industry for the legal profession to
follow the accountancy model and set up national networks.
Such comments suggest the Norton Rose/M5 decision not to merge its firms was
a sound one. While its group relationship allows the individual firms to
co-operate in training recruitment, exchange of information and in marketing
at an international level, there seems to be no demand for a single
partnership.
However, there may be demand for firms that offer high-quality services on
both sides of the Scotland/England border. By failing to include Scotland in
their networks, the existing English national law firms may have missed a
trick.
Scotland is a distinct jurisdiction. Although most company and commercial
law is the same as in England, differences in litigation, property and
bankruptcy laws may have dissuaded a number of English firms from focusing
on the Scottish legal market.
Scottish firms have not been slow to recognise the potential demand for
services in both jurisdictions, but few are big enough to do so, or prepared
to risk losing referral work from English firms by competing south of the
border.
McGrigor Donald of Glasgow may be the exception. A number of Scotland's
leading commercial firms do have offices in London, but in the last five
years McGrigors has built its City office into a full-service operation.
This arguably makes it the only true full-service national law firm in the
UK.
According to Mr Robert Glennie, the partner in charge of the London office,
its strategy of building a full-service operation in London is beginning to
pay dividends. He cites the firm's role in helping to turn round Scottish
Metropolitan Property, Scotland's biggest property investment company, as an
example of work which could not have been done by any other law firm in the
UK acting on its own.
Two and a half years ago, ScotMet was on the brink of collapse, having
reported an unexpected pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.37m, including a write-down
of Pounds 9.4m on a site in Bournemouth, Dorset, and incurred a Pounds 2.2m
cost on renegotiating banking covenants.
The loss followed a badly timed increase in the company's property
development activity, particularly in the south of England. At the beginning
of 1992, Mr Gordon Milne, the company's long-serving managing director,
stepped down and was replaced by Mr Scott Cairns.
Mr Cairns announced a strategy of returning the company to its core activity
of property investment, and set about reducing ScotMet's borrowings, which
stood at Pounds 201m in September 1991 - a gearing ratio of 140 per cent.
After renegotiating the company's banking facilities and executing a
controlled programme of property disposals, ScotMet has achieved pre-tax
profits of Pounds 7.1m in the six months to February.
Company borrowings, which had already been reduced to Pounds 144.9m by
August last year, had fallen to Pounds 67.9m. This was thanks largely to the
sale last October of Saltire Court, a prestige office development in the
centre of Edinburgh, for Pounds 53.1m - a Pounds 6.5m surplus on book value.
In November, the company entered into what Mr Cairns called a 'voluntary
refinancing' with a one-for-three rights issue to raise approximately Pounds
26.8m. It is now back on the acquisitions trail. In March, it announced the
purchase of McNeils, a private company with a portfolio of retail investment
properties in Berwick-upon-Tweed, for about Pounds 4.5m.
Thanks to its London office, McGrigors was able to provide a complete
service for ScotMet, says Mr Glennie. Five years ago, any work in England
and Wales for ScotMet was handled by Linklaters &amp; Paines.
This ability to provide overall legal services within the UK has proved
attractive to retail companies. McGrigors now handles all the UK employment
and litigation for Gap, the US clothes retailer; it acts for the Sock Shop
chain; and has picked up all UK banking and property work for Seagrams, the
drinks company.
While there may be no 'business case' for national law firms in England and
Wales alone, firms might be wise not to ignore the opportunities that the
provision of legal services throughout the UK could bring.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Rents for shops begin to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shop rents are rising for the first time in three years, Richard Ellis,
chartered surveyors, said yesterday, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The 1.1 per cent rise in retail rents in April provides the first evidence
of a recovery in tenant demand. Although investor demand has pushed property
values up sharply since last summer, there have been few signs of any
fundamental recovery in the letting market.
The rise in shop rents contributed to a 2.4 per cent rise in shop values in
April. In the past year, capital values have risen 20.3 per cent.
Office rents showed little movement for the third consecutive month. They
were down 0.2 per cent in April. The capital value of offices has risen 23.2
per cent during the past year. Industrial premises have also increased in
value by 23.2 per cent.
The Richard Ellis Monthly index is based on 249 properties valued at a total
of more than Pounds 1bn.

FT  10 MAY 94 / BT plans to cut costs in rural areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is extending its use of wireless technology to
cut network costs in rural areas.
BT has signed a contract with DSC, a US telecomm-unications equipment
supplier, for a wireless system to replace traditional copper wires in some
rural areas.
The move reflects the increasing attraction of radio systems as a
replacement for fixed-wire networks at local level. Ionica, a private
Cambridge-based company, is piloting a system in East Anglia which it plans
to introduce nationally.
Mercury, BT's main UK competitor, is engaged in radio experiments. It views
the technology as vital to bypassing BT's local network to carry its calls,
and predicts that within a few years 'millions' of subscribers will be
accessing its long-distance network through local radio systems.
DSC's digital radio system, Airspan, will allow BT to carry its full range
of services now carried over fixed lines with no reduction in quality. A
transmitter-receiver, less than one foot square, will be located at
subscribers' premises. The system has a range of 12 miles.
Until recently, radio technology in the telecoms industry was largely
restricted to paging and cellular mobile services. Suppliers are seeking to
exploit its potential, particularly in developing countries and
sparsely-populated areas.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Lending to consumers up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net lending to consumers rose to its highest level for almost five years in
March, while new borrowing reached a record. This indicates that consumer
confidence remained high before last month's tax rises began to bite.
The net level of consumer borrowing recorded in credit-card transactions,
building society loans excluding mortgages, and finance-house lending, was a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 516m, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday.
This compares with Pounds 336m the month before and Pounds 217m in March
1993. The total level of consumer lending for the first quarter of 1994 was
Pounds 1.08bn, slightly up from the Pounds 1.04bn recorded in the last
quarter of 1993.
New credit extended rose to Pounds 5.21bn in March, of which Pounds 3.04bn
was accounted for by credit-card purchases.
This is the biggest monthly rise in consumer lending ever recorded by the
CSO. However, economists yesterday warned that the surge in the credit-card
figures, which record only credit-card purchases in the Visa and Mastercard
systems, was caused partly by seasonal factors and shifts in consumer
spending.
The Credit Card Research Group, which compiles data on credit-card
transactions, said its adjusted figures suggest that the real growth in
credit-card borrowing was Pounds 2.91bn.
Meanwhile the CSO said comparisons with earlier periods of recovery were
difficult because of the increasing popularity of credit cards.
Nevertheless, the result for net lending was better than previous market
expectations, which had centred on a rise of around Pounds 350m. The
Treasury welcomed the figures.
But it pointed out that the broader measure of consumer credit, which
includes lending by banks on personal accounts, insurance companies and
retailers, had fallen slightly in the past two quarters. Taken together with
the rise in credit card and finance-house lending, this may suggest
consumers are seeking to pay off previous debts as the recovery gathers
pace.
Economists warned, however, that the indication of the impact of April's
taxes was only likely to be revealed once they had an effect on pay packets.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'The
really big issue is what happens in later months. There is a pretty good
chance that April's sales will be shown to be down.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Engineers call for tax allowance to boost innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new company tax allowance should be introduced to encourage innovation by
recognising the importance of professionally qualified engineers, scientists
and marketing staff, the Institution of Electrical Engineers said yesterday.
The plea was one of four linked national initiatives proposed in a report by
the institution which aim to improve the UK's output, productivity, share of
world trade and balance of payments.
It comes a few days before the long-awaited Department of Trade and Industry
white paper on competitiveness.
Professor Jack Levy, who prepared the institution's report, said: 'We hope
the DTI will take at least some of our ideas on board.'
The institution says innovation in research and development, design,
manufacturing and marketing depends crucially on the employment of qualified
people.
The new tax allowance would cover more than the total cost of employing
professionally qualified engineers, scientists and marketing staff plus
overheads and support.
As a starting point, the report suggests that 150 per cent of the cost of
such staff plus an agreed percentage for overheads should be allowed for tax
purposes.
The institution says there would be a number of immediate benefits:
innovation would be encouraged and the scheme would motivate staff and
employers.
It would also help combat the UK's anti-industrial culture.
Unveiling the report yesterday, Prof Levy said the initial cost of such a
scheme would be repaid in the long term through increased tax revenues from
an expanded manufacturing base.
The institution's innovation initiative also includes a plea for 100 per
cent capital allowances in the year of purchase to help companies re-equip
at the same rate as overseas competitors.
The three other proposals in the institution's Manufacturing Expansion
Scheme are initiatives on management, technology and finance for industry.
The finance proposal renews and expands on the institution's plea for a new
bank to enable small and medium-sized manufacturers to borrow money more
cheaply.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Commons warns of Scottish drug crisis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Drug-related crime could be costing Scotland up to Pounds 936m a year, a
Commons committee said yesterday.
The cross-party committee of MPs said official figures on the drugs problem
represented 'the tip of the iceberg' and called for anti-drugs education to
start in primary schools.
One Glasgow GP told the Commons Scottish affairs committee that nearly half
the children at one secondary school class in his area had injected drugs.
The MPs' report calls for the painkiller Temgesic to be added to the list of
drugs of addiction notifiable to the Home Office.
It also calls on the Scottish Office to take a more active role in fighting
drug abuse, suggesting a wider use of 'needle exchanges' and crisis
intervention centres. But it would be 'foolhardy' to adopt any policy that
encouraged the use of cannabis. The report from the committee adds that the
Scottish Office estimates that about 20,000 people in Scotland inject
illicit or prescribed drugs.
The committee based its estimate of the cost of drug-related crime on
Glasgow's 8,500 injecting drug users each spending Pounds 300 a week on
drugs. Much of the cash came from the sale of stolen goods for about a third
of their true value. Projecting this Scotland-wide would imply a total of
Pounds 936m.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Back benches warm to referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday came under pressure from senior Conservative
backbenchers to promise a referendum on the next stage of European
integration as a means of uniting the party.
There were strong signs at Westminster yesterday that the majority of the
party would be behind Mr John Major - albeit unenthusiastically in some
cases - if he decided to adopt such a course.
Significantly, some MPs who had previously opposed a referendum said
privately yesterday that they were now inclined to support one.
One MP with more than 20 years' experience said he was coming around to the
idea, and added: 'That is a definite shift in my position. There is a
democratic deficit since all three major parties were in favour of
Maastricht.'
Where there was dissent, it came mainly from representatives of the two
extremes of opinion on Europe.
The most ardently pro-European Tory MPs believe that far from uniting the
party, a referendum pledge would make the split on Europe still more
apparent.
'The Tory party would be so clearly ranged upon either side of a referendum
campaign that we would have to wait for years before it took place,' said
one. 'I'm frantically trying to tell the whips: 'Don't be so bloody stupid.'
'
The hardline Euro-sceptics generally want a referendum much sooner than any
prime ministerial pledge is likely to envisage, and certainly before 1996
when the next EU inter-governmental conference is due to be held.
The advice from members of the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory
backbenchers, however, was that Mr Major should quickly throw his weight
behind the idea of a referendum if the 1996 inter-governmental conference
paved the way for increased European integration through measures such as a
single European currency.
'A commitment to the principle of a referendum would be therapeutic,' said
one member of the executive. Another said that while he would oppose staging
a referendum immediately, he would certainly support holding one in 1996.
These views coincided with the opinion of Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, who said: 'The proper point to hold a referendum would be if
there were any move towards a single currency.'
The Euro-sceptic position was put forward by Mr Bill Cash, the MP for
Stafford, who said a referendum should take place as soon as possible after
next month's elections for the European parliament.
'This issue is about the whole question of the government of the UK in the
future,' he said. 'It is about the new landscape of Europe for the next
century and therefore it is absolutely essential the people of this country
are consulted before these decisions are taken.'
Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said the party should 'immediately
come out for a referendum before any more powers are given to Europe and are
removed from this country'.
A referendum would unite the Conservatives on European policies in the vital
run-up to the European elections, he added.
Several MPs compared the position to the situation at the time of Labour's
1975 referendum on Europe when, they said, Lord Wilson, then prime minister,
needed to unite his party.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Brooke delays Channel 5 further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government admitted yesterday that it will be unable to decide this
month whether Channel 5 should go ahead.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, had told the Independent
Television Commission that he hoped to have a verdict in time for the
commission's meeting next Monday.
The ITC told the government in February that it wanted to re-advertise the
Channel 5 franchise but needed to know whether the frequencies were still
available.
Ministers will not now be able to take the final decision in time although
they will do so 'within weeks', and possibly before the commission's June
meeting.
The delay has been caused by the time needed to obtain new technical
information. NTL, the former transmission and engineering division of the
Independent Broadcasting Authority, has been researching the issue for the
Radio Communications Agency.
It is believed that NTL has advised the government that it is possible, with
some compromises, to have the best of both worlds - a conventional analogue
television service that can reach nearly 70 per cent of the UK population
but does not preclude the possibility of moving to digital television when
the market allows.
The Radio Communications Agency has first to assess the NTL view before
ministers take a decision - although the go-ahead for a conventional Channel
5 now looks more likely.
Three groups have been publicly identified as being interested in applying
for the new franchise - NBC, the US network company; Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin Group; and a consortium which brings together Time Warner, one of the
world's leading media groups, MAI, the television and financial services
company which controls Meridian Broadcasting; and Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times. Meanwhile, the white paper on the future of the BBC has
also been delayed until late June at the earliest.
The heritage department had only eight 'acceptable' working days between the
local government elections and the European elections to publish the white
paper. The convention is that government policy statements do not come out
in the middle of election campaigns.
It had been hoped that it would would be published in mid-May, but there are
still details to be finalised. However, there is no question of any change
to the basic structure or financing of the BBC.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Lib Dem Euro-move gains Tory respect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats' call for a referendum on Europe was a 'masterstroke',
Tory party managers privately acknowledged yesterday.
The firmness of Mr Paddy Ashdown's proposal for a national referendum to
follow any major constitutional change proposed for Europe contrasted
sharply with the uncertainty displayed by Mr John Major's cabinet over the
issue. The proposal came in a leaked letter to the party's European campaign
director.
More crucially, the move may make it difficult for the Tories to claim, as
they have in the past, that the Liberal Democrats are 'soft on Europe'.
In recent months Conservative Central Office has argued that the government
takes a much more critical stance towards the creation of a federal Europe
than either Labour or the Liberal Democrats, and that this policy reflects
public opinion more closely.
Mr Ashdown's move may make it more difficult for Conservative candidates in
the European elections to adopt this line.
Labour officials, meanwhile, indicated that the party's campaign would focus
on attacking Mr John Major's government on domestic political issues,
repeating the approach adopted for the local elections.
The party's manifesto for the European elections would underline that
Britain must play a full role in the EU.
Liberal Democrat officials said that the call for a referendum would not
prevent their manifesto being 'the most pro-European' of any produced by the
three main parties.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Lang in running for party chairmanship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has emerged as a contender for the
chairmanship of the Tory party in the planned cabinet reshuffle after the
European elections.
But some senior ministers are still pressing Mr John Major to appoint Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine has made clear he does not want to move from his present
position, but might find it hard to resist a direct request from the prime
minister without damaging his own leadership ambitions.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, is another strong contender, and
Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the agriculture minister, also remains in the running.
Mr Hunt's strong campaigning skills count in his favour, but his
determinedly pro-European views antagonise the sceptical right of the party.
Mrs Shepherd, like Mr Lang, is regarded as one of the strongest personal
supporters of the prime minister in the cabinet.
The new chairman will have a pivotal role in trying to restore the party's
battered morale after the European elections and in supporting Mr Major's
own leadership during what is expected to be a perilous few months.
Mr Lang's credentials are being promoted by friends of the prime minister in
spite of the difficulties Mr Major would face in replacing him at the
Scottish Office.
There is no obvious successor to Mr Lang among the party's Scottish MPs, and
the appointment of a minister from an English constituency might further
damage the government's precarious standing in Scotland.
Mr Major is said to have been impressed by Mr Lang's performance in
Scotland, where he has succeeded in slowing if not reversing the
haemorrhaging of support for the Tories.
Mr Major is said to have complete trust in the Scottish secretary, a
prerequisite for an effective relationship in the run-up to a general
election.

FT  10 MAY 94 / MPs' vote may kill off CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 2bn CrossRail project for an east-west underground railway link
across London may be blocked today by a cross-party committee of MPs.
The MPs, chaired by Mr Tony Marlow, Conservative MP for Northampton North,
are deeply split over the project, which would link Paddington and Liverpool
Street stations.
After months of uncertainty, the committee is expected to take a final vote
at a private meeting this afternoon. Enough MPs are undecided to make the
outcome highly uncertain.
Under Commons rules, the committee has quasi-judicial powers over the
project because of its impact on private property along the proposed route.
In effect, a vote to block the project would kill the bill. It would also
hearten campaigners against the Channel tunnel high-speed line, which will
be considered under similar rules.
The CrossRail committee has taken an unexpectedly sceptical approach to the
project, which is regarded by British Rail as an essential element of
London's transport infrastructure.
A defeat of the bill would be deeply embarrassing for Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, who overruled
Treasury opposition to the project.
However, it would be a victory for Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief
secretary, who warned Mr Major that the project would not justify proposed
public investment of Pounds 1bn.
CrossRail supporters suffered a setback last month when a report prepared
for the committee by the Sir Alexander Gibb engineering consultancy said the
project could not be justified until 2010.
The report said CrossRail was 'a visionary project which may be ahead of its
time'. It doubted whether the project would attract sufficient private
finance to make it viable.
The committee has also heard opposition to CrossRail from a large number of
objectors, including Tower Hamlets council in east London, which says the
project would cause more congestion than it would relieve.
The council argues that the link should be re-routed to join the proposed
high-speed rail line from London to the Channel tunnel at Stratford in east
London.
The Pounds 500m modernisation of British Rail's west-coast main line may
take until 2005 to complete, the government has disclosed in a Commons
written answer, David Owen writes.
Work on the 480-mile link between London and Glasgow was expected to start
next year and take between eight and 10 years.
The government said a competition would be held 'early next year' for the
contract to design, build and maintain the improvements to the line. This
would follow a feasibility study by a private-sector consortium working with
Railtrack, the organisation set up to run BR's track and signalling.
The consortium is considering how to improve the track, power supply and
signalling and how to raise private finance in a way which is acceptable to
the Treasury.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Ex-Customs chief raps mandarins: Scott told that advice from
Whitehall did not justify dropping Matrix prosecution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs prosecutors bringing the Matrix Churchill trial were given only
vague warnings by other government departments about the problems they might
encounter in court, Sir Brian Unwin, a former chairman of Customs &amp; Excise,
told the Scott inquiry yesterday.
The warnings, given by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, and the
Department of Trade and Industry, amounted to no more than 'background
noise' and would not have justified dropping the prosecution, he said.
Sir Brian said that at a meeting with Sir Robin and Sir Peter Gregson,
permanent secretary at the DTI, he was warned that Mr Alan Clark, the former
trade minister, had given ambiguous advice to machine-tool manufacturers.
He said this had encouraged the interpretation that Mr Clark was giving them
a 'nod and a wink' to export equipment for military use to Iraq. However,
Sir Brian - who ultimately sanctioned the prosecution - said that he had
left the meeting unaware that any fresh light had been cast upon the Customs
investigation.
Sir Brian also discussed the case with the cabinet secretary in a separate
telephone conversation.
In his earlier evidence to the inquiry, Sir Robin said he had tried then to
alert the Customs chairman to the intelligence background to the case.
Sir Brian said yesterday that if that was what the cabinet secretary was
attempting to do then he had not been very explicit.
He told the inquiry that if there had been real misgivings within Whitehall
about the prosecution, the officials concerned should have come to Customs
to tell them.
'It was open to the DTI, Sir Peter Gregson and the other departments
involved to come to the department (Customs) and not simply make noises, but
to say there is a piece of hard evidence which we think will affect your
prosecution.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Reuters starts TV service for market news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters, the news and financial information group, next month launches a new
form of specialist television by satellite to computer screens.
The service, an example of multimedia in action, is aimed at foreign
exchange, debt and treasury financial markets, and will be far removed from
conventional television.
Mr Mark Wood, editor-in-chief of Reuters Holdings, said yesterday extensive
research showed City professionals 'did not want television - they want
video information that is useful'.
Usually Reuters Financial Television will go on air only when there are
events or comments capable of driving markets. There will be a 15-minute
morning briefing at 7.15 and possibly a second at lunchtime. There will also
be five-minute bursts of live television when justified by the news.
The service will be available on adapted Reuters dealing screens. A screen
icon will flash two minutes before a transmission and the television picture
can either be a small square in the corner of the screen or be enlarged to
occupy the full screen.
Charges will be Pounds 80 to Pounds 100 a month per screen.
Apart from news and instant live commentary from analysts, Mr Wood said the
service would provide the opportunity to communicate directly with the
markets for the first time. 'It will show the furrows in the brow and how
people react to questions and how they give information,' said Mr Wood.
A pilot item carried an interview with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
about his discussions with Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
Reuters Financial Television, which will be delivered to foreign exchange
dealers across Europe, will use the digital video compression system
developed by NTL, the privatised engineering division of the former
Independent Broadcasting Authority.
Reuters said yesterday it hoped to develop a retrieval system for video
information within the next year or two and launch a separate television
service for equities dealers.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Prescott predicts drive to adopt minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is to make the introduction of a statutory national minimum wage one
of the main features of its economic policy in spite of differences over the
issue among unions.
The question is likely to have a prominent place in Labour's campaign in
next month's European elections and at the party's autumn conference. Mr
John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, told the MSF general technical
union at its conference yesterday that the party needed to back the general
principle of a national minimum wage, but should not yet commit itself to a
precise figure. He later said it would be necessary to agree on such a
figure before the next general election.
By focusing on the national minimum wage, Labour will be adopting a
high-risk strategy. Last month Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary,
said a future Labour government should introduce a Pounds 4-an-hour national
minimum wage - a proposal denounced by the AEEU engineering union.
Many unions are concerned that any legally enforceable minimum wage will
lead to a squeeze on pay differentials and demands for pay rises to restore
relative pay positions. Observer, Page 17

FT  10 MAY 94 / Speechwriter in Portillo's shadow: Roland Rudd profiles an
adviser of the Treasury chief secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'There is nothing shadowy about me whatsoever,' said Mr David Hart. The
former aide to Baroness Thatcher is back in the news because of his close
links with Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary and potential
leadership candidate in the event that Mr John Major is forced from office.
Mr Hart dismisses as 'complete nonsense' press reports that he is leading a
clandestine campaign for the rightwing Treasury minister and adds that he is
not equipped to be a campaign organiser. He says he is more interested in
political philosophy than in party politics.
Mr Hart is happy to say that Mr Portillo has been a close friend for more
than 20 years. And while he is known to believe that rumours of his wealth
are widely exaggerated, he does provide Mr Portillo with a valuable service
 -free of charge.
Ms Alison Broom, Mr Portillo's political adviser, who was the minister's
former special adviser at the Department of Environment, benefits from a
rent-free office from Mr Hart.
Mr Hart also writes speeches for Mr Portillo and lavishly entertains him
shooting and fishing at a lodge in Scotland.
While Mr Portillo has been deliberately setting out his political stall in
recent months, Mr Hart's views are harder to pin down. On the face of it,
this champion of 19th-century liberalism appears to be on the extreme wing
of the Conservative party.
Yet Mr Hart published a 'freedom audit' in the 1980s which was highly
critical of the Thatcherite accumulation of power in the centre. He is also
opposed to capital punishment and is irritated by the government's claim to
be the party of low taxation when it increased the burden of taxation under
Lady Thatcher.
He was closest to Lady Thatcher during the miners' strike of 1984-85, when
he infuriated the then energy secretary, Mr Peter Walker, by summoning
working miners to his suite at Claridges.
However, Mr Hart hates the label 'rightwinger', although he would be
hard-put to deny that his brand of libertarianism is closer to the right of
the Conservative party than any other political grouping, which is why he is
writing Mr Portillo's speeches.
The Committee for Free Britain, established in 1987 as more of a dining club
than a think-tank, used to debate how much power the individual could have
in relation to society.
Inevitably, it came down on the side of the individual, and this, more than
any other policy, defines Mr Hart's political philosophy and, by
implication, that of Mr Portillo.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Labour warns of poorer service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday issued a sharp attack on the consultation
document outlining how the British Gas monopoly could be abolished. It
claimed that the proposals, if implemented, would lead to higher prices and
a lower quality of service for many customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, claimed that businesses
would be most likely to gain from the recommendations and that medium to
small customers would be threatened with a poorer service.
'It is no wonder that this document has been delayed for three months and
was not published before the local elections,' he said.
He added: 'And I am not surprised that the government has failed to bring
the document before the House of Commons, where it would have been savaged
by MPs.'
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, insisted yesterday that gas prices would
fall across the board, and would bring 'very considerable benefits' for
consumers.
However, in a detailed critique of the document, Mr Griffiths said that the
intention to move to 'more cost-reflective pricing of transportation
tariffs' could penalise people who live at a great distance from Britain's
main gas terminals.
He was also concerned by the Department of Trade and Industry's claim that
'standing charges tend to shelter low-volume gas consumers'.
He said the implication of this was that British Gas was thinking of raising
the standing charge, penalising 6m gas consumers. He felt the charge should
be abolished.
A third cause of concern was the invitation for comments on whether all
suppliers 'should be required to offer prescribed levels of service to all
levels of customers'.
Mr Griffiths claimed that, with that statement, the DTI was leaving open the
possibility that it would reduce current services.
Labour's criticisms were echoed by the Gas Consumer Council, an industry
watchdog. Mr Ian Powe, the council's director, said: 'It is difficult to
avoid the first impression that low-income consumers, hardest hit by VAT,
will gain nothing over the next four years and could even face higher gas
bills than they were expecting from British Gas.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Lloyd's agents seek more control of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading agencies at Lloyd's of London are examining the creation of a type
of corporate investment fund which would give them more control of their
capital.
Agencies will continue to rely heavily on Names, the individuals whose
assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, for the immediate
future, but the creation of so-called 'dedicated' funds would make it easier
for them eventually to become - in effect - limited liability insurance
companies.
Unlike the dozen Lloyd's investment trusts created last year, which raised
more than Pounds 800m and support a range of agencies and syndicates across
the Lloyd's market, the new vehicles would supply capital exclusively to
insurance syndicates managed by one particular agent, giving the agent more
control.
The Hiscox Group, headed by Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman, is
the only agency so far to have formed a so-called 'dedicated' vehicle, but
both Brockbank, an agency which manages one of the market's biggest marine
syndicates, and Kiln, another highly rated agency, said they may follow
suit.
Lawyers and financiers advising Lloyd's businesses on their capital-raising
plans say that many other managing agents are now examining this option.
Mr Cliff Hampton of Phoenix, the specialist securities house, said that
managing agents were becoming more concerned to secure their sources of
capital, at a time when another year of large losses at the market is likely
to lead to a reduction in the amount of capacity supplied by individual
Names.
Lloyd's expects to report a loss of more than Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year
next week, in accordance with its three-year accounting system.
Mr Hampton also said that 'from an investors' point of view there may be
more interest in backing a business where they can more closely assess the
record of management'.
Mr George Stevens, managing director of Brockbank, said: 'Any agent worth
his salt is looking into this at the moment.'
Mr Andrew Fleming-Williams, a director of Kiln, said: 'More and more people
are coming to the conclusion that capital is going to be grouped around
managing agents rather than being brought in wholesale. I am sure that this
is the way it is going to go.'
Interest in this type of structure is likely to lead to pressure on the
Stock Exchange to lift its restrictions on listing such vehicles. At present
they cannot be listed either because they have no trading record as limited
companies, or because their spread of investments is too narrow for them to
be awarded investment trust status. Unless the rules are changed, backers
could seek to list these funds outside the UK, one agent predicted.
Lloyd's suggested last week that Names might at some future point be able to
exchange their participations in syndicates for shares in new 'corporate
syndicates', which would draw all their capital from the same corporate
investor. Mr Stevens said that by the end of the century the market would be
dominated by between six and 10 agents, all controlling corporate vehicles.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wind farms have attracted Pounds 140m in private investment from banks and
companies, a wind power conference heard yesterday.
Mr David Lindley, managing director of National Wind Power, which operates
100 of the UK's 400-plus wind turbines, told the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers in London that about a quarter of the total costs had been
provided as equity.
Nearly all the equity finance came from electricity and water companies. The
balance of the funding has been project finance from banks. Venture
capitalists at the conference said the rates of return available had
generally been too low for them.

Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has vetoed the plan by the National
Galleries of Scotland to establish a gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow.
He said the plan, which had aroused intense controversy in Scotland, did not
enjoy 'the broad general support appropriate to a major initiative of this
kind'.
Mr Lang's decision is a rebuff to Mr Angus Grossart, the merchant banker who
is chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, and to Mr
Timothy Clifford, the director of the galleries, who were the plan's
proponents.
The idea was to create a gallery to depict Scottish art and history.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Eurostar tunnel trains delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could be nine to 12 months before a full service of Euro-star trains is
running through the Channel tunnel from London to Paris and Brussels, says
European Passenger Services, operator of the trains, Charles Batchelor
writes.
The service is expected to start with just two trains a day to each
destination, rising to 15 a day.
Delays in deliveries and the time taken to test each train will mean there
will be a gradual build-up of services from July or August.
The 400-metre trains will take three hours at speeds of up to 186mph to
travel between London and Paris and three hours 15 minutes between London
and Brussels.
Ticket prices will be announced three weeks before the start of the service.
First-class fares are expected to be slightly lower than airlines' premium
rates and there will be discount fares for leisure travellers.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Farmers to test rapeseed car fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmway, a co-operative of 2,500 farmers in north-east England, will this
week begin running some of its cars and trucks on bio-diesel produced from
rapeseed grown on set-aside land.
British Bio-Diesel - a consortium formed by a group of Durham farmers;
Farmway; specialist seed crusher Unitrition; and chemical manufacturer
Chemoxy - has produced 4,000 gallons of bio-diesel, believed to be the UK's
first.
The trial, by seven Farmway vehicles normally run on conventional diesel,
will test vehicle emissions. A North Yorkshire Peugeot dealer's courtesy car
will also use the fuel to gauge public reaction. Engine performance will be
evaluated by Perkins Engines and Lucas.
The consortium believes bio-diesel is an environmentally friendly fuel which
offers farmers a productive use for set-aside land. Farmway is paying
members Pounds 98 a tonne for the rapeseed. That does not affect set-aside
payments.
The initiative was started by the farmers of the East Durham Bio-Diesel
Working Group. They say bio-diesel is cleaner than conventional fuels and,
if spilt, is 95 per cent biodegradable within three weeks and fully within
five.
Farmer Mr David Cowton said the quantity of bio-diesel which could be
produced from UK set-aside land would not supplant ordinary diesel but it
would be attractive in environmentally sensitive areas such as waterways.
The consortium hopes the UK government will grant it pilot plant status for
its production facilities in North Yorkshire and on Teesside. That would
greatly reduce the fuel tax burden while markets are sought for bio-diesel
and its rapemeal and glycerine by-products. If fully taxed, said Mr Cowton,
bio-diesel would be about 50 per cent more expensive than ordinary diesel.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Gas proposals aim to open up market: De-regulation plans set
out / Standing charge to be capped until 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government and Ofgas, the industry regulator, yesterday offered their
vision of how the domestic market of 18m households will be opened to
competition from 1996.
The long-delayed document covers a wide range of areas which need to be
addressed before a final 'framework for competition' emerges. These include
measures to 'avoid unacceptably sharp (price) changes for particular groups
of consumers'.
Other key issues are the safe operation of the system, the obligation to
supply and the future role of Ofgas in overseeing energy efficiency schemes.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday went to some lengths to emphasise
that de-regulation should lead to lower prices. But one reason for the delay
in publishing the report was fears that wide price variations could emerge
as competition was phased in and the 'hidden subsidies' of present pricing
policies were gradually removed.
Consumer groups had warned that under present arrangements consumers of
small amounts of gas are in effect subsidised by households which are large
users. They feared that the removal of such 'cross-subsidies' would lead to
price variations which would tend to penalise the less well-off.
The document notes that British Gas's costing systems are not set up in a
way which would allow the 'cross-subsidies to be readily identified'. But it
says most of these subsidies appear to be in the transport side of the
business.
'The fact that this sector of the market will continue to be regulated will
allow the pace of adjustment to be carefully controlled,' it says.
The report acknowledges that 'some continuing regulation may be appropriate
in the developing competitive market, at any rate in the transitional years'
in order to avoid any sharp price rises.
The report's authors say it is unlikely that any transition would extend
beyond 1998, when the full market is due to be opened to competition.
One of the main ways in which price rises will be limited is through the
standing charge which all consumers pay. The report says this will remain
subject to a cap at least until 1997.
In addition it is expected that British Gas tariffs will not rise by more
than the rate of inflation in the transition period between 1996 and 1998.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, pointed out, however, that
the introduction of more 'cost-reflective' transportation tariffs would
affect a relatively small number of consumers. She added that any price
increases would take place within the 'retail price index minus 4 per cent
(points)' pricing formula under which British Gas charges are now fixed.
New entrants will have to deliver the same standards of service as British
Gas in areas such as debts and disconnections. But the proposals are weaker
for delivery of services to the old and disabled, about 900,000 of whom have
their special needs recorded on a 'gas care register'. The Pounds 23m which
British Gas estimates it costs each year to run the programme are recovered
through a cross-subsidy from all consumers.
The obligation on British Gas would initially apply to new entrants as well,
but the authors say it may eventually be phased out if 'attractively priced'
services aimed specifically at older or disabled customers emerge along with
competition.
The safety implications of introducing competition are to be the subject of
a study by the Health and Safety Executive. But the authors suggest that
British Gas's transportation and storage business continues to have prime
responsibility for overseeing the safe operation of the system and for
responding to emergencies.
The authors also hope that innovative packages will emerge to encourage
energy efficiency. They say parliament should consider changing the law to
allow gas suppliers to provide total energy packages, such as fuel-efficient
boilers, along with the gas supply.
Ms Spottiswoode has been particularly critical of energy efficiency schemes
put forward by the Energy Savings Trust, which require subsidies from gas
consumers. But the document suggests that parliament reconsiders her role
and whether it is appropriate for the regulator to have the powers to raise
such funds.
It is not clear from the document whether the proposed framework leaves a
level playing field in which British Gas can compete equally with new
competitors without being picked clean. Although the newcomers will have to
take on many of British Gas's obligations, it seems that British Gas will be
more level than others.
The reference to a 'responsible party' to hold the gas system together when
all else fails seems to point to a special role for British Gas. It (or
another company) would get compensated for providing stand-in services,
although whether by affected customers, some bonding arrangement or
insurance is open for debate.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Scope of DTI document disappoints independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent gas suppliers eager to take on British Gas in its most lucrative
market sector yesterday expressed disappointment that the DTI's document did
not go further in explaining how competition will be achieved.
'For all the agonising that's gone into it, it's a bit thin,' said Mr John
Astrop, commercial director at Kinetica, a joint venture between Conoco and
PowerGen, the generating company. 'It addresses the major issues but doesn't
sketch out in any detail what the public gas supply licence might look
like.'
Independent gas marketers are keen to see Ofgas's follow-up report to be
published in the coming weeks, which will contain details of the costs to be
charged for using British Gas pipelines.
'The transport costs are the key as to how far we can compete in the new
market,' said Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director at Alliance Gas, a
joint venture between British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil.
The gas marketers believe they will be able to offer domestic customers
price savings of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent.
Under the terms of the DTI's suggestions they will be obliged to offer gas
to all comers, but not necessarily at the same price.
The DTI's report recognises that, in a competitive market, prices will more
accurately reflect the costs of supply. That means users in some parts of
the country could pay more than others. The document says this could mean
consumers paying between 2 per cent and 4 per cent more or less for their
gas depending on where they live.
Mr Peter Bryant, deputy chairman at United Gas, believes that regional
distortions in price will not be more than 2p per therm in the most extreme
cases and are more likely to be 1p per therm.
More importantly, some customers - such as those with bad debts, for
example, or those who move house regularly - could now be receiving a
cross-subsidy from other users. This may result in a re-balancing of prices
in a more competitive market.
In order to minimise the effects of the re-balancing on the most vulnerable
customers, the DTI envisages regulation of British Gas's standing charges
beyond 1997 as well as continuation of its present price formula.
Some shippers do not believe that regulators will be able to protect all
customers in a free market. 'It's impossible to stop cherry-picking: that's
what competition is all about,' said Mr Maroe.
He believes around 10 per cent to 15 per cent of British Gas's domestic
customers may not be paying the full cost of supply. 'These customers
probably won't see price reductions, but neither will they see increases,'
he stressed.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Jobs warning in Whitehall reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several thousand civil service jobs could be lost as part of a shake-up of
the Department of Transport, a leading civil service union said yesterday.
A plan announced yesterday to make 20 per cent efficiency savings at the
department, which employs 15,500 people centrally and in executive agencies,
'could not be carried out without chopping significant numbers of staff,'
said Mr John Higgins of the IPMS civil service union.
Several thousand jobs could be at risk in departments such as the coastguard
agency and the vehicles inspectorate, leading to a threat to public safety,
he added. The department said that job losses would be necessary, although
it declined to specify how many.
Efficiencies are to be achieved by a combination of job losses, office
closures and a streamlining of the department's activities.
Reductions at a senior level will include abolition of one of the
department's four posts of deputy secretary and four of its 17
undersecretaries.
Two new groups will be established in August with responsibility for
transport infrastructure and urban transport and for transport operations.
They will replace three groups which concentrate on public transport, roads
and aviation, and shipping and international matters.
A third new group will have responsibility for questions which cut across
different issues such as the environment and safety.
Mr MacGregor said the changes would allow the department to take a more
strategic approach to transport issues and enhance its case for remaining a
separate department. He added: 'We are at the forefront of very big policies
and carry through massive infrastructure programmes.'
The streamlining of the department has been brought about by hiving off many
of its activities into independent agencies and by the privatisation of
British Rail. Motorway service areas will have to provide picnic sites and
free access for mechanics and motoring organisations to repair vehicles,
according to new Department of Transport guidance to planning authorities.

FT  10 MAY 94 / How Household supplies will be opened up to competition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas' monopoly of the domestic gas market will be ended in 1998, but
new competitors can start entering the market in 1996.
Safety: British Gas' transportation and storage division would retain 'a
prominent role' in ensuring the safety of the gas system.
Assurance of supply: any company with adequate resources would be eligible
to supply homes with gas. But suppliers will have to subscribe to a network
code to ensure orderly operation of the gas system.
Pricing: 'Some continuing regulation' may be necessary to aid the transition
to a competitive market, but prices could vary by plus or minus 2 to 4 per
cent for consumers because of different transportation costs.
Standards of service: new suppliers to observe same debt and disconnection
procedures as British Gas, and to have same obligation to supply older and
disabled customers for a time.
Other measures: liberalisation of metering, and incentives for efficient use
of gas.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Croydon set to clinch Pounds 58m property sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Croydon council in south London is today set to complete a deal which
combines privatisation of its property management services with a Pounds 58m
sale of commercial property.
The sale of the property to Croydon Land and Estates, a new company financed
by Montagu Private Equity, will reduce the council's debt and give it some
Pounds 16m for new development.
Croydon said it believed it was the first council to combine the
privatisation of its estates and valuation department with the sale of
commercial property.
'The deal is something of a market leader and meets government directives to
dispose of surplus land wherever possible and to market-test defined
professional services,' said Mr Mike Brakes, director of estates and
valuation.
Croydon Land and Estates submitted the lowest tender for the five-year
property management contract and the highest bid for the property portfolio.
More than 25 companies submitted bids.
Twenty council staff will move to the new company. 'The transfer means that
the service will not have to face the uncertainty of compulsory competitive
tendering in deterioriating market conditions,' the council said.
The deal follows the government directive that property management services
should be included in the programme for compulsory competitive tendering by
local authorities and a temporary moratorium on restrictions governing the
use of capital receipts from property sales.
The portfolio, which excludes all public buildings and civic offices,
consists of 240 investment properties which generate more than Pounds 4m of
rental income. The properties were acquired over many years as a result of
building activities.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Minister vetoes Scottish art plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has vetoed the plan by the National
Galleries of Scotland to establish a gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow,
James Buxton writes.
He said the plan, which had aroused intense controversy in Scotland, did not
enjoy 'the broad general support appropriate to a major initiative of this
kind'.
Mr Lang's decision is a rebuff to Mr Angus Grossart, the merchant banker who
is chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, and to Mr
Timothy Clifford, the director of the galleries, who were the plan's
proponents.
The idea was to create a gallery to depict Scottish art and history. It
would have been based around the collection in the Scottish national
portrait gallery but include pictures from the National Gallery and the
National Gallery of Scottish Art, all in Edinburgh, plus pictures in store.
Glasgow made a successful bid for the new gallery to be in the city, but the
plan caused an outcry when it was announced late last year. Opposition
focused on the transfer of the portrait gallery collection, and there were
objections to the idea of removing Scottish pictures from their
international context, as well as to the choice of Glasgow rather than
Edinburgh
The trustees of the gallery then changed the plan to leave the portrait
gallery untouched. Mr Lang said he would not have been prepared to permit
the transfer of the portrait gallery collection in any case, but without
this collection the proposals had 'lost their core'.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Pounds 53.8m British Library deal signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 53.8m contract to clad and fit out the final phase of the troubled
Pounds 450m British Library building at St Pancras in London has been
awarded to a joint venture between Sir Robert McAlpine and Haden Young.
The project, which will be smaller than planned, is running several years
late and hundreds of millions of pounds over-budget.
The first phase of the development - forecast to cost Pounds 116m when it
was announced in 1978 by the then education secretary Mrs Shirley Williams -
is due to be handed over this year. It is expected to have cost at least
Pounds 300m.
The 25,000 sq ft final phase is due to be completed by 1995 and the library
ready for occupation in 1996.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday that the
cladding and fitting-out contract for the final phase had been awarded after
competitive tendering.
A 1991 report by the Commons public accounts committee, the public spending
watchdog, strongly criticised the Office of Arts and Libraries, the
department responsible for commissioning the building, and the Property
Services Agency, which is overseeing its design and construction.
It blamed both bodies for serious management weaknesses, for cost increases
and for producing an unsuitable building. When both phases are completed in
1996 it will seat 1,176 readers compared with the 3,440 originally planned.
In 1991 the development hit fresh problems when mobile shelves, made in the
Netherlands, jammed and the anti-corrosive paint covering them peeled.
Their replacement at the makers' expense caused a further two-year delay in
the project, which was expected to have been completed in the late 1980s.
The PSA projects division, responsible for the library, was acquired in 1992
by Tarmac, the UK construction company.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Slimmer curriculum unveiled: NUT insists tests boycott is
growing in spite of opposition from other unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday unveiled detailed
proposals for a slimmer national curriculum, which stresses the importance
of basic English and arithmetic and introduces compulsory competitive sports
for pupils aged up to 16.
The National Union of Teachers claimed that its boycott of this year's pupil
tests, due to start yesterday, had caused even more disruption than last
year's boycott although Mr Patten and Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the
Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, insisted that the tests are
also to be slimmed.
The education department intends to spend the next three months in a Pounds
1.5m consultation exercise before finalising the proposals, which are to be
implemented in September next year.
Controversy over the curriculum centred on English, where some teachers
objected to the imposition of a long reading list from which they should
select the novels to be read, and history, where rightwingers say that the
75 per cent share of classroom time allocated to British history should be
increased.
Team sport also aroused great argument. Mr Patten extended compulsory games
to 16-year-olds but stopped short of requiring schools to teach 'team games'
to children aged 14 to 16.
Mr Patten said: 'We are meeting the concerns of teachers for greater freedom
and flexibility.'
The NUT yesterday claimed that this year's national curriculum tests were
being taken by even fewer schools in England and Wales than last year. Mr
Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'The boycott (of curriculum tests)
has been very solidly supported right across the country. If the government
achieves returns from 150 secondary schools as it did last year it will be
doing very well.'
Up to 600,000 14-year-olds were this week scheduled to start three days of
tests in maths, English and science. Final figures on those actually taking
the tests will not be clear for several weeks, as central information will
not be collated until schools have marked tests and sent results to the
education department.
Mr McAvoy claimed that many grant-maintained schools were not doing the
tests, even though the schools are directly funded from Whitehall and are
normally more committed to government education policies. He said 16 of the
17 secondary schools in Staffordshire were not carrying out the tests.
Leaders of the other teachers' unions have this year advised members to
abandon the boycott. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National
Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, suggested the boycott
would damage relations with Sir Ron. He said: 'Those who continue to boycott
everything are kicking a friend in the teeth. Sir Ron Dearing has again
delivered significant benefits to the profession.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / MPs win changes to bill on red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De-regulation measures will be subject to greater parliamentary scrutiny
after the government said yesterday it would accept significant changes to
its bill.
The de-regulation bill would enable government departments to repeal
hundreds of regulatory measures without primary legislation.
Ministers have privately conceded that the bill, which has reached its
report stage in the Commons, is likely to face fierce opposition in the
Lords.
Critics of the bill have argued that parliamentary orders - which cannot be
amended and on which time for debate is limited - are not a suitable vehicle
for potentially complex and far-reaching changes in the law.
The cross-party Commons procedure committee had recommended tough new powers
for the select committee set up to scrutinise all de-regulation proposals.
In an attempt to placate critics, Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry
minister, said the government would accept the committee's recommendation
for the new body, which will consider the final version of draft orders
implementing de-regulatory changes before they are debated by the Commons.
The bill requires ministers to wait 40 days between laying a draft order
before parliament and submitting a final draft for debate.
An amendment proposed by ministers would extend that period to 60 days if
the de-regulation committee felt that 40 days was not sufficient for
scrutiny of a proposal.
But some backbenchers remain concerned that the government could still push
through significant de-regulation measures without adequate scrutiny.
Mr Gary Waller, Tory MP for Keighley, said: 'While I support the objectives
behind the bill I am still not happy with the mechanism.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Technology changes welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to the technology national curriculum should help to produce more
skilled recruits, employers said yesterday.
Teachers and employers had claimed the original arrangements for technology
 -one of four 'core' subjects in the curriculum along with English,
mathematics and science - were unworkable.
The government has even allowed schools to abandon the existing technology
curriculum in favour of the new proposals from September. The new curriculum
for other subjects must wait until September next year.
More than 2,000 schools in England - about half of all secondary schools -
had applied to do this before the new technology curriculum was published.
It was seen as a decisive vote of no confidence in the old arrangements.
Other schools have until July to register to do the same.
Academics and teachers had two central problems which were addressed by
yesterday's proposals:
The curriculum encouraged so much breadth that it was impossible for pupils
to build up a worthwhile skill in a single subject.
It was too intellectualised and included a requirement that pupils should
'identify needs and opportunities' for technology in different contexts.
A report last year by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
said this left less academic children 'disadvantaged and demotivated'.
The new curriculum will concentrate on 'designing and making' skills, and
support knowledge and understanding.
Additional time for design and technology has been found by cutting back
time devoted to information technology, which is supposed to be taught
across several subjects in the curriculum.
Mr Denis Filer, director-general of the Engineering Council, welcomed the
new curriculum. 'In respect of design and technology we feel that the core
requirements are now closely related to the real world,' he said.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Incomes in northern counties 'among poorest in Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Income for households in northern England is Pounds 36 a week less than that
of the average British household, a report said today.
A Low Pay Unit report, commissioned by the NUCPS public service union, found
that incomes in the region, which covers Tyne and Wear, Cleveland, County
Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland, were among the poorest in Europe, 14 per
cent below the European average.
The report said more than a third of people working full- time in the north
earned less than the Council of Europe's decency threshold.
Low pay rates, however, had not led the region to attract jobs, the report
said. It still had the highest unemployment rate in Britain.
The report says the problem has been made worse by the collapse of
manufacturing, costing 100,000 jobs.
Average pay in the northern region, says the report, is Pounds 288.60, 9 per
cent lower than the national average. It has been steadily falling behind
since 1984 when it was 6 per cent below the national figure.

FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: India aims for sharp growth in exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India is planning to set a target of 24-25 per cent for export growth in the
financial year which started last month, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Mukherjee hoped exports would rise to Dollars 26bn-Dollars 27bn (Pounds
17.4bn-Pounds 18.1bn), from Dollars 22.2bn in 1993-94, when they rose 20.4
per cent.
The Commerce Ministry is looking to rapid increases to make up for the
ground lost in the early 1990s when export growth was hit by a collapse in
sales to the former Soviet Union, once India's biggest market. Also,
economic reforms launched in 1991, which include incentives for exporters,
have taken time to have effect.
Even though exports are growing fast, Mr Mukherjee's target is ambitious.
Finance Ministry projections suggest exports may in fact grow by about 15
per cent.
Mr Mukherjee said he expected further growth from industries which were
already contributing to exports - textiles, computer software, motor vehicle
parts, engineering, agricultural goods, gems and jewellery and leather.
He also forecast an import rise, after growth of only 6.8 per cent last year
to Dollars 22.1bn. There was a sharp pick-up in March when imports were 62
per cent higher than in March 1993.
Mr Mukherjee added that, with signs of industry recovering after three years
of stagnation, imports could grow by 11-12 per cent in dollar terms. Imports
of machinery and of industrial raw materials would cause much of the growth.
He said the recent signing of the Uruguay Round accord of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would benefit India and other developing
country exporters by opening markets in industrial nations.

FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Scheme to increase tourist arrivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government has launched a tourism promotion programme to increase
the number of foreign visitors from 1.76m to 5m over three years.
A calmer political climate and further opening up of the economy have led to
an increase in tourist arrivals, to 1.76m from 1.5m the previous year.
Foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by 14 per cent to Dollars
1.47bn for 1993-94, according to figures published by the Ministry of
Tourism and Civil Aviation.
Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, tourism minister, said Bombay airport, the country's
prime entry point, alone handled 164,000 domestic and international flights,
an increase of more than 150 per cent in a decade. Liberalisation of
domestic routes last year helped ease both congestion and non-availability
of seats on flights within the country.
Tourism is India's third-largest foreign exchange earner, and has more of a
range of destinations to offer than most countries in the world. But the
country accounts for 0.2 per cent of international tourism, largely because
of inadequate infrastructure.
Officials in the Tourism Ministry say a big constraint is a lack of
middle-level hotels. 'The choice we offer the foreign tourist is limited,'
said a senior official. The foreign tourist must choose between expensive
five-star comfort or small hotels that cater to backpackers and lack the
most basic of amenities. 'Our plan is to offer something to the tourist
between the very wealthy ones and the business travellers, and those who
have very little money to spend.'
Foreign hotel chains are enthusiastic about the more relaxed investment
rules after liberalisation (the hotel industry has always been dominated by
private companies), and are flocking to India with joint ventures. The
government estimates that foreign investment is worth at least Dollars 250m
(Pounds 168m) in the hotel industry.
The Australian Southern Pacific hotels plans to start a series of three-star
travel lodges in main cities. The Oberoi group is linking with Accor of
France to start a network of motels across the country. Kamats, a chain of
south Indian restaurants, is linking with the Japanese Dai Ici and Pearl
Hotels, to offer budget accommodation at Buddhist pilgrimage destinations.
The Indian Taj Group, which operates some of India's finest hotels, plans a
350-room hotel in Bombay to supplement its famous Taj Mahal, and a series of
Club Med resorts in association with the French company. And a group of
non-resident Indians has got together with the Irish company, Deltic
Management, to build a Rs8.7bn (Pounds 186m) 600-room floating luxury hotel
in Bombay.

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European rum importers have been cancelling orders from Caribbean suppliers
because the current import quota will soon be filled, according to Caribbean
exporters.
The European rum market faces two months of dislocation because the European
Union has refused to increase the quota to meet growing demand for the
product, producers say.
The exporters have failed several times to have the European Commission
increase the quota of 224,000 hectolitres by 25,000hl to meet demand in
Europe. The quota year is to expire next month.
An increase in the rum quota is not a priority for the Commission, Mr
Philippe Soubestre, deputy director-general for development, said in
Barbados. He said it was paying more attention to the EU's political
problems.
Conditions for access to the European rum market come in a protocol of the
Lome Convention, a trade and aid treaty of the EU and the African, Caribbean
and Pacific group of countries. Rum producers have criticised the EU for
being slow to honour commitments to react automatically by raising access
for rum to meet a growing demand.
'This is a disgraceful situation,' a leading producer said yesterday. 'There
is paranoia in Europe over this matter. No-one wants to upset the French,
who are leading the campaign against an increase in quota to protect
domestic producers in their Caribbean departments.'

Hungary is much the most successful eastern European country in attracting
foreign direct investment, accounting for a third of the Dollars 18.3bn
(Pounds 12.3bn) total at the beginning of this year.
More than Dollars 10bn, or over 55 per cent, went to just three countries -
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland - according to the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe* (ECE).
The figures relate to the foreign component of paid-up capital, and do not
include sums committed but not yet invested.
The bulk of foreign capital in the region comes from western Europe, which
accounts for about 77 per cent of overseas investment in Hungary and 92 per
cent in Slovenia. Just over half the total has been invested in the
manufacturing sector.
The ECE says only Hungary has managed to attract substantial foreign
investment into the important financial services sector, where it accounts
for 11 per cent of all international investment in the country.
Over 17 per cent of all Hungarian enterprises now have a foreign capital
component, giving overseas investors a big role in the economy. By way of
contrast, foreign-owned enterprises in the Commonwealth of Independent
States account for a tiny 0.2 per cent of total employment.

<TEXT>
Honda, the Japanese car company, said yesterday it intended to build a car
plant in Mexico, a further sign of growing international interest in the
country's vehicle sector.
The move will make it the eighth vehicle producer in the country.
Mr Yoshihido Munekuni, vice-president of Honda, told the Mexican government
the plant would initially produce 15,000 cars a year, and employ some 250
workers.
Honda said it plans eventually to double the plant's initial 15,000-unit
capacity.
Honda's decision to build a Mexican plant follows a similar announcement by
BMW last month. BMW intends to assembly luxury cars in Mexico from the
middle of next year, and bring parts producers to Mexico to supply its
planned car plant in South Carolina, US.
The total production of Honda's plant is small even by Mexican standards,
with planned production just a fraction of the more than 100,000 cars a year
each of the five main companies sell in the domestic market.
According to Mr Miguel Angle Olea, a Mexican consultant to car companies,
Honda is preparing for liberalisation of Mexico's car sector, when it will
be able to import cars into Mexico. 'They know that in 10 years' time the
market will be free,' says Mr Olea. 'They are coming to establish their
presence. This is just a penetration strategy.'
Mexico has agreed under the North American Free Trade Agreement gradually to
remove current restrictions on car imports and eliminate tariffs on parts
and finished vehicles. Companies that do not produce cars in Mexico are
currently prohibited from exporting to Mexico.
The car plant will be built in the western state of Jalisco where Honda
already produces motorcycles.

Australia's trade deficit with the US is widening because of import barriers
Washington has erected to protect its own producers, the Australian
government said in a report published yesterday, Reuter reports from
Canberra
The deficit was now proportionally bigger than the US trade deficit with
Japan, according to the report by the Australian Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade. 'The fact that a number of major Australian exports are
subject to stringent US import controls has contributed to the growing
imbalance in trade,' it said.
The report said there were long-standing concerns over access to the US
market, particularly for such key Australian agricultural products, as beef,
dairy products and sugar.
It said there were also concerns over the impact of US farm export subsidies
on Australian exports to third countries, particularly of wheat, barley,
malt and dairy products.
In the year to June 30, 1993 Australian exports to the US were worth
ADollars 4.92bn (Pounds 2.36bn) while imports from the US were worth
ADollars 13.01bn.
Australia's resulting trade deficit of ADollars 8.09bn with the US is its
highest deficit with any one country.
'It is also larger, proportionally, than the US trade deficit with Japan,'
the departmental report said.
The implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) had
not raised specific barriers against Australian imports, but had increased
the potential for trade diversion through origin rules and tariff
harmonisation tactics, the report said.
The report did not specify what Australia would do to push the US to remove
its barriers.

Washington has postponed for 60 days its threat to start proceedings against
Argentina for its failure to enact new laws for the protection of
intellectual property.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said last month he would
investigate damage to US companies in Argentina caused by inadequate patent
laws.
The investigation could then have led to the imposition of trade sanctions.
Pharmaceutical companies are said to be the most affected. Estimates of
damage vary between Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) and Dollars 900m a year. The
Argentine drugs market has grown rapidly in the last three years, with
annual sales of Dollars 3bn.
However, the US embassy in Buenos Aires has said the postponement was a
'positive gesture which, the United States hopes, will give Argentina
sufficient time to pass adequate and effective patent reform legislation'.
The US has been in the forefront of developed country pressure on Argentina
to introduce new patent laws. The government introduced legislation into
Congress three years ago to upgrade the current 1864 law, but the bill has
made little progress.
Local laboratories, together with the nationalist wings of both the
governing Peronist partyand the opposition Radical party, have obstructed
debate.
US and European multinational companies complain that the government has
been giving the bill a low priority.
However, both President Carlos Menem and Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy
minister, have said they would press the Congress to pass the bill as soon
as possible. Mr Cavallo said this was 'not due to US pressure, but because
it is necessary to attract investments' to Argentina.

Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, appeared on fraud charges in a US court yesterday, after
being flown to the country on Saturday.
Mr Naqvi, who was number two at the bank under Mr Aga Hasan Abedi, BCCI's
founder, had been in custody in Abu Dhabi since soon after the bank was
closed in a worldwide swoop by regulators in July 1991. US prosecutors
secured his extradition in a January deal with Abu Dhabi authorities.
In federal court in Washington yesterday, Mr Naqvi pleaded not guilty to
four counts of fraud. These cover BCCI's alleged attempt to gain secret
control of a US bank, First American Bankshares, along with three other
financial institutions in the country.
If convicted, he could face a maximum of 31 years in jail and a Dollars
750,000 (Pounds 503,000) fine. Mr Naqvi was taken to jail pending a further
hearing on June 15. He has already pleaded guilty to fraud charges in Abu
Dhabi, but has not yet been sentenced. If sentenced to jail in both
countries, he would serve the US term first.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Health reform hits Congress troubles
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's proposal to require employers to provide health
insurance for their workers, one of the central elements of his healthcare
reform plan, is running into difficulties in Congress.
Congressional committees working on healthcare legislation are baulking at
the employer mandate, which is opposed by Republicans and centre-right
Democrats who fear the financial burden it would place on smaller
businesses.
Congressman John Dingell, chairman of the House of Representatives energy
and commerce committee, remains a few votes short of persuading a majority
of his committee to accept the employer mandate.
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means
committee, also appears not to have a majority for the employer mandate,
though he has warned his members that the alternative, if a comprehensive
reform is to be financed, would be a broadly-based tax increase.
In the Senate, meanwhile, Democratic Senator David Boren has signed up with
the rival plan produced by Republican Senator John Chafee, which would put
the obligation on the individual to secure health. That could mean that the
Senate finance committee, of which Mr Boren is a member, ends up using the
Chafee plan as the basis for its legislative drafting, rather than Mr
Clinton's proposal.
But Senator Ted Kennedy, who heads the other main Senate committee dealing
with healthcare, preserves the employer mandate in his version of the bill,
which he released yesterday. He does, however, exempt businesses with five
or fewer employees from paying for their workers' insurance.
The Chafee plan would impose a fine on anyone who did not have health
coverage by 2005, just as motorists are required to obtain car insurance. It
would also, like the Clinton plan, prohibit insurance companies from
refusing to cover someone because of their health, or from charging them
more, and would offer vouchers to help those on low incomes pay for
insurance.
It would thus in theory meet the goal of guaranteed, universal coverage Mr
Clinton has said is his only unnegotiable demand. In practice, however, it
would leave the government with a large bill if adequate subsidies are to be
given to those who cannot afford health insurance premiums.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Clinton fails to still Haiti fears
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's weekend change of policy on Haiti has brought some
immediate respite from domestic criticism, but fresh comments yesterday by a
senior White House adviser on the number of refugees who might be admitted
to the US threatened to reignite controversy.
Mr Sandy Berger, deputy national security adviser, said only 5 per cent of
about 1,300 Haitians recently intercepted at sea have qualified for
political asylum. 'That is not a very high number,' he added, in an apparent
attempt to calm fears in Florida of a new influx of refugees.
But this was immediately disputed by Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida, and
Democratic Senator Bob Graham, who predicted a new wave of 5,000-10,000
potential immigrants each month in the immediate future. Florida has already
sued the federal government to recover some of the costs of sustaining the
wave of immigrants, mostly from Haiti and Cuba.
The new Clinton policy, outlined on Sunday, has two main elements: First,
the temporary appointment of former Congressman Bill Gray, a respected black
politician, as special envoy to Haiti, succeeding Mr Lawrence Pezzullo, who
had been criticised for being too soft on the military junta. Mr Gray, it is
hoped, will blunt some attacks from the congressional black caucus that US
policy towards Haiti has been quasi-racist.
Second, the US is to provide asylum processing facilities on its ships and,
it is hoped, in third countries in the Caribbean, rather than sending all
boat people back to Haiti for hearings on the island. The new procedures,
involving larger naval vessels, will not be in place for some weeks,
however.
Also, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, confirmed in Mexico
yesterday that the US was actively exploring the establishment of a joint
hemispheric peace-keeping force, to be sent to help maintain order after the
military junta had left Haiti.
Several prominent critics of US policy, including the exiled Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Mr Randall Robinson, a Washington-based
activist, described the new moves as 'steps in the right direction'. Last
week, the UN security council, at US request, imposed tougher economic
sanctions on Haiti.
Over the weekend, Mr Robinson ended a 27-day hunger strike over the forcible
US return of boat people. But, in interviews yesterday, he remained
sceptical that on-board asylum hearings could meet 'internationally
recognised standards' for refugee processing.
He continued to favour a 'constructive' military intervention under UN or
Organisation of American States auspices but, he said, 'it shouldn't be a
force whose sole purpose is to knock down the Haitian military'.
Meanwhile, Haiti's military leaders have dismissed the UN plan to tighten
economic sanctions. Having survived previous sanctions, army leaders are
confident they will survive the new UN measures, and are encouraged by what
they see as waning support for Father Aristide, diplomats in Port-au-Prince
said yesterday.
The UN will impose tougher sanctions on Haiti on May 21 unless the military
hands over power to Fr Aristide by then. The army leaders, who have refused
to honour earlier agreements for his return, feel the US and other countries
advocating tougher sanctions will lose heart if the new measures do not
work, and will end their support for the exiled president.
The military rulers' apparent confidence in riding out sanctions is also
based on the uncertain situation at Haiti's border with the Dominican
Republic, which has been a loophole in earlier efforts to impose an economic
blockade.
Despite repeated public commitments to increase military patrols at the
border to curb smuggling, mainly of fuel, President Joaqun Balaguer of the
Dominican Republic is against tougher sanctions.

   PANAMA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A millionaire businessman from a discredited party which was the political
instrument of two military dictators has won a narrow victory in the
Panamanian presidential election, considered the country's cleanest for a
quarter of a century.
Mr Ernesto Perez Balladares, 47, of the Democratic Revolutionary party, won
33 per cent of the vote on Sunday, four points clear of Mrs Mireya Moscoso
de Gruber, of the governing Arnulfista party.
In third place was Mr Ruben Blades, a salsa singer and Hollywood actor with
a Harvard law degree, who had been expected to come second.
Mr Perez Balladares's victory confirms the remarkable resurrection of the
PRD, which was thrown out of power by the US invasion at the end of 1989 to
oust the strongman General Manuel Noriega.
Party officials who went into hiding or were arrested by the invaders will
return to government. Gen Noriega himself is serving a 40-year sentence in
the US for drugs offences.
'Now we will begin to build together the future of the nation, without party
political differences,' Mr Perez Balladares declared in a victory speech on
Sunday night. In Congress, the PRD is expected to fall well short of a
majority after the congressional election on Sunday.
In his campaign, he played on memories of the party's founder, the late Gen
Omar Torrijos, who is fondly recalled by many poor Panamanians for his
populist social policies and for negotiating a 1977 treaty with the US for
Panama to take back the Panama Canal.
The victor promised to create jobs and increase social spending to alleviate
conditions for the poor. But the bulky former banker with Citibank has said
he would honour Panama's foreign debt obligations, maintain tight fiscal
policies, and attempt to attract foreign investment so as to improve
infrastructure.
His government, which is to take office on September 1, will oversee the
handover from the US, by 2000, of 34,000 hectares of prime real estate in
the Canal Zone. It is unclear what it plans to do with the area, estimated
to be worth several times Panama's GDP of Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn).
Many analysts speak well of Mr Perez Balladares but the prospect of the
return to government of certain characters, known as the 'herd', has raised
concern. 'All those nasty creatures are going to come out of the woodwork
and ask for a place in the sun,' said Mr Victor Bulmer-Thomas, director of
London University's Institute of Latin American Studies, who was observing
the election.

Bolivia's trade union confederation emerged strengthened at the weekend
after a 23-day public sector strike which forced the government of President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to concede above-inflation pay increases, John
Barham reports from Buenos Aires.
The COB labour confederation mobilised Bolivia's largest protest movement in
recent years and won pay rises of 6-12 per cent for public sector employees.
Even so, public sector wages remain very low. Teachers, for instance, earn
the equivalent of Dollars 90-Dollars 200 (Pounds 60-Pounds 134) a month.
Bolivia's unions hold strikes almost every year as the government prepares
its annual budget and negotiates a new minimum wage. The strikes this year
were very bitter. Protesters blocked roads in the interior of the country
and demonstrated often in the capital, La Paz. Union leaders, headed by
three women from the teachers' union, went on hunger strike. Security forces
broke into COB headquarters to take them to hospital for force-feeding.
Mr Sanchez de Lozada, a US-educated millionaire businessman, was elected
last year and is committed to continue Bolivia's market-oriented reforms,
which he began as planning minister in 1985.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil will introduce a new currency, its fifth since 1986, on July 1 as the
final step of the government's latest effort to tackle inflation, now near
50 per cent a month.
President Itamar Franco yesterday confirmed the date for the switch to the
new currency, the real. However, several important details - for example,
future policy on the real's exchange rate with the US dollar - will not be
announced until next month.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, the new finance minister, said final decisions on
monetary and exchange rate policy were still being finalised. It is expected
the real will initially be backed by Brazil's more than Dollars 30bn (Pounds
20bn) of foreign exchange reserves.
Mr Ricupero said he and Mr Pedro Malan, central bank chairman, would also
examine how state and federal banks would be affected by the introduction of
the real. Several such banks rely on profits from high inflation to remain
solvent. There are fears that, before presidential and congressional
elections in October, the government will have to support these banks and
thus put tight monetary policy at risk.
The confirmation of the advent of the real provided a welcome lift for Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who resigned as finance minister in March to run
for the presidency. The success of the anti-inflation plan, which he
negotiated, is seen as very important to his campaign.
Opinion polls late last week show Mr Cardoso's support at 15 per cent, down
nearly five percentage points in the last month, against about 40 per cent
for Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-of-centre Workers' Party. Mr
Cardoso has been damaged by bickering with his election allies, the
right-wing Liberal Front, and by the choice as running-mate of a lesser
known senator, Mr Guilherme Palmeira.

<TEXT>
Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and President Elias Hrawi locked
horns yesterday over a planned government reshuffle, Reuter reports from
Beirut. The prime minister cancelled tomorrow's cabinet meeting, prior to
greeting hundreds of supporters who flocked to his Beirut home in a show of
solidarity.
Last week, the two agreed to strengthen Christian representation in the
cabinet but have since disagreed over the extent of the reshuffle and the
new names to be brought in.
Relations between the Syrian-backed government and the once-dominant
Christian minority have been tense recently. The proposed changes appeared
an attempt to improve them by bringing in more representative Christian
politicians.
Political observers said Mr Hariri wanted to bring four new ministers into
the 30-member cabinet - two heavyweight Maronite Christian politicians
representing influential Christian political parties, a Sunni Moslem and a
Shi'ite Moslem. He also wanted to swap several portfolios, including
interior, defence and information, among the present ministers. Mr Hrawi was
pressing for a broader reshuffle, amounting to a reduction in Mr Hariri's
supporters in the cabinet.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Palestinians put faith in arrival of policemen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RAFAH, GAZA STRIP
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of Palestinians waving their national flag and singing traditional
songs about the orange and olive groves in the land of Palestine lined roads
to the Egyptian border yesterday and waited in vain to give Palestinian
policemen a heroes' welcome.
The policemen, many of them former soldiers and veterans of wars with
Israel, are now expected to cross the border today. Their arrival is seen by
most Arabs as the first real change on the ground after the Palestinian
self-rule agreement for Gaza and Jericho, signed in Cairo last week. For
hundreds of people left waiting yesterday, the police presence marks the
beginning of the end of 27 years of Israeli occupation.
More than 100 policemen had been expected to cross the border before
nightfall and take over a former army base in Deir al-Balah. Another
contingent of 270 policemen is camped on the Jordanian border waiting to
cross into Jericho, the future seat of the Palestinian administration.
Eventually the Palestinian police force will number 9,000 men, 7,000 of them
from outside the occupied lands.
Donkey carts and cars draped with the Palestinian flag and pictures of Mr
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, choked the
road to the crossing. As the policemen were delayed frustration overtook the
festival spirit and Israeli police and soldiers fired rubber bullets,
percussion grenades and tear gas to push back unruly youths.
'The whole world is here watching you,' shouted one marshal in a camouflage
jacket. 'People are going to judge us by how we behave here. This is a
historic day for celebrating, not for throwing stones,' PLO officials urged
the crowd by loudspeaker.
But violence broke out across the Gaza Strip despite the officials' efforts.
At Neve Dekalim a Palestinian youth was killed when Jewish settlers opened
fire on Palestinians throwing stones. At least 10 Palestinians were wounded
by Israeli soldiers in other incidents. Young people, who remain suspicious
and hostile to Israel, clearly intend to taunt and harass departing Israeli
soldiers who are set to evacuate the Strip within days.
Israeli officials blamed the delay on the PLO ill-preparedness and said they
had wanted Mr Arafat to name his 24-member 'cabinet' before allowing police
into Gaza-Jericho. Palestinians said part of the delay was caused by
difficulties airlifting policemen from conflict-torn Yemen.
Older Palestinians, however, were less impatient. 'We have been waiting
years for this happy day; a few more hours won't hurt,' said Mr Abdel Malik
el-Masri, 42, a farmer. 'The policemen are our soldiers and they will bring
us safety and security and end the occupation. Things will start to change.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Civil war threatens Yemen oil industry: Companies are
disillusioned over prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Yemen's civil war, which has prompted the emergency evacuation of most
foreign oil company expatriates, threatens to deliver a serious blow to an
industry long seen as central to the country's economic prospects, oil
executives suggested yesterday.
As BP, Shell, Lasmo, Clyde, British Gas and other western oil groups
yesterday completed staff evacuation from Sanaa in the north and Aden in the
south, executives at many company headquarters said that, whatever the
outcome of the fighting, there was a growing disillusionment about oil
prospects in the country.
A large number of foreign countries entered into exploration contracts with
Yemen after its unification in 1990.
Optimism peaked two years ago, when more than 20 companies rushed to
conclude exploration deals. These were mostly in the south, after Canadian
Occidental discovered viable fields in the Masila area, the north-west
corner of former South Yemen.
CanOxy says it is now pumping 150,000 barrels a day from the area,
production which the company says will continue despite evacuation of its
staff.
CanOxy's find followed the discoveries in the mid-1980s by Hunt Oil, the
Dallas-based group, in North Yemen. Yemen Hunt Oil produces most of the rest
of Yemen's present output, about 320,000 b/d. It has also said production is
continuing.
Despite heady predictions from the government and some analysts that Yemen
might eventually be capable of producing 1m or even 2m b/d, Yemen's rugged
south has failed to deliver its apparent promise.
'There's been a very significant spate of drilling,' says the head of one
western oil group active there. 'But the results have been singularly
disappointing.'
Another oil company managing director said the war might prompt many
disappointed companies to pull out: 'It's now likely, particularly with this
setback, that Yemen will be left only with Hunt and CanOxy.'
At least two companies, who declioned to be named, said yesterday they
expected to close their operations before the end of this year, given their
disappointing results and the country's heightened political instability.
CanOxy, which is continuing to explore around Masila, has already scaled
down any expectations of further big finds. Shell, which has completed
drilling in its concession, would say only that it would 'need to look at
where we go from here'.
Clyde, the UK-based oil company, said yesterday it had received 'some
encouragement' from early drilling in its Masila concession and had no
intention of leaving.
Nevertheless, diminished prospects for Yemeni oil are a serious blow to
whatever political arrangement arises from the fighting in the Arabian
Peninsula's poorest and most populous land.
It perhaps most seriously undermines the economic hand of Mr Ali Salem
al-Beidh, the embattled southern leader, who would have depended heavily on
oil to support any form of greater economic independence for the south.
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday sacked Prime Minister Haidar
Abu Bakr al-Attas and named a new defence minister in further measures
against rival southern members in Yemen's cabinet, Reuter adds from Sanaa.
Mr Saleh named Mohammad al-Attar, industry minister, as acting prime
minister and Brig Abed Rabu Hadi as defence minister.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Mounting arrears weigh down African bank: Debts from broken
countries compel cut in lending for third year and tougher sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mounting arrears from borrowing countries and the need to make greater
provisions against loan defaults reduced the African Development Bank's net
income by 31 per cent last year to Dollars 112m.
The AfDB's financial results, presented yesterday at the bank's annual
general meeting in Nairobi, are only marginally healthier than the sickly
continent it was set up to help. Arrears owed to the bank and the African
Development Fund, its soft loan arm, rose to Dollars 700m in 1993, against
disbursed and outstanding loans of Dollars 8.4bn.
Most of the arrears are chronic debts from broken countries like Zaire,
Liberia and Somalia.
Others are from AfDB members who are sinking deeper into poverty. Excluding
South Africa, the continent's gross domestic product grew by only 1.4 per
cent in 1993, less than half the rise in population.
To keep its international credit rating, the AfDB cut lending for the third
year running and began to apply tougher sanctions against defaulters. As a
result, Gabon and Kenya have brought their interest payments up to date,
while the Cameroon, which is Dollars 95m in arrears, is negotiating an
assistance package from the IMF and Paris Club which will allow it to clear
its outstanding debts with the AfDB.
Bank governors say they are concerned with two main issues: how to deal with
the mounting arrears and the serious managerial and policy shortcomings
which plague the bank. In addition, some governors have begun to question
the bank's continued ability to provide long-term development finance when
most of its clients can no longer afford its commercial lending terms.
'The arrears have piled up in part because the bank continued to lend on
hard terms to countries which had no creditworthiness,' says Mr Eberhard
Kurth, Germany's representative on the board of governors. 'We are telling
the bank that Germany's future support will depend on better lending
policies and increased efficiency.'
Africa's growing impoverishment is placing greater demands on the African
Development Fund. But its coffers are empty. Industrial countries, which own
one third of the AfDB and donate funds every three years to the bank's
concessional window, are refusing to replenish the ADF until the bank
streamlines its bureaucracy and tightens its lending policies.
Governors came to the Nairobi meeting armed with a damaging confidential
report of external consultants that depicted the bank as a chaotic,
top-heavy institution with little control over its lending projects.
'We have had too many promises of reform in the past,' Mr Kurth says. 'This
time we are seeking legal safeguards which will tie the release of
concessionary funds to improvements in the bank's governance and lending
policies.'
US Treasury officials taking part in the replenishment negotiations say it
is unlikely that new funds will match the Dollars 3.4bn pledged three years'
ago, in spite of Africa's increased need for concessionary finance. With
luck, they believe donors might pledge Dollars 2bn by the end of the week.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Japan trade surplus 'may be peaking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's current account surplus, the source of friction in relations with
the US, could be peaking, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The surplus fell 16.1 per cent during March in both dollar terms compared
with the same month last year. In addition, both the current account and
trade surpluses declined in yen terms during the 1993 financial year, the
first drop in three years, according to figures published by the ministry
yesterday.
'Judging from various indices, Japan's current account surplus appears to be
peaking out now,' ministry officials said. The country's current-account
surplus in yen terms was expected to continue to decline.
'The downward trend is obvious in yen terms, and seems to hold true even in
dollar terms, if figures are compared on a quarterly basis, as opposed to a
monthly basis, which is more susceptible to fluctuation.' But the officials
warned that the politically-charged dollar figure was dependent on exchange
rates and the price of oil which has been rising in recent weeks.
The forecasts and figures will provide some relief in the struggle between
Tokyo and Washington over Japan's surplus. This climbed to another record
during the 1993 financial year to March, when it increased from Dollars
125.9bn (Pounds 59bn) in 1992 to Dollars 130bn.
Tokyo has come under sustained pressure from Washington to boost its
domestic economy and deregulate to generate increased imports. Exports last
year rose 6.1 per cent to Dollars 355bn, outstripping imports, which dropped
6.9 per cent to Dollars 213bn.
In yen terms, the current account surplus fell from a record Y15,600bn to
Y14,000bn, with exports down 8.2 per cent at Y38,300bn and imports down 7.6
per cent at Y22,900bn. During March, the year-on-year surplus fell 16.1 per
cent to Dollars 15.7bn, with exports up 5.3 per cent at Dollars 35.6bn and
imports up 10.3 per cent at Dollars 20.4bn.
The ministry also released details of Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus
during the first 20 days of April, which widened to Dollars 4.75bn from a
revised Dollars 4.61bn surplus in the same period a year earlier.
The continuing weakness of the US currency played an important role in the
rise, with the dollar at Y104.7 over the period, against Y115.9 12 months
previously.
Imports increased by 11.8 per cent to Dollars 15.26bn, while exports rose by
9.6 per cent to Dollars 20bn.

The confused military picture in Yemen's civil war was further darkened
yesterday by clouds of propaganda, with leaders in both north and south
claiming significant breakthroughs in battles concentrated around the
approaches to Aden, the southern capital.
Northern leaders claimed in Sanaa, North Yemen's capital, that their forces
were 'advancing on all fronts' and some units had reached Aden's Bar Saad
suburb, some 3 miles from the airport. The claims were dismissed in the
south, where spokesmen said they had 'totally destroyed' the northern
Amaliqa unit.
Independent assessments remained impossible, given the near-total
communications blackout. Western diplomats quoting reports from Sanaa said
the city was quiet, with no evidence of air or missile raids since those
launched by southern forces at the weekend.
Foreign governments continued to evacuate hundreds of expatriate workers,
with the French navy ferrying foreigners by warship from Aden to Djibouti. A
British Airways jet had landed at Sanaa airport to fly out 200 expatriates,
due at Gatwick airport last night.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Australia boosts business immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia is significantly to broaden its business immigration programme, in
the hope of attracting wealthier individuals prepared to invest in the
country.
Individuals will be asked to make a three-year investment of at least
ADollars 750,000 (Pounds 357,000), to be placed in government securities,
although applicants will still have to demonstrate 'business or investment
achievement' and pass a points test, in which age and English language
ability will be examined.
Temporary residents who have 'a record of substantial financial commitment
to their own business in Australia, and who have been actively involved in
its operation and management for at least one year, will have the
opportunity to remain in Australia permanently from 1995,' for example.
The new class was designed for business people who did not want to commit
themselves immediately to hands-on business activity in Australia as
previous rules had stipulated, Mr Nick Bolkus, immigration minister, said.
Immigration levels have been the subject of heated debate in Australia. One
school of thought argues that the additional supply of labour is detrimental
when the country is facing double-digit levels of unemployment. However, a
number of academic studies have suggested the additional demand within the
economy tends to offset this negative factor.
Yesterday, the opposition attacked the business skills changes as
questionable. 'This is nothing more than a buy-a-visa scheme to enable the
government to fund its budget deficit,' Senator Jim Short said. Total number
of permitted immigrants will rise by 10,000 to 86,000 for 1993-94.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Israel lifts prime rate half a point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Israel raised its prime interest rate 0.5 percentage points yesterday as the
central bank continued to try to damp prices to meet this year's 8 per cent
annual inflation target.
Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, sought to allay fears
among Israeli manufacturers and Finance Ministry officials worried about the
impact on sales and economic growth from interest rate rises.
'This is a moderate change,' Mr Frenkel said.
Yesterday's increase, the second this year, raises the Bank of Israel
lending rate to commercial banks from 10.5 to 11 per cent. Mr Frenkel said
the adjustment was necessary to tighten monetary policy after the bank
assessed that inflation was 10 per cent on an annualised basis
Mr Frenkel blamed housing prices, increasing at 20 per cent a year, for the
government's problems with inflation. 'Privatisation of government land and
changing the designation of land to allow more residential building will
help. But the policy is not yet fully implemented and the fight against
inflation cannot wait.'
He would 'not hesitate' to increase interest rates further if necessary,
despite opposition from the Manufacturers' Association and Finance Ministry.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Memory fails Bond in asset hearings: The court questioning
of a bankrupt Australian tycoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past week Alan Bond has sat in a packed Sydney courtroom facing a
barrage of questions about the whereabouts of his former assets. The
questions have come from the former tycoon's bankruptcy trustee, appointed
by the court to act on behalf of his creditors, and from the liquidator of
Dallhold Investments, Mr Bond's privately-owned investment holding company.
These are the hearings which the Perth-based entrepreneur had long sought to
avoid, saying that illness, depression and brain damage resulting from
open-heart surgery rendered him unfit to take the stand. Now that he is
under oath in the witness-box in terms of Australia's bankruptcy procedures,
his performance has ranged from that of a sorrowful amnesiac to a feisty
barracker.
Starting with a one-man painting company, Mr Bond built an international
media, brewing and property business led by Bond Corporation Holdings, a
quoted flagship with assets of about ADollars 10bn (Pounds 4.8bn).
It all began to fall apart with the stock market crash of 1987 and ended in
bankruptcy in 1992 with debts and contingent liabilities of more than
ADollars 700m.
The main contention of Mr Francis Douglas QC, acting for the bankruptcy
trustee, is that a series of companies or trusts were set up in the Channel
Islands during the 1970s and 1980s to hold Mr Bond's personal assets, but
that these were never declared in the statement of affairs when Mr Bond went
bankrupt in 1992. The names of the entities included Kirk Holdings, Icarus
Trust, Engetal, Piaonla, Bittern, Lindsay Trading, and Panamanian-registered
Juno Equities, which supposedly operates out of Switzerland.
According to the trustee, Kirk Holdings was used to buy property in the UK,
paintings from Neville Keating Pictures, art consultants of London, shares
(including shares in Bond Corporation) and horses for Mr Bond's daughter,
Suzanne. According to Mr Douglas, it eventually became too well-known as a
'Bond company' after Suzanne's divorce proceedings in 1987 and was wound up,
its assets being transferred to Juno.
Mr Douglas has produced enough paper work to suggest that Kirk Holdings was
dealing in large sums. In late 1986, for example, Kirk allegedly instructed
Touche Ross's Jersey office, via Allied Irish Bank, to transfer USDollars
2.75m (Pounds 1.88m) to Mr Bond's account at Arbuthnot Latham, the London
merchant bank. In early 1987, Dollars 541,700 went to James Capel, to buy
shares on behalf of Kirk, Mr Douglas said.
The trustee's problem is that Mr Bond says he cannot recall anything about
most of these entities. He cannot remember Touche Ross in Jersey, which
organised and administered the offshore companies. He thinks he might have
been to Jersey once, but only to the airport, to sign some papers.
Where evidence to the contrary has been presented - for example, bank
payments or letters signed by Mr Bond - he has modified his response.
Without admitting any knowledge of the Channel Islands vehicles, he has
tended to suggest that they must have been related to other entities in the
complex Bond group.
When Mr Douglas produced a deposition (the result of a question-and-answer
session with lawyers) from Mr Geoff Davies, in which the Touche Ross partner
said that he believed Kirk was for the ultimate benefit of Mr Bond, his wife
and his family, Mr Bond said simply that he had never dealt with Mr Davies.
Mr Bond has also insisted that certain assets which the bankruptcy trustee
believes were the former tycoon's, belong (or belonged) to Mr Jurg Bollag.
Mr Bollag, Mr Bond acknowledges, is a Swiss businessman and friend, who was
one of the four people permitted to give instructions to Touche Ross on Mr
Bond's behalf. He has also helped pay Mr Bond's legal fees.
Included in the Bollag category of assets was a house in Chelsea, in which
Mr Bond's son lived for several years, and which was sold last year for
Pounds 610,000, and a London apartment sub-leased to Diana Bliss, Mr Bond's
former girlfriend.
Mr Douglas asked. 'Was there any reason why Diana Bliss should be able to
persuade Mr Bollag to buy and sub-lease' a property? 'I don't recall. I
don't think we were seeing each other at the time. She met Mr Bollag
separately,' Mr Bond replied.
But while the hearings have constituted a public forum for the discovery
work done by the trustee, and will, perhaps, persuade creditors that efforts
are still being made on their behalf, what happens now is not clear.
Pursuit of more information, via Mr Bollag in Switzerland, is a possibility
and a task which the trustee has begun. But it will be time-consuming. And
even if the trustee's suppositions are correct, there is little guarantee
that assets will be sitting in a Swiss bank waiting to be returned.
Meanwhile, hearings on behalf of the liquidator of Dallhold, which began
late yesterday morning were adjourned after Mr Bond reported dizzy spells
and pains in the chest.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Laurie Connell found guilty of conspiracy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Laurie Connell, the West Australian businessman and former head of
Rothwells bank, which backed a number of the nation's 'entrepreneurs' in the
1980s, was yesterday found guilty of conspiracy to pervert the course of
justice. The jury in the Perth district court acquitted Mr Connell of
another count of conspiring to fix the 1983 Bunbury Cup, a regional horse
race run about 140 miles south of Perth.
But they decided Mr Connell was behind payments worth more than ADollars
500,000 (Pounds 238,000) to Mr Danny Hobby, the former jockey who was riding
one of the favourites in the race but allegedly jumped from the saddle
before the race ended. Mr Hobby left the country and the payments were
supposedly made to him to stay out of Australia and the reach of police for
nine years.
The verdict came after a 106-day trial, and evidence from more than 100
witnesses. The jury deliberated more than 35 hours over six days before
reaching its verdict. Sentence will be passed tomorrow; the maximum penalty
for the charge on which Mr Connell has been found guilty is seven years'
jail.
Lawyers for the businessman said he would appeal, adding they believed the
jury, which returned a unanimous decision, had reached a compromise to
release themselves from further deliberation. 'I have a suspicion in my mind
that the jury had spent so long in deliberation that they had to find a way
out,' Mr Alec Shand, QC, acting for Mr Connell, said.
Mr Connell, now 48, is the son of an Irish bus driver and the great-grandson
of West Australia's longest-serving police commissioner. He became a
prominent figure in the 1980s, when he was an important business contact of
Mr Brian Burke, then Western Australia's Labor premier, and a close
associate of Mr Alan Bond, the Perth-based former tycoon.
In its heyday, Rothwells, Mr Connell's merchant bank, presented itself as an
aggressive financial institution. He became known as 'Last-Resort Laurie'
for taking on clients others were reluctant to deal with.
But the bank proved heavily borrowed and ran into difficulties immediately
after the 1987 stock market crash. Mr Bond tried to organise a rescue
package, with backing from businessmen such as Mr Kerry Packer, Mr Robert
Holmes a Court, Mr John Elliott, and Mr Brian Yuill. But the effort was
doomed and Rothwells was liquidated in 1988. Five years ago, Mr Connell was
charged with a series of Rothwells-related matters, due to be heard in a
Perth court later this year.
Mr Connell won fame for making the biggest bet in Australasian history,
winning ADollars 3m after backing the winners in the Melbourne and Caulfield
Cups.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Yeltsin upset over Berlin farewell plan

<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the west not to humiliate
Russia after a row blew up in Germany over plans to exclude Russian troops
from a farewell parade of Allied forces from Berlin.
American, British and French troops are due to mark the departure from
Berlin with celebrations organised by the city authorities on June 18,
nearly 50 years after Berlin surrendered to the Red Army.
But the Russians have been told they cannot take part. And Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has excluded them from the federal government's send-off, to be held in
Berlin on September 8.
The German government and western allies have agreed on separate ceremonies
on the grounds that the role of the Russian troops as an occupying force was
very different from that of the west.
The planned farewell celebrations will be discussed by Mr Kohl and Mr
Yeltsin, who arrives in Germany tomorrow for an official visit, and final
details are due to be settled this week.
Russia has been offered two civilian ceremonies in Berlin and in the
southern city of Weimar on August 31, which Mr Yeltsin will attend.
Moscow has made clear however that it sees plans for a separate send-off as
shabby treatment.
Mr Yeltsin, reflecting hurt national pride, said yesterday during Victory
Day celebrations in Moscow: 'It is important to remember just one thing.
'Russia must always be addressed in a tone of respect because our people
will never accept anything else from any country, such is the will and
testament of those who died defending the honour and independence of our
Motherland.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Bulgarian capitalism boosts ex-communists: Virginia Marsh on
an emerging private sector dominated by the bright young officers of the
'perestroika' years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Bulgaria's transition to a market economy - as in other former east bloc
countries - it is former senior communists and secret police officers who
have been among the quickest to embrace capitalism.
'There is little doubt that communist capital is behind many of the leading
entrepreneurs one sees in Bulgaria today,' says a western observer. 'They
will tell you they founded their media empire with two typewriters in a
one-room office. What they don't tell you is that the next week they somehow
managed to raise a couple of million dollars.'
Many of the self-styled 'Group of 13', the name given to the business lobby
recently founded by the country's largest private companies, started
business this way. Between them, the G-13 control a large part of the
country's emerging private sector. Their empires include banks, insurance
companies, stock exchanges, large trading and financial companies, real
estate developments, television channels, and newspapers. Some G-13
companies already have annual turnovers of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds
685m).
Several G-13 executives were among those sent abroad in Bulgaria's
'perestroika years' of the 1980s by the Bulgarian Intelligence Service, the
former regime's secret police. Bright young officers were sent to top
business schools in Europe and the US or to work in foreign trade companies
which were often used as conduits for Communist party slush funds.
The BIS aimed to step up its industrial espionage activities through a
network ranging from Liechtenstein, Austria and Switzerland to Silicon
Valley in the US. These included the diversion of embargoed high technology
equipment and information to the then east bloc.
Once communism collapsed, former BIS employees with a foreign education and
contacts, and alleged access to the regime's foreign bank accounts, were in
a prime position to go into private business.
The G-13's kingpin is Mr Ivan Pavlov, head of Multi-Group, considered the
most powerful of the G-13 companies. A former professional wrestler, Mr
Pavlov married the daughter of the head of military counter-intelligence and
worked with deposed dictator Todor Zhivkov's son-in-law as an art dealer in
the 1980s, before moving to Malta. There he traded scrap Soviet submarines
with, he says, Turkish financing.
Once back in Bulgaria he expanded into metal and oil trading,
agro-businesses and providing security services. Multi-Group now employs
3,500 in 50 local companies including a bank, insurance company, the
country's most active stock exchange and a sugar plant recently purchased
from the state in one of the country's biggest privatisation deals to date.
Mr Pavlov is also believed to control nine casinos, seven in Bulgaria and
two in Paraguay. Until recently, one of Multi-Group's 'consultants' was Mr
Emil Doynov, a former business associate of the late British publisher
Robert Maxwell and brother of Oguyan Doynov, a senior communist-era
minister. The Doynov brothers are widely held to be behind Multi-Group.
Many think Multi-Group and other similar G-13 companies operate on the
fringes of the law, gaining positions through their contacts in political
circles and in the state enterprise sector, which still accounts for 90 per
cent of industrial production.
One well-used scam is for privately-owned trading companies to over-charge
state companies for raw materials or buy products cheaply and sell them on
with a big mark-up. Another is for companies to operate through offshore
subsidiaries to avoid local regulations and to qualify for tax and other
benefits reserved for foreign investors.
The government is belatedly taking steps to crack down on fraud and to
strengthen tax administration after a 50 per cent shortfall in expected
revenues last year. However, Mr Dimitar Kostov, the deputy finance minister,
says: 'There are suggestions that not all the methods used by G-13 companies
are legal. We do not have facts that they are avoiding tax. Rather, they are
finding legally-based incentives.'
He also denies the G-13 are as powerful or as dangerous as they are made out
to be. But many in business and diplomatic circles fear their activities set
a bad precedent in a country which is already lagging behind in implementing
reform and where many are ambivalent about the transition to a market
economy. There is also concern that G-13 companies, which, fearing foreign
competition, have started a campaign to protect 'national capital', are
prepared to sabotage efforts by foreign companies to participate in
privatisation or invest in Bulgaria.
A western banker in Sofia says: 'These companies have the power to poison
the scene, the ability to buy politicians. There is clearly a need for
regulation before it is too late. Today these guys work in broad daylight;
in five years' time it will be much more difficult to trace their tracks and
connections.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Estonian protest at 'invasion threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Juri Luik, the Estonian foreign minister, yesterday accused Russia of
threatening to invade his country by issuing veiled warnings that the former
Soviet garrison in the Baltic republic might be reinforced.
Speaking at a meeting of the Western European Union (WEU) in Luxembourg, he
called the Russian statements 'unacceptable if not ludicrous' and said they
should be denounced by the international community as open intimidation.
He was referring to a statement last Friday by General Pavel Grachev, the
Russian defence minister, that Moscow could 'provide reliable security' for
its bases in Estonia if political circumstances changed.
Estonia was one of nine nations from the former eastern bloc admitted
yesterday as 'associate partners' in the WEU, the loosely-knit defence
grouping which is gradually acquiring strength.
The new status will give the ex-communist countries consultation rights at
the WEU but no defence guarantees. It marks an important step for the
European Union as it tries to strengthen its political and military ties
with eastern Europe and the Baltic states without alienating Russia.
All six states - including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia,
Bulgaria and Romania - as well as the Baltic trio are being treated as
future EU members.
Talks between Russia and Estonia about withdrawing the 2,600-strong garrison
broke down last week and Moscow said it would not name a date for renewing
them until the Baltic republic came up with more 'constructive' proposals.
The main sticking point has been the rights of 'retired' Russian officers in
Estonia, seen by the Baltic republic as a potential cover for the retention
of a covert military and intelligence presence.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Hungary's left in poll uprising: Only the liberals can
prevent a landslide by ex-communists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungarian liberals yesterday began an uphill battle to stop the former
communists translating their victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections
into a landslide in the second and decisive round of voting on May 29.
With 32.5 per cent of the vote, the Hungarian Socialist party, the successor
to the communist regime, won 55 seats, took the lead in a further 158 and
came within reach of an outright majority in Hungary's 386-seat parliament.
The Hungarian elections establish as a firm trend the resurgence of former
communists in the region on a tide of public disillusionment with the pain
of economic transition. Socialists are back in power in Poland and Lithuania
and only in the Czech Republic have the ruling conservatives maintained
their popularity.
The Socialist surge came at the expense of the governing conservatives.
Voters, bitter at the decline in their living standards, gave the Hungarian
Democratic Forum only 12 per cent of the vote. But the liberal Alliance of
Free Democrats, whose 19.4 per cent of the vote put it in second place,
called on voters yesterday to switch to it in the run-off election later
this month to avert a Socialist political monopoly.
A Free Democrat comeback would deny the Socialists an outright majority and
make the most likely outcome of the election a coalition between the two
parties. As in Poland, the Hungarian ex-communists may offer the premiership
to the leader of their smaller coalition partner, the Free Democrats', Mr
Gabor Kuncze.
Hungary's stock market had discounted a strong Socialist showing in the
elections but the prospect of an outright majority for the former communists
caused consternation. Only one transaction took place in the first 45
minutes of trading yesterday. But when activity did begin there were few
price movements and the BSE index closed down just 1.56 on 1619.22.
Compensation coupons, the vouchers issued by the conservative government to
owners of property confiscated by the former communist regime, fell to an
all-time low of 49.5 per cent before recovering slightly.
These special securities can be used to buy state property, and while the
Socialists have said they will continue with this privatisation programme,
the market doubts they will be as generous as the current government in
offering state companies for coupons.
A public offering for compensation coupons of shares in Danubius Hotels, one
of Hungary's three large hotel chains, was massively oversubscribed as
investors sought to reduce their holdings of the securities.
Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the former and likely future Socialist finance minister,
also said in an interview that he would immediately halt the small
shareholder programme, a Hungarian variant of mass privatisation which
allows small investors to pay for public issues on an instalment basis.
But Mr Bekesi, who represents the strong technocratic wing of the party,
reaffirmed the Socialists' overall commitment to privatisation. He indeed
suggested he would open the economy further to foreign investors, who have
already injected more than Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) into Hungary in the
last five years.

Talks between Russia and Estonia about withdrawing the 2,600-strong garrison
broke down last week and Moscow said it would not name a date for renewing
them until the Baltic republic came up with more 'constructive' proposals.
Earlier, the two sides had agreed in principle on a withdrawal date of
August 31. Estonia says a formal agreement was ready to sign at the end of
March, but Russia unexpectedly started reopening old questions.
The main sticking point has been the rights of 'retired' Russian officers in
Estonia, seen by the Baltic republic as a potential cover for the retention
of a covert military and intelligence presence.
According to Estonian estimates, the 10,600 residents of the republic who
draw Russian military pensions include 1,000 people under the age of 50, and
360 who are below 45. Among the latter group are paratroopers and
counterintelligence officers in their 30s.
Estonia insists it will not follow the example of Latvia, which secured a
troop withdrawal deal by passing up the right to vet the military pensioners
on its soil and granting Russia access to an important radar station.
Tallinn is resisting new Russian demands for the retention till the year
2000 of 200 military personnel at the sensitive naval and nuclear reactor
base of Paldiski.
The three Baltic republics have set up a joint peace-keeping battalion which
uses English as a working language and is receiving help from Britain. Other
providers of military knowhow to the region include Sweden and Finland,
which yesterday backed away from their traditional neutrality and joined the
'Partnership for Peace' devised by Nato.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Greek inflation edges to 10.4%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's annual inflation rate rose to 10.4 per cent in April from 10.2 per
cent the previous month, according to figures released yesterday by the
national statistical service. Monthly consumer prices were up by 1.5 per
cent, the result of a new tax on heating fuel and higher food prices. Rises
in household rents and petrol prices also contributed to the rise. Last
month's rise reverses a year-long trend that has seen inflation fall
steadily from a peak of 16.4 per cent in March 1993. However, Greece's
inflation rate is still more than three times the EU average. The
government, hoping to meet the target of single-digit inflation by the third
quarter of 1994, has avoided price rises for electricity and transport,
despite pressure from public utilities. Kerin Hope, Athens
West German insolvencies rose by 29.7 per cent in February from a year
earlier to 1,710 cases, the Federal Statistics Office said. The total
included 1,283 insolvent companies, up 32.0 per cent. In the first two
months of 1994, west German insolvencies totalled 3,267, up 24.4 per cent,
of which 2,418 were companies, up 27.5 per cent.
The number of insolvencies in Austrian companies rose sharply in 1993 to
5,082 from 3,658 in 1992, the Austrian credit-watch agency
Kreditschutzverband von 1870 (KSV) said. Outstanding liabilities in the
insolvencies rose to Sch32.2bn (Pounds 1.82bn) from Sch23.6bn.
Croatia is reviving the kuna, the currency used by the Nazi puppet regime of
the second world war. It will replace the dinar, inherited from Croatia's
days in the old Yugoslav federation, from May 30 - Croatian Statehood Day.

airliners, carried 1.4m passengers last year, 10 per cent more than in 1992.
Last year the airline reported a modest Zloty 42bn (Dollars 1.82m) net

French prime minister Edouard Balladur has agreed to early reform of local
government finance after his interior minister, Mr Charles Pasqua,
threatened to resign if he did not. Mr Balladur had wanted to delay, until
after the presidential election in a year's time, action on an issue that
divides the two components of his coalition government  - the UDF
centre-right, which believes in regional autonomy, and the RPR Gaullists,
who believe in a more centralised state.
But Mr Pasqua, the RPR interior minister, has championed the need for
France's central government to step in to reduce growing regional fiscal
disparities over the past decade, and as one of the most popular and
populist ministers he was strongly placed to insist.

President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was last night reported to be holding up
confirmation of Italy's 53rd post-war cabinet headed by media magnate turned
politician Silvio Berlusconi. The president was said to be holding
reservations over the compromise arrangement worked out for two key posts,
interior and justice. This had been agreed by Mr Berlusconi earlier in the
day with his two main allies in the Freedom Alliance - the populist Northern
League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr
Gianfranco Fini. Mr Berlusconi had to allow the League's number two to take
the Interior Ministry on the basis that the Justice Ministry was earmarked
for Mr Cesare Previti, a newly elected senator for Forza Italia and Mr
Berlusconi's principal lawyer. President Scalfaro has previously been
critical of the interior portfolio going to the League, which is rooted
solely in the north and has strong federalist demands.

<TEXT>
Germany will tomorrow consider a unilateral move to ban the import of
British beef because of public concern over 'mad cow disease', in defiance
of the European Commission and the rest of the European Union.
A draft regulation to control beef imports will be submitted to the German
cabinet by Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, on the grounds that a
form of the disease - bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) - may possibly
be communicated to humans. The German government is pressing ahead with the
ban, in spite of warnings from Brussels that it will face injunctions and
legal action in the European Court of Justice. Its own experts have also
expressed doubt that any unilateral ban can be effectively enforced because
of the EU's open borders. But health ministry officials insisted yesterday
that the measure will be enacted and can be put into effect.
In London, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the British agriculture minister, said a
unilateral ban on British beef by Germany would be unjustifiable and illegal
under the Treaty of Rome. Britain would take court action if necessary
against Germany for creating an unfair trade barrier, but it looked to the
European Commission to take action in the first instance, she said. Mr
Dieter Vogel, for the German government, said yesterday: 'We have always
said we would prefer to find a common solution for this BSE problem. If that
is not possible, then we have to find a unilateral solution. It may be that
the cabinet will decide on this on Wednesday.
'We are not in favour of unilateral solutions, but in the worst case we will
have to find one.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Greek minister says poll crucial - Questions on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Theodore Pangalos, 56, Greece's European affairs minister, presiding over
the EU's foreign ministers council until June. A former lecturer in
development economics at Paris university, he has practised law and edited a
left-wing journal in Athens. How important are the elections? 'They are a
fundamental test of the European public's interest in European unification.
They are the first elections allowing European citizens to participate
whatever their place of residence.'
Should the parliament be given greater powers? 'The parliament will actively
participate in preparing the 1996 conference to reform EU institutions. We
should aim for an increased role for the only directly elected body for
European citizens.'
What should be the EU's priorities in the next few years? 'Employment and
migration flows will be the main economic and social problems for the next
decade. If we don't answer these two challenges positively, we will have a
serious political and social crisis.'
Should the EU give priority to deepening integration among the 12, or to
widening it towards eastern Europe? 'The enlargement to 16 has almost
entirely exhausted the limits of the EU's capacity to absorb new members.
Two small countries like Cyprus and Malta could start negotiations in the
immediate future. Further enlargement will entail radical reform of EU
structures.'
Are you worried that German unification and an eastwards shift in the EU's
centre of gravity could harm Greece's interests? ''Germanisation' of the
Union can be an irrational anxiety. Strengthening the EU is the best way to
avoid such dangers. Loose co-operation limited to economic or commercial
interests could produce or increase domination.'
Will assistance for poorer EU states eventually have to be cut? 'What you
call 'assistance' is structural action aimed at increasing social and
regional cohesion and helping recovery. 'Such action is essential if we want
more than a simple free trade zone.'
Is the aim of economic and monetary union by 1999 still practicable? 'The
Maastricht treaty provides the route to Emu. Some countries might not
satisfy the criteria in 1999, and Greece might be one of them. Such
countries will have to wait and make further efforts. The world will not end
in 1999.'

FT  10 MAY 94 / Gonzalez turns to party outcasts: Troubled times bring
deputy prime minister Alfonso Guerra in from the cold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The left wing of Spain's ruling Socialist party, headed by the astute deputy
party leader Mr Alfonso Guerra, has come to the aid of the scandal-hit
government after enduring months of ostracism in the wake of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez's narrow electoral win for a fourth term a year ago.
Mr Guerra personally signalled his support for the prime minister just as
the credibility of Mr Gonzalez was dealt another blow yesterday when Judge
Baltasar Garzon, the best known magistrate in the country, announced he was
resigning his Socialist seat in parliament because Mr Gonzalez was not doing
enough to curb corruption.
Mixing both sorrow and anger in his resignation statement, Judge Garzon said
he had been promised support and responsibilities to combat corruption but
that neither had materialised. An independent who was personally co-opted by
the prime minister to stand on the Socialist ticket in last June's election,
Judge Garzon bitterly said he had been used 'as an electoral ploy'. The
prime minister was, meanwhile, seeking a candidate for the key job of
Socialist parliamentary leader to replace Mr Carlos Solchaga, a former
finance minister and the most prominent of the party's free marketeers, who
resigned from the job at the end of last week. Mr Solchaga had cleared left
wingers from many positions of influence in the parliament last year but his
successor now is likely to have to be a figure acceptable to Mr Guerra. The
drive towards consensus, following the departure of Judge Garzon and of Mr
Solchaga, both of whom were equally controversial in the eyes of the deputy
prime minister's supporters in the party apparatus, effectively means the
return to the political centre stage of the guerrista faction.
The comeback of Mr Guerra's supporters emerged at the weekend in regional
Socialist party congresses that were held in Madrid and in the Aragon. In
contrast to similar congresses in recent months that marked a guerrista
retreat, the left wing was able to negotiate a strong position at both
conventions. The chief victim of the spate of scandals that have rocked Mr
Gonzalez's government appears to be the renewal wing which backed the prime
minister in the last general elections and which now has most to lose as the
party faithful close ranks.
In a tell-tale sign that the pendulum has swung back, Mr Jose Mara Benegas,
a leading guerrista, has been entrusted with running the party's campaign in
the European elections next month. Mr Benegas is at the centre of an illicit
party funding scandal that is being investigated by a high court judge.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Bonn fears a low turn-out: Voter apathy could help the
extremists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of all Germany's main political parties are watching the outcome
of next month's European elections with considerable foreboding.
They fear that the general mood of political disaffection, compounded by a
widespread feeling that the European parliament lacks real power, will lead
to a low turn-out. That in turn would boost the chances of the extremist
parties, such as the far-right Republicans, of gaining the necessary 5 per
cent of the votes required to win seats.
In speech after speech across the country, both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Mr Rudolf Scharping, his Social Democratic challenger, urge their audiences
to go out and vote, to keep the extremists out.
The government's federal information office has joined forces with the
European parliament, the German Bundestag and the European Commission to
finance and launch a publicity campaign to encourage the maximum turn-out.
Every conceivable publicity gimmick, from a Roger Rabbit-like figure in a
cinema cartoon, through specially-printed telephone cards, to mobile vans
touring through towns and villages, has been roped in to galvanise the
electors.
And yet most political observers remain convinced that many voters will
either stay at home, or vote for protest parties, come June 12.
'People are saying they can vote again (at the general election) in
October,' says Dr Karl-Rudolf Korte, of the Germany research group at the
University of Mainz. 'There is so much bad feeling on so many domestic
political issues, I am sure people feel that this time they can let off
steam.'
His gloomy forecast is not entirely borne out by the latest opinion poll
(see table), which suggests a big swing back to the main 'establishment'
parties, and only a marginal 1 per cent voting for the far-right
Republicans. But no one quite trusts the polls.
Last time round, the Republicans won no less than 7.1 per cent of the
national vote, considerably better than the Free Democratic party (FDP), the
minority partner in the ruling coalition.
All the main parties have a big interest in reversing that trend, not least
by ensuring the largest possible turn-out overall.
Apart from overcoming apathy, the established parties share an obvious
problem in limiting the protest vote. All of them - Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union (CSU), Mr Scharping's Social Democratic party (SPD), and the FDP - are
more or less committed to the cause of European integration. The German
public, however, has been growing gradually more cautious, above all about
the process towards economic and monetary union, and the exchange of the
D-Mark for a single European currency.
Restrictions on the import of cheap bananas from central America have not
helped. Those who feel strongly enough about it have little alternative but
to vote for a protest party.
An extraordinary array of no fewer than 23 different groups has been given
the go-ahead to stand in the elections, ranging from the Progressive
Democrats (PDS), the former East German communist party on the left, to the
Republicans on the right.
There is also the Alliance of Free Citizens, founded by Mr Manfred Brunner,
once chef de cabinet to Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner
in Brussels, to mobilise the anti-Maastricht vote.
The best thing for the big parties will be if all these smaller ones pick up
a few votes, but none succeeds in crossing the 5 per cent threshold.
Mr Kohl, Mr Scharping, and Mr Klaus Kinkel of the FDP, are refusing to
panic. All have restated their pro-European commitment.
The CSU, on the other hand, has clearly shifted towards a more
Euro-sceptical stance, for fear that it will lose its seats in the European
parliament altogether.
It has to win around 40 per cent of the poll in Bavaria in order to gain 5
per cent of the national vote, and Bavaria is the home base for both the
Republicans and Mr Brunner. Mr Edmund Stoiber, the CSU strongman and
Bavarian prime minister, has expressed open doubts about the ambition of
creating a European 'federal state', and about the Maastricht timetable for
monetary union.
The other great unknown for the major parties is how the east Germans will
vote in their very first European election.
Germany will have 99 members of the 567 in the next Strasbourg parliament,
including 18 extra for the new east German states.
Most east Germans appear to regard the European Union with suspicion.
Their greatest concern is that it should be rapidly opened to include their
eastern neighbours - Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in particular -
to help them revive old trading ties.
It is an open question how their doubt will translate into votes.
The big parties have also signally failed to mobilise European, as opposed
to domestic, political themes.
Dr Korte cites the case of the European parliament's own campaign poster - a
scantily-clad Europa riding a sturdy bull through a flaming ring of European
stars, with a motto urging voters to the polls.
The poster was withdrawn after vehement protests from feminists, over its
lack of taste.
'As usual, there was no controversy about European policy. It was about
women's rights,' he said. 'Even the European parliament could only stir up a
domestic quarrel.'

<TEXT>
Greece's annual inflation rate rose to 10.4 per cent in April from 10.2 per
cent the previous month, according to figures released yesterday by the
national statistical service. Monthly consumer prices were up by 1.5 per
cent, the result of a new tax on heating fuel and higher food prices. Rises
in household rents and petrol prices also contributed to the rise. Last
month's rise reverses a year-long trend that has seen inflation fall
steadily from a peak of 16.4 per cent in March 1993. However, Greece's
inflation rate is still more than three times the EU average. The
government, hoping to meet the target of single-digit inflation by the third
quarter of 1994, has avoided price rises for electricity and transport,
despite pressure from public utilities. Kerin Hope, Athens
West German insolvencies rose by 29.7 per cent in February from a year
earlier to 1,710 cases, the Federal Statistics Office said. The total
included 1,283 insolvent companies, up 32.0 per cent. In the first two
months of 1994, west German insolvencies totalled 3,267, up 24.4 per cent,
of which 2,418 were companies, up 27.5 per cent.
The number of insolvencies in Austrian companies rose sharply in 1993 to
5,082 from 3,658 in 1992, the Austrian credit-watch agency
Kreditschutzverband von 1870 (KSV) said. Outstanding liabilities in the
insolvencies rose to Sch32.2bn (Pounds 1.82bn) from Sch23.6bn. Swedish Gross
Domestic Product growth was forecast at 1.8 per cent in 1994 and 2.5 per
cent in 1995 by the Swedish commercial banking group Svenska Handelsbanken.

The commander of United Nations troops in Gorazde said yesterday he believed
the Serbs still had heavy weapons within the 20km weapons exclusion zone
around the Bosnian Moslem town, in defiance of a Nato ultimatum. Lieutenant
Colonel David Santa-Olalla, the UN commander in Gorazde, said, 'I am quite
certain that there are still heavy weapons being held within the zone.' He
added that the Serbs still had between 100 and 150 police in the 3km zone.
UN officials say the police are in fact soldiers who have just changed their
uniforms. UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic had assured Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's head
of civil affairs, that the troops would pull out of the Moslem enclave but
nothing happened.
Croatia is reviving the kuna, the currency used by the Nazi puppet regime of
the second world war. It will replace the dinar, inherited from Croatia's
days in the old Yugoslav federation, from May 30 - Croatian Statehood Day.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was last night reported to be holding up
confirmation of Italy's 53rd post-war cabinet headed by media magnate turned
politician Silvio Berlusconi. The president was said to be holding
reservations over the compromise arrangement worked out for two key posts,
interior and justice. This had been agreed by Mr Berlusconi earlier in the
day with his two main allies in the Freedom Alliance - the populist Northern
League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr
Gianfranco Fini. Mr Berlusconi had to allow the League's number two to take
the Interior Ministry on the basis that the Justice Ministry was earmarked
for Mr Cesare Previti, a newly elected senator for Forza Italia and Mr
Berlusconi's principal lawyer.
President Scalfaro has previously been critical of the interior portfolio
going to the League, which is rooted solely in the north and has strong
federalist demands. He also was said to have been concerned that Mr Previti
was too close to Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire at a time when
magistrates are investigating it.
Matters were complicated over the week-end by the refusal of Mr Antonio Di
Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate, to take the post of
interior minister as an independent. The issue is expected to be clarified
today. If not,it will be almost impossible to fit into this week the
necessary confidence motions in the two houses.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Tory disarray grows over Europe: Major under pressure for
referendum on integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party was in turmoil last night as Mr John Major fought a
rearguard battle against intense pressure for a referendum on the next steps
towards European integration.
Amid a frantic round of factional meetings at Westminster, Downing Street
insisted that the prime minister remained opposed to a referendum, but
refused to rule out the idea.
Officials said there had been 'huge exaggeration and tremendous hyperbole'
in reports of divisions between cabinet ministers on the merits of a
referendum.
But senior ministers said Mr Major must end the impression of disarray by
making the government's position clear at prime minister's question time
today. The prime minister is expected to consult senior colleagues before
deciding how to respond to the growing demands from backbenchers for a
referendum.
Leading members of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs said that the
promise of a referendum in advance of any further integration was now the
only way to unify the party. The idea was also being pressed energetically
by leading Euro-sceptic MPs. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said a
referendum was 'inevitable'.
However, the Positive Europe group of Tory MPs decided not to support calls
for a referendum. Mr Ray Whitney, a leading pro-European, said the European
parliament elections on June 9 would be the 'real referendum'.
Friends of the prime minister believe that a referendum would be fraught
with political dangers for Mr Major because of his repeated insistence in
the Maastricht debates that only parliament was competent to decide the
issue.
The Conservative party opposed the referendums called by Labour - on Europe
in 1975 and on Scottish and Welsh parliaments in 1978 - on constitutional
grounds.
Senior cabinet ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, continue to argue that it would be wrong
for the Conservative party to call for a referendum.
Mr Major also has to judge whether the offer of a referendum would appease
the Euro-sceptics sufficiently to paper over the split until the vote.
One leading Euro-sceptic said that the offer of a referendum would
immediately be followed by campaigning to ensure that the result 'tied the
government's hands' in the European Union's intergovernmental conference
negotiations.
There was disagreement about the potential impact of a referendum
announcement on the European elections campaign.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, the right-wing MP for Brent North, said that a referendum
would unite the Conservatives in the vital run-up to the European elections.
But Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said there was no point in 'trying
to take people's minds away from the critical European elections'.
Mr Hunt's comments reflected deep unease about a pledge by Mr Paddy Ashdown,
Liberal Democrat leader, that his party would support a referendum on the
outcome of the 1996 IGC.
The announcement was seen as a significant blow to the Conservative campaign
for the European elections because it will weaken the party's attempts to
portray the Liberal Democrats as in thrall to Brussels.
But Conservative strategists hope that Mr John Smith, Labour leader, will be
unable to exploit the government's difficulties because of Labour's
opposition to a referendum during last year's Maastricht debate on European
Union.
Mr Smith sought to avoid the issue yesterday by claiming that the outcome of
the EU's 1996 IGC - the next review of the union's institutions - was too
far ahead to require a decision now.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Gas industry proposals raise price rise fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE, DEBORAH HARGREAVES and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday published its long-delayed gas industry
consultation paper outlining how full competition will be introduced to 18m
households by 1998, amid opposition charges that proposals would lead to
higher prices and a lower quality of service.
However, the report, prepared jointly by the industry regulator Ofgas and
the Department of Trade and Industry, attempts to allay fears about possible
price increases, saying price pressures which might emerge in the transition
to full competition could be limited by regulation.
The standing charge which household consumers pay will remain under a capped
formula at least until 1997. In addition British Gas tariffs are not
expected to 'increase by more than the rate of inflation' in the transition
period between April 1996, when 5 per cent of the market will be opened to
competition, and the full market opening two years later. The report
conceded, however, that regional prices could vary by plus or minus 2 to 4
per cent because of different transport costs.
Independent gas suppliers expressed disappointment that the document did not
go further in explaining how competition would be achieved. They are keen to
see the follow-up report, which will contain details of the costs of using
British Gas's pipelines system.
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, welcomed the report's
recommendation that 'the gas industry as a whole . . . should underpin the
special needs of the more vulnerable groups in society'. But he warned that
time was short for implementation of the programme. British Gas shares
closed yesterday at 285p, up 1 1/2 p.
The report also recommends that the Health and Safety Executive review the
safety aspects of deregulation. It makes clear that companies wanting to
compete with British Gas will have to provide extensive evidence of
financial strength. The report suggests British Gas might become the
supplier of last resort.
The report was due to be published in February. Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, said yesterday he would make 'no apology' for the delay. 'These
are complex issues which need to be thoroughly considered,' he said.
Government critics had charged that the document was being held up for
political reasons, and that implementation of the deregulation proposals
would lead to sharp price rises for less well-off gas consumers.
Mr Eggar dismissed such claims as 'rubbish', but Ms Clare Spottiswoode,
director general of Ofgas, said it was impossible to 'guarantee that prices
won't rise'.
The Labour party said the proposals, if implemented, would lead to higher
prices and a lower quality of service for many customers.
Ms Spottiswoode said she was confident that deregulation would deliver
benefits across a broad range of consumers, and not just to those which
consume large amounts of gas.

FT  10 MAY 94 / BBC to link with Pearson in world satellite TV project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC and Pearson, the media and entertainment group, are expected to
announce today that they have formed a worldwide strategic alliance to
develop satellite television channels and other joint ventures.
The grouping could be a growing challenge to international broadcasters such
as Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Mr Ted Turner's Cable News
Network.
The launch later this year will be a 24-hour BBC World Service Television
channel for Europe, but further channels for Europe and other continents,
particularly Asia, will follow.
The announcement precedes the white paper on the future of the corporation,
which has now been delayed until next month. This suggests that the BBC
argument that it should be able to expand internationally has been accepted.
The government will insist, however, that licence fee money should not be
used for commercial ventures and on transparent accounting.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is likely to provide a scale of
financial investment that the BBC is unable to provide. The corporation has
one of the largest news organisations in the world and an enormous programme
library, which it is keen to exploit.
Recently Pearson has made it clear that its future is as a broadly-based
media and entertainment group. It acquired Thames Television, the former
holder of the London weekday TV franchise, but pulled out of a potential
purchase of Star TV, the Asian satellite venture now controlled by Mr
Murdoch.
Under an agreement with Mr Murdoch, the BBC has already left the northern
beam of the Star system and is no longer available in Hong Kong and China.
It loses the right to broadcast its World Television channel on the southern
beam, which covers India, next year. A return to Asia in a joint venture
with Pearson is now likely.
Apart from areas such as news and documentaries, collaboration could include
education channels and language tuition.
It is believed that a separate company will be set up by the BBC to handle
any ventures with Pearson. The two groups will bring in other local partners
in different parts of the world.
The BBC has been looking for a significant commercial partner for some time
and considered a wide range of possible partners. But Pearson was seen as
the most complementary.
Neither senior BBC or Pearson executives could be reached for comment last
night.

FT  10 MAY 94 / US bonds fall on inflation worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and PHILIP GAWITH AND SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Long-term US interest rates rose to their highest levels for almost two
years yesterday as Wall Street expressed its disappointment that the Federal
Reserve had decided not to tighten monetary policy.
After last Friday's stronger-than-expected April employment report had
deepened concern on Wall Street that the US economy was growing too fast,
bond market investors were hoping the Fed would raise interest rates to
prevent a revival of inflation.
However, when the Fed failed to signal a rate increase during the morning,
bond prices quickly fell. In late trading in New York, the price of the
benchmark 30-year bond was down almost a full point, and its yield - the
best measure of long-term interest rates - had risen to 7.62 per cent, its
highest level since mid-1992. The rise in bond yields upset the stock
market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 40.46 at
3,629.04.
The European government bond markets opened on a weak note in response to
the decline in the US Treasury market on Friday afternoon, and spent most of
the day 'Fed-watching', as did the foreign exchanges.
With the Fed holding a Dollars 29bn (Pounds 19.8bn) quarterly refunding
auction over the next two days, there were expectations that it would lift
rates. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of global currency research at J P Morgan in
London, suggested that without such a move 'they will be faced with a
falling bond market and a collapsing currency, and that will not induce
foreigners to participate in the auction'.
In these circumstances, Mr Persaud predicted that the dollar would fall to
the levels at which central banks were forced last week to intervene.
Figures released in Japan yesterday gave encouragement to the dollar. The
unadjusted current account surplus for March fell 16.1 per cent to Dollars
15.76bn from Dollars 18.79bn a year earlier.
Figures also released revealed a long-term capital surplus of Dollars
21.92bn in March, the highest on record. This was the result of Japanese
companies selling US and European bonds before the March financial year-end,
and foreign buying of Japanese stocks.
Mr Persaud said the figures, which explain the strength of the yen, were a
one-off.

FT  10 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Pay revelations
raise eyebrows - Bernard Simon examines Canada's latest corporate governance
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 19th May 1994) appended to this article.
Canada's corporate gossip-mongers are having a field day. Since the
beginning of this year, they have been fed a juicy diet of proxy statements
which for the first time disclose the pay packets of the captains of
Canadian commerce and industry.
Barely a day goes by without the business press carrying a prominent story
about the surprisingly high or surprisingly modest remuneration of some or
other chief executive.
Corporate governance and executive compensation consultants expect that the
disclosures will not only be good for their business, but could have
significant repercussions in boardrooms, among outside shareholders and even
in the political arena.
Mr Richard Finlay, a Toronto consultant, describes the new rules as the
biggest advance in corporate governance in Canada since the start of
securities regulation.
'We're paying a lot of attention to it,' adds Mr Bob Sillcox, head of
investments at Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (Omers), one of
Canada's biggest pension funds. According to Mr Sillcox, Omers has already
raised the question of excessive compensation with a company (which he
declines to identify) in which it has an investment.
At least one large institutional investor, the Ontario teachers' pension
fund, has decided to publish details of its own executives' compensation.
The chairman of the fund's board said recently: 'Since we sort of bug other
people about this and they are now required to do it, the question arises,
why shouldn't we do it?'
The new rules were imposed last year on a reluctant and notoriously clubby
business community by Ontario's social-democratic government. The government
over-ruled the advice of the Ontario Securities Commission, which had
recommended that companies reveal only the aggregate compensation paid to
their top five executives.
The new guidelines closely follow rules applied by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission. Every company registered in Ontario (which in practice
means all those listed on the Toronto stock exchange) must disclose the
annual salary, bonus, share options and other compensation paid to each of
its top five executives for the past three years.
No Canadian executive comes close to the USDollars 203m reportedly taken
home last year by Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, the US
entertainment group. Nonetheless, several of the dozens of compensation
statements published in Canada over the past three months have raised
eyebrows.
By far the most contentious has been the CDollars 4m to CDollars 6m awards -
all in the form of bonuses - paid to each of the three top officers of First
Marathon, a medium-sized Toronto securities firm.
First Marathon's net profit more than doubled last year to CDollars 44.6m
(USDollars 32.3m). But the combined pay packets of the top three officers
amounted to more than a third of bottom-line earnings. First Marathon's
senior management, long famed for their swashbuckling style, control the
company through multiple voting shares.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mr Peter Godsoe, Bank of Nova Scotia's
chairman, has been singled out as one executive who might legitimately ask
for a raise next year. BNS's earnings of CDollars 714m and its 14.4 per cent
return on equity were the highest among Canada's big six banks in 1993.
But Mr Godsoe's total remuneration of CDollars 786,400 was relatively modest
compared to his counterparts. Mr Matthew Barrett, Bank of Montreal's
chairman, earned CDollars 1.75m.
In many cases, bonus payments appear to bear little relationship to a
company's performance.
Royal Trust, the loss-making financial institution which collapsed into the
arms of Royal Bank of Canada last August, paid its top five executives
CDollars 3.2m, including a raft of bonuses and consulting fees.
Bramalea, the troubled real-estate developer, paid its chief executive a
CDollars 285,000 bonus as part of his CDollars 971,000 earnings. The company
justified the bonus on the grounds that its losses narrowed to CDollars 91m
from more than CDollars 900m in 1992, and it posted positive cash flow after
negotiating a debt-restructuring agreement.
Some executives have paid a tangible price for their companies' lacklustre
performance. Mr Red Wilson, chairman of BCE, Canada's biggest public
company, took a 35 per cent pay cut last year to just under CDollars 750,000
in the wake of the heaviest losses ever suffered by the company.
Nova, the Calgary-based pipeline and petrochemicals group, has taken the
ultimate step in linking compensation with performance by paying its chief
executive entirely in common shares.
The barrage of publicity on executive pay 'is waking shareholders up to
(compensation) issues', says Mr Bill Mackenzie, vice-president at Fairvest
Securities, which specialises in corporate governance.
It will take some time, however, before the full repercussions of disclosure
can be assessed. Mr Sillcox notes that the bald numbers published in proxy
statements do not tell the full story. He says Omers needs to examine such
questions as the composition of boards of directors and their compensation
committees before it can draw any firm conclusions.
One safe bet, however, is that many directors will think much more carefully
at the end of this year not just about how much senior management should be
paid, but also about how the decisions should be explained to increasingly
vigilant shareholders.

Mr Peter Godsoe is president and chief executive of Bank of Nova Scotia,
not chairman as wrongly reported on May 10.

Elan Corporation, the Athlone-based pharmaceutical company, reported a
pre-tax loss of IPounds 49.5m (Pounds 48.3m) for the year to March 31 after
exceptional charges of IPounds 85.1m relating mainly to goodwill write-off
of an acquisition. The previous year there was a profit of IPounds 22.5m.
Operating profits were ahead by 47 per cent from IPounds 19.8m to IPounds
29.1m on turnover up 19 per cent to IPounds 107m (IPounds 89.8m). A
breakdown of turnover showed the main growth occurred in royalties up from
IPounds 12.6m to IPounds 19.9m, licence and option fees from IPounds 5.72m
to IPounds 13.5m, and manufacturing and distribution income from IPounds
57.3m to IPounds 58.9m.
Losses per share came out at 144p, against earnings of 67p. No dividend is
payable, as under New York Stock Exchange rules, where the company has its
primary listing, Elan is classified as a growth stock and not permitted to
pay dividends.
It has IPounds 148m in cash and short-term investments, IPounds 95m of which
was raised in an issue of subordinated loan notes in October 1992.
Mr Tom Lynch, financial director, said: 'This gives us the strength and
leverage to fund acquisitions and organic growth.' He added, however, that
the company had no plans at present to make an acquisition.
Elan has built up a niche market in the development of dermal patches and by
extending the patents of established pharmaceutical products through their
further development in making their gastric absorption more controlled,
facilitating once-a-day dosage.
Elan has 19 products approved for distribution in 44 countries, which focus
on the treatment of chronic ailments such as cardio-vascular and arthritic
diseases.
It plans to have a range of new electrical trans-dermal drug delivery
devices on the market before the end of the decade.

FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BPC joins market with Pounds 250m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Printing Company, the UK's largest commercial printer, confirmed
yesterday that it planned to come to market via a placing and public offer
this summer, which is expected to value the group at Pounds 250m.
BPC, known as BPCC before its January 1989 management buy-out from the late
Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire, claims a 20 per cent share of the UK
magazine printing market.
It prints more than 1bn magazines each year including eight out of the top
10 weekly magazines. Among its titles are the Radio Times, TV Times, Bella
and Woman's Own.
The group operates three main printing businesses, magazines and catalogues,
cartons and labels, and books and journals. It produced operating profits of
Pounds 19m last year on turnover of Pounds 317.6m.
Commenting on the flotation plans, Mr John Holloran, the chief executive who
led the management buy-out, said now was the right time to come to the
market because of the recovery in the printing market.
He said a listing would enable the group to take full advantage of improving
economic conditions and reinforce the group's reputation in the markets it
serves.
Since the buy-out the management has restructured the group which now
operates from 25 main locations and has a workforce of 5,100. A Pounds 110m
capital investment programme has been undertaken.

FT  10 MAY 94 / Polly Peck may face accountancy inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accountancy profession is poised to launch a high level disciplinary
inquiry into Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate formerly
controlled by Mr Asil Nadir.
The joint disciplinary scheme, the most senior regulatory body within the
profession, is expected to announce an invest-igation within the next few
days.
It is likely to concentrate on the role of Stoy Hayward, the accountancy
firm which was the principal auditor to Polly Peck. Officials may examine
the conduct of any member firms or individual accountants connected to the
company.
The development comes just over a year after Mr Nadir broke his bail
conditions and fled Britain for his native northern Cyprus while facing
charges for theft and false accounting totalling Pounds 34m.
The joint disciplinary scheme, which represents the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, only
examines the most serious and public of incidents.
It received a substantial blow last month when the House of Lords ruled
against it and in favour of accountants Price Waterhouse, which was under
inquiry for its audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
In a blow for self-regulation, the Lords supported the court of appeal's
ruling that any inquiry by the profession must wait until after civil
litigation on the case is completed, which could be into the next century.
Just four other investigations are currently underway: into Barlow Clowes,
the disgraced fund management group; Ferranti, the electronics group; the
Maxwell business empire; and War on Want, the third world charity.
Stoy Hayward and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which is under investigation for its
audit of the Maxwell companies, are believed to be among several firms
considering deferring their responses to the joint disciplinary scheme's
inquiries as a result of House of Lords ruling on BCCI.

MONDAY
Swedes and Finns sign up
Sweden and Finland will today break with a long Cold War tradition of
neutrality when they sign up for Nato's Partnership for Peace at a formal
ceremony in Brussels. Both countries plan to offer training in areas like
peacekeeping, but they stress that they are not seeking full membership of
the alliance.
Mandela takes the helm
South Africa's multiracial National Assembly is scheduled to sit for the
first time in Cape Town. It is expected formally to elect Nelson Mandela as
president. Dignitaries will then decamp to Pretoria, where Mandela is to be
sworn in as president at an inauguration ceremony on Tuesday.
US vice-president Al Gore, accompanied by First Lady Hillary Clinton,
arrives in South Africa to attend tomorrow's swearing-in of Nelson Mandela.
Vice-President Gore travels on to Namibia, while Mrs Clinton returns to the
US.
Bank of Africa
The African Development Bank starts its 30th anniversary celebrations in
Nairobi (to May 13) with a fundamental shake-up in the offing. The
deteriorating relations between the president, Babacar Ndiaye, and the board
of governors will be discussed, as will a critical report on the performance
of the bank's projects, which have not been doing well.
Leading member countries say they are holding back the replenishment of the
bank's soft-loan fund. The AfDB is one of Africa's biggest sources of
development finance, with a disbursed loan portfolio of more than Dollars
7bn.
West goes east
At a Western European Union meeting in Luxembourg, steps will be taken to
consolidate the nine-member group's status as a defence association. Nine
former Eastern bloc states will become associate partners, and Turkey,
Norway and Iceland will be drawn closer into the group's embryonic military
planning activities.
UK education
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, will outline his proposals for simplifying the national
curriculum in England and Wales. He will suggest which subjects and topics
should no longer be compulsory. After a period of consultation, the changes
should be ready for the school year beginning September 1995.
Holidays
Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (Victory
Day).
TUESDAY
Mandela sworn in
Mr Nelson Mandela is formally sworn in as president of South Africa this
morning. More than 180 world leaders, including more than 40 heads of state,
are arriving in Pretoria for the inauguration. The ceremony is to be
attended by more than 150,000 people and is being televised live to millions
around the world.
Hata in the lions' den Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, enters the
lions' den when he delivers his first policy speech to parliament, setting
the tone for what is expected to be a short-lived administration.
Crimea's pro-Russian parliament debates whether to hold a referendum in June
on secession from Ukraine.
Australian budget
Ralph Willis, the treasurer, will unveil Australia's 1994/95 budget. In the
light of last week's ADollars 6.5bn (Dollars 4.6bn) jobs package, attention
will focus on the federal government's growth assumptions and its
revenue-raising plans.
Gold Fields Mineral Services publishes its annual survey of the gold market.
Traders will scan it eagerly for a price forecast - something not always
included. GFMS, which is financially backed by two big producers, last year
suggested that gold would range between USDollars 370 and Dollars 400 a troy
ounce, which turned out to be remarkably accurate.
Tilting at chessmen
The Verenigde Spaarbank chess tournament is played in Amsterdam until 18
May. Short won this annual invitation for the world's top grandmasters in
1991, 1992 and 1993, but now faces Kasparov. Other entrants are Timman
(Netherlands) and Ivanchuk (Ukraine). Karpov has refused to play.
Venture seminar
The British Venture Capital Association and the Inland Revenue sponsor a
one-day seminar at London's Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre on how to
structure venture capital investment trusts.
Saleroom
In New York tonight, Christie's is selling some of the most important
Impressionist and modern paintings to appear on the market since the price
collapse of 1990. A group from the collection of Meshulam Riklis, a US
businessman, includes a picturesque Monet, estimated at up to Dollars 7m,
and a Modigliani portrait with a Dollars 6m tag. From another private
collection comes a Gauguin landscape of Pont-Aven, also expected to make
Dollars 7m. If the sale goes well, the art market recovery will have been
confirmed.
Holidays
South Africa.
WEDNESDAY
Yeltsin visits Germany
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin (left) arrives for an official visit to
Germany (to May 13). Among the items on the agenda will be the question of
appropriate ceremonials for the departure of Russian troops from Berlin in
the summer.
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk is expected to ask parliament to
postpone the June presidential elections. Although Mr Kravchuk has
registered as a candidate, he fears a 'vacuum of power' in the country if
elections are held before the parliament - recently elected and politically
divided - is well-established and a post-Soviet constitution passed.
UK economy
Attention will be focused on the pace of recovery again with the release of
March's output data. Analysts predict the figures will show that the
corporate recovery is still in reasonable shape, though continuing at a more
moderate rate.
Manufacturing figures are expected to show a 2.4 per cent year-on-year
increase and a 0.2 per cent month-on-month rise - down from 0.8 per cent in
February. Industrial production is expected to show a 0.2 per cent rise,
down from 0.8 per cent in February.
Saleroom
Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art in New York tonight includes
a painting by Mondrian from the collection of former CIA deputy director H.
Gates Lloyd. He bought it from the artist in 1942. It should make in excess
of Dollars 3m. Among the lots is 'A bather drying her legs' (below) by
Degas, estimated between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 700,000.
Holidays
Sweden (Eve of Ascension).
THURSDAY
Japan's bonsai government
Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, is due to take parliamentary questions
on Tuesday's policy speech today and tomorrow. His opponents intend to give
him a grilling. They are determined to vote his minority government out of
power soon after this year's budget is passed, probably in June.
The Social Democratic Party, which recently walked out of the coalition over
an attempt to squeeze it out of policy making, will seize on last week's
debacle when Mr Hata's justice minister had to resign after saying that one
of the worst Japanese atrocities, the 1937 massacre of Nanking, never
happened.
Mex-TV
In the first televised presidential debate in Mexican political history, the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, takes
on Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution from the
left and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos from the National Action Party from the
right.
The Silver Institute, a producer-backed organisation based in Washington,
releases its annual survey of the world silver market. It is likely to
suggest that silver demand outpaced supply by as much as 250m troy ounces in
1993, the fourth successive year that the market was in deficit. This has
been possible because consumers have been able to dig into the huge stocks
that have been depressing prices for many years.
Cannes film festival
The 47th Cannes film festival gets under way, though this year it may be
more of a coterie spree on the Cote d'Azur (to May 23). Hollywood is keeping
its big films away, in reported annoyance at flag-waving French
protectionism during Gatt. In compensation, there are many fresh names from
countries which have less developed movie industries, including Peru,
Tunisia, Taiwan, Mexico and Romania - and a nation some think qualifies for
its own place on a third-world movie map, Great Britain.
Norway's prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, is to receive the
Charlemagne Prize at a ceremony in Aachen in recognition of her efforts for
social justice and the enhancement of European co-operation. She is the
second Scandinavian and the second woman to be awarded the honour.
Holidays
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Sweden (Ascension Day); India (Bombay
only).
FRIDAY
Major rallies Scots Tories
John Major, UK prime minister and Conservative party leader, addresses the
annual Scottish Conservative party conference in his first big political
engagement since the party's disastrous performance in local government
elections last week.
Major will try to rally the faithful for the European parliament elections
on June 9, keenly aware that another catastrophic defeat could end his
premiership. He will also want to put fresh heart into the demoralised
Scottish Tories, who fared even worse in the local elections than their
English and Welsh colleagues.
Grenadian embassy
The US Congress must decide by today whether to overrule a State Department
plan to close the US embassy on Grenada. President Reagan sent 7,000 troops
to oust a leftwing government on the Caribbean island in October 1983.
In the ascendant
The organisers of a conference on Astrology and the Stock Market, which
starts in New York today, have chosen an auspicious date on which to begin
it (to May 15).
Holidays
Belgium.
WEEKEND
Blackpool's tower of gold
Blackpool Tower, landmark of the seaside resort in north-west England,
celebrates its centenary of opening to the public on Saturday. The local
council has painted the tower gold to mark the event.
The FA cup final, highlight of the English soccer season, pits Chelsea
against Manchester United at the Wembley stadium in London on Saturday.
Revote in Togo
Ballots are repeated on Sunday in three constituencies where the Supreme
Court annulled the results of February's election.
Unison, the result of three UK public sector unions combining last July,
convenes in Bournemouth on Sunday for its first annual conference. It has
ousted the TGWU as Britain's biggest union. Confronting the government's pay
bill freeze will dominate the agenda, but the meeting may find itself
diverted by teething problems associated with the merger.
Monaco Grand Prix
The Formula One season continues on Sunday after two drivers died in
separate accidents at Imola two weeks ago.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (8): Bumper rice harvests - Agriculture
is back on its feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a punch-drunk boxer, Bangladesh has reeled from the blows of flood,
drought and cyclone. Its crops have been washed out, dried up and blown
away. About 300,000 people have died in natural disasters in the past seven
years.
But after a devastating cyclone in 1991, and despite flash floods last year,
agriculture is back on its feet, producing bumper rice harvests in the past
three years.
Agriculture dominates the Bangladeshi economy. It accounts for about 36 per
cent of total output, employs 60 per cent of the labour force and determines
incomes and consumption for the vast majority of Bangladeshis. Rice
dominates the sector, accounting for about 70 per cent of cropped land. The
rest is accounted for by pulses, wheat, jute, oil seeds, sugar plants, tea,
spices, vegetables and fruit.
Last year, Bangladesh achieved a long-sought goal of foodgrain
self-sufficiency. Rice production has risen from 14.2m tonnes in 1983 to
18.5m tonnes last year, keeping pace with the country's rising population. A
rice harvest of about 19m tonnes is expected this year, despite lower output
in the south-west region.
Mr Majid ul-Haq, agriculture and water minister, says the improvements have
been achieved through research, which has produced high-yielding rice
varieties as well as a greater willingness among farmers to experiment.
Research and development in the past 14 years have produced a wider use of
high-yield rice, improved farming methods, greater use of fertiliser and
more widespread irrigation, mainly through deep tube wells and irrigation
canals. The amount of cultivable land under irrigation has increased
markedly in the past few years from 17-20 per cent to about 35 per cent. Mr
ul-Haq says the figure could rise to between 42 per cent and 45 per cent if
Bangladesh resolves its dispute with India over sharing water from the
Ganges.
But Mr ul-Haq believes that improvements in rice yields and fertiliser use
could reach their limits in five to six years, by which time, the population
is likely to have risen to about 130m.
'The population growth that will come about past the year 2000 will really
pose some problems,' he says. The higher population will demand production
of several million tonnes more foodgrain. At the same time, housing will
encroach on agricultural land so the government will have to find new forms
of housing. 'Perhaps we are not rising vertically as fast as we should be,'
says Mr ul-Haq.
Research is under way to produce still higher-yielding rice seeds, and
varieties more resistant to flooding and higher water salinity. The
government is also encouraging a shift from rice to wheat, which requires
less water than rice and can be grown out of the rice seasons, although
yields drop in high temperatures. 'People have taken more to wheat. It has
taken us 30 years, but now it is quite common for wheat to be served in at
least one meal a day.'
The government is also encouraging the introduction of farm machinery. The
low cost of labour has discouraged investment, says Mr ul-Haq. But the need
for machinery has become more urgent because of the loss of cattle, used in
tilling, in recent cyclones. The government has started to lease farm
machinery to groups of farmers forming co-operatives and increasing farm
sizes.
Much of the land is broken into tiny plots with farms of less than one acre
accounting for about 40 per cent, while about 5 per cent of farm households
own and operate more than 25 per cent of agricultural land. This means that
recent technological advances have tended to favour a growing number of
large landowners, although aid agencies say that even the smallest plots of
land have benefited, particularly from the increased use of fertiliser. In
addition, agricultural employment has increased with the use of high-yield
rice, which is between 20 per cent and 50 per cent more labour-intensive
than traditional varieties.
But even today, despite improved harvests and lower rice prices, millions of
Bangladeshis are still going hungry. Some aid workers say the government is
still moving too slowly to improve farm outputs and that implementation of
new technology and farming methods is hampered by bureaucracy.
About 30m Bangladeshis cannot afford even 1,805 calories a day (20 per cent
less than the minimum intake recommended by the World Health Organisation),
according to a recent aid agency survey. The report - Fork in the Path:
Human Development Choices for Bangladesh - puts some of the blame on an
over-concentration on rice at the expense of more nutritional foods such as
beans and pulses. Foodgrains production would have to be increased by 1.7m
tonnes to feed the population adequately. Even then, says the report, the
poorest families in both urban and rural areas would be unable to buy enough
food: their only long-term hope for food-security is productive work.

In an article in the International Companies and Finance section of May 5

FT  09 MAY 94 / Kemper bows to higher GE offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kemper, the US investment group, yesterday bowed to an unwanted takeover
approach from GE Capital after the General Electric financial services arm
increased its offer for the company to Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.64bn).
GE Capital, which had first offered Dollars 55 a share for the company in
March, overcame the resistance of Kemper's board by raising its bid to
Dollars 60 a share.
The agreement, announced jointly by the two companies yesterday, comes just
three days before Kemper shareholders were due to vote on whether to appoint
four GE Capital nominees to their company's board. If approved, this would
have put irresistible pressure on the Long Grove, Illinois-based company to
agree a sale.
The agreed deal will turn GE Capital into one of the US's biggest fund
management groups. Kemper, whose operations span life insurance, mutual
funds and securities broking, had Dollars 67.4bn under management at the end
of March.
Kemper's shareholders had been pressing for a higher offer than the initial
Dollars 55 a share. Although publicly backing the rejection of GE Capital's
opening offer, some of the company's institutional shareholders had hinted
they would consider a higher bid.
In an attempt to appease the institutions, Mr David Mathis, Kemper's
chairman, last week said the company would poll shareholders a year from now
on a possible sale, if the company's share price had failed to reach Dollars
65. It appears this assurance could not overcome the attraction of an
immediate sale. Many of Kemper's shares are believed to have passed in
recent weeks to arbitrageurs, who buy shares in the hope of a quick profit
from events such as takeovers.
Mr Mathis's letter had added to a belief that Kemper's board would accept an
immediate offer of Dollars 65 a share. However, the GE Capital bid failed to
flush out any rival offers, as some Kemper executives had hoped, and even at
Dollars 60 a share the deal is well above the Dollars 40 level at which
Kemper was trading until mid-March.
GE Capital said its new offer was dependent on a review of Kemper's troubled
Dollars 1.7bn real estate portfolio, and outstanding litigation against the
company. It had earlier said that it might be prepared to raise the Dollars
55 a share offer, subject to a review of the real estate investments.
The Kemper annual meeting, which was due on Wednesday, has been postponed
until August 22.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Ideals of Hungary right spurned: Chrystia Freeland and
Nicholas Denton explain socialists' poll success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungarians joke that the right has achieved in four years what the
communists failed to pull off in 40: Make socialism popular.
On one level, the socialist revival is part of a wider eastern European
tendency. Like their neighbours in Poland and Lithuania, Hungarian voters
are venting their bitterness at the pain of the transition from communism to
a market economy by rejecting the parties which ushered in the change in
1990.
'Partly, it is a general eastern European phenomenon,' explained Mr Ivan
Lipovecz, editor of hvg, Hungary's influential political and business
weekly. 'The first reform generation has to be punished for the prosperity
which the economic transition has not yet produced.'
But in Hungary, voters also appear to be rejecting the conservatives' vision
of Hungary's future, which bears a resemblance to the inter-war past. The
ruling conservative coalition of the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the
Christian Democrats has tried to make the sharpest break with the past -
even pursuing 'war crimes' trials of those who crushed the 1956 uprising -
of any post-communist government in the region.
'The government has tried to create an atavistic Hungary,' says Mr Viktor
Polgar, who, as campaign manager for the socialists in Budapest expects to
profit handsomely from the electorate's lack of enthusiasm for this effort.
'But history is what it is - history. You cannot recreate the past.'
Alongside the effort to bring back the halcyon inter-war past, Hungary's
ruling conservatives have sought to wipe out all traces of the communist
period. 'It is partly each individual's own past which is being dragged in
the mud and I think many voters are reacting against that,' said Mr Andras
Simor, managing director of Creditanstalt Securities, the Hungarian branch
of the Austrian investment bank.
In its efforts to remould the Hungarian nation in its own image, the
government has tried to use the media to reshape the national soul. The
government has purged suspected left-wingers, recently sacking 129 radio
journalists, among them prominent broadcasters, and the conservatives at the
television station have done the government's negative campaigning for it.
But the crude pro-government propaganda has backfired, alienating many
voters, who had their fill of media distortion under the communist regime.
Moreover, attacks against liberals and leftists in the media have distracted
the government from the economic issues on which the election hinges.
Lack of attention to economic issues has reinforced the conservatives' image
as a collection of historians, poets and writers who should stick to their
original professions.
The irony is that it is the conservatives who are paying the political price
of the pain of economic transition, and the socialists, who were responsible
for the communist system in the first place, who could reap the political
benefits of the market-driven economic recovery which has already begun.
The conservatives were out of power for a generation; they may have
condemned themselves to another long spell in the wilderness.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Mannesmann swings to heavy loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mannesmann, the German engineering group whose products range from pipes to
mobile telephones, made a net loss of DM513m (Dollars 300m) last year, a
sharp swing from a net profit of DM63m in the previous year.
The group, which in February warned that it would make a heavy loss for
1993, blamed the reverse on one-off restructuring costs coupled with the
impact of further losses in its mobile-phone operations.
In a statement, Mannesmann said it would be cutting its 1993 dividend to DM5
per share - down from DM6 in the previous year.
At the same time, the group confirmed that Mr Werner Dieter, architect of
the group's expansion away from traditional pipe manufacturing activities
into car component production and mobile phones, would be stepping down as
chairman of the group's management board following this July's shareholders
meeting. Mr Dieter's successor is to be Mr Joachim Funk, 59, currently
finance director and deputy chairman of the Mannesmann management board.
The results for the group included a one-off charge of DM515m to cover
restructuring costs. The rationalisation measures undertaken last year would
lead to a lasting improvement in earnings, Mannesmann said.
Another factor behind the group's poor performance was a DM224m loss on its
D-2 mobile-phone operations, down from a loss of DM340m in the previous
year. The group revealed in February that turnover at the Mobilfunk
subsidiary rose from DM138m in 1992 to DM902m last year.
As disclosed in February, Mannesmann's group turnover dropped slightly from
DM28.02bn to DM27.96bn, while order intake rose from DM27.76 to DM27.99bn.
The group blamed its poor operating performance on the state of the world
economy and in particular on weak demand for capital goods, coupled with the
impact of adverse currency movements.
At an operating level, machine tools was the only one of the group's six
business divisions to have made a profit last year - but even there profits
were down substantially on the 1992 result.
The parent company reported a net profit of DM197m, down from DM244m a year
earlier. This profit enables shareholders to receive a dividend in spite of
the scale of the group-wide losses, Mannesmann said.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Fiat on course for its biggest
loss - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the Italian automotive and industrial group, will announce the biggest
loss in its history on Thursday. It is likely to report a net loss for 1993
of between L1,800bn (Dollars 1.1bn) and L2,100bn, and there is little
prospect of a return to net profit before 1995.
The market has already taken account of the bad news - heralded in September
when the group announced a L966bn plunge into the red for the first half -
and is speculating on an end to the crisis. Spurred on by faint signs of
recovery in the automotive market, and by early success of the Punto, Fiat
shares have been among the best performers on a buoyant Milan stock market.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (12): Aid for the poorest / Profile of
Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hawabibi, a 35-year-old village mother of four, was destitute until she
borrowed Tk7,000 to erect a chicken coop and buy nine hens and a rooster.
Six years later, she has built herself a house of wood and bamboo and a
shed, and has enough money to send her children to secondary school.
The loan that changed her life came from the Bangladesh Rural Advancement
Committee, the biggest non-government organisation in Bangladesh and one of
the world's largest development aid institutions in terms of the number of
people that it reaches.
'Without BRAC's loan, we could never have thought of improving our standard
of living,' says Hawabibi, who lives in the densely-populated rice-growing
district of Mirzapur, north of Dhaka. She is one of 480,000 Bangladeshi
women to have received BRAC loans to rear chickens, while about 400,000 have
borrowed money for cattle, tea planting, silk farming, irrigation schemes
and weaving. BRAC has also taught 13m women how to treat diarrhoea; it runs
22,000 primary schools and plans to have 100,000 by the year 2000.
BRAC shows what can be achieved in Bangladesh, even with limited resources.
A non-profit making organisation, it receives 70 per cent of its Dollars 40m
annual income from foreign aid donors. There is a high priority on cost
control and making the most of its funds. BRAC's schools operate at lower
costs than the government's. In its credit operations, bad debts run at
under 2 per cent of lending, even though borrowers are charged annual
interest of 20 per cent.
As for revenue, BRAC tries to generate as much of its own as possible - 30
per cent of its income comes from commercial activities, including a chain
of handicraft shops. This month it will open its first overseas outlet - in
Islington, London.
In 1972, Mr F. H. Abed, a former accountant with Shell, the international
oil group, set up BRAC in the wake of Bangladesh's independence war and with
the help of money from Oxfam, the British charity. Its first work was
post-war reconstruction, particularly the restoration of damaged homes.
Mr Abed devised the plan to open BRAC handicraft stores overseas. It was
also his suggestion that the British government should recruit unemployed
British graduates as teachers to work in BRAC schools for a year or two.
BRAC's schools generally cater for children who are so poor they would
usually have no education at all. However, the quality of education provided
is widely regarded to be better than that of rural government schools. BRAC
recruits part-time untrained graduate volunteers as teachers because they
are cheaper than qualified professionals; it maintains standards by
providing intensive training courses, highly-structured material for use in
class and frequent monitoring.
The combination is so effective that BRAC's methods have been praised by
Unicef, the United Nations organisation for children, and copied by other
countries.
Today, BRAC's most delicate political problem comes in fending off attacks
from conservative Islamic clerics, who condemn its efforts to elevate the
status of women as 'Christianisation'.
'We get a lot of flak from the mullahs,' says Mr Abed. About 5 per cent of
the 700,000 children at BRAC schools have been kept away from class by
parents influenced by the clergy. Some mullahs have even ruled that
membership of a BRAC credit co-operative is grounds for divorce.
But Mr Abed believes strongly that bringing women into economic activity is
vital to Bangladesh's future. The majority of participants in BRAC schemes
are women, whom BRAC has found to be better credit risks than men.
Mr Abed says women benefit more from BRAC than men because they are new to
work outside their immediate household and so are more conscientious. Also,
women are, from an early age, brought up to bear responsibilities, first for
their younger siblings and later for their own children. 'In the 1975
famine, men deserted their families to look for food. Women stayed with
their children. Survival in the villages depends more on women than on men.'
While Bangladesh has seen steady economic growth, particularly in the past
three years, half of the 120m people live below the government's poverty
line. Mr Abed believes the poor will not benefit unless the growth rate
rises from recent levels of 4-5 per cent annually to 6-7 per cent. 'In the
meantime, we must target programmes at the poorest people.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (7): Garments industry leads - Exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monno Khan enjoys the irony of selling plates to Staffordshire, the home of
British pottery. The UK was his company's first overseas buyer. Today, Monno
Ceramic Industries, Bangladesh's biggest producer of porcelain tableware,
sells to 51 countries.
Monno, like Bangladesh as a whole, is looking to exports for growth.
'We should go for exports in any form, whether porcelain or other products,
to give employment to our millions of people,' says Mr Khan, chairman and
managing director.
Monno's exports have risen more than five-fold in the past five years. Total
sales are expected to rise to about Tk440m this year, with exports - mainly
to the European Union and the US - taking an increasing share.
Ceramics represents only a tiny portion of the country's exports - 0.24 per
cent last year - but the sector is one of a few that in recent years has
shown dynamic growth and expanding overseas markets. Bangladesh's total
sales abroad last year rose by 19.5 per cent to Tk2.4bn, covering almost 60
per cent of the country's import bill, and the government is predicting a
further 18 per cent increase this year.
The garments industry is the country's biggest exporter and one of its best
hopes - along with a clutch of smaller growth industries including frozen
foods, leather and ceramics - for providing jobs and underpinning export-led
growth. The sector has grown rapidly in the past 15 years, helped by
economic liberalisation, fiscal incentives, low wages and a relatively
disciplined workforce. It is the country's biggest industrial employer, with
about 800,000 workers.
Last year, exports of ready-made garments rose nearly 19 per cent to
Tk48.2bn - some 52 per cent of total exports. The US market accounted for 52
per cent of Bangladeshi garment exports last year, and the European Union 40
per cent. But growth in recent years has failed to match the rapid expansion
of the 1980s as new players have entered the market and the developed world
has languished in recession. With its principal markets recovering, the
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association says its main
concern now is the industry's dependence on imported raw materials and
fabric. Less than 2 per cent of fabric used in the garments industry is
produced locally.
'Last year, we could not reach our growth target because of a fabric
shortage caused by poor cotton harvests,' says Mr Redwan Ahmed, the
association's president and a Bangladeshi National Party MP. 'Some of our
orders were cancelled because prices went too high. It is our duty to invite
foreign investors or sunset industries in developed countries to relocate
their factories here,' says Mr Ahmed.
Fortuna garments has just moved into a new factory in Dhaka, where it has
capacity to make 5,000 garments a day, mainly shirts and trousers for the US
market. Fortuna says its shirts cost about Dollars 1 each to produce. They
sell wholesale at Dollars 4-Dollars 5 and retail in the US at about Dollars
40-Dollars 50. Fortuna, like other large manufacturers, wants to increase
value-added work and to reduce its dependence on imported fabrics. 'We aim
to be fully integrated and will start by weaving next year,' says Mr
Mohammad Abu Taher, managing director. 'Then we will go on to dyeing and
finishing, perhaps with a foreign partner.'
Mr Akmal Hossain, director-general of the Export Promotion Bureau, concedes
that the future for garments lies in full integration, and says the
government is ready to support the industry. 'In garments, backward linkage
is one of the most important areas. It will be hard for us to survive in
competition with others when import quotas are phased out under the new Gatt
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement. We must go for a whole
industry.'
The wider push for exports, drawn up under World Bank guidance, prompted the
government last year to open a second Export Processing Zone, a duty-free
area for companies selling 100 per cent of their output abroad. The EPZs,
one in Chittagong and the second in Dhaka, aim to draw in foreign capital;
to widen the country's economic base by fostering new and developing
industries; and to generate jobs, particularly in more advanced
technological sectors.
But the rate of arrivals has been slow and Bangladesh continues to lag
behind its Asian neighbours in attracting foreign capital or the transfer of
technology. Much of Chittagong's EPZ stands vacant, and only light industry
has moved in.
While some foreign investors applaud improvements in incentives, others
complain of an overbearing bureaucracy. Only 44 foreign companies - among
them Japanese, South Korean, US and Hong Kong companies - have set up in
Chittagong since the EPZ opened in 1983. Of these, 13 are joint ventures
with local companies. A further nine are Bangladeshi. Total investment at
the site is barely Dollars 140m, providing about 25,000 jobs.
If foreign investment from the developed world is slow in coming, the
industry's best hope may be with India, says Mr Jamal Ahmad, a former senior
minister in the Bangladeshi government. He says it is easier and more
profitable for Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to smuggle fabric from India than
to invest at home because of a porous border and the taka's relative
strength against the rupee.
India should be allowed free access to the Bangladeshi market, he says,
encouraging it to buy more from Bangladesh and to enter into joint ventures.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Investment trusts eye US: Industry delegation to press for
changes in protectionist law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Representatives of the UK investment trust industry arrive in the US today
to press for legislative changes that would allow investment trust shares to
be sold to US investors.
A delegation from the Association of Investment Trust Companies will lobby
for changes to a protectionist law of 1940 which makes it almost impossible
for shares in foreign investment companies to be sold in the US.
The law in effect requires foreign investment companies to operate as US
companies under US regulation. Only 19 have ever managed to comply, all of
them Canadian.
Unsuccessful attempts have been made in the past to overcome the obstacle.
Mr Ernest Fenton, the association's director-general, said there were signs
that the new administration was more amenable to dismantling protectionist
barriers.
A possible solution is for US authorities to recognise UK regulation as
being of an equivalent standard to the US, without requiring compliance with
exactly the same rules.
Mr Patrick Gifford, chairman of Fleming Investment Management and a member
of the association's delegation, said that expanding into the US market
would not only give UK investment trusts a wider potential investor base,
but might also make it feasible to launch new funds for which the UK market
alone would not provide sufficient demand.
Mr Fenton said one attraction of UK investment trusts for US investors was
that while many US closed-end funds trade at substantial premiums to asset
value, UK funds normally trade at discounts or very small premiums.
Additionally, UK investment houses could offer greater expertise in certain
specialist areas than their US counterparts.
Even without changes to the 1940 act, it is possible that investment trusts
could issue American Depositary Receipts which are traded like shares on US
stock exchanges. However, these could be bought only by qualified
institutional buyers, not private individuals.
There are a number of other obstacles such as differences in the personal
tax system. US investment trusts distribute all realised capital gains while
UK ones do not. Private investors holding UK investment trust shares would
be taxed on the undistributed gains, causing possible cashflow problems.
Also, it could be hazardous for UK investment trusts to become too popular
with US pension funds because US pension protection legislation has
extraterritorial provisions.

Monday: Japan's monthly trade balance figures will be watched with interest
on the currency markets in the light of the recent strengthening of the yen.
Analysts expect another substantial surplus, several billion higher than the
Y12.9bn recorded last month.
Tuesday: The Bank of England's quarterly report is expected to underline the
UK central bank's cautious stance. Analysts will be looking for any hint of
a move away from its recent interest rate cuts.
Wednesday: French output figures for February are expected to provide
evidence of a slight recovery in the corporate sector. Industrial production
is expected to show modest growth of 0.6 per cent, after falling by 0.2 per
cent in January. Manufacturing is also expected to show 0.6 per cent growth.
Thursday: A spate of US data will again focus attention on the US recovery,
against a background of market concern about US interest rate and exchange
rate policy. PPI figures out today and and CPI figures on Friday are
expected to show inflation staying low. Retail sales, excluding vehicles,
are expected to show a small rise.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (10): Only a trickle of foreign
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bangladesh is attracting only a trickle of foreign investment despite a raft
of incentives and cheap labour, writes Sheila Jones.
Total foreign investment stands at barely Dollars 800m, the bulk of which is
in one single project, the Dollars 510m Kafco fertiliser plant. Tax holidays
and duty-free facilities in two Export Processing Zones have attracted only
about Dollars 140m in the past 10 years.
Many foreign businessmen say they are put off by an overbearing bureaucracy,
poor industrial relations, low productivity, and an underdeveloped
infrastructure. They also worry about political stability and a lack of
protection under business and contract law.
Mr Ian Sangster, managing director of Lever Brothers Bangladesh, the UK
subsidiary, complains about copyright infringement and the lack of
intellectual property rights. He points to a row of soaps on a shelf at the
company's Chittagong headquarters, imitations of Lever's famous Lifebuoy
brand: Life Bath, Likeboy, Life Joy and Lucky Boy. Lever's Wheel household
soap sells variously as Wheeli, Wheal and Willi.
'It's a massive problem,' says Mr Sangster. 'But there is no support from
the law. It is not a criminal offence.' He also points to the slow pace of
moving goods. 'It can take four to six weeks to get a consignment cleared
through customs, where it would take as many days in the UK. That delay
costs us.'
Some businessmen complain about constantly changing faces in government
ministries and the slow pace of legislative reform. Others says that
borrowing costs to business are higher than they should be because banks
fail to fully differentiate between their best and worst customers: 'So I'm
paying the cost of other people's bad debts.'
Mr K. M. Iqbal, deputy general manager of James Finlay, the UK trading
company based in Chittagong, says the government's tariff structure
penalises local producers. 'It can be cheaper to import a finished product
than to make it here,' he says. 'Even efficient companies are finding it
tough.'
But James Finlay, like Lever Brothers, has been in Bangladesh for many years
and intends to stay. It is well established, knows the system and is making
profits; Tk64m last year before tax, on turnover of Tk645m. It is the
newcomers which the government is finding difficult to attract.
'There is a lot of apparent political instability frightening investors  -
and they're partly right,' says Mr Iqbal. 'But democracy takes time.
Inevitably there will be teething problems.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (11): Problems linger on - A project
with a troubled history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction workers are putting the finishing touches to a shiny new
fertiliser plant in Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. It is all steel
tubes, storage tanks and glistening metalwork - a sight to delight the eye
of any engineer.
Kafco is nearly ready for business. This Dollars 510m project is the biggest
ever foreign investment in Bangladesh. Companies, aid institutions and
export credit agencies from five different countries are involved.
But even at this late stage, the plant is dogged by the controversies which
have plagued the project from its inception. Arguments rage over securing
adequate supplies from Bangladesh's natural gas fields, over costs and over
whether the plant should have been built at all.
The project is on target for completion next month. It will export 500
tonnes of ammonia and 1,725 tonnes of urea a day, mainly to India and China.
Earnings are estimated at Dollars 100m a year. If all goes well, 4 per cent
of the company will be floated on the Dhaka stock exchange in September, and
the company will start exporting in October.
Purchase agreements have been secured for all Kafco's output, and a complex
financing package is in place, 75 per cent of it in government-backed debt
and the rest in equity.
The project has had a troubled history. In 1990, it was suspended for a year
 -at a cost of Dollars 35m - when the newly-elected government of the
Bangladesh National Party refused to honour government guarantees for the
project's Dollars 400m loans. At the time, there were allegations of corrupt
deals with the previous government.
The BNP agreed to back the loans in 1992 only in exchange for places on the
Kafco board and an increase in the gas price from the previously agreed 75
cents per thousand standard cubic feet, to Dollars 1.
Now, with those political troubles in the past, Kafco is bracing for
business.
But there are still problems. Production of ammonia and urea requires two
main raw materials: water and natural gas. At the moment, there is no gas.
It is available - in Bangladesh's northern gas fields - but there is no
pipeline to bring it south to the plant.
A pipeline was to have been built to complete the north-south link by the
end of this year. But it has failed to materialise. Construction and
financing - originally expected from the World Bank - are still in doubt.
The Government of Bangladesh, which is a 40 per cent shareholder in the
project, has told Kafco that the Ashuganj-Bakharabad (A-B) pipeline will go
ahead. In the meantime, it has promised to supply gas by rehabilitating two
gas wells at Bakharabad, north of Chittagong, and to start drilling another
at Feni. These, says the government, will supply the plant until the A-B
pipeline is built.
'Kafco will get its gas,' says Mr Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the energy
minister. 'We have enough to supply the plant for two to three years.'
Kafco can only wait and hope. But much is at stake for both Bangladesh and
its foreign partners, led by Chiyoda of Japan, which is also lead
contractor. Other big foreign shareholders are Marubeni and the Overseas
Economic Co-operation Fund, both of Japan. Smaller stakes are held by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation of the UK, Haldor Topsoe of Denmark,
and Stami Carbon of the Netherlands.
The bulk of the funding is from Japan's export credit agency, with Dollars
250m in loans, and Dollars 32m from Italy's export credit agency. There is a
Dollars 100m commercial loan syndicated by Citibank, with the rest of the
funding from the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department, a Dollars 5m
grant from Denmark's development aid agency and a soft loan from the Nordic
Development Fund.
Kafco stands to lose Dollars 8m a month if it is unable to start operating.
The company says the government will have to pay interest on the loans due
in July next year if it fails to supply the plant with gas.
For Bangladesh, the Kafco project is important as a model for other foreign
investors, which the country desperately needs. If it flops, foreign
investors might be unwilling to risk their money again.
The government is not convinced that the Kafco project is perfect for
Bangladesh, but it now feels it cannot allow it to fail. 'There is no scope
for second thoughts on this project,' says the energy minister. 'It has
reached the stage where it must go ahead. But if someone came along now and
suggested constructing such a plant, I would discourage it.'
Kafco's managing director, Mr M. Towhidi, grits his teeth and smiles. He,
too, believes Kafco has to go ahead.
'This is the ultimate test of whether projects of this magnitude are ever
likely to succeed in Bangladesh,' he says. 'The country is hungry for
foreign investment and everybody is watching to see what becomes of Kafco.
They are watching to see if Bangladesh honours its commitments.
'I have no reason to doubt that it will, but it will have to get gas to us
on time. Otherwise, we're going to be a big white elephant.'

India's Farakka dam this year celebrates its 20th anniversary, but a
water-sharing dispute with Bangladesh that goes back even further is far
from settlement while tens of millions go hungry.
The dam, 11 miles inside India's eastern border with Bangladesh, slows the
Ganges as it turns south towards the Bay of Bengal.
India built the dam to flush out silt from the port of Calcutta. Millions of
tonnes of water are diverted daily from the Ganges into India's Hooghley
river and south to the coast.
But the diversion has dried out the south-western edge of Bangladesh, where
the Ganges and its tributaries feed the region's agricultural land.
Last year, for the first time since the dam was built in 1974, there was too
little water to power irrigation pumps at the mouth of the Gorai river, the
Ganges' main tributary in Bangladesh. The pumps have been idle again during
this year's dry season. The Ganges-Kobadak irrigation project, the country's
largest and until now its most successful, has ground to a halt.
Most of the south-west region's 193km of main irrigation canals are dry.
Where there is water, it is stagnant. Last year, Bangladesh received barely
a third of the Ganges flow. Farmers say they lost a third of their rice
crops last year, at a cost of Tk1bn. The soil was too hard for planting the
dry season crop. They expect this year's harvest to be little better.
There is hardly a current at Hardinge Bridge, 15 miles inside Bangladesh,
where the Gorai leaves the Ganges. Further downstream, there is no flow at
all, only sandbanks and stagnant pools. The Gorai has dried up.
At Kushtia, 25 miles downstream of the Gorai pump house, a few scruffy boys
kick a football across the river bed. The Gorai ferry stands idle as trucks
ease their way down the river banks onto rutted tracks heading east.
Monsoon rains will replenish the river in a few weeks, but even now, in the
dry season, it should flow strongly, feeding 350,000 acres of agricultural
land.
The Ganges is running so slowly that silt is building up in the Gorai mouth,
where sandbanks stand 8-10 feet high. The shallower river bed means the
river cannot contain seasonal flooding. The water spills over onto the land,
ruining the soil and spoiling crops. The uneven flow from Farakka is
battering the Ganges banks, causing it to shift and encroach on agricultural
land.
Mr Abdur Rahman Mondal, an adviser on the G-K project, fears that recent
advances in living standards are being lost because of the damage to fish
stocks and agriculture. The region is going backwards, he says.
'In years to come, this area will be a desert. The farmers will be back
where they started, when they were very poor indeed. Gradually, and with the
help of this irrigation programme, they have come up. They are better
dressed. They have pukka houses and food. In another few years they will
have nothing unless the Ganges flow is restored.'
Mr Mondal says the landless - about a fifth of the region's 50m population -
are suffering most. 'There is no compensation for their losses. Farmers are
only just surviving. They simply have to eat less.'
Farmers who normally sell a quarter of their crops produced only enough rice
last year for their own consumption. Farm labourers with nothing to do in
the dry season scramble for any work they can get, but there is little on
offer.
Alam, 36, says he might earn a few taka helping irrigation workers to shift
sand from the river bed. Last year, he had enough rice in stock to maintain
his income and feed his family. But it is much harder this year.
Mr Shaikh Abdul Momin, who is responsible for water management on the G-K
project, says that only the few farmers rich enough to have water pumped
from below ground have produced dry season rice. But this cannot solve the
problem for the whole region, he adds, because depletion of the water table
is threatening supplies of drinking water and will disrupt the ecological
balance.
Bangladesh has appealed to India over the past two decades for a greater
share of Ganges water. 'We have been talking about Farakka since the
inception of Bangladesh (in 1971),' says Mr Majid ul-Haq, agriculture and
water minister.
In 1977, India guaranteed a minimum of 80 per cent of the Ganges flow under
a five-year treaty. There has been no formal water-sharing agreement since
the treaty lapsed in 1982. Since then, the Ganges water level has dropped
dramatically.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, has raised the dispute with the United
Nations in the hope that it will put pressure on India to release more
water. She has told the UN it is a life-and-death crisis.
'India is a big country, and it has many resources so it should not harass a
small country like Bangladesh,' says Mrs Zia. 'We are not demanding any of
their share of the water. We are simply demanding our rightful share.'
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, told Mrs Zia at a summit
meeting in 1992 that an agreement had to be made for sharing 'the flow in
the Ganges on an equitable basis'. But since the summit, and despite further
pledges from India, little has happened.
India has also suggested broadening the discussion to include the
Brahmaputra and other rivers in the region. But it rejects all moves by
Dhaka to bring in outside organisations, such as the UN, or other parties
like Nepal, whose rivers feed into the Ganges.
Bangladesh is in a weak position: India is upstream and it is a much larger
country.
The only pressure on Delhi is the illegal movement of about 10m Bangladeshis
across the Indo-Bangladeshi border in the past 20 years. They have moved to
try to escape poverty, partly induced by the drought.
Bangladesh dismisses India's suggestion that it should build a link canal
from the Ganges to the Brahmaputra to increase water supplies. 'It goes
completely against the grain of nature,' says Mr ul-Haq, adding that such a
link would destroy crop land and displace thousands of people.
Industry is suffering too, he says, because corrosive saline water has crept
inland from the south. Factories have to bring in fresh water, at great
cost, for cooling and processing.
Increased salinity is also threatening the regeneration of timber-bearing
trees in the region's mangrove forests.
Thousands of people employed in river transport are without work in the dry
season. Fish stocks have been depleted, causing losses estimated at Tk4bn in
recent years.
Workers on the G-K irrigation project say health problems will follow as
washing declines and drinking water from underground is depleted. 'The
health problems will come gradually,' says Mr R. C. Das, an irrigation
engineer at Chuadanga, the southernmost town of the G-K area.
'In the next 10 years, I am afraid people will die. Fifty or 60 farmers came
here last week demanding water. They were shouting for it. But what can I
tell them? I have none.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (6): Solution to flooding sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aid donors from 15 countries gather in Dhaka at the end of this year to set
in motion a Flood Action Plan for Bangladesh, writes Sheila Jones. The plan
follows a five-year programme of studies and pilot projects across the
country into ways of preventing disastrous flooding.
This first stage of the plan, costing Dollars 150m, was initiated in 1990
after the disastrous floods of 1987 and 1988. The work started only after
initial studies of damage, flood policy and structural solutions carried out
in 1989 by France, the US and Japan with the government of Bangladesh.
A review of the latest work, co-ordinated by the World Bank and funded by
aid donors and the United Nations Development Programme, is due in July. The
aim is to agree on a comprehensive and sustainable solution to the country's
chronic flood problem. In coastal areas, cyclones cause more damage, but
they are much harder to predict and are considered virtually impossible to
control. A separate study of cyclone-prone areas is in progress at a cost of
about Dollars 75m.
Pilot projects on flood mitigation are under way on the Brahmaputra, testing
the effectiveness of embankments and river regulators. Study groups have
also examined the pattern of flooding and regional needs, river bank
protection, the encroachment of water onto agricultural land and ways of
stabilising shifting rivers and of securing adequate drainage.
Bangladesh is 80 per cent floodplain. Its land is shot through with rivers.
The largest are the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna. The country is
vulnerable to catastrophic floods that destroy crops, homes, livestock and
the infrastructure, but seasonal flooding is essential for food and life.
The Flood Action Plan thus advocates the principle of 'controlled flooding'.
'The basic policy is to allow normal flooding, which farmers and fishermen
need, but to keep out unwanted floods, the ones that do damage,' says Mr
Hugh Brammer, an agricultural specialist and adviser on the Flood Action
Plan. River embankments would keep out unwanted floods, while regulators
would be open at other times to allow for normal flooding and drainage.
Mr Brammer adds that public participation is a vital part of the project
because of the need for local maintenance and operation, and the possibility
of conflicting interests between, for example, farmers and fishermen.
He admits that the programme is ambitious. 'But you simply cannot leave
people exposed in this way. It took the Netherlands 600 years to create a
system of embankments and regulators. We don't have that time in
Bangladesh.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (2): Why projects stay grounded - The
country's most important economic failing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, visited the bleak sandbanks
of the river Jamuna in central Bangladesh to lay the foundation stone of the
country's biggest-ever investment - a Dollars 700m bridge.
The bridge is sorely needed to link north-west Bangladesh with the rest of
the country. Today, lorries must queue all day to cross the river by a
three-hour ferry ride. Monsoons, floods and droughts disturb the traffic, as
does the constant shifting of the sands in the Jamuna's shallow bed.
Bangladesh is crying out for investment. From the Jamuna bridge to automatic
spindles in the textiles factories and tilling machines on the farms, the
country needs capital to help promote economic growth. Without faster
growth, it cannot hope to meet the needs of its swelling population.
The government and development organisations monitoring Bangladesh, led by
the World Bank, regard the lack of investment as the country's most
important economic failing.
Moreover, at least as far as public investment is concerned, the problem is
not a shortage of funds. It is a lack of experienced and well-motivated
politicians and bureaucrats able to implement the projects on the country's
books.
For private investors political uncertainty, bureaucratic foot-dragging and
the poverty of potential consumers all hold back business activities. Local
investors have been as slow to commit themselves as foreigners. However,
there are signs that a few large private projects now under consideration
could come to fruition and perhaps stimulate the drawing up of other
proposals.
Thanks to the skill of Mrs Zia's government in bringing public borrowing
well under control and curbing inflation to about 2 per cent a year, there
is plenty of scope for the government to expand the public investment
programme. World Bank officials believe that, far from crowding out private
investment, an increased flow of public investment would stimulate private
activity. The Jamuna bridge is a good example - it will permit farmers in
the rural north west to bring more of their crops for sale in central
Bangladesh, including Dhaka, while also giving Dhaka-based manufacturers
better access to distant markets.
Mr Zaifur Rahman, the finance minister, is committed to increasing the ratio
of investment to economic output to an estimated 14.5 per cent in the year
to June 1994 from 13 per cent in 1992-93. The eventual target is 18-20 per
cent.
Foreign aid donors would be ready to increase the amount of aid pledged to
Bangladesh above the Dollars 2.1bn promised for 1994-95, which is roughly
the same as in the past two years. However, with Dollars 5bn in unspent
funds in the pipeline, there is no reason to raise contributions.
One western diplomat involved in aid projects blames 'a weak government, low
quality ministers and civil servants' for the delays in public investment.
Among the serious losses Bangladesh suffered in its 1971 independence war
was the flight to Pakistan of many senior administrators who were of west
Pakistani origin. Nor did the new country's espousal of socialist economic
policies enable civil servants to acquire experience of running open
economies.
Mr Rahman says improved monitoring of schemes will accelerate the investment
flow, but diplomats of donor countries say they see little change as yet.
The controversy surrounding the Dollars 510m Karnaphuli fertiliser plant, a
joint venture between the government, foreign aid donors and Japanese
companies, has also cast a shadow over large-scale investments. First
conceived in 1980 and coming on stream later this year, the plant has been
dogged by arguments about the wisdom of using Bangladesh's scarce gas
resources for fertiliser production instead of fuel. Whatever the merits of
the dispute, its effect has been to call into question the government's
ability to implement mega-projects.
However, the donor countries' decision to back the Jamuna bridge scheme,
which has also been under consideration for over 10 years, shows they are
still willing to take risks in Bangladesh. Similarly, they are supporting a
wide-ranging flood action programme to reduce the impact of future floods
following those which devastated the country in the late 1980s.
By comparison, private sector investments in Bangladesh are mostly small.
Factories for garments, leather and handicrafts, rarely cost over Dollars
100,000. The returns can be spectacular - recent investments in the garments
industry have seen entrepreneurs recover their money in a year.
Mr Jamal Uddin Ahmad, a former deputy prime minister turned business
consultant, says: 'Bangladesh generates these small high risk, high return
investments. But what we need is to create a more stable environment to
encourage more long-term local investment and eventually foreign investment
as well.'
A handful of larger investments are in the pipeline. Tootal, the British
subsidiary of Coats Viyella, which operates a spinning mill in Bangladesh,
is building a Dollars 25m extension to increase capacity threefold.
Bangladesh Tobacco, an affiliate of BAT Industries of the UK, is considering
a Dollars 60m plan for modernising tobacco and cigarette production.
In the longer term, foreign companies are interested in investing in
telecommunications, transport and energy, if these state-dominated
industries are opened up to private investment as the government plans. In
oil and gas, Holland Sea Search of the Netherlands and Cairns Energy of the
UK are the first of seven international oil exploration groups to have
completed exploration and production agreements. Other potential investors
include Occidental Oil of the US and France's Total.
In electricity, International Energy Group of the US and RP Goenka group, an
Indian business group, have proposed plans for building and operating
privately-owned power stations - but detailed rules for the entry of private
companies have not yet been established. The government hopes to complete a
new energy policy, including rules for private sector participation, next
month.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (3): Enter the foreign investor - Dhaka
Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The sight of foreign capital has stirred the sleepy Dhaka Stock Exchange
into action.
An estimated Dollars 50m has flowed into Bangladeshi shares since the end of
last year, borne by the tide of money washing through emerging markets over
the past 12 months. It amounts to a few drops of capital compared with the
buckets poured into India and China, but for Bangladesh any sign of foreign
investment interest is welcome. After rising a mere 6 per cent last year,
the Dhaka SE index has doubled in 1994.
'This is the first time foreign investors are investing in Bangladesh,' says
Mr Kurshid Alam, the DSE chairman. Fund managers who have visited Dhaka
include executives from the Hong Kong-based Regent financial services group,
which manages the Regent Pacific Moghul Fund, which invests in southern
Asia, from Jardine Fleming of Hong Kong and Fidelity of the US. Stockbrokers
from Smith New Court of the UK and WI Carr, an affiliate of France's Banque
Indo-Suez, have also called on Mr Alam and his colleagues.
Foreigners now own an estimated 5 per cent of Bangladeshi stocks which have
a combined capitalisation of about Dollars 1bn. There are no ceilings on
foreign ownership of the 142 listed companies. But stock can be difficult to
acquire because an estimated 50 per cent of shares are owned by founding
entrepreneurs and their families and a further 40 per cent locked in
long-term holdings with government financial institutions. Mr Imtiyaz
Hussain, a broker and investment adviser, says this leaves only about 10 per
cent of stock floating free. 'Of course, this tends to drive up prices.'
Foreign buyers have concentrated on about 15 leading shares whose prices
have climbed 300 per cent and more. For example, Beximco, a diversified
trading company, was quoted last month at Tk80, more than four times higher
than its low of last year of Tk18. Bangladesh Tobacco, the affiliate of
Britain's BAT Industries traded last month at Tk230, up from last year's low
of Tk70.
The trading room is a dark hall in which tables covered with white
tablecloths are set out in a circle. The stockbrokers sit at the tables,
with microphones in front. Trading is carried out in bursts of frantic
shouting into the microphones. Officials record the prices in chalk on a

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (1): A narrow window of opportunity -
There is not much time for Mrs Zia to curb political disputes and put the
economy and poverty back at the top of her agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
For Bangladesh the struggle to capitalise on the gains it has made in the
past three years of good harvests, democratic government and freedom from
natural disasters is proving hard.
Mrs Khaleda Zia's assumption of power as prime minister in 1990, following
the overthrow of the military dictator, General Hossain Ershad, has enabled
the country to enjoy its longest period of political stability since its
formation in a bloody independence war in 1971.
Although they remain among the poorest people on earth, Bangladeshis are
slightly better off than they were, thanks to bumper rice crops. The
government has brought its borrowing under control, taken some steps to
liberalise the economy and is considering implementing many more.
There is a risk, however, that the gains could be lost. The next general
election, due by early 1996, is already exerting a baleful influence on the
country's politics, diverting attention from social and economic needs.
Economic reforms are progressing at a snail's pace while politicians focus
on party work.
Charges of election-rigging pollute the political air. Strikes and
demonstrations have disrupted business. Islamic fundamentalists, numerically
weak but nonetheless active, have launched bad-tempered attacks on the
influence of foreign aid organisations.
There is still time for Mrs Zia, widow of the assassinated soldier-president
Zia ur Rahman, to bring the political disputes under control and put the
economy and fighting poverty back at the top of her agenda. But the window
of opportunity is closing fast.
As Mr Jamal Uddin Ahmad, a former deputy prime minister turned businessman,
says: 'The political parties are fighting so much that we are heading
towards a point of no return.'
The tensions were highlighted last month by the decision of the Awami
League, the main opposition party, to call a strike on the day when the
prime minister was laying the foundation stone for a Dollars 700m bridge -
the biggest investment ever made in Bangladesh. A day which was meant to
celebrate the nation's economic progress became an occasion for political
squabbling.
Mrs Zia denies there is any risk of instability. She says: 'The important
thing is democracy and the democratic system. If democracy continues, then
stability will continue and our economic policies will also stay in place.'
Bangladesh is a young country of 120m people with a young country's sense of
insecurity. It is tragically vulnerable to the elements, such as the
devastating cyclone of 1991 and the storms which lashed the eastern coast
this month. It feels nervous about its huge neighbour, India.
Bangladesh's institutions and elites are new; the middle-class is small and
lacks capital, skills and experience.
Among the poor, one child in 10 dies in infancy. Nearly one third of
youngsters do not go to school. About 20 per cent of families have no access
to safe drinking water. Without foreign aid, of which more than Dollars 2bn
is pledged every year, Bangladesh would even have difficulty feeding itself.
Although population growth has slowed to 2.2 per cent a year, it is still so
high that in just over 20 years Bangladesh will have 200m people.
Moreover, the country is not free of external difficulties. It is engaged in
a festering dispute with India over sharing the waters of the Ganges river;
and it has run into international criticism of its handling of tribal
refugees from Myanmar and of a long-running insurgency among tribal Chakma
people in southern Bangladesh.
Mrs Zia deserves some credit for trying to tackle the country's basic
economic difficulties. The government has contributed by expanding
poverty-alleviation and social welfare programmes and introducing a World
Bank-endorsed economic liberalisation programme.
Government over-spending and inflation have been curbed. Prices are rising
at less than 2 per cent annually. Controls on foreign trade and investment,
including high import tariffs, have been cut, internal price controls
relaxed and a start made on financial reforms and on overhauling debt-laden
public sector industries and services. Last autumn, the taka was liberalised
on the current account.
Liberalisation has particularly benefited agriculture. Bangladesh has become
almost self-sufficient in food grains and has started exporting modest
amounts of high-quality rice. With the country's subsistence seemingly
assured, agricultural planners are now looking to expand output further by
encouraging crop specialisation.
Foreign trade has gained from liberalisation and the establishment of two
duty-free export-processing zones. Boosted by the rapid expansion of the
garments industry, overall exports are growing at about 20 per cent a year
and could reach Dollars 2.6bn in the year ending June 1994, according to
government estimates.
With the help of a further Dollars 1bn of remittances from Bangladeshis
working overseas, Bangladesh has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of
Dollars 2.6bn, enough to pay for seven months' imports.
The fiscal deficit is also well under control and inflation is low, running
at an annual rate of 2 per cent.
As Mr Saifur Rahman, the finance minister, says: 'Never in the past has our
economic position been so good.'
And yet, even though Mr Rahman's boast is true, Bangladesh still has far to
go before it can satisfy even the basic needs of its people. The main
problem is that economic growth - running at 4-5 per cent in recent years -
is too slow to generate adequate resources for the future.
However, in order to reach growth rates of more than 6 per cent, which the
government believes is the minimum required, Bangladesh needs to make
radical economic changes, particularly to boost investment above its current
level of about 13 per cent of output. The World Bank estimates a ratio of
18-20 per cent is necessary to lift Bangladesh into a higher level of
economic activity. The immediate challenge is to raise public investment.
Bangladesh has Dollars 5bn of unused foreign aid in the pipeline waiting for
the government to implement projects to which the funds are tied.
The start of construction on the Jamuna River bridge will help utilise
money, so will work on the Flood Action Plan, a system of embankments
designed to protect Bangladesh against floods. Preparations and pilot
studies for a World Bank-sponsored programme have themselves cost Dollars
150m. There are also ambitious projects to improve the exploitation of
Bangladesh's abundant natural gas reserves.
Inexperience and inefficiency among ministers and civil servants alike
combine to frustrate schemes, sometimes for years. The fear of corruption,
coupled to the measures taken to prevent it, ties the government into knots.
Mr Rahman has promised to speed decision-making, but aid donors see little
sign of improvement.
Without more public investment, private investment will be slow in coming
and limited to small projects. Industry needs more support than Bangladesh
provides - electricity generation is just 80 kilowatt hours a head a year,
compared with 200-350 in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. There are just two
telephones for every 1,000 people when even India has seven.
Only this year will the last ferry crossing on the road from Bangladesh to
the second city of Chittagong be replaced by a bridge.
One reason why public investment is slow is that the government's time and
money is being swallowed up by the loss-making, over-manned, state-owned
industry. The gross losses in 1992-93 amounted to about 20bn taka, the
equivalent of 45 per cent of external aid disbursements. Moreover, the
inefficiency of these industries acts as a drag on the rest of the economy,
raising costs and dissuading companies from investing.
Prodded by the World Bank, the government has committed itself to
streamlining enterprises, liberalising the state-dominated financial
markets, privatising and opening basic services such as electricity
generation and telecommunications to private investment.
It has already embarked on rationalising the jute industry, the biggest
loss-maker, with the help of a Dollars 250m World Bank loan which will
contribute towards compensation for some 20,000 mill workers losing their
jobs.
Financial sector reform depends crucially on improving the performance of
the state-owned banks which hold about 80 per cent of banking assets. The
government is planning to privatise Rupali Bank, a medium-sized state-owned
institution, later this year. It has also granted permission for Citibank of
the US to join the small group of foreign banks operating in Bangladesh and
increase competition.
But deep-rooted problems remain, notably the Dollars 2bn of bad debt
weighing on the public sector banks - about a third of their assets and much
of it accumulated through loans to state-run enterprises, notably jute.
Overall progress with privatisation is painfully slow. Only two of about 40
enterprises identified for stock market flotations have actually been sold.
Measures to attract private investment into infrastructure are only
beginning to be implemented. The government was due to sign its first
contract for oil and gas exploration with a foreign consortium this month.
The latest indications are that the government is more likely to slow
economic reform than to accelerate in advance of the next general election.
The ruling Bangladesh National Party was defeated in municipal elections in
Dhaka and other cities in March - a setback which Mrs Zia says was partly
due to the unpopularity of reform.
The obstacles to further progress are many: politicians who are more
interested in fighting over the existing political and economic turf than
increasing future acreage; civil servants worried that liberalisation will
curb their powers, including access to bribes; strike-prone trade unions
which resent the job cuts that serious public sector reform would bring;
Islamic fundamentalists seeking to exploit deep-rooted suspicions of
programmes advanced by foreign donors; and poverty and ignorance.
But amid the gloom there is also hope. Bangladesh's fight against poverty
has spawned two of the world's most successful non-profit organisations -
Grameen Bank, a co-operative bank which has won endorsement from President
Bill Clinton for its work with the poor, and the Bangladesh Rural Action
Committee (BRAC), which has a range of programmes including credit
co-operatives, chicken farming, schools, and health centres.
These institutions show how even the very poor can take advantage of
opportunities, given the right encouragement. As Mr Mohammed Yunus, Grameen
Bank's founder, says: 'Poverty is a very powerful motive for action.'

FRANKFURT
Speculation about the outlook for interest rates is growing ahead of the
Bundesbank council's fortnightly meeting, brought forward to Wednesday
because of Thursday's Ascension Day holiday which will leave many European
markets closed. James Capel says that the recent strength of the D-Mark and
cuts in the repo rate already totalling 29 basis points since the last
discount rate reduction on April 14, point to a further decline in the
discount rate, perhaps of 50 basis points, and possibly this week.
Veba reports first-quarter figures tomorrow, with NatWest Securities
forecasting net profits up to DM253m from DM202m.
ZURICH
Full-year figures for 1993 are expected this week from Winterthur and Zurich
Insurance. UBS expects Winterthur to report a 27.5 per cent jump in net
profits to SFr315m and Zurich to post a 15 per cent rise to SFr565m. The
investment bank expects double-figure earnings growth from the leading
insurers in coming years.
Roche holds its annual news conference on 1993 results tomorrow. Roche
certificates have been under pressure since the group announced results
almost three weeks ago and there was further weakness last week after it
announced a Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, the US drugs group. However,
analysts have noted that the drop in the price would have been even bigger
without the continued support of Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank.
AMSTERDAM
First-quarter figures are due on Wednesday from Aegon and Royal Dutch.
Unilever reports first-quarter results on Friday. Hoare Govett estimates
Aegon's operating income will rise by 8 per cent and expects a further
profits increase in all insurance lines. The broker expects Royal Dutch's
net profits will dip to Pounds 900m from Pounds 971m in the same 1993 period
while slightly higher sales and margins should boost Unilever's earnings per
share to Fl 2.88 from Fl 2.86.
TOKYO
A brief lessening in the strength of the yen may encourage some
institutional investors wanting to begin allocating this year's funds in the
stock market.
However, with the currency factor remaining uncertain and the start of the
earnings season starting next week, many investors may remain on the
sidelines.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Wall Street steels itself for long wait -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a disheartening irony, but until the economy shows unmistakable signs
of cooling, the share prices of those companies best positioned to benefit
from steady growth - and lead the market to a sustained rally - are likely
to continue falling.
In the aftermath of Friday's news of a surprising jump in April employment
levels, a sense of resignation is hanging over Wall Street this morning.
After flirting with the notion that the worst was over, many investors are
now convinced the market has a long way to go before hitting bottom.
'We don't have much leadership, we've got a very weak bond market and very
good potential that stocks are going to be under pressure in the near term,'
says Mr Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane in
Charlotte.
'We are probably going to stay in a corrective phase until there is some
solid evidence the economy has slowed,' agrees Mr Thomas McManus, stock
strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Consumer and producer price data, due out later in the week, could help, but
it is doubtful, regardless of the actual numbers. A look back at last
month's price trends is hardly instructive for investors seeking to gauge
inflation a year from now.
Ever since the Federal Reserve last raised rates on April 18, economists
have warned that a fourth increase was only a matter of time. Yet Wall
Street had been growing confident that the next tightening, when it came,
would satisfy the Fed's intention of establishing a 'neutral' monetary
policy, although that remains undefined.
Amid this cautious optimism, the blue chip index showed a net gain of 14
points in the first four sessions of last week, despite the dollar's
unsettling weakness and its depressing implications for an already soured
Treasury market.
However, the April payroll number has forced investors to rethink their
positions. It showed non-farm employers taking on 267,000 more workers last
month, against forecasts of a 160,000 gain. Stocks dropped on the news,
recovered and lurched downward again after it became apparent that the Fed
would not make its move before the weekend.
'The two greatest foes of stocks are rising rates and uncertainty,' points
out Mr Eugene Peroni, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Both bogeymen loomed larger on Friday and the Dow was 26 points down on the
session.
Wall Street is betting heavily on the Fed striking this morning. The
reaction may depend on the bank's aggressiveness. A fourth 25 basis point
increase is likely to be a disappointment to a market hoping against hope
that the tightening sequence is to be completed soon.
The tribulations of the dollar, meanwhile, remain a distracting sideshow.
Further declines are possible today, analysts say, especially in view of the
currency's steadiness as bonds plunged on Friday. As with monetary policy,
the stock market's concern over the dollar is based more on the shifting
landscape than its actual value.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Congress to call for wide extension of
regulation - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the US Congress needed another excuse to interfere in the derivatives
business, then it will get it next week. The General Accounting Office is
due to add its own report to the growing mound of reviews of the derivatives
markets and it will be the most damning yet.
The GAO - Congress's investigative arm - seems set to call for a sweeping
extension of regulation. Companies using derivatives and unregulated dealers
involved in the markets should be brought under the remit of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, according to a draft of the report shown to some
interest groups in the financial industry.
Its tone is 'unremittingly negative,' said one person who has seen it. The
industry has been bracing itself for some time for an adverse report but may
be surprised by its stridency.
If US legislators wanted to interfere in the derivatives industry, they have
been given plenty of ammunition in recent months. Trading losses by some
banks and hedge funds, and the recent revelation that some big companies
have taken hits on instruments supposedly bought for hedging, are taken by
critics as a clear sign that the financial system is going off the rails.
The industry, and some policy makers, are against hasty legislation. On
Friday, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said risk
management systems for derivatives have stood up 'reasonably well' during
this year's upheaval in financial markets. More evidence is needed before
any conclusions can be drawn about how well the damage-control systems coped
with the market turmoil, he said.
Meanwhile, there is already considerable momentum for a quick response. The
House Banking Committee, for one, seems close to publishing a compromise
bill that will impose tighter controls on the derivatives activities of
banks.
The committee is hoping to codify guidelines already being worked on by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees federally
chartered banks in the US. The agency stepped up its own assault at the end
of May, when Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said he was
considering imposing limits on the risks banks could take on through their
proprietary trading activities.
The GAO report seems set to provoke legislators whose remit extends beyond
the banking industry into action. 'It's an invitation to Dingell and Markey
to get involved,' says one industry figure - a reference to the House Energy
and Commerce Committee chaired by John Dingell and its sub-committee on
telecommunications and finance chaired by Edward Markey.
It was Mr Markey who prompted the GAO review, in June 1992. Now, he is set
to mark its publication with hearings which could prompt a legislative
initiative from his committee. Tomorrow, the sub-committee will take
evidence from Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan, and two former
top regulators - Gerald Corrigan and Richard Breeden, former heads of the
New York Fed and the SEC respectively.
The sound of Washington's wheels grinding into motion does not mean
legislation is imminent. Even if the House Banking Committee gets a bill out
in the coming weeks, there is no telling whether or not it will get to the
floor of the House. Also, Mr Markey and Mr Dingell have yet to show their
hand, not to mention the Senate Banking Committee.
However, the pressure is certainly mounting on the derivatives industry to
make a better case for its activities, and to come up with new disclosure
and other initiatives of its own to meet the concerns.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Investors fail to focus on recovery signs -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the stock market cannot respond to almost daily evidence of economic
recovery, then it clearly has its eyes on other matters. Last week's higher
dividend payouts from British Petroleum and Bank of Scotland, excellent
first-quarter profits at BAT Industries and a handful of mega transatlantic
deals should all have pointed the way to a healthier market; yet, the
overall performance of market indices was still disappointing.
One reason is that the market's nervousness is self-feeding. Market-makers,
fearful of being caught out by a highly volatile equity sector, cut share
price quotations hard whenever they think they see trouble ahead. The
institutions are equally sensitive and, after taking aboard a steady flow of
placings and rights issues in the first quarter of the year, have now become
relatively unreceptive to new issues. More worrying were the indications
last week that some large overseas investors were lightening their holdings
in UK stocks.
The market is clearly gun-shy, or perhaps dollar-shy would be more explicit.
In mid-week and again on Friday afternoon, share prices went into reverse
very quickly when threats to the dollar revived fears that the Federal
Reserve would raise interest rates to defend the dollar.
Some analysts argue that the weak pound, which usually follows a weak dollar
in present conditions, has in the past been quite good for share prices. If
the dollar gets into trouble again this week, then UK bonds will fall and
the Footsie 3,100 mark will be at hazard again.
With the outlook for the market so uncertain, there are signs that
institutional investors are looking carefully at existing portfolios and
endeavouring to identify sectors which retain some attractions. In many
cases, these attractions are there only because the shares were left out of
the huge jump in equity prices earlier this year - for which the market is
now paying dear.
This has put the pharmaceutical sector back into the limelight after nearly
two years in which fund managers probably wished the shares had ceased to
exist. The sector still trades at a substantial discount but not much worse
than it did 12 months ago when it was hit by worries over the Clinton
tightening of US healthcare costs.
Now, with SmithKline Beecham paying Dollars 2.3bn for a US drug firm and
European buyers focusing on the impending sale of Eastman Kodak's Dollars
5bn plus pharmaceutical division, the sector looks interesting again.
SmithKline is buying a Pharmaceutical Benefit Manager, a new animal for UK
investors. BZW concedes that the move will mean modest earnings dilution
this year but expects 'superior growth' from the combined group thereafter.
For the sector as a whole, there is the hope that the SmithKline deal will
provide the recovery trigger for which the market has been waiting.
The question must be whether these latest developments will bring a general
revaluation of the sector which has remained decidedly out of favour with UK
analysts.

Early this week, the bund market is likely to suffer repercussions from
Friday's sharp increase in yields on US government securities, triggered by
data showing faster than expected growth in US employment.
In theory, the bund market should move independently of US Treasuries, as
German interest rates are due to fall further, in stark contrast to the US
where further rate increases are now expected.
However, the German market will need proof of the course of German rates and
will watch the outcome of this week's repo rate operations to see whether
the Bundesbank is prepared to let this key rate drop substantially from its
5.41 per cent level.
The nearer the repo rate moves to the discount rate - currently standing at
5 per cent - the more the market will be convinced that further cuts in the
discount rate are imminent.
The Bundesbank's policy-making council meets on Wednesday, brought forward a
day because of a public holiday on Thursday.
Few expect the German central bank to seize the opportunity to cut the
discount rate - the consensus is that the next cut will come later in the
month at the earliest - but the Bundesbank may stay true to its habit of
cutting rates when the markets least expect it.

Fluctuations in the Japanese bond market this week will depend heavily on
currency movements - especially the yen's strength.
If the dollar stabilises against the yen due to the past week's heavy
central bank intervention, profit-taking may hurt bond prices. However, the
yen is unlikely to plunge and its continued strength, in the Y100 to Y105
range against the dollar, is expected to weigh on profits of corporations
dependent on exports.
'The yen's firmness, continued economic weakness and sluggish inflation will
continue to keep the bond market well underpinned,' says DKB International.
If the yen appreciates further, hopes of a cut in the official discount
rate, or at least an easing in short-term rates, will rise.
The official view on the yen's strength is expected to be aired on Wednesday
by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan.
Asset allocation by domestic institutions, which have expressed caution over
the increased risk in the stock market, is expected to provide support for
the bond market. With concerns of oversupply due to increased municipal
issues gradually receding, bond prices may receive a boost from such
purchases.
Meanwhile, traders say the bond market's upside is limited due to continued
turmoil in US financial markets.

FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Looking to the longer term on Europe -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury bond market has provided much of the inspiration for Europe
this year. What with three hikes in short-term US interest rates since early
February, and the prospect of a fourth in the immediate future, US Treasury
bond prices have plummeted, taking the European markets down in their wake.
The release on Friday of stronger than expected US employment figures for
April, coupled with the recent weakness in the US dollar, means that global
bond markets are braced once again for another rise in US interest rates,
possibly as early as this week.
At the same time, the European government bond markets appear determined to
focus on any 'bond-negative' news on the home front, such as signs of a
stronger than expected recovery in Germany.
While the volatile market conditions this year have made trading in European
government bond markets a difficult task on a day-to-day basis, those with a
longer time perspective - the economists and fund managers - still cling to
the hope that once the bond market shake-out finally shudders to a halt,
sensible economic fundamentals will take over once again as the driving
force for Europe.
Strategy-wise, fund managers claim they are keeping to the core European
bond markets of Germany and France, as they see inflation staying low and
expect European interest rates to fall further. At the same time, they are
studiously avoiding the volatile high-yielders such as Italy and Spain, and
prefer to steer clear of the UK economy which is further ahead in the
recovery cycle than the rest of Europe.
'People have seen the turn in the interest rate cycle in the US and see it
as only a matter of time before that happens in Europe: however, that's too
simplistic,' said one European fund manager.
'You have to bear in mind that the dynamics of the situation in Europe are
very different from those in the US. In the US, interest rates are rising,
and probably should be rising more rapidly than they are, given the
inflationary pressures. But Europe is different: the inflation background is
improving and even though there is going to be some modest recovery in the
European economies, it won't be so strong as to be a worry with respect to
inflation.'
Mr Nick Henderson, fixed income manager at Gartmore, says he has been
increasing the duration of his European government bond portfolio during the
turbulent past few months, shifting along the yield curve, for example into
the liquid 30-year French and German bonds, as well as into long-dated Ecu
issues.
'We have gradually been lengthening our maturity in the global bond markets
because continental Europe offers good value. We still see inflation
remaining very low, so implied real yields for long-dated bonds are
attractive,' says Mr Henderson.
Meanwhile, Mr Jonathan Kelly, fixed income manager at Fidelity, sees 'a lot
of value in the very short end of European yield curves,' namely in
maturities of less than one year. 'Three-month Euro contracts are unduly
pessimistic, as they are predicting very high interest rates,' he says,
adding: 'It's my opinion interest rates will continue downwards at the
short-end in Europe.'
While some of the economic data which has come out of Germany recently has
sparked nervous selling in the bund market - on the grounds that it suggests
the Germany economic recovery is stronger than had been predicted - fund
managers and economists are taking a fairly sanguine view.
Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities,
says: 'I'm sympathetic to the stronger growth story in Europe, but I also
think the market is making a bit too much of it. We are looking at a
stronger trajectory for economic growth, but there are important caveats.'
He makes the point that German economic growth is 'bond-friendly . . . it's
an export-led expansion, with consumer spending and credit expansion playing
very limited roles.'
Mr Werner Kramer, bond strategist at DB Research, Deutsche Bank's research
subsidiary in Frankfurt, says he does not expect stronger growth to affect
the outlook for rate cuts in Germany and its neighbours.
'The inflation outlook won't change - if anything, given the dollar's
current weakness, the Bundesbank may accelerate its rate cuts to support
other central banks in their intervention efforts. At the very least, it
will stick to its current pace of easing,' he says
'The market is right in thinking we're getting close to the trough (in
interest rates), but it's absolutely mistaken in thinking of interest rates
increases' in the near future, says Warburg's Mr Magnus.
However, he acknowledges that a lot depends on the direction of the US
market: 'If the long bond stabilises around 7 1/4 to 7 1/2 per cent and
investors start buying again, Europe will enjoy better times. Whatever the
longer-term view, there's going to be a period in the next several months
where life will become easier. Maybe the summer months will provide a
positive surprise.'

Not for the first time, the US bond market is starting the week like a
paralysed rabbit caught in the glare of a car's headlamps.
The onrush of the next Federal Reserve tightening transfixed the market last
Friday: the April employment report, with its strong gains in job numbers,
wiped more than two points off the price of the 30-year Treasury bond,
driving the yield to over 7.5 per cent.
With the Fed choosing not to act last Friday, the market has been left
grappling with the likely timing of the next interest rate increase.
This will happen today, in the view of some on Wall Street, or at the latest
on Tuesday of next week, when the Federal Open Market Committee holds its
next meeting to discuss interest rate policy.
By the time the committee meets, it will also have the latest retail sales
data and producer and consumer price figures at its disposal.
The April producer price index, due to be announced this Thursday, is
expected to be up by 0.1 to 0.2 per cent, after a rise of 0.2 per cent in
March, while the consumer price index is expected to rise by 0.3 per cent,
as in each of the previous two months.
Retail sales in April are expected to have risen by 0.3 to 0.4 per cent,
moderating slightly from the levels of the previous two months.

An already glum gilt-edged market is unlikely to receive much support from
tomorrow's Bank of England inflation report, while the fall-out from last
week's UK local elections is expected to deter investors.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist of Yamaichi International in London,
believes there is enough medium-term anxiety about inflation for the Bank to
adopt a cautionary tone. In particular, the recent slight acceleration in
pay increases could encourage the Bank to emphasise longer-term inflationary
risks.
The market's attention could shift to funding arithmetic by the end of week,
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, believes.
Although this year's PSBR will be lower than the Pounds 46bn of 1993-94,
political uncertainty and medium-term inflation worries make a repeat of
last year's heavy Pounds 23bn foreign gilt purchases an unlikely bet at
present.
The Bank's next auction announcement is due on Friday. With the yield curve
abnormally steep (the 10-year benchmark bond ended last week yielding 8.21
per cent against base rates of 5.25 per cent), Mr Shepperd believes the Bank
may opt for another floating-rate issue. A convertible with an option to
convert from a short to a
long gilt would be another
way to overcome current uncertainties.

FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: IMF agreement vital for Turkey -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's foreign debt strategy is under the spotlight again as Turkish
officials continue their talks with the International Monetary Fund on a
possible stand-by facility.
Agreement with the Fund is vital to restore domestic confidence in the
battered Turkish lira and the austerity programme of the prime minister, Mrs
Tansu Ciller.
An accord would also do much to dispel the growing mutterings from the
market that the republic could be pushed to meet its foreign obligations in
the current crisis.
Turkey's total outstanding foreign debt - public and private - stood at
Dollars 66bn at the end of September 1993, up from Dollars 55bn at the end
of 1992.
The country has to repay around Dollars 5bn of medium and long-term debt in
1994. Around Dollars 16bn, or 27 per cent of total debt, is short-term - the
maturity structure having worsened sharply with the big increase in
commercial borrowings by banks to finance last year's record 28 per cent
jump in imports. Even with a sharp drop in imports this year, some of the
repayment will need to be rolled over.
Turkey will certainly benefit from a more robust picture on the current
account. With the austerity programme, imports are expected to come back
sharply from the record of Dollars 29bn in 1993, while officials are
projecting a 12 per cent increase in export revenues to Dollars 17.5bn.
After a record deficit in 1993 of Dollars 6.4bn, Mr Necati Ozfirat the head
of the State Planning Organisation, says the current account should be in
balance in the current year.
More encouraging, Turkey's international reserves appear to be growing,
according to figures released last week.
Since the announcement of the April 5 austerity package, central bank
reserves have risen from Dollars 3.03bn to Dollars 3.3bn on April 29,
although this still represents only a little over one month's import cover.
Also, commercial bank reserves at around Dollars 9.4bn, will only be
accessible by means of further severe monetary tightening.
Turkey's policy options are thus constrained. In the wake of the rise in US
interest rates, emerging market borrowers like Turkey have gone out of
favour.
When Turkey pulled a Dollars 750m global bond in March, uncertainty mounted.
This has since been exacerbated by Islamic gains in the March municipal
elections and nagging doubts over the ability of the prime minister to
implement the package.
Underscoring those doubts, Standard &amp; Poor's has just downgraded Turkey for
the third time this year, from BB to B+. Turkey remains on CreditWatch,
which all but rules out an early return to the bond markets.
Traders say its Pounds 125m 10-year bond deal, launched last year by S. G.
Warburg and priced to yield 230 basis points over gilts, is now being
offered at around 600 basis points over gilts - and there are no buyers.
Much will depend on the outcome of Turkey's negotiations with the IMF. If
the talks fail, a rescheduling of Turkish debt seems unavoidable.
On the other hand, if the sides can agree a letter of intent, IMF officials
have indicated that up to Dollars 450m may be released as a one-year standby
facility.
The government says it is also considering a club loan with US banks, which
is likely to provide short-term financing.
That still leaves at least Dollars 3bn of maturing debt to cover. Some
bankers believe the multilateral and bilateral official creditors will be
flexible in rolling over repayments.
'This time, I don't think Turkey can borrow its way out of the problem.
Equity is the only way to go. For the fixed-rate investor, there is just not
enough information,' said one US banker.
The government hopes to raise Dollars 3.5bn from the sale of state assets in
1994. The plan was given a boost last week with Parliament approving an
enabling bill which empowers the government to use decrees for three months
to prepare state companies for sale.
However, the government's recent sale of a minority stake in Tofas, the Fiat
car subsidiary, did not set a very convincing benchmark. The issue raised
around Dollars 350m, compared with bankers' earlier estimates closer to
Dollars 700m before the currency collapsed, losing more than 50 per cent
against the dollar since the start of the year.
Chase Manhattan is now leading a consortium, also comprising Kleinwort
Benson and Salomon Brothers, to prepare the state refinery corporation
Tupras and the petrol retail company Petrol Ofisi for sale. CS First Boston
has been mandated to prepare the state-owned Erdemir Iron and Steel works
for privatisation.
S. G. Warburg confirms that plans for a Dollars 2.5bn convertible issue in
the state owned telecommunications company are also still under
consideration, although it may be some time before the markets are ready for
such a deal.
There is almost as much anxiety over whether Turkey's private banks will be
able to refinance their short-term liabilities. Much of this is trade
finance and many have healthy reserves. However, traders say that market
sentiment could be badly affected if the authorities fail to settle the
Dollars 200m owed to foreign creditors by the three Turkish banks that were
closed down last month.
As one London based dealer put it: 'We're not looking at year-end numbers,
we're wondering whether Turkey can make it through the next six months.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Johannesburg Exchange committed to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Johannesburg stock exchange announced its intention to reform itself
last week writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
In a report - expected to be legislated by the new government later this
year - the authorities declared their commitment to overall restructuring of
operations, with emphasis on increasing market participation by both
foreigners and black investors.
The exchange will run a series of investor workshops and encourage the
listing of small black companies, while also permitting limited corporate
membership and some foreign ownership of local brokerages for the first
time.
After years of sanctions and isolation, during which many overseas buyers,
particularly Americans, stopped even considering South African stocks,
interest has resurfaced over the past six months.
The recent boom, which has seen the major indices hit a series of new highs,
has been largely foreign driven.
Several specialist Africa funds have been formed, most notably Morgan
Stanley's Dollars 60m Africa Fund and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars
100m Southern Africa fund, both of which are overwhelmingly concentrated on
the South African market. More are expected.
As South Africa is increasingly added to global market indices, such the IFC
data base on emerging markets, a greater proportion of international
investment capital will almost certainly make its way to the country.
With a current market capitalisation in the region of Dollars 160bn, the
exchange is the 11th largest globally, and much more mature and
sophisticated than most comparable markets in the developing world.
With foreigners expected to be allowed to participate shortly, it is already
widely rumoured that major London firms have expressed interest in
partnership with local brokerages, a move that will likely generate further
foreign business down the line.

TURKEY
Equities finished last week higher after another volatile ride in previous
sessions as the country's parliament passed laws on tax and privatisation
which are among the government's main efforts to reduce the budget deficit.
The privatisation law allows the cabinet decree powers for three months to
sell off state companies.
The World Bank has approved a Dollars 100m loan for the privatisation
programme. The loan had been suspended in March because of worries over the
financial crisis.
CHINA
The Bank of New York has forecast that China will become its most important
new market for American Depositary Receipts within the next three to five
years, agencies report.
A bank spokesperson said that between 10 and 12 Chinese companies would
establish ADR programmes in the US during 1994.
China's economic problems and the introduction of new taxes has dampened the
Shenzhen B share market, with an indicative measure - Credit Lyonnais
Securities Asia's Shenzhen B index - at, or around, year lows.
Commentators observe that there is little incentive for foreigners to come
into the market at present, with overseas institutions mainly targeting the
Shanghai market, which has a much larger capitalisation.
In Shenzhen daily turnover is estimated at 0.05 per cent of total market
capitalisation. Last Thursday, for instance, turnover was just HKDollars
800,000.
INDIA
The country's financial markets are expected to remain under pressure
following the cancellation of VSNL's Euro issue last week. However,
Ballarpur, the country's biggest papermaker, has said that it has no
immediate intenetion to delay its proposed Dollars 35m Eurobond issue with
plans to launch it later in the month.
The company said it would take a decision this week.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Market focus remains on dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar looks set to remain the focus of attention this week after
widespread central bank intervention last Wednesday to support the US
currency.
The market is watching to see what action the US Federal Reserve and the
Bundesbank take to shift interest rates in a way likely to support last
week's intervention effort, and the dollar.
The initial focus is on the US Federal Reserve. Many in the market believe
there is a good chance the Fed will raise rates today. If not today, then by
May 17 when the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets.
If excuse for tightening were needed, it came last Friday in the form of
buoyant April employment figures. Jobs rose by 267,000, compared with a
market forecast of 170,000, providing confirmation that the US economy
continues to grow strongly.
The refunding on Tuesday and Wednesday of Dollars 29bn of US treasuries is
also likely to play an important part in the Fed's thinking. If the risk of
the dollar weakening is still substantial, then overseas investors are less
likely to participate.
April PPI and CPI data are also likely to influence monetary policy.
A firm view has emerged in the market that a decisive move from the Fed is
necessary to curb the dollar's decline, and arrest the related weakness in
the US bond market.
This would involve the discount and federal funds rates rising by 50 basis
points.
So far, in the three policy tightenings over the past three months, the Fed
has moved rates in 25 basis point increments.
However, analysts argue that this is destabilising for the dollar and US
asset markets as it leaves investors perpetually waiting for the next
tighten-ing.
The argument for a decisive move is that it would calm market nerves if it
was sufficient to show that interest rates have reached a medium-term
plateau.
The discount rate is currently 3 per cent, and the Fed funds rate 3.75 per
cent.
Another key factor in the fate of the dollar is the Bundesbank. Were the
German central bank to cut its discount rate at its council meeting on
Wednesday, this should lend support to the dollar by shifting the interest
rate differential in the US's favour.
Sterling will also be in focus following last week's drubbing in local
elections for the Conservative Party. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has
made it clear that he will resist pressure to resign, but the instability of
his position is likely to put a dampener on the pound.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Socialists' return greeted with equanimity
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and CHRYSTIA FREELAND

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electoral victories by the left make markets and investors jittery all over
the world. In eastern Europe, where this weekend Hungary's socialists look
set to follow their Polish comrades back to power, the prospect is
superficially even more alarming. For the region's socialists are the
successors of the communist parties whose economic management, or rather
mismanage-ment, condemned their countries to relative backwardness.
However, foreign investors and their Hungarian advisers are reacting to the
left's resurgence with remarkable equanimity. 'I don't think anyone outside
the country is really concerned about the clock being turned back,' says Mr
Janos Bartha, chief executive of CS First Boston Budapest, the Hungarian
branch of the international investment bank.
The Left Alliance, which came back to power in Poland last autumn, has won
the confidence of western investors by continuing the orthodox economic
policies of its non-communist predecessors.
The Polish stock market's hectic rise continued after the left's triumph and
ended 1993 with a 900 per cent year-on-year gain. The equally dramatic 50
per cent crash this spring had much more to do with inflated price/earnings
ratios than politics.
Likewise, Hungary's bourse, which rose sharply in January, fell back and is
now moving sideways, is not expected to change course. On the last day of
trading before yesterday's vote the market was flat. Volume touched a low
for 1994 with only Ft13.1m (Dollars 130,000) worth of shares changing hands.
The price of compensation coupons, the certificates for a politically driven
privatisation programme of the governing conservatives opposed by the
socialists, fell to a near historic low. Otherwise the Budapest Stock
Exchange index hardly moved, ending 0.13 up on the day at 1620.78.
Mr Zsigmond Jarai, head of the Budapest office of UK merchant bank Samuel
Montagu, speaks for most analysts when he predicts: 'My expectation is that
nothing will happen to the market.'
Indeed, some analysts, including Mr Jarai, believe a socialist government
could even be an improvement.
One ex-communist who inspires their confidence is Mr Laszlo Bekesi, former
and perhaps future finance minister in a socialist government. Mr Bekesi
sees economic policy in starkly pragmatic terms: 'The options are not those
of conservative, liberal or social democratic policies. There are only two
alternatives: realistic and unrealistic.'
In an interview with the FT he proclaimed his belief in floating the
exchange rate and relying on private finance of infrastructure projects, and
he favoured fire sales of unprofitable state companies. Even Mr Bekesi's
pledge to stop Hungary's fledgling mass privatisation programme wins marks.
Like the prodigal son, the socialists are prepared to bend over backwards to
win the trust of western investors.
Mr Bekesi and his fellow technocrats represent the reassuring face of the
socialists. Less visible, but perhaps more powerful, are the trade unions
which underpin the party organisation and put jobs and wages above the
painful process of economic restructuring.
And, however restrained the programme and public pronouncements of the
socialists, many of their supporters are hoping for an immediate rise in
their living standards. 'The socialists say they will build capitalism, but
when they say capitalism the Hungarian people hear socialism,' says Mr Peter
Tolgyessy, a leader of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, a potential
coalition partner for the socialists.
In Poland, the Left Alliance government's austerity has angered industrial
workers who swung to the left in the belief that it would temper Poland's
harsh new capitalism. This disillusionment helped inspire strikes which are
jeopardising economic recovery, as well as the left's reputed ability to
maintain social peace.
An additional danger in Hungary is that the return of former communists to
power will provoke the extreme nationalist right to resort to desperate
action. Mr Ferenc Kulin, leader of the parliamentary group of the governing
Hungarian Democratic Forum, warns: 'Western investors don't have any moral
and political worries, because they have just one interest, an economic
interest. But they don't realise that with a socialist victory, social
stability will be in danger.'
However, even alarmist statements like these do not ruffle the confidence of
western investors. That is the true measure of the transformation in eastern
Europe: western observers are convinced countries like Hungary have
irreversibly opted for capitalism even if the leaders they choose call
themselves, for old time's sake, socialists.

FT  09 MAY 94 / The Markets: Dealing with the emerging Chinese giant -
Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under the rule of Deng Xiaoping, the long slumber of China, home to a fifth
of the world's population, has ended. This creates possibly the most
important policy challenge facing the West. Significant decisions - over
whether to renew China's MFN (most-favoured nation) status in the US, for
example, and on what terms to let it into the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade - must soon be taken.
The issues are expounded with clarity and common sense in a recent monograph
by Mr Nicholas Lardy, professor at the University of Washington, and a well
known expert on the Chinese economy.* Prof Lardy recognises the difficulty
posed for the rest of the world by a country that is so large and
economically dynamic, but remains under the control of a distasteful
communist regime. Fortunately, experience elsewhere in east Asia suggests
that democracy ultimately follows introduction of a successful market
economy, though with a significant lag.
Partly for this reason, the remarkable economic development under way needs
to be supported. The Chinese economy grew at an annual average rate of 9.4
per cent between 1980 and 1991. The explosion in its foreign trade (shown in
the chart) means that China's share in world exports rose from 0.9 per cent
in 1980 to 2.3 per cent in 1992. In 1973, China was the world's 20th largest
exporter; by 1985, it was 15th; and by 1992, it was 11th (10th, if Hong
Kong's re-exports are excluded).
Prof Lardy tries to assuage the alarm this performance has awakened. He
argues, for example, that China is not yet and is not likely soon to become
an economic superpower. Similarly, he notes that China is, in important
respects, more open to the world economy than were Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan at comparable levels of development.
How large is the Chinese economy? The highest estimate of income per head at
international prices is Dollars 2,600, which would make the economy second
largest in the world. If recent rates of growth were extrapolated, China
would overtake the US by 2010. Against this, Prof Lardy argues that China's
real income per head is only about Dollars 1,000, no higher than India's. He
also argues that supercharged growth is unlikely to be sustained after the
year 2000. Should the growth rate fall to 5 per cent, China's output would
not exceed that of the US until 2040.
These arguments seem mutually inconsistent. If China's real income is as low
as Prof Lardy suggests, its potential must also be greater. China would then
only be where south Korea was a quarter of a century ago. Since then the
latter's economy has grown at close to 10 per cent per annum. Furthermore,
the handicaps Prof Lardy points to - high levels of public ownership,
bankrupt banks and continuing dependence on foreign entrepreneurship and
capital - suggest that the rewards of further reform could be huge.
Much, however, depends on the rest of the world. Here Prof Lardy's arguments
are more persuasive. He notes, for example, that China received an inflow of
foreign direct investment in 1993 of Dollars 26bn, up from Dollars 5bn in
1991. In 1993, more than a quarter of China's exports were from
foreign-invested firms, which accounted for 70 per cent of total export
growth. Processing of duty-free imports into exports is also more important
for China than for other east Asian countries.
These facts, along with the role of Hong Kong as an entrepot, make the US
administration's beloved statistics on bilateral deficits more meaningless
than usual. A correction for US exports to China, through Hong Kong, and for
the value-added in Hong Kong on US imports from China is shown in the chart.
But suppose a US export is incorporated into something made in Taiwan that
is further processed in China. US bilateral trade statistics would miss this
altogether. It is interesting, therefore, that the US deficit with China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan, taken together, has changed little since 1987.
China has, in short, an increasingly open economy, one that specialises on
the basis of its comparative advantage and imports as much as it exports. It
needs to be encouraged to proceed further towards becoming a transparent,
market-based economic regime. Such a regime would, of necessity, also
increase the legal rights of the Chinese themselves, precisely what the West
is supposed to want.
Prof Lardy's recommendations include:
abandoning the use of the bilateral trade imbalance as an indicator of the
degree of openness of the Chinese economy;
working for China's early entrance into the Gatt, preferably before the end
of this year (which would make it a founding member of the World Trade
Organisation); and
providing China with permanent MFN status in the US.
All this makes eminent sense. Withdrawing MFN, for example, could be
catastrophic for US bilateral trade: the World Bank estimates China's
exports would then have fallen by between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 15bn in
1990. But it would also be an act of economic warfare, devastating to those
Chinese who are pushing for reform, or benefit from it.
Furthering China's long-term integration into the world economy would
increase its direct stake in stability and make it more likely that China
would co-operate on noneconomic issues as well, argues Prof Lardy. Against
this view, Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, has
designated China a 'backlash' state, along with Iran and Iraq. This is a
ridiculous parallel, partly because the course of Chinese economic
development promises something very different. More fundamentally, China
cannot, like Iran and Iraq, be quarantined. The question is what sort of
great power China will turn out to be. The China the West will experience is
likely to be the China the West deserves.
*Nicholas R. Lardy, China in the World Economy (Washington DC: Institute for
International Economics, April 1994).

FT  09 MAY 94 / The Markets: Fed credibility on the line - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve could move as early as this morning to raise
short-term interest rates, for if it fails to provide rapid reassurance to a
very jittery market it may face a week of tumbling stock and bond prices and
further weakening of the dollar.
There can be no doubt that a Fed tightening is imminent. What remains
unclear is whether the central bank will wait until the next meeting of its
policy-making Open Market Committee, on Tuesday of next week, and how large
a rate rise it will sanction. There is a powerful case for immediate, strong
action.
Last Friday's better-than-expected April employment figures prices, which so
badly spooked the bond market, demonstrated that the US economy is growing
vigorously - probably at a 3.5 to 4 per cent annual rate - and so far
showing few signs of the more modest performance widely predicted for later
this year.
While inflation remains subdued for now, the current 3.75 per cent Fed funds
rate is still a considerable way from the neutral rate the Fed is aiming
for, which arguably lies in the 4.5 per cent range.
The persistent rise in bond yields since February's initial tightening, and
last Friday's jump - the biggest one day increase since the Gulf war - show
that the market simply does not trust the bank's policy of incremental, 25
basis point increases in Fed funds as an inflation-fighting instrument.
Its anxiety is being heightened by the Clinton administration's nomination
of Mr Alan Blinder as Fed vice chairman, given his reputation (deserved or
not) for softness on inflation.
Fed tightening early this week could restore a measure of calm to the bond
market, and would also clear the air ahead of this week's Dollars 29bn of
Treasury auctions, starting with tomorrow's sale of three-year notes.
Whenever the bank acts, the general expectation is that it will put at least
25 basis points on Fed funds and increase the discount rate for the first
time in this cycle, with a 50 basis point rise. But a 50 basis point
increase in both rates would send a much better anti-inflation signal to the
markets.
The politicians would hate it, and so might stocks, but a firm demonstration
of resolve could lay the basis for an eventual rally at the long end of the
bond market.
It would also help underpin the dollar, at least in the short term. While
longer-term structural factors (including a deepening current account
deficit and outflow of investment funds) may explain much of the dollar's
unexpected weakness, the recent plunge in the currency is due in no small
measure to lack of confidence in US monetary policy.
COMMODITIES
The surge in international commodity prices on Friday also represented a
vote of no confidence in the Fed's anti-inflation credentials as speculative
funds poured into a broad range of assets, including precious metals,
copper, coffee and oil.
However, the bull run hid a range of differing fundamental factors in the
various markets which suggest it is too soon in the current cycle to expect
a sustained surge in across-the -board prices - though the long-term trend
is upwards.
Gold, in particular, would be vulnerable to a decisive tightening move by
the Fed. Copper prices may stay firm thanks to the strength of the US
economy and glimmerings of European recovery, but increased supply later in
the year could have a depressing impact on the market.
The coffee rally, which has taken prices up by nearly 40 per cent since the
start of the year on supply constraints, may be due for a correction, though
the outlook remains fundamentally strong.
Oil, having rallied by more than Dollars 4 a barrel since mid-February, was
further buoyed last week by fighting in the Yemen and output problems in the
North Sea. The Yemen is not a big producer, and the markets should rapidly
adjust to any supply disruptions. But indications of higher global demand in
the second half of this year - underscored in a report last week from the
International Energy Agency - should help underpin the market's rally.
KODAK
Shareholders in Eastman Kodak will gather this Wednesday for the company's
annual meeting in much better spirits than for very many years. Mr George
Fisher, chairman since December, has moved rapidly to reverse a decade of
misguided diversification which has left the group with a heavy debt burden
and lacklustre earnings growth.
The first fruits of the new management style were put on display for Wall
Street analysts last week when Mr Fisher announced plans to sell off three
big businesses, including Sterling Drug, the pharmaceuticals business Kodak
bought for Dollars 5.1bn in 1988.
Fisher's plan, which squares with what the investment community has been
urging Kodak to do for years, is to concentrate the company's resources on
its core imaging business. That means both squeezing better earnings out of
its conventional silver halide photographic business, through cost cutting
and market share gains, and focusing more energy on digital photography,
which some forecasts reckon could account for 25 per cent of the image
market by the turn of the century.
However, Kodak's new vigour does not make the stock a strong buy. The
disposals look like being fairly neutral for earnings, and Kodak shares,
which stand plump in the middle of their 52 week range, are not particularly
cheap, with a prospective p/e ratio of 16.
Mr Fisher is promising to boost the return on net assets from about 6 per
cent last year to at least 12 per cent by 1999. He should be able to take
plenty of fat out of the paternalistic company's cost structure, but Kodak's
traditional film business faces increasing competition from branded rivals
like Japan's Fuji and private label manufacturers such as 3M.
And while Mr Fisher's high technology background - as former chief executive
of Motorola - holds promise for the digital imaging business, there are no
signs yet of this sector making a substantial contribution to group profits.
KEMPER
Kemper's agreement yesterday to open negotiations with General Electric on a
Dollars 60 a share takeover bid looks good both for GE and the holders of
Kemper shares - some 10 per cent of whom are based in Europe.
GE, which has faced persistent rebuffs from Kemper's management, will
finally get a chance to look at the company's books and determine whether
its property portfolio is sufficiently cleaned up to merit a formal tender
offer at this level.
If so, a takeover will give GE a powerful leg up in the fund management
business.
Kemper, for its part, has managed to get GE to increase its offer from
Dollars 55 a share to Dollars 60, and its management avoids what was likely
to have been an embarrassing defeat at its annual meeting - due this
Wednesday but now put off until August.
GE, in an effort to get Kemper to open bid negotiations, had submitted an
annual meeting resolution to put four of its nominees on the board in place
of Kemper directors up for re-election, including Mr David Mathis, the
chairman.
Investors had a strong interest in voting for GE, since failure of the
resolution would have probably sent Kemper's shares tumbling back towards
the Dollars 40 level at which they were trading before GE first made a bid
approach.
That was because GE was unlikely to launch a hostile tender offer and there
were no signs that GE's activity would flush out a rival offer.
Kemper's agreement to talk just days ahead of the annual meeting mirrors the
white flag displayed in similar circumstances three years ago by computer
company NCR, which after months of stone-walling opened negotiations with
hostile bidder AT&amp;T shortly before an annual meeting vote on the composition
of its board.
Like NCR's stone-walling, Kemper's two months of rebuffing GE has served
shareholders well. Its submission now is a sensible acknowledgement that the
time has come to talk. It also removes the possibility that Mr Mathis might
have lost his job on Wednesday - hardly an outcome to strengthen Kemper's
hand in the hard bargaining that may yet lie ahead.

FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Birla ready for multinational
challenge - India's family-run conglomerate has no fear of competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few leaders of Indian industry are as enthusiastic about their commercial
future as Mr Aditya Birla.
At a recent business conference in New Delhi, he gave such a rousing summary
of India's economic prospects that he won more applause than even the
charismatic reform-minded finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh.
Mr Birla has good reason to feel more optimistic than most. As head of a
grouping with annual sales of over Rs100bn (Dollars 3.2bn), he controls one
of the largest industrial houses in India, with interests in textiles,
chemicals, metals and cement.
Moreover, unlike most other big family-run groups, Mr Birla's companies
already have a substantial investment overseas - over half of total sales
come from plants in south-east Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Birla companies
made their first foreign investment - a textile mill in Ethiopia - 35 years
ago.
Mr Birla says that having competed with foreign companies abroad he has no
fears about meeting the challenge of the multinationals in India, his native
land. 'We have been operating abroad in free markets for many years. I would
say competitors should be afraid of me.'
Some other businessmen have expressed fears that Indian industry might be
swamped by foreign companies, and have urged the government to protect them
from the onslaught. Mr Birla says he understands these concerns.
Local groups producing branded goods have genuine difficulties because
multinationals have 'built their brands over a 100 years in 100 countries
spending millions of dollars'.
These advantages cannot be wished away. But Mr Birla says that in basic
industries - including the activities of Birla group companies - success is
mainly determined not by brand but by quality and cost-competitiveness. 'In
the sectors we are in, we can hold our own.'
Unlike the small-scale obsolete plants typical of much of Indian industry,
Mr Birla's enterprises compare well with the world's largest. He says his
companies are sixth biggest in the world in carbon black, third in
electrical insulators, first in refined palm oil and in rayon fibre.
Mr Birla's companies produce rayon in Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philippines as well as India. His aluminium smelter in north India,
producing over 140,000 tonnes of metal a year, is among the world's top 15
per cent lowest-cost producers.
The Birla fortunes date back to the 19th century, when the family moved from
its ancestral home in Rajasthan to Calcutta, the commercial centre of
British India. Members of the Marwari merchant caste, they quickly made
money trading jute and opium and established themselves in jute production.
The family prospered under the legendary leadership of Mr G. K. Birla, Mr
Aditya Birla's grandfather, who dominated the business for more than 60
years until his death in 1983.
Control of Birla companies is spread among about six family branches, but Mr
Aditya Birla was singled out for special favour by his grandfather because
of his precocious business talents and he was bequeathed the best of the
group.
Mr Aditya Birla particularly impressed his grandfather by expanding overseas
in the 1960s and 1970s, when the socialist-inspired governments in New Delhi
tried to curb the domestic expansion of large groups.
Mr Aditya Birla's main listed companies, in which the family holds 20 to 30
per cent of the equity, are Grasim Industries (cement, textiles, and caustic
soda), Hindalco Industries (aluminium), Indian Rayon and Industries (rayon,
carbon black) and Indo Gulf Fertilisers and Chemicals (urea-based
fertilisers).
The group is in the midst of important investment plans, put together before
Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched economic reform in 1991
but which have since been brought forward and expanded.
Altogether, Mr Birla's companies are spending Rs70bn over the next three
years. Hindalco, which is spending Rs12.5bn, is expanding output of refined
aluminium by 40,000 tonnes a year to 210,000 tonnes and installing a new
rolling mill.
Grasim is spending Rs14.5bn on expanding production of cement (it is India's
largest manufacturer) and rayon and on a recently-completed sponge iron
plant in the western state of Maharashtra.
Indian Rayon, Indo-gulf Fertilisers and smaller companies also plan
expansion and new ventures ranging from software exports to producing
magnesia from sea water.
However, even these projects are dwarfed by Mr Birla's plan to build a
Rs27.5bn oil refinery with an annual capacity of 3m tonnes of crude in
Mangalore, on the south-west coast.
Formed as a joint venture with Hindustan Petroleum, a state-owned oil
company, the plant is expected to come on stream in 1996.
To help fund these schemes, Birla group companies have raised some Dollars
423m through Euro-equity issues in the past 18 months and intend to raise a
further Dollars 200m.
Mr Birla rejects suggestions that the group is becoming too diverse. He runs
his empire by delegating decision-making to the operating companies, while
remaining in overall charge of the direction the businesses take.
He keeps in touch with financial performance by a regular reporting of cash
positions - using a system developed by the Marwari caste.
Mr Birla is now so confident of India's future that his overseas companies
are putting capital into the Indian operation - reversing the flow of
previous years.
His main immediate concern about the Indian economy is inflation, which has
risen sharply in the past year from below 7 per cent to over 10 per cent for
wholesale prices.
Mr Birla says: 'We have to ensure that our costs don't go up with inflation
if we are to remain competitive.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Helicopter group forecasts big
fall in losses this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurocopter, the Franco-German helicopter company, hopes to reduce its losses
significantly this year after a very difficult year in 1993, according to Mr
Jean-Francois Bigay, chairman.
Mr Bigay said that Eurocopter - which is 70 per cent owned by Aerospatiale,
the French aerospace group, and 30 per cent by Deutsche Aerospace, its
German counterpart - sustained a net loss of between FFr350m and FFr400m
(Dollars 61m - Dollars 70m) on turnover of around FFr10bn in 1993, the worst
year for the helicopter industry since the 1960s.
He predicted that the middle to late 1990s would be a 'critical period' for
the company, which was created in 1991. However, Mr Bigay said that
Eurocopter had already started to recover from its difficulties in 1993 and
hoped it would halve its net loss this year.
The industry suffered last year from the economic recession, which triggered
a substantial reduction in orders for helicopters for civil purposes, and
from significant cutbacks in government expenditure.
Demand was also affected by the problems of the oil industry which, has been
one of the main markets. The recent fall in the oil price has forced many
oil groups to cut down on orders for new helicopters for use on off-shore
rigs.
Eurocopter estimated that the number of helicopters sold last year was
roughly half that of the 1,000 sold in each of the previous 10 years. Mr
Bigay said demand does not appear to have improved so far in 1994.
The Franco-German company also claims that it is more vulnerable to
downturns in demand than its US competitors - Sikorsky and Bell - because it
does not have the benefit of a strong domestic market. However, Eurocopter
does have high hopes for the long-term potential of the NH90, a new
helicopter being developed on a pan-European basis.

FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mike Walsh, chairman of Tenneco,
dies

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Walsh, chairman of Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company,
died on Friday, 16 months after being diagnosed as suffering from a brain
tumour.
Mr Walsh, 51, was a highly-regarded manager who had won a reputation as one
of the US's foremost turnround experts.
He had been hired by Tenneco in 1991 to help revive the fortunes of the
ailing company, whose activities extend from the Case farm machinery company
to gas pipelines, shipbuilding and packaging.
By slashing the company's dividend, selling assets and taking an axe to its
costs, he returned Tenneco to profitability last year.
Mr Walsh had spent the previous five years at Union Pacific Railroad, which
he had taken through a similar restructuring. But his career in industry had
begun only in 1980, when he joined Cummins Engine at the age of 38. Before
that, he had worked in private practice as a lawyer and as district attorney
in southern California.
Mr Walsh had stepped down as chief executive of Tenneco in February, saying
at the time that his medical treatment was impairing his ability to run the
company. The chief executive's position was taken over by Mr Dana Mead, then
president and chief operating officer, who had been brought in to Tenneco by
Mr Walsh two years before.
Mr Mead was among those who paid tribute to Mr Walsh's determination.
'Mike's legacy is our shared inspiration to fight on and never settle for
second best,' he said.

Sumitomo of Japan and Norway's Hydro Aluminium group are joining forces to
exploit expected growth in the use of aluminium by the world's motor
industry, writes John Griffiths in London.
A general co-operation agreement has been signed in Norway between Sumitomo
Light Metals, a leading supplier to the Japanese car industry, and Hydro's
aluminium extrusion group, whose main markets are in Europe and North
America.
The launch of Audi's A8 luxury car, the first fairly high-volume car with an
all-aluminium body, has encouraged forecasts that industry use of the
material will soar.

FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Kays Food relaunches flotation proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kays Food Group, the meat processing company, has decided to relaunch its
flotation plans, after proposals to expand the group through a takeover fell
through, writes Simon Davies.
Kays produces brand name cooked and processed meats, with a clientele which
includes Fortnum &amp; Mason and British Rail.
The company has trodden a tangled path towards listing. It first planned a
reverse takeover of textile and leisure company Noble Raredon, which is
controlled by Asil Nadir's sister Bilge Nevzat.
This was followed by proposals for a straight placing in March, but these
were dropped, following takeover talks with another meat processing company.
Given the falling stock market and diminished investor appetite for
flotations, Kays has scaled back its demands on new shareholders. It is
issuing 50m new shares at 5p to raise Pounds 2.1m net of expenses.
It initially planned to raise around Pounds 4.5m. This included the sale of
an additional 22m shares by Mr Fred Andrew, Kays' founder, who has now
decided to retain his stake. Kays will have a market capitalisation of
Pounds 4m.
The capital raised will help fund a Pounds 2.3m factory near Milton Keynes,
which will boost capacity from 3,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes per annum.
The company is already facing capacity constraints, but the new production
plant will not come on stream until the 1995-96 year.
Sponsor to the new shares is English Trust.

FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Goldsborough buys hospital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldsborough Healthcare has enlarged its position in the acute hospitals
sector with the acquisition of Regency Hospital, the owner and operator of
Macclesfield's independent Regency Hospital, for an initial Pounds 1.1m,
plus the repayment of Pounds 3.53m of debt.
Regency Hospital is currently registered for 33 beds, but could increase
that number by 17 'with only relatively minor additional commissioning
costs', Goldsborough said. In 1993 Regency made profit before interest and
tax of Pounds 396,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.62m. The profit figure was
struck after one-off charges of Pounds 138,000.
Subject to the achieving of profit targets for 1994, Goldsborough will make
a deferred payment of Pounds 1.5m on a pro rata basis. The consideration
will be financed from Goldsborough's own resources.

P&amp;P, the computer hardware supplier and services company, is buying
Computers for Business (Scotland) for up to Pounds 6.6m.
The company also reported an encouraging start to the present year to
November 30 1994.
Profitable contributions continued to be made by most areas of the business
and earnings were showing significant progress. An initial Pounds 3.74m for
94.3 per cent of CFB will be satisfied by the issue of 4.5m shares, valued
at Pounds 3.11m, Pounds 520,724 in loan notes and Pounds 108,597 cash. P&amp;P
has an option to buy the outstanding shares for an initial Pounds 260,000
cash.
A further Pounds 1m payment is variable depending on net assets at
completion and there is an additional profit-related payment to a maximum of
Pounds 1.6m.
The additional payments will be satisfied by a mixture of shares, loan notes
and cash.
CFB reported 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 530,157 (Pounds 606,000) on

FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J meeting likely to be adjourned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's extraordinary meeting at troubled retailer Brown &amp; Jackson to
consider a capital injection by Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld, will no
longer mark the Glaswegian couple's triumphant return to discount retailing.
A motion to adjourn the meeting will probably be approved by shareholders,
paving the way for their later consideration of a newer bid by Pepkor, the
South African retailer. Pepkor's offer of a capital injection of up to
Pounds 56.2m is double the maximum investment by the Weisfelds.
The Weisfelds, who founded the Whatever Everyone Wants clothing chain, have
remained silent since their offer was gazumped, leaving no indication of
whether they are prepared to enter a bidding war.
The B&amp;J board is unanimously supporting the Pepkor offer, but the Weisfelds
have more than three weeks to counter bid, before the South African
proposals go before shareholders.
Pepkor would provide a Pounds 12m secured five-year trade finance agreement.
In addition, it proposes to pay Pounds 500,000 for 12.5m new shares and buy
Pounds 7.5m of secured convertible loan stock, convertible into 187.5m
shares.
It would pay Pounds 77,200 for unsecured loan stock, carrying the rights to
subscribe for 772m new shares at 5p, raising Pounds 38.6m.
Finally, it would take options to buy 128m shares at a price of either 2.5p,
5p, or 7.5p, depending on the timing of exercise. This would raise between
Pounds 3.2m and Pounds 9.6m.
The Weisfelds were proposing an initial Pounds 6m capital injection, and an
investment package worth a maximum of Pounds 28m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Water is seeking to enter the multi-billion dollar North American
water and waste treatment market through a joint venture with a US
contractor.
The UK group will take a 45 per cent stake in Ogden Yorkshire Water, with
the balance to be held by Ogden Projects, the waste and energy arm of the
Dollars 2.5bn Ogden Corporation.
The joint venture will launch bids for contracts in a market which is
expected to grow rapidly from next year because of increased spending and
tighter legislation.
NatWest Securities, the UK broker, estimates that the Clean Water Act, which
is being proposed in the US, could result in increased funding next year of
Dollars 3bn.
The tighter regulation is also expected to force local government bodies to
turn to the private sector to manage waste treatment facilities.
Neither partner will inject capital initially. Funds will be allocated on a
project-by-project basis.
Mr John Bell, managing director of Yorkshire Water Enterprise, said Ogden
would bring an already significant presence in the municipal sector to the
joint venture.

FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: L&amp;G to reappraise tie with Northern Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest life and general insurance
companies, is to seek to devise a new relationship with Northern Rock
building society.
The need to reappraise Northern Rock's 'tie' with L&amp;G comes from the
society's announcement last week that it planned to merge with North of
England, to form the UK's 10th largest society. North of England is tied to
General Accident, and the merged society could not maintain ties with both
insurers.
Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock managing director, is concerned about whether
the society would find it worthwhile continuing a tie against a background
of rising compliance costs.
Severing the link would represent a further unwinding of relationships
between building societies and life insurers, and could also point to a more
general reconsideration by insurers of the benefits of having tied agents.
Last week, for example, Nationwide, the UK's second largest society,
announced plans to end its tie with Guardian Royal Exchange and set up
wholly-owned life assurance and unit trust subsidiaries.
The Northern Rock board will decide about the future arrangement with an
insurer, if any, over the summer - ahead of the effective date of October
for the merger.
If it ended the relationship altogether, Northern Rock could stand to lose
about Pounds 1m a year in premium income.
One possibility is that Northern Rock might become, in return for smaller
commissions than it receives for being a tied agent, an 'introducer' of
business to L&amp;G. On that basis, the society's staff would not give financial
advice, but simply pass on 'warm leads' to an L&amp;G sales force.
L&amp;G said that losing the tie with Northern Rock would be a 'disappointment
rather than a setback': some 40 per cent of new business in 1993 came from
its direct sales force, with up to 30 per cent coming from independent
financial advisers.
However, Northern Rock was its largest tie with a society, since it lost the
link with Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society.
Other recent events may have contributed to making insurers wonder if having
tied agents can be more trouble than it is worth: failures to meet
regulatory standards relating to tied agents were elements in the record
Pounds 300,000 fines imposed on Norwich Union and Premium Life.

FT  09 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Setback for Lipton over British Land stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle by Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, to block a
deal in which British Land acquired a 29.9 per cent share of Stanhope has
suffered a setback in the High Court.
Mr Justice Vinelott made an order striking out proceedings by Mr Lipton's
private company against British Land and the Bank of Nova Scotia. Mr Lipton
had claimed pre-emption rights over the 29.9 per cent stake which British
Land acquired from the Bank of Nova Scotia in March.
The judge made his decision on the grounds that the Lipton Group's claim
disclosed 'no cause of action'. He refused leave to appeal and costs were
awarded to the defendants.
Mr Lipton has been anxious to overturn British Land's acquisition of the
stake, which is seen as a step to gain control of Stanhope's half-share in
Broadgate, the City offices.
Mr Lipton says he has the right of first refusal to buy the stake,
originally owned by Olympia &amp; York, then pledged to the Bank of Nova Scotia.
Mr Lipton was unavailable for comment, although he is understood to be
intent on pursuing his claim further.

FT  09 MAY 94 / African empire open to the world: Anglo American and De
Beers have much to celebrate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo American Corporation, the world's
largest natural resources group, had two reasons for celebration at the
weekend.
There was the successful outcome of the first all-race elections in South
Africa, where Anglo dominates the economy.
There was also a 60th anniversary party in London for the Central Selling
Organisation, the most successful cartel in history, accounting as it does
for 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds. The CSO belongs to
De Beers, another element in Mr Harry Oppenheimer's industrial empire and
another company which has Mr Ogilvie Thompson as chairman.
Anglo and De Beers are emerging from difficult years of apartheid, isolation
and frequent tension with their government. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has to
ensure that the empire continues to flourish as South Africa rejoins the
rest of the world, a South Africa that, he believes, has the capacity to
grow economically as fast as Brazil did in the late 1960s and 1970s.
Apartheid, he says, was economically disastrous for South Africa, in that it
'stopped the clock'. But the delay in bringing in electoral reform had one
big advantage: 'The system of socialism and central planning as practised in
Russia and eastern Europe has been shown not to work.'
Among other things, this means that Anglo is no longer such a natural target
for an ANC-controlled government either to break-up into its mining,
industrial and investment parts, or to nationalise. The ANC, he says, has
been 'on a great trek to economic sanity'.
He says the degree of Anglo's domination of the country's economy has been
exaggerated. However, by its own 1993 calculations, Anglo represents about
25 per cent of the Johannesburg stock exchange and 6 to 7 per cent of South
Africa's capital assets.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson insists that small countries such as South Africa cannot
afford US-style anti-trust legislation if they are to have companies that
can compete internationally. Sweden and the Netherlands show what can be
done. Anglo is urging the new government to have an independent inquiry into
competition policy. 'I can't believe that the country will be so silly as to
penalise success.'
And if Anglo were to be split up, the likely buyers would be existing
pension funds and other institutional investors. It would do little for
black empowerment, he says. Instead Anglo is promoting black ownership of
business, for example, by prompting the 'unbundling' of Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments (JCI), a mining and industrial concern in which
Anglo and De Beers hold nearly 50 per cent, in a way that should transfer
control of some assets to black investors. The Sowetan newspaper is also
being transferred to black ownership. And last year Anglo spent about R100m
(Pounds 13.7m) buying products and services from small mainly black-owned,
businesses that it had encouraged with training and, sometimes, financial
help. 'You need big businesses for exports but small businesses create most
of the jobs,' says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
However, Anglo remains very much an anachronism when viewed by international
investors. It is a huge, centralised group with complex cross shareholdings
that, according to its critics, renders management unaccountable to
shareholders. The complicated control structure ensures that Anglo remains a
family business, even though Mr Harry Oppenheimer, 84-year-old son of the
founder, retired as chairman 12 years ago.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson admits: 'We have a major job to get our structure
understood. We must improve our presentation of ourselves.' But he insists
Anglo is not a conglomerate in the 1980s American style, it has not
developed by acquiring companies for shares but by starting most from
scratch and 'following our noses'. Its metallurgical skills lead it to set
up the Highveld steel company, for example. He recalls that the South
African mining industry developed the way it did because of shortages of
capital and skills. 'When you had a good metallurgist, you shared him among
several companies.'
Anglo has been 'tidying up' its structure to make it more logical. Most of
the industrial assets have been moved into Amic (Anglo American Industrial
Corporation). A reshuffle of assets between Anglo and Minorco, its
Luxembourg-registered offshore investment arm, has ensured there will be no
conflict of interest - Anglo searches for mineral opportunities in Africa,
Minorco gets the rest of the world.
There is still some tidying up to do and more non-core assets will be sold,
such as the Argus newspaper operations being acquired by Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspaper group.
But 10 years from now, the Anglo-De Beers group will not look much
different, Mr Ogilvie Thompson says. The relationship between Anglo and De
Beers - cemented by substantial cross shareholdings - has worked well for
years and there is no reason to suppose it will not go on doing so. De Beers
concentrates on the diamond business. Anglo will continue to invest in
diamonds through De Beers and continue to provide De Beers' technical needs
 -'that way we can offer the people we hire much wider scope'.
De Beers needs a very strong balance sheet to be able to finance the troughs
in diamond demand or sudden increases in supply. So it will continue to
build up investment in 'a portfolio of companies competently run, because De
Beers' people need to put all their concentration on diamonds'.
Cashflows will be used for businesses the group knows well. Anglo's profile
might change slightly if South African exchange controls are removed and it
can invest abroad. But as Minorco is cash-rich and unhampered by the
restrictions, 'we are not champing at the bit for that to happen'.
He suggests South Africa should work towards the removal of exchange
controls but 'timing is everything. We cannot run the risk of capital being
withdrawn in a hurry.'
The staying power of the group is well illustrated by De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation which yesterday welcomed clients from all over the
world for a 60th anniversary party.
After last year's record performance - CSO sales reached Dollars 4.4bn
(Pounds 3bn), some 5 per cent ahead of the previous record in 1988 - the
diamond market 'opened firm' this year, says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
Nevertheless, De Beers faces some substantial challenges.
It is still restricting the quantities of stones it takes from producers who
belong to the cartel - only 85 per cent of those contracted for. This is a
clear sign that supply continues to outpace demand. And stocks are already
high - De Beers' own have a book value of about Dollars 4bn and probably
have a much higher market value.
But the biggest threat to the cartel is Russia, which supplies about 25 per
cent of the world's gem diamonds by value, and whose contract with the CSO
runs out next year. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has already scolded the Russians for
selling diamonds from their stocks 'in contravention of our agreements'.
He says most of those officials in Russia who have been in the diamond
business for years want to stay with the CSO.
Others, such as Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Komdragmet, the Russian diamond
and precious stones committee, 'are not totally committed. We have 18 months
to convince them that it is in their best interests.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Marc Rich ferrous team goes it alone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A team of ferrous metals traders this morning resigned from Marc Rich, the
Zug-based international commodities trading group.
The team of 18 has set up its own trading company, to be known as Profer,
which will start operations this week from seven offices around the world.
It will also have agents in a further 11 locations.
Mr Omar Shah, who will be managing director, said the new company had
conservatively estimated that it would turn over 1m tonnes of ferrous raw
material, or about Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) in its first year. The
company is aiming at least to double its trading in the second year.
Turnover at Marc Rich in 1992 was Dollars 24bn, making it the 29th biggest
company in the FT's European Top 200. Mr Willi Strothotte, who returned to
Marc Rich as chief executive last year, said the defections would have an
insignificant effect on the group's business.
'It's something that happens in a large organisation when people seek
greener pastures,' he said, adding that senior traders had remained at Marc
Rich, which would continue in the ferrous markets.
He dismissed as an 'insult' any comparison with the well-publicised
departure in 1992 of Mr Claud Dauphin, head of the oil trading operations,
and Mr Manny Weiss, head of sugar trading.
Their resignations, along with Mr Strothotte himself, prompted speculation
of a power struggle at the top of the organisation. Last December Mr Marc
Rich resigned as chairman of the company and restructured it to give 72.5
per cent of its capital to management and key employees.
Mr Shah said dissatisfaction with 'the much heralded equity restructuring'
was a key reason behind the decision to set up Profer, which would be
'sufficiently well capitalised'. It had not ruled out diversifying into
non-ferrous metals.
Mr Bruno Furrer will be the chief executive.
He has spent 18 years with March Rich and will remain in Zug where Profer is
to have its head office.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): UK insurers likely to confirm
recovery - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the UK's biggest insurance companies are due to report rises in
profits for the first quarter, confirming recovery in that market. General
Accident is expected tomorrow to post pre-tax profits of about Pounds 60m,
compared with Pounds 42m. Forecasts for Commercial Union's profits on
Wednesday vary from Pounds 38m to Pounds 80m, while the range is Pounds
15m-Pounds 50m for Royal Insurance the same day. Some analysts warn,
however, that current profit levels do not represent any increase on the
last quarter of 1993 and suggest that competition is returning to some
sectors of the market.
Kwik Save: The UK's largest grocery discounter is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of Pounds 62m-Pounds 64m, against Pounds 61m. While it is
one of those putting pressure on J Sainsbury, it faces competition on its
own territory from expanding continental discounters.
Scottish Power: The electricity generator and distributor is expected to
reveal annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 340m-Pounds 350m on Wednesday, up
from Pounds 308m. The total dividend will probably rise by 11 per cent to
12.4p.
Royal Bank of Scotland: The bank, reporting on Wednesday, is expected to
double its interim pre-tax profits, which stood at Pounds 91.6m last time,
as well as lift its dividend. Questions will include whether it will spend
its healthy capital on acquisition.
Grand Metropolitan: Interim figures, due on Thursday from the food and
drinks group, should show a 10 per cent increase to about Pounds 445m
pre-tax. The Pillsbury Green Giant business in the US should do well, given
the floods in the mid-west and the resulting rise in vegetable prices. The
hot topic is whether GrandMet will unwind its unhappy Inntrepreneur pubs
joint venture with Courage.
Unilever: First-quarter figures on Friday for the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group should show modest improvement to about Pounds 450m pre-tax,
against Pounds 440m, with detergents the main depressing factor. A downturn
in the US started after the period and this quarter should also start to
show the costs of launching a new concentrated detergent across Europe.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Big loss at German engineer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mannesmann, the German engineering group whose products range from pipes to
mobile telephones, made a net loss of DM513m (Pounds 205m) last year, a
sharp swing from a net profit of DM63m in the previous year.
The group, which in February warned that it would make a heavy loss for
1993, blamed the reverse on one-off restructuring costs coupled with the
impact of further losses in its mobile-phone operations.
In a statement, Mannesmann said it would be cutting its 1993 dividend to DM5
per share - down from DM6 in the previous year.
At the same time, the group confirmed that Mr Werner Dieter, architect of
the group's expansion away from traditional pipe manufacturing activities
into car component production and mobile phones, would be stepping down as
chairman of the group's management board following this July's shareholders
meeting.
Mr Dieter's successor is to be Mr Joachim Funk, 59, currently finance
director and deputy chairman of the Mannesmann management board.
The results for the group included a one-off charge of DM515m to cover
restructuring costs. The rationalisation measures undertaken last year would
lead to a lasting improvement in earnings, Mannesmann said.
Another factor behind the group's poor performance was a DM224m loss on its
D-2 mobile-phone operations, down from a loss of DM340m in the previous
year.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Charges take toll as decade of
growth ends - J Sainsbury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury's downbeat trading statement in January, when it announced a
fall in underlying sales and gross margins, and a property write-down of
Pounds 365m, was one of the lowest points in a bleak year for UK food
retailers.
The impact of those factors will be apparent on Wednesday, when Sainsbury is
expected to announce a fall in reported pre-tax profits for the year to
March from Pounds 735m to Pounds 320m-Pounds 355m. That is after both the
Pounds 365m non-recurring write-down on property, reflecting the fall in
value of many of Sainsbury's sites since it bought them, and a Pounds 40m
recurring depreciation charge - the result of the group's decision to
depreciate buildings by 2 per cent a year and a revised depreciation policy
on fixtures and equipment.
Even adding back the charges, profits are at best expected to be only
slightly better than last year - ending a decade of spectacular profits
growth by the UK's largest grocery retailer.
The key questions Sainsbury is likely to address on Wednesday include
whether trading has improved since January - and whether gross margins have
stabilised - and the future of its 'Essential for Essentials' campaign
launched last October. That marked a move away from periodic promotions
towards 'everyday low prices' on 300 own-label lines, accounting for about
10 per cent of turnover.
Hailed initially by analysts as a clever strategic move, it has since been
blamed for the group's recent poor performance. There have been rumours that
the board was split over the campaign, which might be quietly jettisoned.
Analysts are also keen to hear more about Sainsbury's plans for its
Savacentre hypermarkets, Homebase DIY superstores and US supermarket chain
Shaws, as well as planned trials of a city-centre format.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Fourth year of decline sets record
 -Japanese season
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese corporate results season starts this week with 1,390 companies,
listed on the first and second sections of the Tokyo stock exchange,
announcing annual figures for the year to March.
The trend is expected to be for companies to report profit declines for the
fourth consecutive year, the longest period on record.
Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, projects
combined pre-tax profits for the last business year to fall 23.2 per cent.
Sales of the manufacturing sector are forecast to fall 4.9 per cent.
Although earnings prospects in the electronics and electronic parts sectors
improved, lower earnings of basic materials companies, such as steel,
cement, and paper and pulp makers, will have pulled profits lower.
Capital investment, excluding financial companies, is expected to have
declined by 11.4 per cent.
Improvement in profit margins, lower labour costs, and a decline in
depreciation and other effects of rationalisation are expected to help
earnings for the current year, with NRI expecting pre-tax profits to rise
0.2 per cent.
However, the institute, which based its forecast on an average yen rate of
Y109.5 to the dollar, warns the outlook will deteriorate if the annual
average for the currency rises sharply.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Household and business debts could slow economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High levels of household and company debt will curb borrowing, investment
and employment growth during the present economic recovery, the Bank of
England warns today.
The Bank calculates that in the first quarter of this year more than 1.29m
households were affected by negative equity, with their mortgage borrowings
exceeding the value of their property.
The total value of negative equity was Pounds 7.6bn, representing an average
of Pounds 5,900 per affected household, the Bank says.
At its peak in the first quarter of 1993, the negative equity of home-buyers
totalled nearly Pounds 12bn and affected about 1.8m households, of which
more than half were in the south-east.
In an article, released before publication tomorrow of its Quarterly
Bulletin and Inflation Report, the Bank says the continuing effects of high
debt levels are likely to lead to cautious borrowing patterns and moves to
reduce debt in the months ahead.
In the longer term the Bank expects households and corporations to be
willing to take on debt again.
In the personal sector, income gearing - the ratio of net interest payments
to disposable income - is back at the levels of the mid-1980s while the
corporate sector as a whole has reduced its indebtedness sharply since 1992.
But, says the Bank: 'In the recent recession, debt had a much greater impact
on both sectors' behaviour than in the recession of the early 1980s.' House
price falls and debt deflation 'left many recent house-buyers - a
substantial minority of all homeowners, and often young, first-time buyers -
with negative net wealth'.
In the corporate sector, the Bank found that smaller companies were
especially badly hit by high levels of debt. Many companies became
vulnerable to recession through over-expansion in the 1980s when they had
high profit expectations that were not fulfilled.
The Bank says the financial hardships experienced by households have changed
spending patterns and affected the economy as a whole.
For example, lump sum repayments to mortgage lenders rose by 140 per cent
between 1989 and 1993 to reach Pounds 2.5bn, or nearly 5 per cent of
personal sector saving last year.
This increase, at a time of falling mortgage rates, almost certainly
reflected concern among borrowers about debt levels being too high.

<TEXT>
Vodafone has managed to milk its franchise with great skill since the
mid-1980s. But the value of this franchise is dwindling at a pace much
faster than the company's current Pounds 5.5bn capitalisation implies. The
strong rally in Vodafone shares since the middle of last month has been
driven by enthusiasm over its success in winning more than half the mobile
phone market and relief that the new Orange service was not more
aggressively priced at launch.
But these are short-term factors. The medium-term outlook is not so rosy.
Orange will become a more formidable rival from the middle of next year when
its network is fully developed. Mercury One-2-One, the other new player, is
further behind but could accelerate its investment plans. These two
operators will flood the market with capacity. Their marginal costs will
also be below Vodafone's and Cellnet's. Sharp price cuts and margin squeezes
will be unavoidable. Strong growth in demand will counterbalance these
effects but not sufficiently to enable large profit increases beyond the
next few years.
Vodafone will still be able to earn a decent return on its investment for
many years to come. But that is little comfort. The company's net asset
value is only Pounds 600m on a historic cost basis and, given reductions in
telecommunications equipment prices, probably not much more on a replacement
cost basis. Vodafone is now valued at over nine times asset value. When the
market stops looking at the attractive short-term prospects, the shares
could come down with a bump.

FT  09 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Pharmacia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's decision to press ahead with the privatisation of Pharmacia must
come as a relief to the company's management. The drugs group has been a
pawn in a game of industrial chess ever since Volvo bought its stake nine
years ago. The subsequent acquisition spree in Sweden and merger with
Procordia can only have been a distraction from the serious business of
running an international pharmaceuticals group. A trading margin of 14 per
cent - against an industry average in the high 20's - hints at how much work
remains to be done.
Rationalisation should allow Pharmacia to deliver higher earnings over the
next year or two even if sales growth proves elusive. There is nothing in
the company's diverse portfolio of drugs likely to push it into the same
growth league as Astra, Sweden's glamour pharmaceuticals stock. But neither
does Pharmacia rely on a single blockbuster drug or face any damaging patent
expiries. If management can deliver cost-savings, Pharmacia could be a
low-risk bet during a difficult period for the sector.
With the shares yielding around 2.5 per cent, compared with nearly 6 per
cent for Glaxo, international investors will have to be convinced of this
logic if privatisation is to be a runaway success. The eventual sale of
Volvo's 28 per cent stake - although at least 18 months away - and the
government's remaining 10 per cent interest could make it difficult for the
shares to perform even after next month's offering has been digested.

FT  09 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: IBM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM's revamp of its 40,000 salesforce has a laudable enough objective: to
present 'one face' to each customer. Too often the computer giant has
confused its customers by sending in a different representative for each
product. One IBM-er could be peddling mainframes, another data
communications gear and a third personal computers - all to the same
customer and sometimes in competition with each other. The structure also
meant few sales people had a deep knowledge of their customers' businesses.
Under the reorganisation, 14 new divisions responsible for selling a full
range of kit to specific industry sectors such as travel, oil and health
will be created. Though hardly an original idea - Hewlett Packard and
Digital Equipment already operate in this way - the aim of getting closer to
customers has its merits.
The snag is that IBM chief executive Mr Lou Gerstner has not felt able to go
the whole hog. The new industry structure will co-exist with the old
geographical and product structures. IBM's regional chiefdoms will remain,
while part of the salesforce will still be organised on product lines. The
result could be a tangled management matrix. One only has to look at the
snarl-up caused by a similar matrix at Digital to see the risks IBM faces.
Mr Gerstner presumably concluded that a bolder shake-up would have ruffled
too many feathers. While that may have been the right judgment, it serves to
underline how hard it is to turn the IBM juggernaut around.

FT  09 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Shoring up the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's intervention to support the dollar seems to have worked for the
time being, but it has done nothing to reverse the fundamental problem.
Japan has a current account surplus and a capital inflow, while the opposite
pertains in the US. As long as that continues the dollar remains vulnerable.
The immediate assumption was that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its
rate tightening in order better to underpin the dollar. This may yet happen
after Friday's strong employment data, but it is the Treasury which decides
on intervention and is worried about the dollar. The Treasury has no control
over interest rates. Any Fed decision on that score is more likely to be
determined by domestic conditions than its perception of the dollar.
One of the Treasury's concerns, which is all the more understandable in the
light of this week's borrowing operation, is that a weak dollar saps
overseas demand for US bonds. Higher interest rates, of course, would make
this problem worse in the short run. If the Treasury really does believe the
dollar is under-valued, perhaps it should consider another course. It could
cover part of the US budget deficit by borrowing yen.
That would both offset some of the capital flows which have been depressing
the dollar and reduce the weight of supply on the US bond market. Moreover,
with Japanese government bond yields more than three points lower than their
US equivalent it could prove a cheap source of funds. The precedent is the
foreign currency Carter bonds, issued when the dollar was under pressure
during the 1970s. The dollar's subsequent recovery made the bonds an
exceptionally good deal for the US taxpayer.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Shake-up at African bank urged: Consultants criticise
'chaotic' bureaucracy at development body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading member countries of the African Development Bank say they are
holding back the replenishment of the bank's soft-loan fund to demand
fundamental changes in the way Africa's premier lending institution conducts
its business.
Bank governors say they are alarmed at the findings of a task force of
external consultants who recommend a radical shake-up in the institution's
lending policies, projects and personnel.
Their report describes the bank, which receives money chiefly from leading
western industrial countries, as a chaotic, top-heavy bureaucracy, weakened
by the impoverishment of the continent it is meant to help, and riddled with
political intrigue and suspicion.
The report of the Task Force on Project Quality, chaired by Mr David Knox, a
former vice-president of the World Bank, will dominate discussions at the
bank's 30th annual general meeting in Nairobi this week.
'If not strengthened, (the bank) may end up by destroying itself. That is
the stark choice before the entire bank community,' says the confidential
report, a copy of which was obtained by the Financial Times.
Ironically, the task force said it could not assess the quality of the
Dollars 27.8bn (Pounds 19bn) the bank has approved in loans over the past 30
years 'due to the absence of reliable and sufficient data on completed and
active projects'.
The task force said it could not find a central file on any single project.
The bank's financial health has begun to suffer from loan defaults and
arrears, which have topped Dollars 700m, according to Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the
bank's Senegalese president.
'The bank is being pulled in all directions,' says the report. 'Management
mistrusts the board, and vice-versa.'
Almost half of the bank's loans have been awarded to seven of the bank's 51
borrowing members: Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Ivory Coast
and Zaire.
In private, governors say there is open war between Mr Ndiaye and some north
African members of the 18-member executive board. The task force says the
president 'has much authority but no power'. It says the problems associated
with the bank's governance must be solved.
The task force says bank personnel have been unable to keep up with the pace
of growth in project lending. Little attention is paid to the quality of
loans as opposed to quantity.
The task force does not single out individuals or specific groups for blame.
It does, urge African member countries, who own two-thirds of the bank, to
take a more active interest in monitoring the bank's financial health.
vie Thompson says. The relationship between Anglo and De Beers - cemented by
substantial cross shareholdings - has worked well for years and there is no
reason to suppose it will not go on doing so. De Beers concentrates on the
diamond business. Anglo will continue to invest in diamonds through De Beers
and continue to provide De Beers' technical needs - 'that way we can offer
the people we hire much wider scope'.
De Beers needs a very strong balance sheet to be able to finance the troughs
in diamond demand or sudden increases in supply. So it will continue to
build up investment in 'a portfolio of companies competently run, because De
Beers' people need to put all their concentration on diamonds'.
Cashflows will be used for businesses the group knows well. Anglo's profile
might change slightly if South African exchange controls are removed and it
can invest abroad. But as Minorco is cash-rich and unhampered by the
restrictions, 'we are not champing at the bit for that to happen'.
He suggests South Africa should work towards the removal of exchange
controls but 'timing is everything. We cannot run the risk of capital being
withdrawn in a hurry.'
The staying power of the group is well illustrated by De Beers' Central
Selling Organisation which yesterday welcomed clients from all over the
world for a 60th anniversary party.
After last year's record performance - CSO sales reached Dollars 4.4bn
(Pounds 3bn), some 5 per cent ahead of the previous record in 1988 - the
diamond market 'opened firm' this year, says Mr Ogilvie Thompson.
Nevertheless, De Beers faces some substantial challenges.
It is still restricting the quantities of stones it takes from producers who
belong to the cartel - only 85 per cent of those contracted for. This is a
clear sign that supply continues to outpace demand. And stocks are already
high - De Beers' own have a book value of about Dollars 4bn and probably
have a much higher market value.
But the biggest threat to the cartel is Russia, which supplies about 25 per
cent of the world's gem diamonds by value, and whose contract with the CSO
runs out next year. Mr Ogilvie Thompson has already scolded the Russians for
selling diamonds from their stocks 'in contravention of our agreements'.
He says most of those officials in Russia who have been in the diamond
business for years want to stay with the CSO.
Others, such as Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Komdragmet, the Russian diamond
and precious stones committee, 'are not totally committed. We have 18 months
to convince them that it is in their best interests.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Jobs agenda for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To focus attention on everything is to focus it on nothing. This, along with
an unwillingness to confront grim choices, has been the biggest failure of
the European Union's response to its employment problem. The white paper on
growth, competitiveness and employment, discussed at the Brussels European
Council last December, was one example.
Another is a report last week from the House of Lords select committee on
the European Communities. Few stones that might conceal an idea or a new
programme have been left unturned. The result is not so much wrong, as
unhelpful.
European economic growth is not the burning issue: over the past 20 years,
it has compared well with that of the US. Nor is it European
competitiveness: in relation to an entire economy this concept lacks much
meaning. Nor is it even European macroeconomic policy: misguided though it
has recently been, this too shall pass. The issue is that, over the past 20
years, growth in employment has been exiguous, while the overall rate of
unemployment in the European Union has risen, cycle by cycle, and now stands
close to 12 per cent. This is the uniquely European disease, one that has
deeply infected social and political life.
The defect of the white paper was that it provided neither a focused
discussion, nor clear analysis, nor strong policy recommendations. The House
of Lords report fails to remedy these defects. It recognises that 'neither
lack of growth nor loss of competitiveness on their own are sufficient to
explain the comparatively high level of structural unemployment'. But it
avoids the central question, which is whether and, if so, how greater job
creation can be reconciled with Europe's much prized regulatory, tax and
welfare regimes.
Commendably blunt
The latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF shows what is needed. It is
commendably blunt. 'While some policies to increase the flexibility of
labour markets have recently been adopted in Europe,' wrote the IMF, 'most
of these measures attempt to correct distortions stemming from labour market
regulations rather than to change the regulations themselves.' A close
parallel to such tinkering can be found in the EU's approach to reform of
its common agricultural policy, with its set asides and similar command and
control mechanisms. Just as the CAP has created butter mountains, so labour
market interventions have created mountains of surplus labour.
Irrelevant remedies
What then is to be done? First, attention must not be diverted to irrelevant
remedies. French experience has, for example, demonstrated that training is
insufficient to lower unemployment if minimum wages are too high. Similarly,
Europe's investment rates have been above those in the US and, even so, its
jobs record has been far worse.
Second, overhaul of labour market regulations and tax and benefit systems
must be given pride of place. The bulk of the long-term unemployed are to be
found among the low skilled. There is no mystery about why this is so. These
people are discouraged from seeking work by the generous benefits they
receive when they do not work and by the high rate at which benefit is
withdrawn when they do. Simultaneously, employers are discouraged from
offering work by the cost of labour, partly determined by the taxes and
charges they have to pay, not to mention the regulations that govern their
ability to manage their labour forces flexibly.
Analytically, the solution is clear. It is to reduce the wedges between what
it costs an employer to employ someone and the benefit an employee derives
from obtaining such employment. This can be done by radically reforming the
subsidy regime, to promote employment. It need not necessitate the ending of
benefits.
Without radical action, European countries are accepting the persistence of
high unemployment. That may be their least bad choice, given political
constraints. If so, policy-makers should at least be honest about what they
are doing. They must not be allowed to pretend that today's bloated policy
agenda will do much to eradicate Europe's unemployment black spot.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Growth and the Tories
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy must provide some of the few rays of hope left for Britain's
prime minister. But will it be enough to save him and the Tories? Two
questions arise: first, what sort of growth will be delivered in the near
future and, second, will this satisfy the voters? Unfortunately for the
government, growth is unlikely to be impressive enough to win back its
supporters.
Recent evidence does show a steady recovery, with low inflation. Gross
domestic product grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year to
regain its pre-recession peak of four years ago. Unemployment is falling,
while underlying inflation is at its lowest for 25 years. This is good news,
but it is less encouraging on closer inspection. Much of the growth in GDP
was due to a surge in North sea oil and gas production, while output of
manufactures is still 4.2 per cent below its peak in 1990. The fall in
unemployment still leaves 2.72m people out of work; the jobs that have been
created in the recovery have tended to be part-time or self-employed; and
the number of employees in employment has fallen.
The greatest uncertainty concerns the effects of last month's tax increases.
If consumers were to take fright, the UK's largely consumer-led recovery
could be checked. Early evidence is inconclusive. Consumer confidence was
near to a record low in April, according to a Gallup poll, but this report
is at odds with official data on consumer spending. Retail sales grew
rapidly in March and were up by 3.8 per cent on a year earlier, while narrow
money, normally regarded as a good coincident indicator of consumer
spending, increased by 6.2 per cent in the year to April. Lending by banks
and building societies expanded rapidly in March. But much of this was due
to lending to the financial sector, while borrowing for personal consumption
remained weak.
Satisfy public
All in all, the recovery is likely to weather the tax rises and the
government forecast of 2 1/2 per cent growth in the economy this year is
also likely to be met. The problem for Mr Major is that this may not be
enough to satisfy the public. After enjoying growth rates of 4 per cent or
more for successive years between 1985 and 1988, only to be pummelled by a
long recession, voters feel cheated. What is more, although output has
reclaimed its pre-recessionary peak, it is still well below levels people
expected before the recession. Worse still, despite the recovery, real
personal disposable fell in the third quarter of last year and grew by a
paltry 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Taken fright
Even though the public at large has barely registered the recovery so far,
financial markets have already taken fright. The continued rise in bond
rates - now two percentage points higher than during the trough at the turn
of the year - shows that investors at least believe recovery is
well-established. They also expect inflation to start rising. The gap
between yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, which is a good
indicator of inflationary expectations, is up by more than one point since
January, to 4.7 percentage points.
These fears are probably exaggerated. Underlying inflation is quite low.
Import prices, producer prices, pay settlements and unit wage costs all
remain subdued. There is also spare capacity in the economy: the
International Monetary Fund estimates an output gap of 4-5 per cent. If
correct, this should allow the UK several years of non-inflationary growth.
The only significant indication of a pick-up in inflation is the rise in the
rate of growth of average earnings. This increase, from 3.0 per cent in
November to 3.25 per cent in both December and January, indicates that the
trough in earnings has passed.
Financial markets may turn out to be in an unjustifiable tizzy, but lack of
credibility is itself a constraint on policy makers. They may be forced to
raise short-term interest rates far earlier than they would like. Yet even
if economic growth can be sustained at present rates, the necessary increase
in taxes will still prove unpopular. The rise in pre-tax real wages must
also remain modest, if increases in employment are to be sustained. In
short, dissatisfaction is bound to remain rife, which is not good news for
Mr Major and the Tories.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Old ways hamper new prosperity: Entrepreneurs in the Czech
Republic are being held back by a shortage of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jiri Pospisil, a director at the Czech National Bank, seems a hard man to
please. He says he is puzzled by industry's 'slow' response to growing
domestic demand. Although exports from the Czech Republic rose 23 per cent
last year, he is disturbed about a 10 per cent rise in imports. 'Perhaps the
bank should talk to the companies to get a clearer picture,' he suggests.
He might start with Mr Armando Tatar, feisty founder of a small,
two-year-old contact lens maker in Brno, the republic's second city and
oldest industrial centre. He competes with 'western quality at Czech prices'
against three state-owned operations. 'If I had the money,' he says of his
moribund but dominant competitors, 'I would buy them.'
But local banks want loan security of between 100 and 200 per cent and even
then demand interest of up to 18 per cent, he says. Foreign banks are little
use. 'They are only interested in foreign investors, not in us. They always
say 'we can't assess the Czech risk'.'
Risk is one thing, but as Mr Pospisil acknowledges, the lack of a fully
convertible currency - something only the central bank and government can
correct - is a big obstacle to the establishment of an efficient primary
market and to the flow of foreign funds to finance economic revival.
Mr Zdenek Svehla, boss of Prague's Zatka soft drinks company, privatised in
mid-1992 with a Kcs55m (Pounds 1.25m at current rates) loan at a relatively
generous 14 per cent, agrees that raising capital is the entrepreneur's
worst problem. But Czech customers' tendency to ignore invoices is a close
second. 'If we could collect 50 per cent of our receivables we would have no
worries,' he says.
Zatka's only present recourse is to stop deliveries. Prague lawyer Mr
Bohuslav Klein says a company seeking redress has to wait five years for a
hearing in the overloaded courts. Hence some adopt more unconventional
approaches, he says: 'Pay by Tuesday or burn on Wednesday,' for example.
While shortages of capital and the inadequacies of the legal system are
serious obstacles to development, they are not insuperable. Mr Tatar, for
example, was helped by acquaintances in the German optometrics business, who
gave him machinery on a pay-when-you-can basis.
Mr Lubomir Smejkal, chairman of OMB, a busy textiles plant in Brno, has a
more formal agreement with customers in Germany and Austria. Days before his
old, state-owned employer closed on December 31 1991, he and his colleagues
took with them their know-how, customer address books and the machinery to
keep on producing their range of work wear and camping equipment. Production
restarted on January 2 1992.
Valuing this source of western quality goods at Czech prices, OMB customers
funded the purchase of sewing and other machinery on a pay-as-you-go basis.
'At the end of this year it's all ours,' says Mr Smejkal. OMB also has
access to foreign bank credits secured against customers' guarantees of
payment and, since all output goes to Austria and Germany, there is no
trouble with late or non-payment.
In an economy where old ways persist - turnover is still equated with
production by some - OMB seems a model of capitalist correctness. Mr Smejkal
made Kcs1.5m pretax profit on sales of Kcs20m in 1992. Last year, when
turnover soared to Kcs46.2m, profits were reduced to Kcs500,000 as earnings
were ploughed into new machinery.
In the first quarter of the current year OMB made Kcs2.3m pretax profit on
sales of Kcs11.5m, and Mr Smejkal is now confident enough to consider
braving non-payers in the domestic market: 'We might be ready to try selling
here by the end of this year.'
But OMB has yet to win complete control over its destiny. Its offices,
workshops and stores are in a corner of a giant state-owned weaving mill.
Rent is a mere Kcs750,000 a year, but OMB's tenure could be put at risk by
the outcome of negotiations for privatisation of the mill.
Bayerische Vereinsbank, provider of DM200,000 in credit lines, has promised
to help find a way out if OMB must set up in more expensive quarters. When
pressed, Mr Smejkal says he may surrender a stake in OMB to 'our German
friends' as a last resort. But 'management interference' is unacceptable, he
insists.
His attitude reflects rising self-confidence among new entrepreneurs, whose
private businesses now account for a guesstimated 50 per cent of gross
national product. They are driving growth, forecast at a real 3.5 per cent
this year after four years of decline.
Mr Smejkal's resistance to outside 'interference' reflects resentment
against the waves of wheeler-dealers - known locally as 'Johnnie Walkers' -
who swept through in the early days of economic reform.
Mr Smejkal's rejection of outside management also reflects a feeling that
the neighbours' influence is already deemed strong enough. Mr Stephen Bligh,
a partner in KPMG's Prague office, says in terms of numbers of investors
Germany will 'inevitably' be the biggest foreign business presence in the
republic. Apart from heavy-hitters such as Volkswagen, which has a 30 per
cent controlling stake (plus further options) in the Skoda car business,
hundreds of smaller companies have 'infiltrated' the country.
Although real economic growth is expected to start this year, the republic's
'industrial Wirtschaftswunder' has yet to materialise, he says. The second
stage of privatisation is due shortly and should be complete in two years,
he reckons. Restructuring will last another five.
There are signs this phase will be painful. It is a measure of the success
of the private sector so far that it has absorbed almost all workers
displaced by privatisation. National unemployment is less than 4 per cent
and nil in industrial centres.
But there is an awareness of a big overhang of hidden unemployment in the
utilities, chemicals, agriculture and other state industries which remain to
be sold off. Local experts say the best workers and managers from these
businesses have already left for new jobs, and there are few opportunities
for the unskilled residue.
Meanwhile, shortages of skilled labour and management are apparent. The
ABB-PBS boiler works in Brno, taken over last year by the Swedish-Swiss
group, Asea Brown Boveri, pays wages 10 per cent above local engineering
rates to attract talent. Lawyer Mr Klein says Prague-based managers can
already earn as much as their German counterparts and a secretary can earn
two-thirds more than the national average wage.
Although overall labour costs are still low, the new Czech capitalists can
see this gives them only a transient competitive edge internationally and
none domestically. Increased productivity and quality are now the goal. At
ABB-PBS, chief executive Mr Richard Kuba plans in three years to thin the
workforce of 4,000 to 3,200 while expanding volume output three-fold and
matching the parent's quality standards.
At the other end of the scale, the strategy at Mr Tatar's eight-man lens
factory bears some hallmarks of that at ABB. High quality means he must pay
high prices for imported German raw materials, and high wages for skilled
labour, he says. 'If I am to sell at the same prices as the state factories
I need much higher productivity.'
The quality/price relationship is also crucial to Zatka's approach in the
soda pop trade. 'We base our future on the quality of our products,' says Mr
Svehla. That depends on fruit concentrates shipped from Israel and Greece.
Although he competes against 130 indigenous companies and foreign invaders
which together can quench the national thirst twice over, Mr Svehla has few
qualms. He can beat the locals on quality, he says. As for newcomers Coke,
Pepsi and Schweppes, he accepts 'we will never beat them on image or
volume', but Zatka products are 50 per cent cheaper.
Without access to the imports which seem so to irritate the central bank, Mr
Svehla and Mr Tatar would have been hard-pressed to compete and stay in
business. They may tell Mr Pospisil, should he call, that access to imported
capital on reasonable terms may also give home-grown entrepreneurs the
opportunity to build on their modest beginnings.

Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota has come up with a novel idea for
concentrating Canadian minds on the protracted North American trade war over
wheat and barley subsidies. 'We've got 300 Minuteman IIIs in North Dakota
that we're ready to re-target and maybe that will get their attention,' he
recently joshed in a US Senate committee hearing.
Those who berate Canadians for lack of humour must think again, however. Hot
after Conrad's quip, Canada's defence ministry now says it's scrapping the
country's 1,449 nuclear air raid sirens.
Top that, Senator.

Europe's 'green' parties come in all sorts of political shades, but none
comes near to matching the performance of the Hungarian 'greens'. Instead of
campaigning for population control, the Hungarian greens' TV broadcasts call
on Hungarian men to do the 'daily triple' with their wives.
The party does not spell out in detail what it is Hungarian men should do
three times a day. But party officials believe it would 'increase the birth
rate and lead to a decline in homosexuality, prostitution and the divorce
rate'.
However, this brave rallying cry has yet to capture the imagination of the
Hungarian electorate. Early returns suggest that the party has as much
chance of capturing a seat as Britain's Screaming Lord Sutch.

Call it foolhardy, call it courage; few politicians would schedule a keynote
speech by an embattled political leader on a Friday that fell on the 13th of
the month. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist party has done just that
for John Major's closing rally at this week's Inverness party conference.
Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, doesn't inspire much confidence with his
explanation that 'we control a lot of things, but we don't control the

Those seeking straws in the wind concerning the fate of Britain's prime
minister John Major will clutch at this latest one. Apparently he has fallen
almost as low in the eyes of the image-makers as that other great public
relations disaster, Hoover. In a survey of 100 marketing directors around
the UK, Le Fevre Williamson found that Hoover got 11 per cent of the votes
for worst PR image, closely followed by Major at 7 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moving offices from one side of town to the other? Philippe Starck, the
superstar French industrial designer, has solved what can be a traditional
corporate headache with some style. Having transferred his headquarters to
Issy Les Moulineaux on the outskirts of Paris, he compensated his employees
for any upheaval in their travel arrangements by giving each of them a shiny
silver mobylette, or moped, so they can whizz through the traffic jams to
get there.

A visitor to the smart new Gresham Street headquarters of College Hill

The 'shelves' are adorned with classic authors like Ibsen, Dante, Shaw,
Racine and Austin. Austin?
Must be the little-known British linguistic philosopher J L Austin, rather

FT  09 MAY 94 / Observer: A last puff for Fidel?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Fidel Castro really given up smoking cigars? And if he has, what will
make him change his mind and light up one of his favourite Cohibas?
These are not the sort of questions that the New York Times or CBS would put
to Cuba's reclusive president. But then they did not get the scoop, and New
Yorker Marvin Shanken, owner of a two-year-old special interest magazine,
Cigar Aficionado, did.
Like most serious smokers, Fidel can remember the day he gave up - August 26
1985. But hadn't he ever lit up in the privacy of his home? No, said Castro,
arguing that it would involve several accomplices - somebody to buy the
cigars, another to hide the ashes. Clearly, Shanken found this hard to
believe. Not even a puff?
Castro: 'No. No.'
Shanken: 'Not even a little puff?'
Castro: 'Not one.'
So under what circumstances would the president smoke his country's most
famous product? He might be tempted to smoke a cigar of peace with US
president Bill Clinton if the US market was re-opened to Cuban cigars. But
he didn't hold out much hope.
For a start Castro didn't want to lose his no-smoking medal awarded by the
World Health Organisation. And even if the WHO gave the OK, there was still
the problem of Hillary Clinton's new no-smoking policy in the White House.
Poor old Hillary gets blamed for everything these days.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Dollar policy still lacks consistency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'My administration is setting a medium-term goal of stable prices - zero
inflation. We believe a further reduction in inflation is the best way to
secure higher living standards and a sustained reduction in unemployment. To
this end, we would welcome an appreciation of the dollar. We are 100 per
cent behind the Federal Reserve in its efforts to prevent the economy
overheating and protect the currency. We accept that a substantial further
rise in short-term interest rates may be required.'
This imaginary statement is the kind of signal that President Bill Clinton
needs to send if financial markets are fully to regain confidence in the
conduct of US economic policy. To have maximum effect it would need to be
swiftly followed by a half or - better still - a full percentage point
increase in short-term interest rates. Markets might then believe that the
Clinton administration puts the same priority on price and exchange rate
stability as most other governments.
Needless to say, no such statement was forthcoming from the Oval Office last
week. But the US Treasury did offer markets half a loaf. When the Fed and 16
other central banks joined forces to support the dollar last Wednesday, Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, issued a statement sharply different
in tone from previous pronouncements. He said the administration saw 'no
advantage in an undervalued currency,' signalling for the first time a
concern about the level of the dollar rather than its rate of change.
By contrast, the previous Friday, he had stuck to the old formula that
intervention was needed to counter 'disorderly markets' - a code meaning the
Treasury wanted calmer trading conditions but was not trying to alter the
direction of currency movements. As such it was an invitation to markets to
renew their attack on the dollar.
Mr Bentsen's recantation - orchestrated by Mr Larry Summers, the Treasury
undersecretary - is regarded within the US Treasury as a bold departure from
previous policy. By explicitly saying he did not want an undervalued
currency, Mr Bentsen was attempting to put a floor under the dollar.
Yet it makes little sense to take a strong position on the dollar without
also adopting a consistent line on interest rates. Intervention is rarely
successful unless backed by more fundamental policy shifts. One of the
principal reasons why the dollar has been weak recently is that financial
markets regard US monetary policy as significantly looser than that in
Europe and Japan, once allowance is made for countries' different positions
in the economic cycle.
The US has entered its fourth year of expansion and is rapidly approaching
capacity limits; elsewhere output is far below potential because other
countries are still struggling to emerge from recession. Yet real interest
rates are lower in the US than in either Germany or Japan.
The administration was annoyed in early February when the Fed signalled the
first increase in short-term interest rates in five years. It did not think
a tightening of policy was then required and it only grudgingly accepted
subsequent rate increases. The White House blamed the Fed for soaring bond
yields and turmoil in the markets. Belatedly, administration officials are
now perhaps beginning to grasp the political advantages of slowing growth
this year so as to prolong the economic expansion until election day in
1996. But having ridiculed the notion that inflation might rise they will
have to work hard to convince markets that their attitude has really
changed.
In the meantime, the degree of market volatility will depend on the Fed's
willingness to put teeth into Mr Bentsen's dollar policy. After Friday's
very strong employment report, there is no longer any doubt that it needs to
tighten monetary policy again. Since January the economy has generated 1m
new jobs, a marked acceleration in the pace of job creation from the second
half of last year when economic growth averaged nearly 5 per cent at an
annual rate.
Other data last week signalled that the economy is rebounding strongly from
a first quarter weakened by bad weather and other distortions. The
Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the health of manufacturing - rose
more sharply than expected. And the Fed released a notably bullish Beige
Book assessment of regional trends. Highlights included double-digit annual
increases in retail sales in many areas, brisk housing markets and 'near
capacity' production of cars, vehicle parts, steel and building materials.
Ominously, there were reports of significant upward pressure on raw
materials prices.
The economy may now well be growing at an annual rate of 4-5 per cent in
real terms - far above its long-run potential. Some analysts expect
annualised growth this quarter of 6 per cent. With the dollar weak and
credit growing briskly, the case for a decisive tightening of monetary
policy could hardly be stronger. Wall Street is looking for an increase in
short-term rates of half a percentage point, preferably this week but no
later than the Fed's May 17 policy meeting.
If the Fed delivers, it may buy temporary calm in foreign exchange markets.
Ultimately, however, markets want to be reassured that Mr Clinton
understands the economic facts of life. The president needs to declare his
personal commitment to low inflation, sound money and a strong dollar - and
then encourage Mr Greenspan to play tough.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Treasury and Bank in halfway house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once upon a time I used to advise fellow economic journalists that the sure
way of securing prominence for an article was to say that there was a
difference between the UK Treasury and the Bank of England - or if the
writer wanted to be pedantic, a difference of emphasis, as no two
institutions ever entirely agree. This strategy will have to be reassessed,
although not entirely abandoned, in view of the fact that the two
organisations have dipped their toes into the waters of greater openness.
The right attitude now is one of qualified rapture tinged with irony.
The first serious move, taken over a year ago, was the publication of the
Bank's independent quarterly Inflation Report, which the Treasury is now
'only shown in its final form'. Then last November the Bank was given
discretion over the timing of interest rate changes - the substance is still
decided by the chancellor. Finally, there was the decision to publish, after
a gap of six weeks, minutes of the monthly Monetary Meeting between governor
and chancellor.
The plan to publish the minutes has been around about a year. The final
decision was not made until after the disagreement between chancellor and
governor in February over the former's proposals to cut base rates by  1/2
per cent. When the chancellor saw that the minutes recording this could be
published without disaster he recognised a test case and pressed the green
light. In fact, the disagreement took a second day to resolve; and officials
toyed with the idea of pretending that the second meeting never took place
until wiser counsels prevailed.
The published minutes begin with an anodyne set of notes on recent
developments based partly on the Treasury's own Monetary Report, which is
published on the same day and has now been jazzed up in appearance. There
then follows the opening remarks of the governor, Eddie George, set out
fairly fully. Mr George makes sure of this by handing over a full set of his
speaking notes to the Treasury secretariat.
After that comes the chancellor's own assessment, often more briefly given.
Here, however, a minor element of fiction enters. For the chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, usually encourages the Treasury's chief economic adviser,
Prof Alan Budd, to lead off for the Treasury and comes in himself somewhat
later. The rest of the discussion is given as a series of separate and
unrelated points, not attributed to anyone. The final paragraph is called
'Conclusion' and contains the chancellor's summary and decision.
In fact there are quite a large number of people in the room during this
bilateral meeting, including the Treasury's permanent secretary, press
advisers, and Sarah Hogg from the prime minister's office. This makes the
preliminary meeting, between Treasury and Bank officials to prepare the
ground, all the more crucial; and one is assured that these discussions are
more systematic and less pointilliste than the chancellor-governor meeting.
There are good hopes of the official anonymity being penetrated. For
instance, at the February meeting, where the chancellor and governor
disagreed over a base rate cut, Kenneth Clarke complained that the 'advice'
he received was too cautious, but in no way exempted his Treasury officials
from this stricture.
The UK minutes obviously follow the model of the Fed Open Market Committee,
but do not go as far. For the Fed lists who voted for and against the final
decision. But it is in London only where one person has a vote - the
chancellor (presumably the prime minister can whisper in his ear).
The timing of the monetary meeting - a day or two after the publication of
M0 figures - is itself a historical hangover, dating from the time when the
Treasury was still trying to use this aggregate, which consists almost
entirely of notes and coins, as its main monetary target. Now it is but one
of many indicators that are examined. Indeed, the most important clutch of
indicators, such as retail sales, more widely based money and credit,
manufacturing production, unemployment and earnings and producer and retail
prices, all come out around the middle of the month.
Obviously, the two main characters are role playing. Kenneth Clarke fully
intends to let Eddie George take the initiative when the issue is whether to
raise interest rates. The governor, however, is not quite so reconciled to
waiting for the chancellor to propose interest rate reductions. The base
rate cut of January 1993 occurred, of course, before the publication of
minutes. But it was triggered by the Bank's concern over the snail's pace of
economic recovery.
The more typical February 1994 debate was resolved by making the base rate
cut one of a quarter per cent. This is fine, as far as it means smaller and
more frequent changes, which could make monetary policy one degree less
politicised. But it is far from fine if it means that disagreements are to
be resolved by splitting the difference. Both in relation to Bank of England
independence and in relation to greater transparency, the present
arrangements are all too clearly a halfway house.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Costings on works councils exclude a
number of obligations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM R MACKENZIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bert Thierron, general secretary of the European Metalworkers'
Federation (Letters, April 29), has let the cat out of the bag. His costings
for the 190 European works councils meetings EMF has organised are similar
to EEF's. The similarity ends if you know that EMF's costings exclude the
pay of workers' representatives to attend meetings, advisers' costs,
management attendees' time and costs, and all the costs of preparation and
reporting back. The obligations imposed on a company by the current proposal
involve far greater expense than the meetings EMF has organised, as it well
knows. We believe our estimate of up to Pounds 250,000 per meeting may well
be conservative.
Mr Thierron also chastises Unice, the European employers' organisation, for
suggesting that works councils would delay decision making. He says many
existing European works councils agreements provide for consultation
procedures and there have been no reported delays. How odd then that the
European Trades Union Congress's own case study should conclude that 'most
arrangements provide only information, typically covering corporate
strategy' and 'consultation is rare and negotiation is non-existent'.
European business should be aware of the trade union objective. ETUC, to
which EMF belongs, passed a resolution in 1988 on European works councils,
which called for 'the right for workers' representatives (trade unions) to
obstruct any decisions which are taken without prior negotiation'.
Effective information and consultation of employees is vital for any
business. The Commission's own research shows that there is no single
solution. Multinationals have different methods of informing and consulting
employees, reflecting domestic circumstances and cultural differences. These
should be encouraged with no threat of standardised and centralised models
being imposed by legislation.
EEF calls on member states to reject the latest Commission proposal on
European company committees. If member states are intent on pursuing this
legislation, they should listen to the concerns expressed by companies and
accept amendments to the proposal put forward by Unice, EEF and other
employer bodies.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Erroneous 'folklore' on consultants'
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir PETER LEVENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are some erroneous assumptions being peddled as part of an
emerging folklore about the UK government's use of external consultants. I
would like to put some more balanced points down for the record.
Over the past 10 years there has been a significant increase in the use of
external consultants by the public sector. But 'consultancy' is a very
difficult activity to define and many of the blurred boundaries have found
their way into the assumptions which have been incorrectly matched up in
recent articles in the press.
The government is a significant purchaser of external advice and does spend
a considerable amount in this area, as it does on research and on purchasing
contracted services. It is, therefore, important and timely to be looking at
the use of external consultants so that the government can be sure the best
value for money is being obtained. In some cases, the money is well spent;
in others we are not so sure. The Efficiency Unit scrutiny team is examining
whether the purchasing of external advice can be improved. Are there best
practices developed in some areas of government which might be shared more
widely? Are there management systems which might be put in place to assess
benefits and value for money in a more quantifiable way? These and other
questions are part of the team's brief.
Different sources of advice should not be seen as being mutually exclusive.
They can be complementary, with the government purchasing expertise which
does not reside within the public sector. At other times drawing on a
different range of experience would be prudent and desirable.
Many consultancies are, of course, not aimed at producing savings, though in
the long run savings may be achieved. One could cite here improving customer
services, developing training systems and designing strategic management
systems. These lead to benefits but they are not always quantifiable under a
direct bookkeeping type 'savings' heading. It would be foolish indeed to
expect government to put a rigid straitjacket over the decision-making
process, and insist that only one source of advice should be considered
valid expenditure of the taxpayer's pound.
This is a good time to take stock and to look at the value for money
obtained from using external consultants. But it is much more helpful if
this debate takes place on the basis of a final report, with the supporting
data assembled and displayed, rather than at an intermediate stage when not
all of the evidence has been assembled and when the report is still some way
from reaching final conclusions.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Repairing the fault line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It hardly needed the latest Tory tiff over a single European currency -
a natural corollary of the single European market already in being, but
still a remote prospect - to drive home Philip Stephens's point about the
re-emerging 'Tory fault-line over Europe' ('The clock starts to tick for
Major', April 30).
We have, of course, had other alleged fault-lines, notably with regard to
the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (though here, in the events leading up
to Black Wednesday, Britain's own behaviour was at least as much at fault as
anything else). But the real fault-line in British politics now, it seems to
me, runs through No 10 Downing Street, whose occupier - to adapt a remark
about an earlier ruler by the Roman historian Tacitus - seemed eminently fit
to hold the job that goes with it had he not done so. Clearly, it is up to
the Tory party itself, in the first place, to repair that basic shortcoming.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: VAT answer to late payers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R V SIMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One aspect to the late payment of bills which seems to have received
little attention is the effect of VAT.
Large companies remit to Customs &amp; Excise each month the difference between
the VAT which they have charged (output tax) and that which they have been
charged (input tax). If they get paid before they pay their suppliers (for
example, retailers), Customs &amp; Excise tops up the benefit to their cash-flow
by crediting them with the VAT on invoices which they have not in fact paid.
This suggests a simple lever which the chancellor of the exchequer could use
to encourage prompt payment of bills: if a company regularly fails to pay
its bills within 30 days it should be switched to a more onerous VAT regime.
Output tax would still be due to Customs &amp; Excise based on tax point but
input tax could only be claimed in respect of bills actually paid.

FT  09 MAY 94 / The pay demon not yet dead: The upward trend in UK average
earnings could be a matter for concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at the cashmere spinning company Todd &amp; Duncan in Kinross, Scotland,
have just won an 8.5 per cent pay rise, more than three times the current
inflation rate of 2.3 per cent.
Pay rises such as this have contributed to the recent upward trend in UK
average earnings. Last October, earnings were increasing at an annual rate
of 2.1 per cent, but by February, the latest month for which figures are
available, the rate had reached 4.4 per cent.
But as pay-setting enters its busiest season in Britain, there is only a
glimmer of anxiety among employers about the possibility of wage inflation
being spurred by the strengthening recovery and decline in unemployment.
The relaxed mood of Mr Neville Barnes, personnel director at Todd &amp; Duncan,
is part of the explanation. Instead of managing 440 workers for the
company's most hectic production period from February to September, as he
did last year, he now has only 360 workers producing the same amount of
cashmere.
Pay for the 360 is now based on a system of annualised hours, which allows
managers to cope more efficiently with the seasonal peaks and troughs of
consumer demand, and obviates the need to employ temporary contract workers.
'This way you can also reduce excessive overtime during one part of the year
and short-time working at another,' says Mr Barnes.
The 8.5 per cent pay rise - a one-off reward for shifting to the new system
 -is more than paying for itself through higher productivity, so labour
costs per unit of output are lower than last year.
Across manufacturing industry as a whole, unit labour costs are no longer
falling, as they did for periods of last year, but they are scarcely rising.
Average earnings increases of about 4.5 per cent are being almost matched by
productivity gains.
According to the Confederation of British Industry it is such gains that are
driving up pay, and not the slight upturn in inflation (now heading towards
an annual 3 per cent) or even the recent increases in tax and national
insurance contributions.
Nevertheless, the slight rise in pay settlements and the likelihood that
unit labour costs across the economy as a whole will increase by at least 2
per cent this year is causing some concern among employers.
'There is a danger that the old inflationary habits will reappear as the
recovery gets under way,' says Mr Ian Thompson of the Engineering Employers
Federation.
Even small increases in unit labour costs may be bad news, he says. 'To
remain competitive in some sectors you need falling unit labour costs so you
can pass on lower prices or higher quality to the customer.'
The CBI, too, which was recently claiming that British pay-setting was now
more disciplined than Germany's has done an about-face. After a period of
pay laxity induced by unification, German unit labour costs are now falling,
and Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, warns that 'other
countries in Europe are now tackling their cost competitiveness in a
determined way'.
While employers are not yet talking about a new wage-price spiral, they are
markedly less sanguine than the government, which continues to claim that
inflationary pay bargaining - and even the annual pay rise - is a thing of
the past.
The chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, last week celebrated the steady decline
in collective bargaining (which now covers fewer than half of all employees)
and the idea of the 'going rate'.
'It has taken over a decade for both employers and employees to accept that
an annual pay rise need not be inevitable,' he said.
Inflation continues to set a floor beneath pay rises for the large majority
of employees, however. And, as Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Morgan
Stanley, the US investment bank, says: 'Real wage growth has been
substantially stronger during this recession than during the last.'
The low absolute level of earnings increases has disguised the fact that,
relative to inflation, wage growth continued strongly through the recession.
According to Mr Gardiner, real disposable earnings rose only 0.8 per cent in
1980-82 but 7.8 per cent in 1991-93.
'Employers and employees are tacitly colluding, at the expense of the
unemployed, to keep wages and prices higher and output lower than it could
be,' he says.
Events at Todd &amp; Duncan, where 80 jobs (albeit seasonal ones) have gone,
appear to support this view.
The Bank of England, too, warns the government that the UK's pay-setting
system remains biased against employment-creation. In its latest inflation
report, the Bank writes: 'Wages are still strikingly unresponsive to changes
in unemployment. Either the labour-market reforms have yet to bear fruit, or
other forces of inertia are at work to offset them.
'The most important factor preserving the bargaining power of employees may
be the scarcity of their skills and an unwillingness to recruit from the
ranks of the unemployed . . . those in work, whether members of unions or
not, will still be able to push for real wage increases that, in aggregate,
keep others out of work.'
Skill shortages helped to stimulate wage inflation in some sectors at the
end of the 1980s, and there are some signs that they are now returning.
According to a recent Department of Employment survey, 17 per cent of
employers felt that the skills of their existing workforces were inadequate
to meet business objectives.
But there are more prosaic reasons for the recent upward drift in pay. Last
year pay negotiations were dominated by a continuing decline in inflation,
stubbornly high unemployment and a 1.5 per cent pay policy in the public
sector.
This year none of those conditions applies. Inflation is rising slightly,
unemployment is falling, and despite the overall pay bill freeze in the
public sector, most workers will receive rises of close to 3 per cent.
Further, as Mr Bill Callaghan, the chief economist at the Trades Union
Congress, points out, many workers will try to claw back the effect of
income tax and national insurance increases this year through higher pay.
One recent two-year pay deal - at the tractor maker Massey Ferguson - has
recognised the effect of the tax increases by giving a higher rise this year
than next.
The scope for clawing back the effects of tax rises is probably limited,
however. Many economists expect earnings to rise by just over 4 per cent in
1994 with inflation at just over 3 per cent for the year. But the combined
tax rises will cut income by more than 2 per cent, leaving a net reduction
in income of more than 1 per cent.
The final factor contributing to the pick-up in pay is the tenacity of 'pay
drift' - the gap between what is agreed in settlements, still running at 2.5
to 3 per cent, and actual earnings increases, running at about 4 per cent.
Overtime payments are usually an important part of the gap but overtime is
falling at present. Bonuses and profit-sharing, especially in the financial
services sector, may be a more relevant explanation for 'pay drift' and may
lie behind the jump in service sector earnings from 3.1 per cent in January
to 4.8 per cent in February. Some economists worry that whatever the benefit
of an increase in performance and profit-related pay, it may bring the cost
of permanent upward pressure on earnings.
Thus the message to employers from organisations such as the CBI is: do not
fritter away the competitive gains of the past few years.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, employee relations director at the CBI, concludes: 'Given
our history, one can never be confident that our pay problems are behind
us.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: Berio's progress - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current South Bank celebration of Luciano Berio's music, 'Renderings',
gave us a long concert on Thursday ' worth every minute ' devoted to his
eleven Sequenze for virtuoso soloists. The Park Lane Group, who were
responsible for it, must have been proud to field three former 'PLG Young
Artists' whose virtuosity yielded nothing to their international colleagues,
among those the dedicatees of Sequenza VIII (violinist Carlo Chiarappa) and
Sequenza XI (American guitarist Eliot Fisk). Time takes its toll; Berio
turns 70 next year, and the performers who inspired his earlier Sequenze
have mostly retired or died.
There is no modern parallel for his sequence of Sequenze, which stretches
from 1958 to (so far) 1988. Intense, fantastical monologues or monodramas,
they try the possibilities of their solo instruments ' including the unique
persona and mezzo of Cathy Berberian, Berio's first wife and creative
partner (Sequenza III) ' to the limits, and then explore unheard-of new
ones. Yet they aren't primarily virtuoso trials; rather, they find the
composer seeking to create rich, expressive mini-worlds, within the economy
of means that using only one performer must entail.
Few of his famous fellow-serialists of the 1950s and '60s ever seemed to
share Berio's passion for individual human sounds, articulations, gestures.
The Sequenze take loving account of their live performers, though they set
them extravagant challenges. Personalities are forced into the open at full
stretch. After eighty-odd years in which self-effacing service to the score
was the idealised Western standard, that is exciting to hear. Here there was
no weak link in the chain; every soloist drew us into his or her particular
manner and climate, and made Berio's points tell with personal force. It was
a rewarding experience.
A fascinating extra dimension of the sequence was nevertheless obscured:
namely, the continuous development that it traces. In this concert it was
chronologically jumbled ' indeed, the Sequenze were listed without numbers
or years, identified only by artist and instrument. On programming grounds,
probably the fractured order offered better contrasts; perhaps also Berio
wanted us to find our feet with each piece on its own terms.
Still, this is a unique diary of a high-'60s composer's progress: from
arcane musical calculations plus Dadaist theatrical effects (Sequenze I'V)
through cooller developments, more open to the unaided ear and more steadily
dramatised (VI'IX), to the newest virtuoso explosions for scorching trumpet
and luxuriant guitar (X and XI), which trail a lot of knowing history behind
them. Though each can be heard as a brilliant one-off study, they deserve
the deeper perspective of way-stations along a thoughtful path. We don't,
after all, listen to Haydn's or Beethoven's series of quartets as if it made
no difference when they were composed.
This concert was prettily rounded off by Consequents, commissioned from Paul
Roberts, a clever, shapely collage of excerpts from all the Sequenze
soloists together. Saturday's concert offered something analogous but
tighter: the latest (number V) of Berio's own Chemins expansions of some
Sequenza, this time upon Fisk's breathtaking guitar epic. Mixed impressions:
the new orchestral tendrils, mostly harmonic and exuberantly scored, often
swallowed up the central guitar that should focus them.
Franker amplification for him should set it all in better order. The triumph
of that concert was Berio's 1984 Voci, with the honeyed-but-acrid folk-lines
of Aldo Bennici's viola cushioned, titivated and twisted (Chinese whispers])
by Berio's opulent band.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: Tunnel opens to closed minds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal Verdi created his most popular
work, Aida, first performed in Cairo in 1871 to great acclaim. To
commemorate the most spectacular engineering achievement of the twentieth
century, the Channel Tunnel, we had, well, some really nice Kentish
choristers singing their hearts out in a tent.
It is a scandal, a striking expression of loss of national nerve and
ambition, that the artistic contribution to the opening of the Channel
Tunnel on Friday was so negligible. The finger must point at Alistair
Morton, chairman of Euro Tunnel, who might have spared a borrowed mite from
the billions invested in the Tunnel to create an occasion. The government,
too, looks shabby and unimaginative, while local authorities, displaying
their ambivalence to the project, pled poverty.
Worse, there had been plans to do something interesting. There was going to
be an arts festival. Impressive figure followed impressive figure as
festival director. First Luke Rittner, then Michael Nyman, and finally Gavin
Henderson, who each, to their amazement, discovered that they had to raise
the million or so needed themselves by going cap in hand to business and
government.
Things became more farcical with the delays in the opening. About the only
new work inspired by the venture, Michael Nyman's, TGV, actually celebrates,
not least in its music, the French express train which makes British Rail
look like Barkis and his cart. It was first performed last autumn in Lille
when the TGV linked Paris to the north French city which had helped pay for
the work, another embarassment for the British.
Naturally any attempt to have a joint British-French artistic celebration
floundered. The French went their own way and the citizens of Calais on
Saturday night were able to get drenched listening to a new piece by Berio
on the banks of a canal. The English concert was much more humble, but
probably more enjoyable, the choirs of Ashford, Folkestone and Dover coming
together with the few French singers that the Pas de Calais could spare for
some choral favourites.
There was one appealing oddity in the programme, unearthed by conductor Mark
Deller: 'The song of the railways', commissioned from Berlioz in 1846, by
who else but the town of Lille, to celebrate the first coming of the train.
It is a rousing piece of popular art, as catchy as an operatic chorus, and
well worth this timely revival. Its disappearance is attributed to a
disgruntled citizen stealing the parts before the second performance because
he had not been invited to the celebratory ball.
But one musical footnote is hardly comparable to Aida. There will of course
be plenty more events for the Channel Tunnel to celebrate - the appearance
of the first paying passengers for example. It should start planning now. It
could get advice from South East Arts which has done its best, by
commissioning photographic exhibitions on the theme of the Tunnel and
forging artistic exchanges with France, to make something of this rare
occasion when the eyes of the world are focused on its region.
For South East Arts feels neglected, and with justification. Its citizens
receive much less arts expenditure per head from the Arts Council than
anyone else in the country. The Council seems to think they can go to London
for their artistic fix, a belief belied by a British Rail timetable. Still
South East Arts is putting the Tunnel fiasco behind it and getting back to
basics.
It has just given Kent Opera a grant, a small sum but one that will help
Norman Platt's much admired creation, killed off by the Arts Council to
universal opprobrium in 1989, to rise again, with performances of Benjamin
Britten's church parable, The Prodigal Son, opening in Bath on June 9th. A
work by Purcell, perhaps even a masque, is planned for 1995.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: To reconcile two quarrelling sisters - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a theory that the English find it difficult to think in three
dimensions and that the plastic arts are less appreciated here than the two
dimensional or the literary. This exhibition shows that it has not always
been the case. Architects' designs for sculpture 1600-1951 (until June 11,
RIBA Heinz Gallery 21, Portman Square, London, W1) may not sound the most
gripping of titles but the subject is a fascinating and much neglected one.
Tim Knox, the curator of the exhibition, is one of the few scholars and
historians with a real love for sculpture as well as an understanding of
architecture. He quotes, in his small leaflet that accompanies this
exhibition, the immortal words of Ruskin: 'Architecture stripped of
sculpture is at best a convenient arrangement of dead walls; associated,
they not only adorn but reciprocally exalt each other, and give to all the
arts of the country in which they exist, a correspondent love of majesty.'
When looking at this exhibition, spanning some 450 years and taken from the
rich archives of the RIBA drawings collection, we see how sculpture and
buildings had always been natural handmaidens. As we enter the entrance
hall, the first thing we see is the splendid model of the Festival of
Britain Sea and Ships pavilion, designed by Sir Basil Spence in 1951. This
fascinating but temporary building was embellished throughout with works of
art.
It was in many ways a model of how things might have been if modern
architects had continued the kind of collaborative partnership that Spence
encouraged with other artists. He was to do the same thing at Coventy
Cathedral, where Epstein's figures of St Michael and the devil are among the
last conventional figurative sculptural commissions for a public building in
this century. We have now become much more used to the inevitable Henry
Moore on its lonely plinth outside a contemporary building.
No one can doubt the fact that sculpture and architecture are sister arts -
but standing as we do, contemplating the sad fag-end of modernism at the end
of this century, all one can see in contemporary buildings is the visible
evidence of the sisters' quarrel and falling out.
The lack of understanding of sculpture, or indeed many of the visual arts,
by contemporary architects is yet another example of their isolation. Knox
does not enlighten us much about the current divorce between artists and
architects beyond saying that engineering is now the ruling force in
architecture, and that something like the Lloyds' building is itself so much
a three dimensional object that it leaves no room for any other form of
artistic commission.
Architects traditionally learned to draw from the casts of antique
sculpture, and on their Grand Tour travels in Italy and Greece, it was
sculpture as much as architecture that took the eye. The evidence of those
travels shows up well in the early part of the 18th century when pediments
and skylines of new town and country houses were bristling with
authentically classical sculpture. The choice of subjects for pediments,
'Hercules cleaning out the Augean cow byres', for example, ranges from the
bizarre to the conventional. The formal arrangements of eighteenth century
classical architecture demanded controlled cooperation from sculptors and
they clearly enjoyed the discipline of working within a classical framework.
Sculptors of the calibre of Rysbrack and Flaxman enjoyed the chance to work
on a large scale and in prominent places.
Knox is wise to point out that the Reformation killed off religious
sculpture in England; and the modest scale of royal and state patronage also
denied architects and artists the chance offered to their European
colleagues - that of working on an heroic scale. English Baroque
architecture does not have the sculptural content of much European
architecture of the same date.
By the middle of the nineteenth century there was a flowering of sculpture
and decoration that matched the boom in architectural commissions. The
Gothic revival and especially the work of Pugin and Barry at the Palace of
Westminster brought the combination of the plastic arts and architecture to
an unsurpassed apotheosis: the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the revival of
church furnishings encouraged by the Ecclesiological Society almost led to
the mass production of ornament and sculpture. Commercial firms took on the
task of promoting ornament and the manufacture of artificial stone,
terracotta and other materials made sculptural decoration universally
available. The drawings in the exhibition of the Alfred Waterhouse's Natural
History Museum show anthropomorphic art and decoration on a scale that no
architect could ever imagine today.
I particularly admired the intense drawings of Henry Wilson, who was to
abandon full scale sculptural work and concentrate on his Arts and Crafts
jewellery. His First World War memorial at Tonbridge school is a brilliant
creation and it is a scandal that it is still lying dismembered after the
fire that recently destroyed almost the whole school chapel.
The attempt to show drawings of twentieth century works is inevitably
limited. There is a telling horror of a student drawing by Lubetkin, a giant
howitzer running with a flow of red water - a crude attempt to dramatise the
horror of war in an animated memorial (mercifully never built).

It was argued in a recent discussion of Schindler's List that the time had
come to stop harping on the appalling crimes of the Nazis. It was unjust, it
was suggested, for a new generation of Germans to be weighed down by the
sins of the past. But with neo-fascist movements gaining ground among this
very generation (in Italy, France and Germany), the argument should surely
be resisted.
Horizon comes up with Auschwitz: The Blue Prints of Genocide (BBC2, 8pm),
showing how architectural plans and documents relating to the death camp
have been kept, until now, in a secret library in Moscow. They give the lie
to the revisionists who maintain that there never was any 'final solution'.
The fashion for swift repeats gains ground. BBC1 begins a repeat of Stark,
the dramatisation of Ben Elton's comedy/satire about a plot to ruin the
earth. Elton stars as the modern Candide figure, CD (10.15pm).
Following yesterday's opening of its Watergate series, BBC2 sets out to
answer the question Whatever Happened to Woodward and Bernstein?, the two
reporters who broke the story (11.15pm).

FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: Square Dance cachet - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Ballet's amoebic existence this month - the company split
for visits to small theatres - took one half (with an orchestra) to High
Wycombe's Swan Theatre this week. The especial cachet of the tour is the
acquisition of Balanchine's Square Dance. It is a stunning piece, with the
conventions of American folksiness re-thought for ballet. There was, in the
staging of 1957, a 'caller' yapping through the Vivaldi and Corelli concerti
which are the score. He was a pestilential bore, and has mercifully long
been abandoned.
As now mounted, and well presented and lit, by ENB, curtain-rise reveals a
luminous area containing six couples in simplest Balanchinian dress against
a cyclorama. The look of the stage, after the Raymonda grand pas which began
the programme with dark draperies, chandeliers and mimsy costuming, was like
cool water after a glass of treacle-ish madeira. (The effect of the
performances the same).
The dance sets out clean patterns, and there enter two principals - Hope
Muir and Giuseppe Picone on Wednesday afternoon. Square Dance is
uncompromising in its clarity, and must be uncompromised in performance. I
thought ENB's dancers made a fine first shot at choreography which offers
them discipline, ideals of physical acuity, and not a little gaiety. They
look good. A little more physical drive will make them look better, but this
is dance - marvel suits them and they seem proud and happy in it. Hope Muir
has the qualities of bright assurance her role needs; Picone, a young
Italian recruit to the company, promises marvels. Brave technique, a premier
danseur's physique and elegance of means, mark him as a talent to watch. In
the nobly contemplative variation which Balanchine added to the ballet for
the tremendous Bart Cook (a solo also danced with memorable poetry by Sean
Lavery), Picone showed just how gifted he is.
The opening Raymonda grand pas also brought remarkable male dancing.
Frederic Franklin has set this collection of Petipa variations very well.
They are devilishly hard to bring off, and need grander forces than anyone
but the Bolshoi or Kirov can field. ENB's dancers do an honest best, but it
was the former Kirov danseur Dmitri Gruzdyev (now with ENB) who told the
truth about its style. It is a matter of dignity and broad phrasing in
movement: Gruzdyev knows how to sustain interest in what is really a
collection of academic cliches because his training is sprung from
Raymonda's traditions. Across the century since its first performance,
blood-lines from Sergey Legat (who created the role) to Gruzdyev are still
to be traced.
This triple bill ends with Wayne Sleep's Savoy Suite. I was not enchanted by
it at an initial showing last year.
ENB's tour visits Crawley, Dartford, Darlington, Basingstoke, during the
next fortnight.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel: High - and dry if you want it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wine-enthusiast readers of Business Traveller may feel rather short-changed
by last month's issue. For the last eight Aprils the London-based magazine
has published the results of its trail-blazing comparison of the big
airlines' wine selections.
But this year its editor, Gill Upton, has bowed out of the comparative
tasting notes and rankings game, partly because of the 'nightmare' of
organising last year's taste-offs actually in-flight (at the behest of the
airlines), but also because business travellers seem to be less and less
interested in what they eat and drink.
In the 10 years the magazine has been polling its readers on how they rate
airlines' attributes, food and wine has fallen from fourth to ninth place.
This drop may, of course, reflect the considerable improvement in in-flight
catering since the early 1980s. Certainly a number of airlines have targeted
food and, particularly, wine as a significant marketing tool. According to
Peter Nixson, British Airways' chief cellarer: 'Wine is one of the areas in
which you can make a significant improvement over your competitors.'
Most of the big airlines have been hard at work on their wine lists over the
past few years, sometimes sponsoring wine competitions and often hiring
outside help. American Airlines, for example, has featured its wine expert
Dr Richard Vine, looking serious in tenebrous cellars, in its advertising
campaigns.
BA meanwhile has called upon the services of wine writer Hugh Johnson,
Michael Broadbent of Christie's and Master of Wine Colin Anderson to help
select the 340,000 cases of wine it buys each year. And Singapore Airlines
has regularly fought BA and American Airlines for first place in
inter-airline wine comparisons, thanks to its panel of tasters carefully
drawn from Britain, Australia and California.
It is BA's Anderson who has conducted some of the most detailed research on
the psychological and physiological effects of wine drinking in the air. He
maintains that our tasting ability is impaired at 33,000 ft, chiefly because
of dehydration which dries out the sensory membranes.
The upshot is that acidity and tannin tend to be accentuated, making even
the fruitiest champagne taste leaner than it should, and flattering fruity
exuberant wine styles such as those produced in the New World.
The cabin pressurisation also tends to thin the blood slightly, which means
that the effects of alcohol are accentuated. This, together with the
generally dehydrating effect of air travel, means it is essential to
alternate non-alcoholic drinks with alcoholic ones.
Another important factor is stress. For many travellers, alcohol is used as
an antidote to fear of flying, or simply a release from an angst-ridden
airport experience.
As Nixson puts it: 'The chances are that the first glass goes down without
even touching the sides of the mouth.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Management: Old soldiers do not fade away - It's time to put
an end to age discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WARR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stereotypes about older employees give rise to a great deal of prejudice.
That is obvious to the middle-aged manager who becomes unemployed and has to
start applying for jobs.
Invalid negative stereotypes, though, also determine what happens to people
who are still in work. These have been reinforced in recent years by the
widespread encouragement of early retirement for many managers. Those
individuals are thereby publicly defined as 'too old', and as a result
negative attitudes to other people of the same age become even more fixed.
Research has indicated that the stereotypes applied in decision-making about
older workers are widely incorrect. The mental decline that takes place up
to the mid-60s is very small, and is limited to only a few types of
information- processing. In most activities, there is no overall difference
between the work performance of older and younger staff.
Furthermore, older employees have available depths of knowledge and
expertise built up over years of relevant experience.
Prejudice against older staff is often seen in decisions taken about the
provision of training at different ages. Many companies restrict learning
opportunities at older ages, for instance by emphasising that individuals
cannot be spared from their immediate work activities.
Two surveys by the London School of Economics have found that the amount of
training declines rapidly as a manager gets older. This is despite the
belief (expressed by nearly 90 per cent) that 'the business environment is
changing so rapidly that managers need more training than in the past'.
As a result of this age-imbalance, older managers can become out of practice
as learners, and they sometimes feel uneasy about entering new training
situations. But that is not to say that they cannot learn. Other research
has shown that older individuals can acquire new skills and knowledge,
especially when learning involves practical activities rather than being
merely abstract and unused. Older learners, in particular, benefit from
opportunities to turn into action the general principles and specific facts
which need to be acquired.
So what to do? First, throw out the overall negative stereotype. Look at the
person, not at his or her age.
Second, if some staff changes are essential, ensure that early retirement or
age-based redundancy are not automatically viewed as the primary option.
Think initially about other routes to competitiveness, through job redesign,
lateral transfers, training and other procedures which can utilise important
expertise and knowledge.
Third, if a number of older managers have to be asked to leave, seek to
retain their skills through some form of subsequent contract, perhaps
intermittent or part-time, or perhaps as a consultant.
Fourth, and most fundamentally, work towards a culture of adaptability at
all ages. Current levels of competition and the pace of change mean that new
ideas, procedures and products must be sought all the time.
The best way to develop adaptability is to keep people learning. It often
makes sense to plan the movement of managers sideways to different jobs,
where new demands will be placed upon them. It is clear that flatter
organisations will require career ladders to be shorter.
In a corporate culture of continued learning, the strengths of the older
manager can be a foundation for company success. At present, too many
organisations are responding to a socially-fashionable idea that youth is
best. Research makes it clear that neither youth nor age is in fact best: it
all depends on the individual.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Another dragon awakes - The charms and
hassles of doing business in Hanoi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only an hour by air from other Asian business centres, with their towering
office blocks, glitzy hotels and pollution, Hanoi could inhabit another
world. Its crumbling colonial villas and tree-lined avenues give it the
appearance of a town in southern France. It has only one five-star hotel and
its most common form of public transport is the cyclo, a sort of bath chair
pushed by a bicycle.
Anyone who has spent hours in a Bangkok traffic jam will appreciate one of
the Vietnamese capital's greatest pleasures - it rarely takes more than 15
minutes to get anywhere. But this is the only time-saving aspect of doing
business in the city. 'If you think you're going to fly in to Vietnam and
sign a deal after one week you're naive. And if you do sign a deal after a
week you're foolish,' says David Drinkard, Digital Equipment's
representative in Hanoi.
Whereas in Hong Kong or Singapore business can be conducted by fax or phone,
in Hanoi almost everything requires at least one, often drawn-out, meeting.
The Vietnamese delight in formalities requiring elaborate ceremonies,
complete with champagne (Russian) and photo sessions.
Meeting venues are dingy rooms where low-slung sofas are usually placed on
either side of a coffee table across which delegations face each other,
sometimes peering around a vase with a couple of dusty plastic roses in it.
Compared with their counterparts in other Asian centres, Hanoi officials and
businessmen are inexperienced when it comes to international deals. 'They're
not uneducated but they haven't been exposed to such things as business
plans and requests for proposals,' says Mr Drinkard. This makes it advisable
to reiterate detail as Vietnamese, like most Asians, hate losing face and so
rarely question things they do not understand.
Yet any foreigner who thinks he or she is dealing with people who have no
knowledge of the outside world is wrong. Hanoi is a city of linguists.
Languages spoken range from French and Russian to Chinese and Spanish (with
a Cuban accent). Links with communist countries were once strong and many
Vietnamese studied or worked in eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union.
From its own communist past, Vietnam is being hurled into the 21st century
at an alarming pace. In offices which seem unchanged since the 1940s, there
will be a cordless telephone. And the crumbling terracotta roofs of
ministries sprout satellite dishes.
There are signs that Hanoi is quickly learning how to accommodate the hordes
of businessmen clamouring to enter what they predict will be the next dragon
economy.
It is now possible to phone for an air-conditioned taxi or order a take-away
pizza from a restaurant run by an Australian.
Decent accommodation, however, is less easy to find and expensive when you
can. The Metropole remains the only hotel meeting western standards and is
usually fully booked. But a host of tels are springing up. These are eight-
to 10-room wonders where, among the kitsch statues of Greek goddesses and
hideous nylon bed linen, staff are friendly and satellite TV and IDD
facilities are available.
Since credit cards and travellers cheques are not in wide use it is best to
take cash. Dollars are eagerly accepted and it is adviseable to have a
supply of dong, the local currency, since a cyclo ride costs only a fraction
of a dollar.
But Hanoi, whether charming or frustrating for the traveller, is changing
fast. Multi-million dollar hotel projects, high-rise apartments and office
blocks are planned, and these threaten to alter radically one of Asia's most
delightful cities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malcolm de Saulles, in his 28th year with Rover, saw his post as senior
finance analyst disappear 18 months ago. But while his job became redundant,
he did not, moving through a series of project posts until he was asked if
he would accept production-line work.
He now works on the Discovery transfer case, the part that is attached to
the gearbox and converts the vehicle to four-wheel drive. 'For the first
fortnight I couldn't move a muscle. It was devastating. Then I got used to
it and now it is great,' he says.
For others, such as John McSheffrey, a heat treatment supervisor, the
transition has been more difficult. He has no intention of going to an
hourly-paid job and is seeking other opportunities within and outside the
company. 'I want to be a production manager if I can, whether here or
elsewhere.'
Lynne Hindmarsh, a former clerical worker in credit control and inventory,
has signed a contract as a fork-lift truck driver on the production line.
'I had done a succession of projects since my former post was displaced,
then 15 of us in my area were asked if they wanted to go on to the
production line. Only two of us said we would. Frankly, it's hard work. I
didn't realise how easy it was behind a desk.'
All who cross over to production-line jobs have been guaranteed their former
salaries for two years. With the opportunity to earn overtime on top it has
increased earnings potential in the short term. 'I can gross Pounds 700 a
month in extra overtime so financially I have never had it so good,' says de
Saulles.
In the long term, however, all of them know their salaries are not assured.
De Saulles says he has not yet opted to change his contract but is thinking
about doing so. 'I'm very happy doing what I'm doing, which I can't
understand in some respects, but I am.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Management: Rover's cultural revolution - Richard Donkin
discovers what white-collar workers do at the car manufacturer when their
old jobs disappear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Assembly-line workers jeered Terry Morgan, the chief executive of
Land-rover, when he addressed a factory meeting wearing grey overalls. They
thought it was some kind of gimmick. That was three years ago, he is still
wearing them, and people don't jeer anymore.
Managers admit that outsiders can still find it disconcerting to be greeted
by a British executive in a grey 'workers' suit, rather like coming across
someone from the Chinese communist party central office, mid-cultural
revolution, on a number seven bus. The comparison grows more acute at Rover
which, perhaps more than any other British manufacturer, has been undergoing
its own cultural revolution.
New Deal, the company's agreement with the unions in 1992, secured a
management pledge of job security for all. The way that it is being
engineered has led to some tough career decisions for managers and
administrative staff watching their old jobs disappear through technological
change.
Current Rover vacancies are almost all in assembly-line jobs but when the
company asked for volunteers last November from white-collar staff to move
across, few stepped forward. So far only 200 out of a hoped-for 500 or so
have crossed over to hourly-paid production jobs and not all have yet signed
new, blue-collar contracts. Others are thinking about it. Staff report a
lowering of morale among many of those canvassed to consider changing jobs
and the company admits it will have to recruit from outside.
The need to encourage cross-overs became apparent when Rover found itself
top-heavy with clerical and administrative employees. Its shift from volume
car producer to niche manufacturer has led to greater emphasis on front-line
production workers.
At Landrover, for example, after the vehicle frame has come out of the body
shop into the main assembly plant, there are no robots, and all the work is
done by hand. Computer-based ordering, which allows any specification on any
model to be tapped down the telephone line, is reducing the clerical roll.
This has led management to seek greater flexibility in the workforce. Part
of this process includes encouragement of and opportunities for continuous
skills development through course work at Rover's training and development
centre.
Much of the groundwork on harmonisation of conditions of service has already
been established, but removing the old white-collar, blue-collar distinction
in employees' minds is more difficult. One way has been to encourage
white-collar staff to take part in assembly-line work on Saturdays. Another
practice developed to create all-round awareness of the assembly role has
been for new graduates to complete what has been dubbed 'national service'
for three months on the production line.
The main difficulty for those who have opted to cross over has been making
the adjustment (see above). Complex emotions are involved when people who
are used to arriving with a briefcase are asked to don overalls and wield a
spanner. Although the management has tried to remove the trappings of status
they have not been completely banished from people's minds; and for some the
physical demands of the new job are too much.
Equality in the workplace is beginning to happen, led by management.
Equality, used in this context, does not mean equal pay for all or even
equal perks. But it does mean a removal of the 'us and them' barriers, the
boss-worker relationship and the old concept of status.
Executives not wearing overalls are more likely to attract sarcastic
comments today. When Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman, visited the
Rover plants immediately after BMW's takeover announcement in February, 'we
had some overalls run up for him although the name tab was a bit of a
problem. It almost ran down his sleeve,' says David Bower, Rover's director
of personnel.
Rover name tabs do not indicate position. Like many of Britain's newly
restructured companies, Rover has a flattened-out management structure. 'I'm
only one step away from the managing director's job,' says Bernard Sullivan,
Rover's training and development manager. Sullivan enjoys a reputation as
something of a management specialist on the conference circuit and his views
command respect - yet you could not tell him from a council binman by his
dress and that is how Rover wants it.
The philosophy on working practices goes much deeper than dress, however.
Many of the ideas are drawn from Japan, although management was sceptical
that Japanese culture could be transported to Rover before they saw how it
had been adapted in a US Honda factory in Marysville, Ohio in 1986.
'Suddenly we were thinking if it can happen in the US, it can happen here,'
says Bower.
The need for change had already been established that year when the company
carried out the first of a series of attitude surveys among employees. 'The
things people told us were important to them have not changed over the
years. They wanted a degree of challenge in their work and to participate in
problem solving. They were concerned about the quality of training to
develop the skills to do their job and they wanted opportunities to advance
themselves in the business. They were concerned about the quality of
communication and the quality of leadership,' says Bower.
Sullivan explains the new approach to flexibility thus: 'There may well be a
job for life but it won't be the same job. You may start out as a fitter,
become managing director and end up as a fitter.'
Rover says Pischetsrieder has no plans to change working practices at the
Rover plants, nor do Rover managers plan to copy BMW systems. The main
impression from visiting Rover plants today is that there is a much greater
degree of honesty between management and the workforce. It is a far cry from
the British Leyland days.
'There is no end to this story,' says Bower. 'Continuous change is part and
parcel of being competitive and staying alive. The challenge is to maintain
the bulk of the improvement so people become part of it but not overwhelmed
by it.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Travel variations across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hotels and airlines are busy promoting discount prices, but companies are
under no illusions that travel still accounts for a big slice of their costs
whatever is on offer. A study by market researchers Mori for travel agency
Thomas Cook says that travel is the third biggest corporate expense in
Europe after salaries and information technology.
Almost half the 298 companies questioned had a firm policy to control
corporate travel, but the details varied by country and business sector.
Banking and finance companies are the most likely to impose a company-wide
travel policy.
The UK had the highest proportion, 59 per cent, of companies where travel
policy was made at the corporate level, and the second highest, 25 per cent,
with the individual traveller having the sole control. The remaining
companies left decision-making to departments or a combination of
individuals and departments.
Germany, by contrast, relied on departmental rules more than other countries
and had the second lowest level of control, 30 per cent, at the corporate
level. Other national characteristics included French companies' enthusiasm
for driving a hard bargain with the travel agency, while the Swiss and
Swedes were least concerned about money.
Four out of five Italian companies rated it important or very important for
the agent to be nearby, a factor which was hardly relevant for Swiss,
Swedish and Dutch companies.
Swiss companies are keen on their travel agents taking a back seat in travel
management, while the UK, Sweden and France want their agency to be
'proactive'.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): United does more business at home
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines said last week that domestically it had experienced stronger
traffic and improved passenger loads. 'These were driven in part by low
fares,' said J C Pope, president and chief operating officer.
United's total scheduled revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 6.1 per
cent in April, compared with the same month of 1993. Available seat miles
rose by 0.8 per cent.
The scheduled passenger load factor was 68.1 per cent, compared with 64.7
per cent a year ago.
The airline's total scheduled RPMs were 8.27bn compared with 7.8bn in the
same month of 1993.
United flew 5.75m passengers in scheduled services in April, an increase of
3.6 per cent over the 5.55m flown a year earlier.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Continental Airlines cuts fares to
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Airlines has announced new one-way fares from the US to Europe.
According to the airline, these will reduce the price of some tickets by up
to 67 per cent. The fully-refundable, unrestricted fares are available on
every seat on every flight and do not need to be purchased in advance.
A flight to London will cost between Dollars 349 and Dollars 499 each way.
Fares to Paris range from Dollars 399 to Dollars 499, and those to
Frankfurt, Munich and Madrid will cost from Dollars 349 to Dollars 549.
Fares for weekend travel are Dollars 50 higher.
American Airlines says it will match Continental's fares, but only on a
round-trip basis until September 15.
Trans World Airlines says it will respond with fully-refunable, one-way
fares in certain international markets.
Delta Airlines is looking at the new fare structure but is not sure it will
follow suit.

FT  09 MAY 94 / The Monday Interview: The longest swansong on Wall Street /
A look at what makes Felix Rohatyn probably the most renowned investment
banker in America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You sit in the ante-room and wonder at its drabness. The non-descript
wallpaper, the table too big for the room - you have to edge around it to
peer out of the window on to Manhattan's West Side. No corporate art
collections on display here.
Who else has been ushered into this anonymous receptacle in recent months?
Martin Davis, the erstwhile boss of Paramount Communications, perhaps, or
Howard Stein, who is selling his Dreyfus mutual funds group to Mellon Bank.
Or maybe Stephen Wolf, head of United Airlines, which recently sold a
majority stake to its unions, or Garry Wendt, whose GE Capital yesterday
announced an agreed merger with the Kemper financial services group.
A door to the inner office opens and Felix Rohatyn sweeps in. Or rather, he
bustles. A compact, slightly rumpled man in his mid-sixties, Rohatyn moves
to the far side of the vast expanse of table. With sharp eyes behind his
thick-rimmed glasses, he looks like an alert elderly uncle. You have to
pinch yourself to remember that this is probably the US's most renowned
investment banker. Though he will hit 66 at the end of this month, Rohatyn,
a senior partner at Lazard Freres, is still very much in the thick of
things.
The takeover wave of the late 1980s had seemed likely to be his last fling.
Nearly six years ago, Business Week was moved to ponder 'the post-Felix era'
at Lazard: 'Rohatyn at 60 is not the ravenous gatherer of new business he
once was.' But the 1990s takeover boom has projected him back into the
limelight, even as many of his contemporaries are moving into retirement.
'There is a generational change,' says one (much younger) merger and
acquisition head on Wall Street. 'But Felix is Felix - he gets introduced to
other people by people he knows.' The business gathering has not faltered.
Rohatyn's swansong can probably be attributed in equal measure to his
contacts, his reputation, and his style. The contacts have been formed over
many years: the relationship with Howard Stein, the 66-year-old head of
Dreyfus, dates back 25 years, says Rohatyn. Martin Davis, who retained the
Lazard banker to advise him on the sale of Paramount, is also a long-term
friend.
The election of a Democratic president has buoyed the fortunes of Rohatyn,
himself a life-long Democrat and a man once talked of as a Clinton Treasury
secretary. A position on the airline commission set up by the Clinton
administration last year served as an introduction to Wolf of United
Airlines. Wolf was having trouble persuading the airline's unions to make
big concessions in return for a majority stake. 'He showed up one day in my
office and said he would like to retain us - and me specifically - because
he thought it would help to convince the unions that he was serious,' says
Rohatyn.
If Rohatyn's style suits the times, it is because he largely stood back from
the 'binge of leverage' in the late 1980s, says Martin Lipton, the US's top
takeover lawyer, and a contemporary and close friend. The more considered,
less super-heated takeover market of the 1990s has suited him better.
Rohatyn himself characterises the current wave of takeovers in the US as
being 'driven by technological or regulatory or legislative changes -
whether it is the regulation and technology of communications and media, the
legislation and the changes coming in healthcare, or in banking, or in
mutual funds'. His verdict on the resulting restructuring in some of the
biggest industries in the US: 'It's real - it's reality. It's not whether
you can sell a junk bond to an S&amp;L' The exception, perhaps, was Paramount.
The stress of that Dollars 10bn battle is clear from Rohatyn's verdict now:
'Probably the most difficult and personally-draining experience I have ever
been through.'
His reputation did not emerge unscathed. Last summer, with Rohatyn advising
him, Davies agreed an Dollars 8bn takeover by Viacom in a transaction
designed to discourage any other bidders. The courts later ruled that cozy
deal illegal, opening the way for a bidding war which eventually forced
Viacom to pay some Dollars 10bn for its conquest (and left Davies without a
job).
Rohatyn still sticks by the original plan. Explaining why the agreed deal
with Viacom had been hatched, he says that, even though the deal was widely
leaked, no one else came forward to express an interest in the buying the
group - and 'you don't shop a Dollars 10bn company around, you really don't
 -it doesn't happen.' He adds: 'I would argue frankly that the original deal
would have created a very powerful company in terms of capital structure.
That, over time, would have been a much better deal than going through this
whole agony and winding up with a highly-leveraged business that will
require dispositions of assets.'
Rivals, though, say Rohatyn should have put Paramount's shareholders first.
'He got a black eye. We will use that when talking to their clients in
future,' says a senior investment banker at another Wall Street firm.
Davis is leaving Paramount. Stein, at 66, is unlikely to stay long with
Mellon. Wolf is planning to step down when (if) United's shareholders
approve the buy-out. ('I can't take credit for that one - he had decided to
leave before he even showed up in my office,' says Rohatyn.) The loss of old
ties makes business-gathering harder.
And Rohatyn, though active, is less intimately involved in deal-making than
he was. 'Back in the 70s, we would go seven days a week, 14 or 16 hours a
day,' says Lipton. Not any more. 'Felix takes more vacations than he used
to, and he doesn't work as hard as he used to - none of us in our sixties
(does).' For now, he does not plan to leave Lazard - though 'I certainly do
have plans to spend more time on other things.' He is involved on a UN
commission, acts as vice chairman of Carnegie Hall and hopes to serve on
other official US commissions, for instance.
If the right offer came from the Clinton administration? 'If the president
asks you to do something, you do it - but it's certainly not something I
expect or am seeking.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / People: A future on other side of turf war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After drifting for two years without a permanent helmsman, the agency which
supervises the rapidly growing and often controversial derivatives industry
in the US has now found a well-qualified new head-in-waiting. President
Clinton last week said he intends to nominate 38-year-old Mary Schapiro as
chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, writes Laurie Morse in
Chicago.
Schapiro was most recently a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and hence on the other side of the turf wars that erupt between
the rival agencies at frequent intervals. But she has also had a cosy
association with the derivatives industry for most of her 14-year career.
Having started an enforcement attorney for the CFTC, she quickly became
executive assistant to the chairman. The bulk of her time - 9 years - was
then spent as a lobbyist for the industry in her capacity as general counsel
for the Futures Industry Association in Washington.
And though she left the FIA in 1988, appointed by Ronald Reagan to the SEC,
she has maintained her personal ties to the FIA. The relationship has served
her well; her candidacy for the CFTC chair was actively encouraged by
futures practitioners, who heaved a collective sigh of relief last week.
Given the intense criticism aimed at the whole field recently, it might seem
surprising Clinton picked an industry advocate to become its chief watchdog.
But Schapiro's supporters, including Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman, argue that
a detailed grasp of this dynamic corner of the financial world is essential
for the position, and that Schapiro's broad experience with the SEC and CFTC
will benefit the inter-agency co-operation now seen as critical for
derivatives regulation. Schapiro intends to stay at the SEC until she is
formally nominated to the CFTC and has Congressional confirmation to the
post.

FT  09 MAY 94 / People: Derivative move across the Rhine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After playing an important role in shaping the French derivatives industry,
39-year-old Antoine Paille has crossed the Rhine to set up Commerzbank's new
derivatives venture, Commerz Financial Products (CFP), writes Conner
Middelmann.
An options specialist, Paille was an early recruit to derivatives in Paris,
and sat on the commission that drafted the relevant regulations. He spent a
decade building up Societe Generale's derivatives capabilities and left last
October, 'ready for a new challenge'.
He remains cagey how met Rudolf Duttweiler, Commerzbank's capital markets
and treasury boss, who was head-hunted from CSFB in London a year ago. But
he says they had an almost instant meeting of minds as to how to approach
the business.
The smallest of the big three German banks, Commerz is the first institution
in Germany to set up a derivatives subsidiary.

FT  09 MAY 94 / People: Reinshagen - from fine art to UBS boardroom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Staid old Union Bank of Switzerland will have to go some way to provide
Maria Reinshagen, one of two women it has just elected to its board, with
the kind of thrills she has known in the fine art business, Ian Rodger in
Zurich.
Reinshagen, deputy chairman of the Swiss subsidiary of Christie's
International, was the underbidder for Van Gogh's Portrait du Dr Gachet in
May 1990 when Ryoei Saito, a Japanese paper magnate, won it with a Dollars
75m bid. With the 10 per cent commission, the Dollars 82.5m is still the
highest price ever paid for a painting.
'By the end, my heart was about to jump out of my body,' recalled Reinshagen
last week of the feverish bidding. Described by Christie's chairman Sir
Anthony Tennant as the group's number one business getter, she says she
throws herself fully into everything she does.
She studied violin as a child and played in professional orchestras in
Switzerland and the US in the 1960s. But she gave it up in 1966 when the
first of her two children was born. A school teacher by training, she
started in the art business in Zurich in 1961, working in galleries there
and in Los Angeles until setting up a Zurich outlet for Christie's in 1978.
Inevitably, both she and Anne-Lise Monnier, the other woman joining the UBS
board, have been labelled token women. Reinshagen, who did not even campaign
for women's voting rights in Switzerland in 1971, says she is apolitical and
has never had problems working alongside men. She has, however, fought
vigorously to reform the country's perverse primary school hours, which are
deliberately designed to trap mothers at home.
She joins the UBS board at a potentially exciting time. Her election was in
doubt till the end because of a motion by activist shareholder BK Vision at
the recent AGM to slash the board's membership from 23 to nine. The motion
was defeated, but the 40 per cent support for BK and its intense chairman
Martin Ebner showed that the bank's directors will have to pay much more
attention to shareholder interests than they have in the past.
Reinshagen suggests that Ebner erred only in pushing the issue in the year
when UBS finally invited two women to join, and in fixing on nine. 'By
coincidence, nine is my favourite number, but for such a large bank, it is
too low a figure.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (6): Moving on to the fast track -
Clive Cookson finds that a sizeable industry is beginning to emerge in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't be misled by the apparent quietness of the European biotechnology
scene compared to the US.
While American biotechnology is a cacophony of hundreds of independent
companies shouting exaggerated claims about wonder drugs in the early stages
of development, the loudest noise to be heard from the European industry is
moaning about over-regulation by the EU and national governments -
particularly on environmental and patent issues - which allegedly puts it at
a disadvantage in competition with the US.
In reality, the gap between Europe and the US is narrower than it sounds.
The illusion of a huge US lead results partly from the customary habit of
Americans to be more positive about their achievements than Europeans and
partly because the structure of the industry is so different on each side of
the Atlantic.
US biotechnology is driven entrepreneurially by young companies most of
which have no products on the market yet. They burn millions of dollars a
year in research and development and their existence depends on screaming
good news at would-be investors. In contrast, European biotechnology has
developed primarily in large pharmaceutical and chemical groups on one hand
and in universities and non-profit research institutes on the other. Neither
camp is so dependent as the US companies on public relations hype to raise
money.
Even so the first survey of European biotechnology, published in March by
Ernst &amp; Young, the US-based business consultancy, identified 400
biotechnology companies in Europe. That may be only one third of the
American total but it is more than Ernst &amp; Young had expected.
The consultants say that when they embarked on the study, their perception
'was of an industry lagging behind that of the US on almost every measure,
bar the quality of the initial science. What was found, however, was a
sizeable industry emerging, one that is learning how to shape its future and
that realises the scope of its potential contribution to the future European
economy towards the year 2000 and beyond'.
Ernst &amp; Young predicts that the European biotechnology market will grow
15-fold to reach Pounds 63bn by 2000 and provide 2m new jobs. The key
factors accelerating the growth of the new industry include:
More uniform regulatory policies, driven by EU legislation;
Increasing awareness of the sector's importance by investors, governments
and the EU (last year's EU White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and
Employment highlighted the potential of biotechnology);
Further development of centres of scientific excellence, clustering around
universities;
Emergence of exit routes for venture capitalists;
More strategic alliances between small biotechnology companies and large
pharmaceutical and chemical groups.
A particularly important change in the European financing environment came
in June last year when the London Stock Exchange relaxed its listing rules
to make it easier for young biotech companies without a profitable track
record to go public. Since then 11 companies, led by British Biotechnology,
have raised Pounds 200m through initial public share offerings in London,
although no stock exchange on continental Europe has yet followed London's
example. Ernst &amp; Young predicts that at least 20 biotech companies will be
listed in London in a year's time. Initial public offerings on the LSE will
raise Pounds 1bn for biotech companies over the next two to three years.
When it comes to strategic alliances, however, the most common pattern is
still for the large European pharmaceutical groups to form partnerships with
US biotechnology companies. Roche of Switzerland led the way with its
Dollars 2.1bn purchase of a majority stake in Genentech in 1990; the Swiss
group also has minority stakes in Chiron and Protein Design Labs and
collaborative agreements with Amgen, Synergen and Hybridon, among others.
An analysis by Roche of the 55 'major R&amp;D alliances' formed by the global
pharmaceutical industry in 1993 shows that 52 of the 55 'technology
providers' were US biotech companies and just three were European. The
corporate partners acquiring the technology included 21 European, 16 US and
six Japanese pharmaceutical groups - and 11 established US biotech
companies.
European companies are beginning to make good use of their US contacts. For
example Schering of Germany has developed Betaseron, the first drug proven
to have a clinical effect on multiple sclerosis, in collaboration with
Chiron, the Californian biotech company, which is manufacturing it in the
US; Betaseron came originally from Triton, a small US biotech company which
Schering bought from Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant.
The European industry has complained consistently about regulatory burdens
that are more onerous than those in the US and Japan. There has been a
particular problem with environmental controls (obtaining permission to
release genetically modified organisms into the environment) but European
companies say that the whole approach of EU biotechnology regulations -
concentrating on the process rather than the product as in the US - has made
life unnecessarily difficult for them.
But within the past year the EU and national governments have responded to
industry concerns by streamlining regulations. A further boost will come
from the European Medicines Evaluation Agency which is being established in
London to provide centralised licensing of new drugs from 1995. It is likely
to give the EU a faster and cheaper approvals process than the US Food and
Drug Administration.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (7): Just out of the starting blocks
 -Low R&amp;D spending is Japan's main weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese biotechnology is scarcely out of the starting blocks. It has been
left standing by the US and even lags behind Europe. Yet most Japanese
pharmaceuticals research directors believe biotechnology will be key to the
next generation of medicines.
'We're witnessing a revolution in the methodology of making drugs,' says Dr
Masahiko Fujino, general manager, discovery research division at Takeda,
Japan's biggest drugs company. 'Biotechnology and the understanding of human
genes is creating a completely different concept. In the past drugs were
designed to be tested on animals. Many compounds that might have proved safe
and effective in humans were rejected, and many that were valid in animals
just did not work in humans,' he explains.
'Now we are designing drugs for humans,' says Dr Fujino. 'There will be an
increasingly high probability - maybe 50 per cent - for drugs to pass
toxicology. That's double the present rate.'
Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&amp;D at Eisai, says: 'We're well
behind.' He believes Japanese companies may be able to do create some
innovative work by the beginning of the next century.
A few companies have attempted to remedy their deficiencies by setting up
separate biotechnology units. Most, however, have tried to incorporate the
technology in their research and development division.
'We are producers of medicines. If a science leads us to a potentially new
drug, we will try to increase our knowledge,' says Dr Yohihiko Baba,
director of the Sankyo research institute. 'Merck and Glaxo can afford to
concentrate on the technology and then the products. We can't'
The weakness of Japan's biotechnology expertise is a reflection of the more
general weakness of Japanese pharmaceuticals R&amp;D. In some areas, such as
antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering medicines and allergy treatments, Japanese
scientists are among the world's leaders. But the main weakness of Japanese
R&amp;D is that companies spend too little.
Their spending, when expressed as a percentage of sales, is not poor. Takeda
invests 8.2 per cent of its turnover on R&amp;D, Fujisawa 14.8 per cent, Sankyo
9.6 per cent, Eisai 13.2 per cent, Shionogi 11.8 per cent, Daiichi 12.3 per
cent. That compares favourably with Merck, the biggest US drugs group with
R&amp;D spending at 11 per cent of sales, and Glaxo, Europe's biggest company at
18 per cent.
But Japanese companies limited exposure overseas means their overall sales
are low and amounts spent on R&amp;D are tiny. While Merck spent Dollars 1.17bn
on R&amp;D last year and Glaxo Dollars 1.1bn, Takeda, the largest Japanese
company, spent only Dollars 557m, and not all of that on medicines. Sankyo,
Fujisawa and Yamanouchi all spent less than Dollars 400m, and Eisai,
Shionogi and Daiichi invested less than Dollars 300m.
Inadequate R&amp;D spending is reflected in the number of scientists in R&amp;D.
Merck has 1,700 scientists in research alone, excluding development. Takeda,
has 1,200 in R&amp;D combined, while Sankyo has between 1,200 and 1,300 in R&amp;D.
Daiichi employs 600 researchers and 130 scientists in development; Eisai has
420 people including administration in clinical development, safety and
formulation, and 220 scientists in discovery; and Yamanouchi has 1,320 in
R&amp;D. Glaxo employs some 7,500 scientists.
Much research is also poorly directed. While considerable lip-service is
given to the need for innovation, many R&amp;D directors are more interested in
what they call 'survival' products. These are compounds with only small
improvements on previous therapies that, in the past, could be used to
side-step the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare's price cuts every two
years.
Unlike their western competitors, Japanese groups have proved reluctant to
rationalise their therapeutic areas, reallocating scarce resources to areas
such as biotechnology.
When challenged why his company persists in antibiotics, a low-margin,
highly competitive arena, Dr Fujino at Takeda explains the company has an
historical responsibility. 'If Takeda doesn't give up, maybe the others
will.'
Few Japanese companies have made up their for lack of biotechnology
experience by links with US and European boutiques. In part this is a
reflection of their insularity. Few companies have R&amp;D centres outside Japan
(although some have links with overseas research institutions). Sankyo, for
example, has only 15 R&amp;D scientists in the US, and about 165 in Germany,
almost all in development. Takeda, Japan's largest group, has no research
centre outside Japan, although it is considering setting up a unit at a UK
university.
The links that have existed between Japanese drugs groups and western
biotechnology companies have been fraught. Sankyo's relationship with
Celltech, the UK biotechnology group, was not successful, says Dr Masonori
Saeki, director of the R&amp;D planning department, 'partly because the success
rate is not high. But a relationship like this is like a marriage. The human
factors are very important. In addition, the economic factor is decisive,
both sides have to have a financial incentive to make it work.'
Clearly, some Japanese groups, given their conservative practices, feel ill
at ease with the high-risk, high-reward approach of the US biotechnology
industry. Some companies, such as Takeda which has had links with Chiron,
have been bruised by their experiences.
'These relationships were not very successful,' says Dr Fujino. 'I do not
believe links with biotechnology groups will lead to much.'
Daiichi says it has abandoned its links with US biotechnology boutiques. 'We
did have a relationship with Calbio working on Alzheimer's. But Alzheimer's
proved very difficult and we have further plans to link,' says Dr Hiroyki
Nagasako, board director for corporate planning at Daiichi.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (4): Seeking a backer - Raising
capital is never easy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If one phrase describes the nature of the biotechnology business it is
'credibility equals capital'.
A decade or so without income from sales means that the boss's job consists
of endless rounds of capital raising. The chief executive has no suitcase of
samples and the main sales tool is the scientists' creativity and hard work.
Capital is needed more than just to pay the bills. A company with Dollars
100m in the bank has a strong hand when negotiating with potential partners
from the mainstream pharmaceuticals industry. 'Capital is a strategic asset,
not just something you intend to spend,' says Joshua Boger, president of
Massachusetts company Vertex.
Yet it is hard to imagine a more ignorant group of investors than typical
fund managers. Nobel prize-winning science must be sold to people who are
accustomed to evaluating the plans of shopkeepers and food manufacturers.
And the sales pitch is getting tougher. New biotechnology companies are
launched every week. Yet, US biotechnology companies managed to raise only
Dollars 2.8bn in 1993, down from Dollars 3.4bn in 1991 and only a slight
improvement on the Dollars 2.5bn raised in 1992, according to research from
biotechnology consultancy Feinstein and Partners.
The increasing difficulty in translating credibility into capital is seen in
the average amount raised on flotation: Dollars 22m in 1993, compared with
Dollars 26m in 1992 and Dollars 33m in 1991.
One biotechnology company chief speaks of 1991's 'waterfall of money. You
just held out your cup and it was full'.
Today, the tables have turned. 'There's more great science than access to
capital,' says Harvey Berger, chairman of Ariad Pharmaceuticals of
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Steve Burrill of San Francisco merchant bank Burrill and Craves says that
the US biotechnology industry alone will demand Dollars 5bn in 1994 in
further investment. It is unlikely to get it.
Wall Street might not understand science, but it does understand that the
industry rarely provides a return on its investment.
One of the main reasons that Wall Street has been prepared to fund the
mysterious biotechnology industry is that it has thought it might be
investing in a product so innovative it might be a monopoly. But healthcare
reforms around the world threaten to prevent the charging of monopoly
prices.
'Healthcare reforms scare off Wall Street,' says Alison Taunton-Rigby, chief
executive of start up Boston biotechnology company Mitotix. 'Especially the
thought of price caps on drugs.'
So the merchant bankers' minds have turned to ever more innovative financial
instruments, many designed to appeal to those who would not normally invest
in the sector.
Last month saw a successful cash call from British Biotechnology using
effectively a deferred rights issue. Half the money is to be put up now, the
other half in two years time when investors have had a chance to see the
results of work in progress.
In the US there have been even more creative ideas put into action,
including off-balance sheet financing and spin-offs of subsidiaries.
One of the most widely employed is the Pipe - a private investment in public
equity - in which a block of shares is placed privately at a discount to the
market price. Pipes accounted for more than Dollars 500m in 1993's
biotechnology fund raising, according to Feinstein and Partners.
Nevertheless Pipes arouse controversy in the industry. For Mr Burrill, the
private placing avoids the problem of the share price being depressed by
market knowledge that a large block of shares is on offer. 'You might offer
the shares privately at a 15 per cent discount to the market price, but if
you offered them openly, the stock might fall 30 per cent.'
But one embittered biotechnology chief executive says: 'It's not very
creative to sell stock at a discount. Sell it at a premium, that's
creative.'
So the search continues for financial innovation suited to the industry.
Aberlyn Capital Management, a US subsidiary of Dutch merchant bank Mees
Pierson, part of the Netherlands' largest bank, ABN-Amro, lends money to
biotechnology companies using their equipment and patents as collateral. 'We
are not taken aback by the dismal shape of the balance sheet,' says Aberlyn
president David Sakura.
'Leasing on a patent as collateral can be done because patents are carried
on the books at the cost of filing. In many cases, the technology remains
sound even if the company gets into trouble. Investors lose sight of this.'
Another fund raising idea comes from Drug Royalty Corporation, a quoted
Canadian company, which invests cash in return for a slice of the royalty
stream of a product.
Alan Grieve, president, explains that their policy of not taking equity is
attractive to biotechnology executives who have seen their stakes diluted as
wave after wave of conventional investors becomes involved.
Such ideas have yet to make inroads into biotechnology companies. If Wall
Street or the City of London are unable to provide the funds they need, they
are likely to turn to the cash-rich pharmaceuticals companies for finance.
Drugs companies can provide research and development help as well as cash.
But they often demand in return marketing and manufacturing rights and a
slice of equity. For Ms Taunton-Rigby, drugs companies provide a less than
satisfactory alternative to capital markets. 'We've gone to pharmaceuticals
companies, but given a choice we would not, as you give up too much.'
Nevertheless, now is a time of investor caution. Even a powerful story of
scientific and management expertise meets with scepticism from investors.
Good science will always find backers, runs an adage in the sector.
Privately, however, company executives concede that there are huge doses of
salesmanship and luck to be added to a successful recipe. Credibility will
continue to be the goal of the biotechnology company manager, and it will be
achieved any way possible.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (5): Distrust remains - Public
perceptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRIAM HUGHESMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid advances that have been made in the biotechnology industry over
the past 20 years have caused much public debate. This debate has been
focused on applications in health care, but equally controversial have been
biotechnology developments in agriculture and food processing.
Some experts say that the lack of public support in Europe, in particular,
is a stumbling block to industry progress.
Studies conducted on the public perception of biotechnology over the past 10
years largely have concluded that the key to positive public support is
education. Part of the problem is the lack of understanding of exactly what
biotechnology is.
'People in general have very little idea of what biotechnology is,' says
Eirlys Roberts, CBE, author of The Public and Biotechnology, a study on
public attitudes in Europe towards biotechnology. 'They have a clearer idea
of the genetic engineering part of biotech, but even that knowledge mostly
comes from press coverage.'
In the study, Public Attitudes to Genetic Engineering: Some European
Perspectives, the author Louis Lemkow argues that if the industry cannot
properly define itself, challenges lie ahead. 'The term biotechnology itself
is problematic. Even today, many scientific meetings held on biotechnology
are prefaced by lengthy discussions on the provision of adequate definition
of the subject,' Mr Lemkow says. He adds that with 41 definitions of
biotechnology in EU documents alone, 'the number of definitions of the work
has become a matter of embarrassment'.
Dr Keith McCullagh, chief executive officer of British Bio-technology Group
and chairman of the UK BioIndustry Association, says: 'You can't use
biotechnology as a generic term, it is not a useful description, it does not
tell people anything.' He believes that people are interested not in the
biotechnology process but in the benefit of the end result. 'If you tell
people you have a possible treatment for cancer, the reception will be
positive.'
The European Commission-funded EU-wide survey conducted by Eurobarometer
Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering - What Europeans Think about it in
1993 - an update on the 1991 survey also highlights the public's distrust of
the industry.
In ranking order, the most reliable sources of information on biotechnology
and genetic engineering are considered to be environmental organisations,
consumer organisations and schools and universities, according to
Eurobarometer.
Eurobarometer's study finds that less than one respondent in five believes
public authorities provide a reliable source of information on
biotechnology. In Denmark, however, this is nearer one in two. The survey
indicated that Germans were more trusting of information from the government
authorities than other European countries.
Regardless of the nationality and the applications of biotechnology in
question, demand for governmental control of the various applications is
great. Whereas the perception of risk is particularly high in Denmark the
support recorded is about the European average.
Although weaker than registered in Denmark the perception of risk is also
high in west Germany - the second highest in the EU.
To counter this, the Trade Ministry of the German state of North Rhine
Westphalia recently launched an initiative to support investment in
biotechnology research in the state.
Trade minister Gunter Einert told a conference in early May, that 'while the
revised federal law governing genetic and biotechnology research now gives
German companies competitive parity with foreign rivals it is important to
change the public's negative perceptions of biotechnology.'
Mr Einert said he intended to highlight 'positive examples' of genetic and
biotechnology research and foster international co-operation.
In the UK, a department of trade and industry-sponsored survey revealed that
the industry's efforts are failing to win support from sections of the
public which are relatively well informed about biotechnology. The study
found that 80 per cent of those questioned considered the industry to be an
unreliable source of information. Some 68 per cent said they thought it took
short cuts with safety.
Dr McCullagh said he did not think the full picture had yet emerged. 'I am
confident that once biotechnology products hit the market and people see
what great value it has to offer Britain, public perception will be much
more receptive,' he said.
Quite a different situation exists in the US. Daniel Eramian, vice-president
of corporate communications for the US Biotechnology Industry Organisation
said US public perception was favourable, partially as a result of the
Clinton healthcare proposals. 'The healthcare debate for whatever reason,
decided to make the large pharmaceutical companies as the bad guys and the
biotech companies came out looking like the good guys.'
He also attributes US success to what he terms a 'freer enterprise system',
where investors are willing to invest a large amounts of money in small
companies. 'It is part of the American dream, the small company striving to
become bigger and better. There are about 1,300 US biotech companies and
about 75 per cent of them are small businesses.'
Mr Eramian said he found the US media supportive of the US industry. 'The
industry provides a lot of information as products hit the market. We
explain what it is all about, including the risks. It is not done in a
vacuum, it is not dishonest and we certainly do not give the impression that
we want to put our heads in the sand. People need to know what we are doing,
if the industry is to be successful.'
However Mr Eramian concedes that 'no matter what you do, there will always
be concern over something new, particularly if you are not told about it.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (3): Accessing the technology -
Debate focuses on how best to develop drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conventional wisdom on biotechnology - at least the one propagated by
the biotechnology industry - is that the technology will provide the next
generation of blockbuster drugs. Not all pharmaceuticals groups' research
directors are convinced.
'There is a bright future for biotechnology, but not as bright as you might
think,' says Dr Pierre Simon, director of Elf Sanofi, the French
pharmaceuticals group. 'If you look at what the industry was promising 10
years ago, it's a long way behind.'
Dr Simon, who says his company does not intend any more close links with
biotech boutiques, says: 'It's clear that in the future some clear progress
will be made in medicine through biotechnology. But biotechnology compounds
are often too big and fragile. The drugs developed through biotechnology are
so huge that they often have to be rejected - they won't cross the
blood/brain barrier. They have to be developed to be injected. The most
successful compounds are once a day oral drugs - with these drugs there's no
chance of developing them for that.'
In any case, argues Dr Simon, the pharmaceuticals industry is making rapid
progress in the field of drug design and, using computers, can screen as
many chemicals in a day as it used to be able to test in a year.
'Why produce drugs through biotechnology, when you can make the compounds
through classical chemistry?' he asks. 'For the next few years we will try
to mimic the products of biotechnology through classical chemistry. Through
biotechnology you can identify a receptor, then the chemists can find
cheaper, simpler alternatives to the biotech drug.'
Although Dr Simon's non-conformist views are shared by many research chiefs
in Japan, few in the western world subscribe to his views, at least in
public. Many disagree.
Dr William Scott, senior vice-president of exploratory drug discovery
research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, explains: 'The opportunities for making
better drugs are greater than ever before. In a short period of time most
genes in the human body will be sequenced. Once we can identify the
molecular basis of diseases, then we can begin to treat them.'
X:'Biotechnology and a greater understanding of the life and death of the
cell are opening up vast new scientific and medical horizons,' says Sir
Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group.
'The basic biology of cellular Mechanisms is becoming more and more
understood. That biological understanding is coming mainly from outside the
company, from university collaborations and small biotechnology start-ups.'
However, he adds: 'Medicinal chemistry will still have an important role to
play 10 years from now.'
But in spite of the opportunities offered by biotechnology, considerable
divergences remain among research directors and their chief executives over
how best to access the new science.
A few groups, such as Roche of Switzerland and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the
Franco-American company, have acquired substantial stakes in biotechnology
groups. Roche spent Dollars 2.1bn in 1990 on a majority stake in Genentech,
while RPR acquired a 37 per cent per cent Dollars 113m stake last June in
Applied Immune Systems, to gain access to its cell therapy technology.
Most recently Corange signed two large deals, acquiring stakes in Protein
Design Labs for Dollars 206m and CellPro for Dollars 220m. Meanwhile,
Wellcome linked up with Centocor in an alliance potentially worth Dollars
100m, and SmithKline Beecham invested Dollars 125m in Human Genome Sciences.
Others have set up a portfolio of small stakes or alliances in particular
therapeutic areas, or even individual projects. The balance of bargaining
between drugs groups and biotechnology companies has shifted markedly over
the past 12 months. The collapse in the share prices of Synergen and
Centocor after the US Food and Drug Administration turned down their
products frightened many investors who had not realised the risks involved
in biotechnology.
The harshening healthcare environment has made initial public offerings more
difficult for the biotechnology boutiques. In particular, the provision in
President Bill Clinton's proposed healthcare reforms to control the price of
new drugs has hit the biotechnology sector hard, says Bill Steere, chairman
and chief executive of Pfizer of the US, and outgoing chairman of the US
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
'Often a biotech company is based on the development of a single product.
When it comes to the market, that product not only has to pay past research
expenses but also generate enough income for the future. The biotech groups
are risky enough anyway. If we end up with price controls, then private
investors are naturally reluctant to make that investment,' says Mr Steere.
Some pharmaceuticals groups believe they can create innovative biotechnology
groups internally. Their research directors are clearly irked by the
propaganda pushed by some biotechnology companies that the drugs companies
are lumbering giants incapable of harnessing the revolution proffered by
biotechnology. 'We've built one of the best biotech groups in the industry,'
says Dr Scott at Bristol-Myers Squibb.
This, he hastens to add, does not mean the company is not looking at forming
alliances with biotech groups or even buying them out, but it does provide a
level of expertise that allows him to make good calls when negotiating with
the boutiques.

Local facilities and regulations are important

For such a young sapling of an industry, biotechnology has already rooted
itself firmly in specific locations, and today's thriving centres will
probably continue to dominate in the future.
The US holds the lion's share of the business, with more than 1,500
biotechnology companies. Europe, in contrast, has less than 250 operations,
including university research programmes and pharmaceutical company
subsidiaries. A handful of firms also dot Canada, Australia and Japan.
Within countries, too, biotechnology tends to cluster in specific regions.
The areas around San Francisco and Boston are the undisputed capitals of the
sector in the US. A research corridor also extends along the eastern
seaboard from Rhode Island to North Carolina, and spots along the West
Coast, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle, have attracted a number
of firms. In Europe, Britain is emerging as the biotechnology king, with
centres in Oxford, Cambridge, Scotland and London.
Industry executives predict that future growth will be focused in these
areas. 'After a while, the business begins to feed on itself,' says Kenneth
Bate, head of sales at the Boston-based group Biogen. 'Biotechnology firms
want to be where the other biotechnology firms are. Scientists like to talk
with each other, and there's a lot of cross-fertilisation that goes on.'
The attractions which drew the biotechnology sector to these locations will
continue to act as magnets in the future: a friendly regulatory stance,
access to capital, proximity to universities and hospitals, the presence of
a skilled labour pool and nearby airports and highways.
Regulatory procedures are the most changeable of these factors. Overly
bureaucratic requirements can put a death seal on a developing biotechnology
centre. Germany's antagonistic stance toward the sector has seriously
limited its ability to compete as a biotechnology contender, for instance.
Citing overly zealous regulatory restrictions in Germany, Bayer, Boehringer
Mannheim and Hoechst have all established biotechnology operations in the
US.
'It would take us at least two years to get permission to build a lab in
Germany,' says Dieter Bauer, expert on biotechnology research and
development at Hoechst. 'In the US, we got approval for the building in
about five weeks, and everything else happened very quickly.'
The development of biotechnology in Britain has also been hurt by regulatory
restrictions. Companies in the sector complain that until two years ago,
flotation requirements for the London Stock Exchange included a five-year
track record and three years of profits.
Since the rules changed, life has become much easier for UK firms. British
Biotechnology floated in mid-1992 and a number of other companies have
followed the group to market. 'We negotiated criteria more appropriate to a
biotechnology group,' says Keith McCullagh, chief executive of British
Biotechnology. Biotechnology companies usually do not show profits for years
after their inception.
The UK sector now seems ready for growth, and executives hope the new,
friendlier climate will halt the brain drain of British scientists to the
US. But many believe it will take the country years to overcome the damage
done by the previous regulatory structure. 'The environment in the UK has
changed tremendously, but we're still at least eight years behind the US in
terms of developing a biotechnology industry,' Mr McCullagh says.
Regional and local regulations can also make a difference. A few years ago,
the state government of Massachusetts became concerned that a slow
permitting process was undermining its status as a biotechnology mecca. The
biotechnology company Genzyme was threatening to leave the state, and other
groups were filing similar complaints. In the end, Massachusetts succeeded
in keeping Genzyme in the state by allocating ombudsmen to take
biotechnology companies swiftly through the regulatory procedures.
'We wanted a commitment from the government to work together with us on the
permitting and approval process,' says Geoffrey Cox, senior vice-president
in charge of world operations at Genzyme. 'This is a big issue and can have
an enormous financial impact on a firm. If it's your first product, for
instance, all the months you're waiting for approval for a plant you're not
selling anything.'
Massachusetts also sweetened the Genzyme deal with tax breaks. Indeed,
financing issues have become crucial in siting decisions. British company
Celltech, for example, decided to build a US manufacturing plant in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after the state made the group an offer its says
it could not refuse. 'We got tremendous financial assistance from the state
of New Hampshire,' says Peter Fellner, Celltech's chief executive officer.
'It was far more than we could have got in Europe, and a better deal than
other regions in the US were offering.'
Biotechnology groups also like to be near their investor bases and their
market, two factors favouring growth in the US. 'Most biotechnology groups
will have to set up branches in the US at some point,' said Mark McDade,
chief operating officer for Boehringer Mannheim Therapeutics. 'We set up
here because we needed to address the needs of the largest, most profitable
pharmaceutical market in the world.'
British Biotechnology says it established a branch in the US in part because
it wanted to be near investors. 'About 18 per cent of our shareholders are
in the US, so it's good for investor relations for us to be here,' says
McCullagh.
Other factors weigh into companies' decisions about where to locate. The
availability of a skilled labour pool for instance, easy access to air and
road transportation and quality of life, which helps firms attract the best
people, are mentioned as important considerations.
Because these factors are often slow to change, industry executives believe
a growth bias will favour existing centres. 'Regulatory structures, being
near universities, all these are important in making the decision about
where to locate, probably more important than which places are the
cheapest,' says Mr Cox of Genzyme. 'That's why I think that the south-west
and north-east of the US, even though they are relatively expensive places
to do business, will continue to be magnets for the biotechnology industry.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (1): A long and arduous journey to
success - While raising cash to support science is tricky, the profits to be
gained from developing a top drug remain a strong magnet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Peroutka is happy, excited and perhaps just a little nervous. Aged
40, he has just given up a senior job at one of the world's most successful
biotechnology companies, Genentech. He now employs a staff of nine in a
spartan office by California's interstate-101 freeway about 25 miles south
of San Francisco.
He is embarking on a journey that thousands of other
entrepreneurially-minded scientists have made before him. He has started a
company, Spectra Biomedical, that plans to discover how a disease works.
Once the disease is understood, a team of scientists he has yet to recruit
will find a way to treat it. A development team will take the treatment
through several years of clinical trials to the doors of the Food and Drug
Administration in Washington and its equivalents around the world. Finally,
marketing and sales executives will put the newly approved treatment in
front of doctors who (it is hoped) will be impressed enough to authorise its
purchase by the truckload.
Mr Peroutka will become a saviour to thousands of afflicted people, a
millionaire - possibly a billionaire - a Nobel prize winner and revered
elder statesman of the world's healthcare industries.
Perhaps the most extraordinary aspect of the biotechnology business is that
people believe in the possibility of successes such as this, and back their
beliefs with cash. There are now more than 1,400 biotechnology companies
around the world, half of which are in the US. More than 250 have achieved
stock market quotations. Only five or six make an operating profit.
One certainty is that Mr Peroutka's story will be different scientifically
from those that have gone before.
A decade ago, the drug interferon was hailed as a cure-all. It has turned
out to have only limited use in cancer therapy. By the end of the 1980s
proteins were all the rage. The idea was to make something that is already
present in the body and avoid all the difficulties of side effects. Today,
proteins are regarded as difficult to make, unstable and tricky to use
because they have to be injected rather than swallowed.
The latest fashion is in 'small molecules' - essentially the business end of
a protein. With all the unnecessary parts discarded, a small molecule can
mimic the action of a protein and is cheap as well as easy to make, store
and administer.
But while science moves quickly, the business of raising the money to
support it remains gruelling. Mr Peroutka has got off to a good start by
securing the personal backing of one of the doyens of California venture
capital, Eugene Kleiner, a man behind many of the electronics and computer
industry start-ups of the 1960s and 1970s.
Mr Peroutka's team is already working to find the genetic basis of migraine.
He has attracted attention from potential corporate partners in the US and
in Europe. Soon he will do deals with venture capitalists, pharmaceuticals
companies and Wall Street.
Three thousand miles away, in Cambridge Massachusetts, Alison Taunton-Rigby,
an expatriate Briton, is well into the second round of venture capital
financing for her company Mitotix.
Her company has been recruiting fast, searching for the cell scientists
which it wants in order to develop cancer treatments. It has taken advantage
of the restructuring of the pharmaceuticals industry. With job security no
longer guaranteed, a biotechnology company promises growth rather than
contraction.
Yet times are tough for a small biotechnology company. Mitotix has 40
employees and its few dollars of venture capital are beginning to look
small. Wall Street is unenthusiastic about the whole healthcare industry so
Mitotix is looking for corporate partners.
'We approached nine Japanese companies of which four to five have expressed
interest and that has been narrowed down to three companies,' says Ms
Taunton-Rigby. Talks are still going on.
One day, Mitotix may find itself in the position of a company such as
British Biotechnology. With 300 employees and an asthma collaboration with
Europe's biggest drugs company Glaxo, it has just completed a financing
round that raised more than Pounds 90m over two years.
Or it could go the way of fellow Massachusetts company Vertex which has used
a string of corporate deals as the basis for building cash reserves of
Dollars 104m, almost Dollars 1m for each of its 115 employees.
The company has a contract in Aids research with UK drugs company, Wellcome,
in which Vertex believes it drove a hard bargain because it had both the
expertise - in an area called proteases - and a strong financial position.
'Wellcome had to do the deal,' explains Joshua Boger, company president. 'We
took advantage of that. Merck (the biggest US drugs company) and others were
already into proteases.'
Vertex's financial strength brings it more than further cash. 'We are
especially pleased with the non-cash resources that have been put into these
deals,' he says. 'In Wellcome's case the details have not been released, but
French company Roussel put in more than 30 scientists in Paris and Swindon.'
Mr Boger makes little attempt to hide his ambition to become a global force
in the healthcare industry.
Back in California, Chiron Corporation has almost done so. Last year it saw
the approval of multiple sclerosis treatment Betaseron, which it now makes
for Schering of Germany to sell. It has made profits for five quarters in a
row and promises more thanks to joint ventures with Swiss company Ciba to
develop Aids and herpes vaccines and licence deals in other areas with
Germany's Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US.
Chiron remains a biotechnology company in technological terms. In financial
and management terms, it is practically a drugs company. Edward Penhoet,
chief executive, has 2,250 employees and deals with the problems that face
ordinary companies. 'When we get too big we divide it to try to keep the
small company culture. We keep the management structure flat. Our target is
five layers and we get close to it,' he says, sounding like a career general
manager.
But Mr Penhoet is not so different from Mr Peroutka. He gave up security as
a tenured professor at Berkeley just over a decade ago. He moved three miles
south from one of the US's most prestigious academic institutions to offices
in disused dockyards across the Bay Bridge from San Francisco.
In the 13 years since he and two colleagues started Chiron, Mr Penhoet has
seen many rivals fall. Chiron itself took over Cetus in 1991. Last year saw
the spectacular failure at late stages of development of sepsis drugs made
by established stock market quoted companies Xoma, Centocor and Synergen.
Both in spite of and because of such failures, the life cycle of a
biotechnology company embodies the US way of doing business. Sheer belief
can make things happen; success attracts success.
Investment draws in talented people who get things done and attracts further
finance. Waves of investors get in and then sell out at a higher price to
the next wave. Many down the line will find they have bought worthless
paper. The idea that seduced them failed. The scientists move on, the
entrepreneur starts another company, the next scientific fashion is in
vogue.
But the ultimate goal is no longer a dream for southern California's Amgen.
Fourteen years old and with 3,100 employees, it already has one product -
blood treatment Epogen - which is among the world's top five selling drugs.
By the end of the decade it will have two in the top five and Epogen will
have displaced Glaxo's ulcer treatment Zantac at number one, according to
forecasts from analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers.
Amgen stands at the top of the biotechnology pyramid. Like many before him,
Stephen Peroutka has begun his climb. He will not be the last.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Education row to flare again as tests begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy over education will return to the top of the political agenda
today as tests for 14-year-olds start in schools in England and Wales and
the government announces details of its proposed cuts in the national
curriculum for next year.
Conflict is likely over English, where the government is expected to publish
a suggested reading list of novels. Teachers have opposed such a list as
unacceptably limiting their professional discretion.
The revised curriculum is likely to recommend using the 'phonics' method for
teaching reading - a favourite cause for educational conservatives.
And team games are likely to be made compulsory between the ages of 14 and
16.
Cuts in the national curriculum were announced last year by Sir Ron Dearing,
the government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests, following a
boycott of tests by teachers that forced them to be abandoned. The
announcement of the detail of the cuts is certain to reopen divisions
between educational traditionalists and progressives.
History has already provoked an angry response from one member of the
working party reviewing the draft curriculum. Sir Ron denied the charge that
the revised history syllabus ignored the study of English monarchs.
After the proposals are announced today by Mr John Patten, the education
secretary, government advisers will start a consultation costing between
Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m. Sir Ron aims to deliver the new curriculum to
schools by the end of January for the academic year beginning next
September.
Teachers' reactions to today's proposals could be critical to the fate of
this year's tests. More disruption seems certain as the National Union of
Teachers, the largest in the UK, has voted to continue boycotting the tests.
Both the other big unions have voted to stop their boycott, ensuring
increased take-up of the tests this year.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Dismay at stance on EU funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is refusing to submit plans for spending Pounds 520m of
European Union funds available to the UK for retraining workers in
industries undergoing structural change - such as cars and carpets.
Ministers believe that the money would be better spent on training for the
unemployed and that employee training is the responsibility of employers.
But the decision has caused dismay among local authorities, motor industry
companies and Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in areas of industrial
change such as the Midlands.
'When funding is already there and we're turning our back on it, it is
extremely frustrating,' said Mr John Hawksby, a Bedfordshire Conservative
councillor who is chairman of the all-party Motor Industry Local Authority
Network (Milan), which brings together local authorities with a strong
interest in the motor industry.
The money available from the EU is the so-called Objective Four funding,
which can be spent over the next five years. It is administered by national
governments, which must give the European Commission details of their
spending plans. The UK government has refused to do this for 1995-96.
'We believe that the money could be better used in helping the unemployed
under Objective Three of the structural funds, which provides training for
the unemployed,' the employment department said.
Any money spent on Objective Four funding comes out of the budget for
Objective Three. By not applying for Objective Four funds, the government
hopes to maintain present levels of EU funding for unemployment programmes.
However, Mr Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of Central England Training and
Enterprise Council, said that withholding Objective Four funds was making it
harder for Tecs to assist in reskilling local labour forces. 'Anything we
can do to help people make a smooth transition in employment must make
sense.'
Motor industry groups, including Ford, Vauxhall, Unipart and Rover - which
spends Pounds 35m a year on training - want to tap Objective Four funding.
Mr Iain Mills, co-chairman of the Commons car industry committee, said it
would not take up any position on the issue before the autumn.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Employers' pension fears queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers' fears that the government's proposed pension fund reform will
raise their costs significantly may be overblown, says a study by Bacon and
Woodrow, a firm of consulting actuaries.
The Confederation of British Industry, the UK's largest employers' body, has
said that proposed minimum solvency standards for pension schemes could
force employers to move pension-scheme assets from high-yielding equities
into lower-yielding gilts. Such a move would require employers to inject
additional cash into their schemes and could have the effect of discouraging
pension provision, the CBI said.
However, Bacon and Woodrow said a survey of 112 of its clients' pension
schemes found that more than 90 per cent were 100 per cent solvent. The
standard of solvency was a compromise proposed by the Institute and Faculty
of Actuaries and is less stringent than one proposed by the Goode Committee,
which called for pension law reform.
Only four schemes surveyed were less than 90 per cent solvent, meaning
employers would have to put in extra cash. Most of those not 100 per cent
solvent were executive pension schemes covering restricted groups of
members.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Resignation of whip 'won't harm Major'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative party managers insisted yesterday that the resignation of a
government whip over allegations of a homo-sexual relationship would do
little to harm Mr John Major's already beleaguered government.
Mr Michael Brown, the Tory MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, announced at the
weekend that he would return to the back benches after a Sunday newspaper
alleged that he had a homosexual relationship with a Tory student.
An official at Conservative Central Office described the allegations, which
appeared in the News of the World, as a 'storm in a teacup'. Members of the
MP's constituency party also pledged to stand by him, indicating there would
be no question of Mr Brown being asked to resign his seat.
However, the MP is the latest in a long line of Tory ministers and MPs who
have been forced to resign following the launch of the 'Back to Basics'
drive.
In the last six months, two ministers and one parliamentary private
secretary have resigned in the wake of allegations about their private lives
in British newspapers.
Mr Brown is a leading member of the 'No Turning Back' group of Tory
rightwingers. He was promoted to the whips' office last May with special
responsibility for Northern Ireland, transport and the north west of
England. Before that, in 1989, he was appointed parliamentary private
secretary to Mr Douglas Hogg, then trade and industry minister, staying with
him when he went to the Foreign Office.
But although a loyal Thatcherite, he was not above rebelling against Lady
Thatcher's government when he thought it was moving in the wrong direction -
particularly over Europe.
The revelations over his personal life - which he is disputing - could
hardly have come at a worse time for the government, following the
catastrophic result for the Conservatives in the local government elections
and with the Euro-elections to be held next month.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Companies' CD probe fears ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record companies are increasingly confident they will be cleared by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission of charging excessive prices for compact
discs, but say they are still unsure whether the large market share of
leading music retailers will be criticised.
The commission's report on the music industry, launched last year, was sent
to the Department of Trade and Industry last month. The DTI said yesterday
that recent reports on the outcome of the inquiry were 'speculation'. Music
companies say they have still not seen the commission's report.
Record industry executives say the tenor of their correspondence and
meetings with the commission has led them to conclude that the inquiry had
moved away from the CD pricing question to the issue of music retailing.
The national heritage committee's report last year criticised music
producers and record retailers for charging too much for CDs.
The committee said that music companies had failed to justify the difference
in the prices they charged UK and US dealers for CDs. The price difference
on full-price discs was between Pounds 1.50 and Pounds 2. The committee was
even more critical of the industry for charging dealers Pounds 2.50 more for
compact discs than for cassettes.
Music companies say, however, that they expect the commission to accept that
many consumer products are more expensive in the US than in the UK and that
British CDs are the cheapest in Europe.
Industry executives believe the position of music retailers is less clear.
The national heritage committee said last year that the retail market was
dominated by WH Smith, Our Price, Virgin, Woolworth and HMV, who together
controlled 54 per cent of UK music stores. Last March, WH Smith, which owns
Our Price, said it was merging the chain with Virgin Retail, with which it
had previously had a joint venture.
The committee said that large retailers had not done enough to reduce CD
prices and had simply passed responsibility on to the music companies.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Post Office talks to City on sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, has held detailed
talks with a senior team from SG Warburg about how best to privatise the
corporation.
The talks are the furthest the corporation has gone in pursuing
privatisation.
Senior executives are keen to push ahead with a partial privatisation, even
though the government has yet to announce the results of a review of the
Post Office's future.
Mr Cockburn said: 'If the government decides to privatise the Post Office
all the indications are that investors looking at our business find it a
very attractive proposition. Warburg is confirming this.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said there is a
strong case for privatising Royal Mail, a subsidiary of the Post Office,
although he has conceded that political issues make it difficult to do so.
Mr Cockburn, while careful not to call publicly for privatisation, wants the
government to act speedily if it has decided to sell.
He said yesterday his preferred method was to float Royal Mail along with
the parcels division, which the government is already committed to selling.
'If the government want to privatise the Post Office, it makes best
commercial sense to keep the Royal Mail and parcels together as one company.
No other post office has hived off its parcels division.'
Mr Cockburn feels that the Post Office's public obligation to provide a
parcel service through the country, in contrast to its 4,000 privately owned
competitors, gives it a natural fit with letters.
However, Mr Cockburn warned that the government would have to be careful not
to over-regulate a privatised Post Office, which could depress profits and
share price.
He believes ministers may be encouraged towards privatisation by the strong
interest in any UK postal sale shown by institutional shareholders. Hoare
Govett has reported similar investor interest in a UK sale. Hoare Govett is
the UK stockbroker owned by ABN Amro, the global co-ordinator in the
privatisation of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch telecom
and postal group.
Mr Nick Verey, deputy chairman of Warburg, is expected to explain his
proposals for privatising the Post Office at a Westminster and City
conference next month.
Warburg is the lead UK regional manager in the Dutch postal privatisation
due to take place next month.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Ex-Tory voters say PM must go
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most ex-Conservative voters want Mr John Major to resign, according to a
Gallup opinion poll conducted for the BBC.
In a poll of 988 people who voted Tory in the 1992 general election, 58 per
cent said Mr Major should resign, while just 34 per cent said he should stay
on. All 988 people polled said they would not or were not inclined to vote
Tory if there were a general election tomorrow.
Among this group of voters, the Conservatives are less trusted on tax than
Labour, the poll found. Eighty eight per cent said they would not believe a
Conservative politician talking about taxes, while 82 per cent would not
trust a Labour politician on the subject.
Mr Michael Heseltine was the preferred choice to replace Mr Major, with 34
per cent of these former Tory voters saying they would vote Conservative if
he were party leader. Only 18 per cent in each case would vote Conservative
if either Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, or Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary, were in charge.

Changes are under way in franchised car dealership networks in the UK with
large groups expanding at the expense of individually owned dealerships.
The main groups such as Lex Service and Inchcape now own more than a third
of the 7,000-plus franchised dealerships compared with just a quarter in
1990, according to Sewells International, the motor-trade monitoring group.
Some are also beating down manufacturer resistance to selling more than one
make from a single site and leading the expansion of UK car retailing
methods by buying dealerships in other EU countries.
Sewells attributes the decline in individually owned dealerships mainly to
the recession. At the same time, would-be individual dealers are discouraged
by the cost of setting up - often more than Pounds 1m.

<TEXT>
Manchester Business School will today name Professor John Arnold, now at
Manchester University, as its new director.
He takes up the post on September 1, but he will begin working on the
school's strategy review when his appointment is ratified this month.
The school has been involved in a row over plans to make it part of a
federation with the university's department of accountancy and finance, and
the school of management at the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology.
The dispute led in 1992 to the resignation of the school's advisory board of
private-sector leaders and the departure of then-director Professor Tom
Cannon. His successor, Professor Tony Cockerill, is to become director of
Durham University Business School.
Yesterday Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless and chairman of
the school's new board, said that Prof Arnold was an inspired teacher and a
very efficient administrator.
Prof Arnold will be expected to raise the school's research rating, market
it more effectively and improve its financial position.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Scheme for school leavers supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost two-thirds of young people believe the government should introduce a
community service scheme for all school leavers, a survey shows today.
The study, conducted by Gallup for the charity CSV which places young people
in voluntary posts, shows that 64 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds believe the
government should establish a voluntary programme available to all young
people.
Although community service has supporters among individual politicians, the
parties have tended to shy away from the idea - particularly in any form
that might look like the introduction of a compulsory alternative to
national service.
The poll showed that 31 per cent believe that community service for school
leavers should be compulsory.
'Over 6m carers nationwide need respite care and support,' said Ms Elisabeth
Hoodless, executive director of CSV. 'Schools in our inner cities would be
transformed if each pupil had a volunteer mentor or tutor to help with their
reading. Crime would be cut by giving young people the chance to put their
energy and enthusiasm to good use.'

Significant changes are under way in the structure and ownership of
franchised car dealership networks in the UK with large groups expanding
rapidly at the expense of individually owned dealerships.
The main groups such as Lex Service and Inchcape now own more than a third
of the 7,000-plus franchised dealerships compared with just a quarter in
1990, according to Sewells International, the motor-trade monitoring group.
Some of these groups are also beating down manufacturer resistance to
'multi-franchising' - selling more than one make from a single site - and
leading the expansion of UK car retailing methods into continental Europe by
buying dealerships in other EU countries.
Sewells attributes the continuing decline in individually owned dealerships
mainly to the recession. At the same time, would-be individual dealers are
being discouraged by the 'prohibitive' cost of setting up a dealership -

The UK motor trade owned 19 outlets abroad in 1990. By last year the total

FT  09 MAY 94 / Union finds high level of worker dissatisfaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A high level of dissatisfaction with employers' treatment of their workers
is recorded in a workplace opinion survey published today by the MSF general
technical union.
Nearly half the sample of MSF's workplace representatives said the treatment
of staff in their workplace by management was either or poor or very poor
compared with 11 per cent who thought it was good or better. The highest
levels of dissatisfaction were among sales staff (65 per cent) and
administrative and clerical (51 per cent).
The survey also found that 37 per cent of employees feared their jobs were
less secure than three months ago, with the highest level of anxiety about
jobs being experienced in the financial services sector and the National
Health Service.
However, 28 per cent of MSF representatives described relations between the
unions and employers as good or very good and 44 per cent said they were
fair. By contrast, 28 per cent said relations were poor or very poor with 17
per cent reporting a deterioration in union/management relations.
The survey was carried out for MSF by the independent organisation Quality
Data Preparation. It covered representatives in 404 private and
public-sector workplaces. A MORI poll conducted for the GMB general union
identified concern over unemployment as the main factor in the way people
voted in the recent local government elections.
The survey of 501 people showed that for 69 per cent, policies on creating
jobs and reducing unemployment had been crucial in determining their vote.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said: 'Fear of unemployment is the
iceberg that will sink this government.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Inflation pressures 'will stay subdued'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued over the
next six months, the latest survey of business in the east Midlands has
found.
The survey, published today by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and
Nottingham Business School, covers 973 companies. It shows that nearly half
expect their prices to remain unchanged for the next six months while only
23 per cent predict they will raise prices by more than 2.5 per cent. This
follows a year in which 66 per cent of companies held or decreased their
prices and 52 per cent of wage settlements were below 2.5 per cent.
Profitability has increased since September and order books are fatter, but
recovery has not been as quick as companies expected. A total of 64 per cent
of companies now expect the Budget tax increases to slow recovery further.
This figure rises to 80 per cent in the food, drink and retail sectors.
The survey says, however: 'The tax increases are only seen as slowing down
the recovery and not heralding a return to recession.'
Considerable slack remains. The level of capacity utilisation among
manufacturing companies has scarcely changed since the autumn. Just 20 per
cent of companies are working at higher than 90 per cent capacity.
There is enough confidence in the region for 33 per cent of companies to be
predicting an increase in recruitment over the next six months compared with
28 per cent in September.
The levels of confidence are uneven: rising in the construction industry but
falling in the textiles and clothing sector and with doubts about future
prospects in the services and retail areas. There are also geographical
disparities. Confidence is highest in Northamptonshire but lower than six
months ago in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Lincolnshire.

FT  09 MAY 94 / London may buck job trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London will buck the trend towards replacing full-time jobs with part-time
ones, and its manufacturing companies are set to create more jobs than those
in financial services, says a report published today.
The survey of 1,000 companies by Centec, central London's Training and
Enterprise Council, found twice as many would increase full-time jobs as
would create part-time jobs.
Mrs Gwynneth Flower, Centec chief executive, said: 'This could be one of the
first real indications that full-time employment is coming back, and that
London is leading the way.'
Business services and manufacturing anticipate most growth in full time jobs
over the next three years. However, financial services companies continue to
expect a net reduction in staff.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Gummer seeks to revitalise town centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, will reinforce his commitment to
revitalising town centres this week with a report which warns that property
owners and financial institutions must invest in cities or risk them
becoming US-style 'ghost towns'.
Mr Gummer will launch the government-sponsored report, the result of a
year-long study, at the Cities 94 urban regeneration conference in London's
Docklands tomorrow. .
The report warns that cities face a choice between the North American
example, where retailing has been sucked out of many town centres by
out-of-town developments, and the continental European model, where high
population density, good transport facilities and attractive streets have
kept city centres popular.
The report's recommendations stress the need for property owners and
investors, including insurance companies, banks and building societies, to
play a part in regenerating urban centres.
If that is not achieved voluntarily, it suggests, the only solution might be
US-style business development districts, where property owners must pay a
local levy to fund town-centre promotion and improvements in the urban
environment.
Mr Gummer has already published two controversial guidance notes for local
authorities, PPG6 and PPG13, emphasising the importance of restricting
development of greenfield sites and restor-ing the vitality of town centres.
The new report - by the Urban and Economic Development Group, the planning
consultancy, and four other partners - explores ways of achieving the latter
and of assessing the impact on town centres of edge-of town and out-of-town
developments.
It recommends that local authorities produce a 'town profile', a vision of
where the town should be going, and a strategy to support it. It adds that
local authorities should also set up town-centre management groups, bringing
together local officials as well as forums representing all the main
interests including councillors and officials, retailers, chambers of
commerce, property owners and community groups.
A report published today by Corporate Intelligence, the retail research
group, warns that the government's tougher stance on out-of-town retailing
could threaten the development of US-style factory outlet centres and thus
restrict consumer choice.
It says nearly 30 such centres, which group together manufacturers' shops
selling branded goods at low prices, are proposed in the UK, but several may
not receive planning permission under the new rules.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Doubt on upturn in construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil engineers are becoming concerned that the construction recovery may be
starting to lose pace, says a survey of more than 130 companies published
today.
The survey by the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors shows that
there has been a disturbing decline in invitations to tender for work during
the first three months of this year.
Mr John Hackett, federation director-general, said the findings were mixed:
'Some of the answers were the best we have received for four years.
'There has been some further improvement in orders actually won and there
has been the first sign of an increase in jobs. On the other hand, cost
increases are accelerating and threatening to reverse the easing of the
squeeze on contractors' margins.'
The proportion of companies reporting a fall in invitations to tender
compared with 12 months earlier has increased from 18 per cent to 27 per
cent since the previous survey published at the beginning of this year. The
proportion reporting a rise in tender invitations has fallen from 43 per
cent to 27 per cent.
Mr Hackett said: 'With our members aware that the Department of Transport
will be starting fewer new road schemes in 1994-95 than in 1993-94; that
English local authorities' road spending plans have been hit by the savage
cut in transport supplementary grants; and that the English and Welsh water
industry has been holding back on investment pending the outcome of Ofwat's
price limits review, it is hardly surprising we have found members less
confident than previously about prospects for the coming 12 months.
'With additional orders already in the book it looks as if the recent slight
recovery in employment may hold up through 1994, but once again we have a
majority of firms fearing that the flow of new orders will tail off over the
coming year.'
The federation said that much of the recent rise in new orders had been due
to a few large projects such as the extension to London Underground's
Jubilee Line. These orders were very welcome but benefited relatively few
contractors, it added.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Change in lending forecast by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of the asset-backed securities market could have far-reaching
effects on the structure of lending in the UK, according to a report on
securitisation released by the Bank of England today.
The author of the report, Mr Ian Twinn of the Bank's economics division,
suggests that this growth may allow new institutions to enter the lending
market and compete against traditional lenders, potentially reducing costs
for borrowers, for example in the mortgage market.
Asset-backed securities are tradeable instruments backed by a pool of loans
or other assets. The process of 'securitisation' allows an institution to
remove these assets from its balance sheet.
The report says the UK asset-backed securities market has become second only
to that of the US. There is still room for substantial growth as only a
small proportion of total UK lending has been securitised.
By the end of last year Pounds 16bn of issues had been launched, the report
says. This compared with about Pounds 640bn of lending by banks and building
societies. Mortgage-backed securities accounted for 81 per cent of the
asset-backed market in the UK at the end of last year.
However, Mr Twinn says the further development of the market depends on the
cost of securitisation relative to other sources of funding.

Mortgage lenders could tighten their lending criteria, putting recovery in

intend to restrict further the availability of mortgage support to people on
social security benefits, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has warned.
In a letter to Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, the council

An Indian senior research chemist has won promotion and Pounds 15,000 in an

Mr Iqbal Khan, an MSF union member, was selected for redundancy and
dismissed in 1992. He was later re-employed by the same company earning
Pounds 6,000 a year less than his previous salary but then failed to gain
promotion in more than a dozen internal job applications. Mr Khan went to an

The west Midlands company is not being named as part of the settlement. Mr

FT  09 MAY 94 / Pay deal analyses differ on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Differing analyses of the recent upward trend in pay settlements are
published today by two of the most influential pay analysis organisations.
Incomes Data Services says that the upward trend looks set to continue with
a growing proportion of April settlements giving increases of between 3 per
cent and 3.5 per cent.
Industrial Relations Services, however, says that the upturn may now be
levelling out. It finds that settlements are remaining steady at 2.5 per
cent and that upward pressures 'seem unlikely to intensify much further over
the months ahead'.
Among the April rises monitored by IDS are 3 per cent increases at Toshiba,
3 per cent average merit awards at the Co-operative Bank and 4.5 per cent
average merit rises for clerical staff at Lloyds Bank.
Overall in the banking sector pay rises in 1994 have ranged between 1.6 per
cent and 4.5 per cent, with awards increasing in the course of the year.
Retail pay rises are slightly lower, with most between 2 per cent and 3 per
cent.
An indication that more companies have confidence inflation will remain
steady comes from the growth in pay deals covering more than one year. IDS
says that two-year agreements have recently been agreed at British Airways,
McVitie's, Chivas Brothers, Pilkington Optronics and Cummins Engine's Shotts
site.
A two-year deal at Massey Ferguson, the tractor maker, has also explicitly
recognised the impact of this year's tax increases by giving a higher
flat-rate rise of Pounds 12 for this year compared with Pounds 10 for next.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Policy not war is price trigger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation, as a prominent banker once remarked, is like sin - every
government denounces it, and every government practises it.
But as a Bank of England report on inflation history illustrates, recent
governments should blush more than their predecessors.
In spite of the modern assumption that inflation is as inevitable as the
weather, study of the three centuries of the Bank's lifespan shows that
prices can both rise and fall and that the rise has been more dramatic in
the past 50 years than in all of the previous 250.
Although the retail prices index rose only threefold between 1694 and 1948,
it has risen more than 20-fold since then, leaving prices 67 times higher
than in 1694, says the Bank, which is issuing the report in its Quarterly
Bulletin to coincide with its 300th birthday.
It admits that calculating this rise is far from easy, given the problems of
finding equivalents to the modern shopping basket.
'What can we compare with the price today of a second-hand car - a
second-hand sedan chair?' it asks, pointing out that even an apparently
'fundamental' item such as potatoes must be qualified - in 1694 potatoes had
only recently arrived in England and were considered as exotic as rambutan
today.
But by using 'timeless' goods such as eggs, bread and coal, the main message
to emerge is that until 50 years ago it was war, not policy, that was the
main trigger of inflation.
The Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century, for example, created one of
the most dramatic price rises in the Bank's early history - a crisis fuelled
by its failure then to recognise that the government's heavy public
borrowing was being monetised, the Bank notes with some historical
self-flagellation.
In the event this crisis subsided as prices fell during the 19th century -
by 1894 bread was actually cheaper than its 1694 price of 5.6d (2.3p). And
it was not until the onset of apparently irreversible inflation this century
that the number of inflation theories also began to soar, variously citing
unemployment, consumer expectations or central-bank credibility as the
culprit.
The Bank carefully refrains from drawing any policy recommendations from
this - although it modestly notes that modern bank clerks start on 25 per
cent less salary than their 17th-century counterparts.
But after pointing out that the first recorded inflation occured in the
second century, when Roman citizens took to cutting their gold coins in
half, its conclusion, unsurprisingly, extols monetary caution.
'There have been no instances when inflation has not been associated with an
increase in the money supply,' it warns - a message that will have as much
relevance for the government perusing this month's money supply figures as
the Roman emperors 18 centuries ago.

FT  09 MAY 94 / North-east England quoted company sector gains momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The importance of the quoted company sector in north-east England increased
significantly last year, demonstrating that the region's economy has
regained momentum, a survey by accountancy firm Price Waterhouse has found,
Chris Tighe writes.
The north-east's quoted companies recorded turnover of Pounds 3.5bn last
year, up 12 per cent on 1992. Pre-tax profits grew 30 per cent to Pounds
326m. In the 1980s, 23 of the quoted companies disappeared because of
takeovers, receiverships and relocations but the survey says this trend now
appears to have been reversed. At the end of last year the region had 29
quoted companies, two more than a year before. There are now 30 and another
flotation is planned this summer.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Consumer spending drop blamed on tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first signs that April's tax increases could be sapping consumer
confidence emerged yesterday, with the release of figures showing a surge in
consumer borrowing in March - but a drop in discretionary spending in April.
Data published by two credit organisations point to increased credit levels
in the retail, car and home-loans sectors in March as consumers apparently
ignored the impending tax rises.
But figures released by Barclaycard, which represents 38 per cent of UK
credit card spending, suggest the tax increases incorporated in April's pay
packets are now reducing discretionary spending.
The figures, which show the amounts processed by Barclaycard on any given
day - indicating spending on that day or immediately before - suggest
spending has dropped slightly compared with the equivalent period last year.
On April 25, the amount processed by Barclaycard was 120 per cent of the
amount processed on Monday, April 26 last year. By May 5, the cumulative
figure over the previous two weeks had slipped to 106 per cent of the
comparable 1993 figure.
Mr Michael Head, who is in charge of planning and development at
Barclaycard, admitted that the figures were 'not very exciting'.
He added that, although consumers appeared to have discounted much of the
impact of April's tax increases in the period since the November Budget,
there could still be further slippage. 'It looks as though there may just be
a slight tightening of the screw,' he said.
This concern, however, is at odds with an upbeat message in a report
published today by the Finance and Leasing Association on consumer credit in
March, before the tax rises were introduced. The association represents
companies accounting for 80 per cent of consumer credit and 30 per cent of
business investment in plant and equipment.
Total consumer credit rose to Pounds 1,463m in March, a growth of 44 per
cent year-on-year (and 19 per cent compared with February), the association
said.
The biggest growth occurred in the retail sector, where purchases on store
cards grew 57 per cent year-on-year, and 34 per cent month-on-month. Credit
in the motor sector grew 37 per cent and personal loans rose 34 per cent
year-on-year.
The publication of these figures follows a weekend report by Infolink, the
credit information organisation, which also found a credit surge and
concluded that in March 'consumers remained unperturbed by April's impending
tax increases'.
The finance association also noted that the rise in business credit was
relatively subdued, with an 8 per cent growth in business finance
year-on-year - lower than previous months.
Mr Tony Mallin, the association's chairman, said: 'The business figures for
March are disappointing . . . in our view businesses are still not investing
as much as we would have expected at this point in the cycle.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Debt threatens investment, says Bank: Quarterly Bulletin
warns cautious borrowing likely - Asset-backed securities market grows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Norman, Economics Editor
Severe financial constraints affecting a minority of UK households and
companies are likely to lead to cautious borrowing patterns and moves to
reduce debt in the months ahead, the Bank of England warns today.
In an article released before publication tomorrow of its Quarterly Bulletin
and Inflation Report, the Bank concludes that the continuing effects of high
debt levels on some companies could dampen investment and employment
expansion during the present economic recovery.
In the longer term the Bank expects households and corporations will be
willing to take on debt again.
In the personal sector, income gearing - the ratio of net interest payments
to disposable income - is back at the levels of the mid 1980s while the
corporate sector as a whole has reduced its indebtedness sharply since 1992.
But, says the Bank, 'in the recent recession, debt had a much greater impact
on both sectors' behaviour than in the recession of the early 1980s.
'Even last year, many companies remained vulnerable to a sharp rise in
interest rates.' House price falls and debt deflation 'left many recent
housebuyers - a substantial minority of all homeowners, and often young,
first-time buyers - with negative net wealth'.
At its peak in the first quarter of 1993, the negative equity of homebuyers
totalled nearly Pounds 12bn and affected about 1.8m households, of which
more than half were in the south-east.
In the first quarter of this year, negative equity was still affecting 1.29m
households. Its total value was Pounds 7.6bn, representing an average of
Pounds 5,900 per affected household, the Bank says.
In the corporate sector, the Bank found that smaller companies were
especially badly hit by high levels of debt. Many companies became
vulnerable to recession through over-expansion in the 1980s when they had
high profit expectations that were not fulfilled.
One analysis showed that 'the firms that were highly indebted in 1991 had
been among the most profitable in the mid 1980s'.
The combination of debt and poor profitability among highly geared companies
led in the recession to large-scale job losses, cuts in investment and
widespread insolvency. A substantial minority of households had mortgage
arrears and some lost their homes through repossession.
The Bank says the financial hardships experienced by households have changed
spending patterns and affected the economy as a whole. For example, lump-sum
repayments to mortgage lenders rose by 140 per cent between 1989 and 1993 to
Pounds 2.5bn, or nearly 5 per cent of personal sector saving last year. This
increase, at a time of falling mortgage rates, almost certainly reflected
concern about debt levels.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Big wages mask big risks / A look at the pitfalls and
rewards which could await foreign construction workers in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Bricklayers wanted for contracts in Germany; excellent rates offered;
immediate start'
Advertisements in British national newspapers continue to lure construction
workers with the promise of high wages on German building sites.
The advertisement above was one of more than half a dozen job offers which
appeared on a single day last week in Britain's Sun newspaper.
Some British builders unable to find work in the UK have made money working
in Germany. For others the dream of finding a job abroad has become a
nightmare as they have been left destitute and cheated by unscrupulous
labour agencies and employers.
The UK Building Employers Confederation issued a report last week
highlighting the plight of stranded and destitute construction workers in
Germany. In one month this year British consulates in Germany made
arrangements to ship home 150 construction workers in distress according to
the foreign office. These were only the workers who could find relatives and
friends who would pay for their fares home.
Many had replied to advertisements from labour agencies with telephone
numbers in Belgian and Dutch towns, such as Nijmegen and Arnhem close to the
German border. Most of these would be illegal in Germany under the country's
strict labour laws, according to the British Building Employers
Confederation.
Interviews rarely took place in offices but in public places such as bars.
One London construction worker found it strange when he was interviewed in
an otherwise empty building.
He later realised the furniture was only temporary.
Mrs Elizabeth Bridge, the confederation's director of taxation, toured
London building sites to question workers recently returned from Germany.
She became concerned after workers requested information on how to reclaim
German tax paid on wages. They had been duped into accepting lower wages on
the false grounds that UK authorities would repay the tax.
One scaffolder who answered an advertisement in the Sun paid his own way to
a hotel in Frankfurt on the promise of a job in Dresden. He waited three
days with about 50 other workers but his potential employer never arrived.
The scaffolder was left with a Pounds 400 bill and the agents could not be
traced.
A 19-year-old construction worker replied to an advertisement in the London
Evening Standard placed by a Belgian agency.
He was taken to a car park development in Germany where he spent four weeks
grinding the surface of bricks. He was not supplied with a mask as required
under German and British safety laws.
After three weeks he had been advanced only Pounds 30. When he complained at
the end of the fourth week he was dismissed. Another worker with experience
but no formal qualifications was persuaded by an agency to accept a job in
eastern Germany.
When he arrived the contractor refused to engage him. He was left without
job and money.
To enable German employers to avoid paying national insurance, British
construction workers must hold an E101 certificate from the UK government
exempting them from making social security payments in the 'host country'.
British rules allowing workers to qualify for E101 certificates were
tightened last month to apply to only those 'who are normally self-employed
in the UK'. This is unlikely to stem cross-border work as more than
two-thirds of UK construction workers are estimated to be registered as self
employed.
One agency advertising for bricklayers in a British newspaper offered to
arrange E101 certificates. According to the British confederation, builders
planning to work in Germany should check whether agencies are bona fide
offices and offers of work should be in writing and checked in advance.
Workers also should check whether they are required to register as living in
Germany. If the answer is negative they should not go as they will be
working outside the law and will have no protection, said the confederation.
Most important of all, workers should leave enough money for return fares
with a reliable friend or family as British consulates do not provide money
for fares home.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Janusz R, a carpenter, has it all worked out.
He lives in the Polish town of Miedzyrzecz, not far from the German border.
'I'm far better off going over to Berlin every couple of weeks. I stay with
my cousin. And I earn lots of money on the building sites. Then I can go
home, buy building materials, and can afford to take off time to build my
own house with my German savings.'
Janusz is just one of the many thousands of Poles, Irish, Turks and
Portuguese who are helping to rebuild Berlin.
'Everybody talks about the unemployment in east Berlin and in east Germany.
But these east Germans just don't want to get their hands dirty,' said Mr
Wolfgang Korich, a supervisor of a building site in east Berlin's Mitte,
once the heart of Berlin before the second world war and now a prime
development area for shopping and office complexes.
Mr Kohrich, however, has few complaints about his foreign workers.
'They work in all kinds of weather. We don't have to pay them bad weather
money,' he said. 'And my foreign men work at least 60 hours a week. None of
this seven-hour-a day nonsense. And they don't drink on the site either,
unlike some Germans who have the beer bottle open by 8am,' he continued.
Yet some foreign workers, such as Mr Vincent Kelly who arrived from Ireland
several months ago, complain about wages. 'There's no work at home. So I am
lucky to get work here. But when I compare what I earn to a German, it
really makes me angry,' he said.
Mr Kelly says he earns DM25 an hour before tax. 'But the Germans earn DM38 -
and that's the minimum paid to an unskilled worker, if such a thing exists
among the Germans. After all the tax is deducted, I take home about DM13 an
hour while they get DM24. Its not fair.'
Mr Kohrich admits he pays his foreign workers at least a third, if not a 50
per cent, less than his German crew.
A hundred yards down the street, a team of 200 workers were hard at work;
there was hardly a German on the site. 'Half of us are Portuguese. The other
half is Polish,' said one. 'We do the excavation work, the Poles do a lot of
the scaffolding. The wages vary. What would you expect?'
But the Association for the German Construction Industry is furious about
the number of foreigners working in the building sites throughout eastern
Germany.
'Some local councils, city authorities, and building firms are contracting
out to foreign companies because they can do things more cheaply,' said Mr
Heiko Stiepelmann, the association's spokesman. 'This means competition.
This could affect the wage levels in the industry.'
Janusz laughed when he heard this. 'And show me a site which only has German
workers,' he quipped.
'These Germans are just too over-qualified, or else they get paid too much
when they are out of a job. I think that's the reason why there is a
shortage of construction workers,' he said. 'I don't know what the
association is complaining about. They get us cheaply. The work gets done.
So they should stop grumbling.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / Thuringia in public funds scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eastern German state of Thuringia has been accused of persistent
misappropriation of public funds and abuse of office by Der Spiegel and
Wochenpost, two German weeklies.
If confirmed, the allegations, which appear to be substantiated by the state
Audit Office, could damage Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election chances in
eastern Germany just as his governing Christian Democratic Union is trying
to claw back support. Thuringia is governed by a CDU/Free Democrats
coalition, led by Mr Bernhard Vogel, a west German and a close ally of the
Chancellor.
The allegations coincide with the start of the election campaign in
Thuringia, which faces a local government poll on June 12, and state
elections and federal elections next October. Opinion polls give the CDU-led
coalition less than 23 per cent of the vote in the five eastern states.
The allegations touch several ministers. In one case, the government sold a
state-owned clinic to a west German company for DM7.6m (Pounds 3m) although
Wochenpost alleges the real market value exceeded DM42m.
The scandals are expected to be greeted with cynicism in Thuringia which has
endured an unemployment rate above 18 per cent. They also reflect the
unstable nature of the state's government. Since late 1990, 25 senior
officials have either resigned or changed office. These include one prime
minister, five ministers, eight state secretaries, three police chiefs, and
eight regional councillors.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Finland, Sweden join peace alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An important new link in the security structure of post-Cold war Europe will
be set in place today as Sweden and Finland, moving away from their
long-standing neutrality, join the Partnership for Peace devised by Nato.
At the same time, the Western European Union is expected to upgrade links
with nine former communist nations as well as drawing Turkey, Norway and
Iceland more closely into its embryonic efforts at military planning.
The moves come at a time of mounting uncertainty over the intentions of
Russia towards both Nato and the three Baltic republics, which are among the
nine nations that the WEU will elevate into associate partners.
While it still operates in the shadow of Nato, the WEU is expected to grow
in importance as the US scales down its involvement in Europe.
Moscow stated last week that, in matters of co-operation with the Atlantic
alliance, it insists on having a role in drawing up the menu, as opposed to
selecting dishes that have already been cooked at Nato headquarters. General
Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, also sent shudders down Baltic spines
by hinting that the Russian garrison in Estonia, whose withdrawal has been
promised by August 31, might actually be reinforced.
Unlike the 15 members of the former Eastern bloc which have become 'partners
for peace,' the two Nordic states that sign up are expected to be givers
rather than takers of military expertise. Both Sweden and Finland have
already been lending a discreet hand to efforts by the Baltic states to
build up defence forces.
Moscow's effort to influence the Partnership from within will be aided by
the fact that it remains a fluid arrangement.
Only 10 days ago the Partnership received a provisional headquarters, in the
shape of a modest green building at Mons, near Brussels, previously used for
planning the reinforcement of Berlin in the event of an East-West crisis. Of
the 15 former communist states that have signed up to the Partnership, only
Poland is certain to assign officers to the Mons premises. Even they cannot
take up their duties until Belgium clarifies their legal status.
Two, and possibly three, war games within the framework of the Partnership
should take place this year, including one naval exercise, and an exercise
in the Netherlands that will focus on peace-keeping. But participants have
yet to be announced. The emphasis on peace-keeping is one of the reasons why
Russia does not want to be left out. Russia remains hungry for international
approval of its 'peace-keeping' activity on its borders.
Moscow's aspirations include Russia's acceptance as a full partner in Nato's
deliberations on Bosnia; Russian participation in other forms of
co-operation between the top western nations, such as the Group of Seven; an
upward revision of the troop numbers Russia is allowed by the treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe; and a veto on the elevation of other
Partnership members to full membership of Nato.

FT  09 MAY 94 / France unveils first N-carrier: Europeans can develop their
own means of security, says Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>

It was a weekend of false starts on historic projects for President Francois
Mitterrand. On Friday he helped Queen Elizabeth open the Channel Tunnel
which then promptly closed. A day later, he went to Brest to 'launch'
France's, and Europe's, first-nuclear powered aircraft carrier, but the
Charles de Gaulle stayed firmly in dry dock.
If five months seems a long wait to use the Chunnel, spare a thought for the
impatient French navy which will have to wait another five years, until
summer 1999, before their Charles de Gaulle is fully fitted out with all its
weaponry and Rafale jets.
What the navy had to be content with on Saturday was a Christo-like
wrapping-up of the carrier's hull and its conning tower in the tricolour,
and then the ceremonial 'undressing' of the carrier in the presence of Mr
Mitterrand, and three of the people who would like to succeed him as
president - Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Paris mayor Jacques Chirac and
the defence minister, Francois Leotard.
The carrier's real launch will take place out of the limelight in a week or
so when tide and weather are judged right, because the navy wants to take no
risks with the ship which has cost FFr17.5bn (Pounds 2bn) so far, not
counting an even more expensive bill for the Rafales. Ironically, timing of
the launch of this ship, symbol of France's we-depend-on-no-one sovereignty,
is very much dictated by a Dutch salvage company, which can only spare for a
brief time its giant barge crane to lift the nuclear propulsion reactors
into the carrier.
But the 38,000 tonne carrier will be worth the wait. 'European navies have
some 200 frigates between them, but only ours has true aircraft carriers',
said Mr Mitterrand, adding that 'by preserving this, France will assure its
place in a future European navy.' Though less than half the size of their US
counterparts, French carriers are the only European ones capable of putting
heavy aircraft into the air ever since Britain opted for the Invincible
class of mini-carrier with their acrobatic Harriers.
But France's Foch and Clemenceau carriers (32,000 tonnes) have each seen
more than 30 years' service, and cannot take the heavier, 15-20 tonne
version of the Rafale fighter/bomber coming into service at the end of this
century. Equally significant are France's unrelenting ambitions for its own
defence and that of Europe - shared as much by the socialist president as by
the conservative Balladur government - and the new importance it places on
crisis prevention and power projection, which are classic rationales for
aircraft carriers.
'There is no reason why 350m Europeans cannot develop together their own
means of security,' said Mr Mitterrand. But co-operation involves
concessions, he told an audience of several thousand which included Admiral
Sir Kenneth Eaton, Comptroller of the Royal Navy. Referring to the Horizon
project in which France, Britain and Italy hope to build a dozen or so
frigates together, the president said France's Horizon-class frigates would
be the essential escort to the Charles de Gaulle.
But he warned of 'industrial difficulties' which were preventing the project
getting off the ground. French officials said defence ministers of the three
countries were delaying signing a formal memorandum of understanding until
an Anglo-Italian dispute over radar had been resolved. Italy is offering the
completed Empar system, but the UK claims its Mesar system would be better.

FT  09 MAY 94 / French to urge Airbus challenge to US jumbo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NICE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospatiale of France will press its European Airbus partners to step up
marketing and development efforts of a new 500-550 seat large Airbus
airliner - the A3XX - to challenge the monopoly of the US Boeing company in
the jumbo aircraft market.
The move reflects concern over Boeing's plans to develop a larger version of
its Boeing 747-400 jumbo with a new wing to consolidate its dominance of the
big aircraft market.
Although the four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace,
British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - have been involved for the past two
years in joint studies with Boeing of the development of a very large
aircraft, Aerospatiale is worried that Boeing is moving to develop a bigger
version of the 747.
'We must give Boeing the strongest possible signal that Airbus will develop
its own jumbo if Boeing decided to go it alone with a bigger 747,' said Mr
Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale chairman.
Airbus has suspected that Boeing has been using the joint studies on a super
jumbo programme with the Europeans as a device to delay Airbus' own efforts
to compete against its monopoly of the jumbo market while it continued to
study a bigger version of the 747. Airbus, however, has also continued to
pursue studies of a 500-550 seater airliner. 'These preliminary studies on
the A3XX jumbo will be completed in the next few weeks,' said Mr Claude
Terrazzoni, head of Aerospatiale's civil aircraft division.
Mr Terrazzoni said Aerospatiale estimated the cost of developing the A3XX, a
double deck jumbo airliner, at around Dollars 8bn. This compares with
Dollars 6bn the Airbus partners spent on the development of the A330-A340
family of 350-seat widebodied aircraft which have recently entered service.
Although only two airlines, British Airways and Singapore Airlines, have so
far shown interest in a super jumbo aircraft, Mr Terrazzoni expected demand
for around 500 very large capacity airliners costing between Dollars 200m
and Dollars 250m each to emerge within 20 years. 'Aircraft with over 400
seats will account for over 40 per cent of the value of the civil aircraft
market in the next 20 years and Airbus simply cannot afford not to be part
of that market,' he stressed.
While continuing their joint studies, each side is now striving to position
itself ahead of the other to launch its own super jumbo programmes. This
issue is expected to weigh heavily in the revival of negotiations in Geneva
on May 19 on a new civil aircraft subsidy code under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
The talks were suspended at the end of last year when it was decided to try
to reach accord on a Gatt civil aircraft code by the end of this year. But
the Europeans fear the US has little interest in negotiating such an
agreement, preferring to see the civil aircraft sector fall into the general
Gatt subsidy code.
This reflects differences in which the US and European aircraft industries
are subsidised. European manufacturers rely on direct refundable loan
support from their governments while the US industry benefits from indirect
research and development support from government agencies. In 1992 the US
and the then European Community agreed to limit direct support to 33 per
cent of development costs of new aircraft programmes.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Serbs have faith in their new saviour: Ebullient bank chief
has brought inflation under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the Yugoslav National bank, crowed that
his economic programme had virtually defeated sanctions, after he managed to
reduce inflation from 300,000 to zero per cent overnight.
At a recent dinner in Belgrade, Mr Avramovic said economic expansion was
under way despite nearly two years of UN sanctions, which include an oil
embargo.
Across the table, Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign minister of
Yugoslavia, appealed for the lifting of the crippling sanctions, which he
said, repeating a common official refrain, were 'unjust and genocidal'.
The contradictory statements reveal the collision of two political roles. Mr
Jovanovic tries to convince his foreign colleagues that peace cannot be won
without lifting sanctions, while Mr Avramovic, who is believed to be in his
late 70s, is responsible for boosting public confidence in the new Yugoslav
dinar, which is pegged at one-to-one with the D-Mark, and the rebirth of the
Serbian economy.
In fact, people seem to believe in Mr Avramovic, Serbia's newest saviour.
In Belgrade, people thank him because they no longer have to count out
billions of dinars to buy a loaf of bread. Their monthly wage has risen from
DM30 (Pounds 12) to DM100. Goods have returned to store shelves. Even though
petrol costs DM3 a litre, there are more cars on the streets than at any
time since sanctions, imposed on Belgrade for the violent partition of
Bosnia.
The 10m inhabitants of Yugoslavia have breathed a sigh of relief that they
no longer have to race against hyperinflation.
'We have actually overcome the blockade. Yugoslavia can no longer be
blackmailed with sanctions, the problem of sanctions and blockade is now
secondary,' said the ebullient Mr Avramovic, a former employee of the World
Bank, in a recent interview.
But gloomy Belgrade economists and businessmen say the sanctions and the
price of nearly three years of waging war have devastated the Yugoslav
economy. They fear that economic recovery cannot be sustained without
lifting sanctions and foreign loans. They trade predictions on when the
programme will collapse.
The ebullient Mr Avramovic says production was expected to grow by 30 per
cent in April in relation to the month before. It grew by 24 per cent in
March, according to official statistics.
Mr Ivan Vujacic, an economist at Belgrade University, says: 'This is no
miracle. After hyperinflation is stopped, it is always followed by a 10-15
per cent jump in production. We have not even reached that percentage.'
He says the new dinar has enabled people to calculate their expenditures,
but he fears that huge taxes will wipe out any small private enterprise.
Further, economists worry that the inflation will soon reappear. Mr Milutin
Mitrovic, editor of Ekonomska Politika, an independent economic magazine,
points to hidden inflation. 'Businessmen have taken out credits but are
unlikely to pay them back, which will mean a return of inflation.'
'The black market has disappeared because of the harsh penalties from three
months to three years in prison for selling hard currency. But there is no
real basis for ascertaining the value of the dinar,' he adds. Mr Avramovic
laughs, saying his programme has left the black marketeers of hard currency
out of work.
He says the country's currency reserves have increased by DM450m since the
progamme was implemented at the end of January. Most economists say the
budget deficit of DM2.5bn represents an awesome obstacle to recovery. While
Mr Avramovic has succeeded in stopping the printing presses of the national
mint, so far he has not eliminated the enormous demands on the budget. For
example, Serbia alone reportedly supports a 100,000-strong police force.
Mr Avramovic claims to have discovered a new model for economic recovery,
which he admits was in part due to luck public acceptance fo the new dinar.
But economists have little confidence in the official statistics which try
to put a gloss on the bleak prospects. They predict that by September, the
programme will cave in, unable to meet all the demands - from the army to
the farmers.
Mr Mitrovic says: 'It will reach the point where the statistics cannot
disguise the real situation.'

Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk hopes a special aid package for his
country's energy industry can be approved at a Group of Seven industrial
nations summit in Italy in July, the Spanish daily El Pais reported
yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid.
'It's difficult to say what sum we are talking about but if we were given
real aid of between Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) and Dollars 8bn we would be
able to manage the range of possibilities open to us quite well and not only
in energy,' Mr Kravchuk said.

Sweden's Centre party yesterday voted to support the country's application
to join the European Union, averting a potential crisis in the four-party
coalition government, writes Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm.
The vote enables the coalition to present a united front on the issue in the
run-up to September's general election and a national referendum on EU
membership on November 13. The Centre's backing for membership came followed
a two-day debate. The margin in favour was 184 votes to 92.

whose recent discovery has led to heated public debate about the bank and Mr

<TEXT>
Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin has sacked a deputy privatisation
minister in an attempt to fend off accusations that he is moving too slowly
and ineffectively on economic reform.
Mr Vladimir Kvasov, the prime minister's chief of staff, revealed in a
newspaper interview that Mr Valentin Sychkin, deputy chairman of the
Committee for State Property, was fired for failing to provide office space
for unspecified officials. Mr Dmitry Vasiliev, another deputy privatisation
minister and a driving force behind a mass sell-off of state assets, would
be scolded next week for not submitting a new privatisation plan for later
this year, he said.
The criticisms are part of a series of attacks from Mr Chernomyrdin on three
ministries whose top staff are still closely identified with radical leaders
forced out of office last winter.
Infuriating the men in question, Mr Kvasov made public the fact that Mr
Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister responsible for the budget, and
Mr Yakov Urinson, a deputy economics minister, had been scolded for not
meeting deadlines on issues such as the distribution of state investment
credits.
He said that the ministers of economics, finance and privatisation had been
given a week to 'put their departments in order'.

FT  09 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Dutch press cool on poll glitz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NETHERLANDS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In the eyes of the Dutch press, the staid, stodgy world of Dutch politics
has been engulfed by a tide of 'Americanisation'. The proof, this theory
goes, is the campaign waged in last week's general election.
The evidence is largely circumstantial but undeniable. Compared with the
studiously low-key campaigns of previous elections, the 1994 poll was a
veritable razzmatazz of sound bites, photo opportunities and competing
personalities.
The glitziest campaign - by Dutch standards - was waged by the Christian
Democrats, who also happened to suffer the greatest defeat. Mr Elco
Brinkman, trying to step into the shoes of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing
prime minister, used tactics which his advisers had borrowed partly from the
US and Britain.
Mr Brinkman's whirlwind tour of the country was made in a campaign bus
bristling with the latest in mobile communications and fax machines. Rather
than standing stiffly by lecterns during speeches, he was hooked up to a
mobile microphone which allowed him to roam the stage in what became known
as the 'Brinkman shuffle'. And, like Mr Bill Clinton appearing on 'Larry
King Live' programme during the US campaign, Mr Brinkman chose to play the
'soft' media, giving interviews to women's magazines and undergoing
questioning from a popular comedian.
His rival in the Labour party, Mr Wim Kok, also waged a highly personalised
campaign. His face stared out from election posters stating 'Choose Kok',
with little or no mention made of the unpopular party he represents.
This style of campaigning came in for criticism in the earnest Dutch press,
which produces newspapers of various political persuasions, but not a single
tabloid or sensationalist title.
But the morning after the election, Dutch politics was back to normal with a
vengeance, with attention firmly turned back to excruciatingly intricate
speculation about the composition of the next coalition.
Elections in the Netherlands do not produce winners and losers even at the
best of the times. But this year's result was spectacularly inconclusive,
with the two biggest parties losing ground to two smaller 'swing' parties,
the right-wing Liberals (VVD) and the left-of-centre D66.
The erstwhile coalition partners, Mr Brinkman's Christian Democrats (CDA)
and Mr Kok's Labour party (PvdA), lost their majority. This means that a
coalition of three parties will have to be formed from the four main
parties. And this has led in the press to the 'alphabet soup' speculation so
beloved of political columnists and leader writers.
Will the next government be a CDA-PvdA-D66 cabinet; a coalition of strange
bedfellows like PvdA-VVD-D66; or would Labour be forced into opposition by a
CDA-D66-VVD grouping? What about the option of taking on board the two new
pensioners' parties that had come from nowhere to capture seven seats?
Summing up the situation, the financial daily Het Financieele Dagblad
concluded that 'a long and bloody' period of coalition negotiations lay
ahead.
Other newspapers agreed that no firm conclusions could be drawn on who would
be the next prime minister, or even who would be included in the next
cabinet.
At the daily De Telegraaf in Amsterdam, columnist Kees Lunshof reminded
readers that Labour could make no automatic claims to anything, even though
it had narrowly emerged from the fragmented balloting as the largest party.
'There is no written rule that the PvdA must take part in government because
it is the biggest,' he wrote.
In Rotterdam, the NRC Handelsblad cautioned in a leader that it was too
early to write off the Christian Democrats as coalition members, despite
their record losses at the polls. 'It would not be the first time in Dutch
political history that the loser of an election walks away victoriously from
the cabinet formation,' it said.
In the absence of any real progress in forming the next coalition,
speculation like this fills column after column in the newspapers. Perhaps
it is a good idea for newspaper readers, as well as newspaper writers, to
start getting used to these minute examinations of coalition tactics: after
the 1977 election, for instance, it took no less than 208 days for the
Netherlands to come up with a government coalition.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Berlusconi allies hold up deal on Italian cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Six weeks after Italy's general elections, media magnate Mr Silvio
Berlusconi is still facing problems completing a cabinet list that satisfies
his own requirements and the individual demands of his allies in the Freedom
Alliance.
The battle over the various cabinet portfolios has revealed the wide
differences between the demands of the Northern League which needs to retain
a separate identity from Forza Italia and from the neo-fascists. It has also
shown that Mr Berlusconi has found it far more difficult than he expected to
produce a government team and a coherent programme since his landslide
victory in the general elections of March 27-28.
The main point of contention has been the post of interior minister - which
the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi has claimed as the largest
party in parliament. It appeared agreement had been reached last Thursday on
an independent candidate for the portfolio which controls the administrative
apparatus and the security services.
This agreement fell apart at the weekend because the compromise candidate
declined to accept the post. The job was offered, for the second time, to Mr
Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's best known anti-corruption magistrate. However he
politely refused the offer, complicating the choice of a successor.
If the agreement on the interior portfolio between Mr Berlusconi's Forza
Italia and Mr Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance is to hold,
the post will have to be given to an independent figure, probably a senior
judge.
However, the continuing problems over the Interior Ministry underline the
difficult balance of interests within the Freedom Alliance.
Mr Berlusconi had hoped to finalise the cabinet last week. He is under
strong pressure to present his list of ministers at the latest by Tuesday so
that parliament can rapidly confer a vote of confidence on Italy's 53rd
post-war government and the programme of the right-wing government.

FT  09 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Politician to test water on
coalition preferences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first step towards form a new Dutch government was taken over the
weekend when a senior politician was asked to poll the different parties on
their coalition preferences, reports Ronald van de Krol.
Mr Herman Tjeenk Willink, a Labour politician who is chairman of the upper
house of parliament, was appointed 'informateur' by Queen Beatrix to assess
the parties' views. Last week's general election was inconclusive, producing
four main parties of almost equal strength.
The ruling Christian Democrats and Labour lost their majority in the
150-seat lower of parliament, while two opposition parties, the right-wing
Liberals and left-of-centre D66, made strong gains. Several combinations of
these parties are possible, but at least three parties will be needed to
create a majority in parliament.
Mr Tjeenk Willink's first task is to find out whether it will be possible to
form a left-right coalition of Labour, D66 and the Liberals. This coalition,
described as the 'purple' option because it would span the red of Labour to
the 'Tory' blue of the Liberals, would force the Christian Democrats into
opposition for the first time. The Christian Democrats, who traditionally
dominate Dutch politics, support the idea of investigating the 'purple'
option first.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Yemeni forces yesterday appeared locked in fierce fighting to repulse
northern units attempting a drive towards Aden, the political and economic
capital of the south, in what southern officials called the 'decisive'
battle of the intensifying war at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.
Amid claim and counter-claim, the military command in southern Yemen said
its troops yesterday regained full control of the capital of the southern
province of Abyan but fighting with northern troops was still raging in
Lawdar about 60 km from Aden.
Military and political officials in the south said earlier that at least
three southern 'brigades' - each of up to 2,000 men - had been deployed to
counter a push towards Aden by the Amaliqa brigade, the main North Yemen
military unit at Zinjibar, 20 km east of the southern port.
The reports appear to confirm that Mr Ali al-Beidh, vice- president of
unified Yemen and political leader of the south, is fighting for his
political life against an outright drive by Mr Ali Abdullah Saleh, unified
Yemen's president and leader of the north, to evict him from power and
reassert the country's disintegrating four-year-old unity by force.
North and South Yemen formally unified in 1990, but relations between the
two leaders collapsed last year after the state's first multi-party
elections, when Mr al-Beidh claimed southerners were politically
marginalised. However, the two armies were never themselves unified, and
pockets of fighting in north and south result from symbolic redeployment of
northern units in the south and vice versa.
Over the weekend, military officials in Sanaa said five Scud missiles had
been launched at targets in the north, all apparently landing without
causing damage. Evacuees from Aden in Djibouti yesterday confirmed that
Northern jets had bombed Aden airport and other installations, but said that
damage appeared limited.
By yesterday, however, the focus of fighting appeared firmly to the north
and east of Aden.
Witnesses quoted by the Reuter news agency spoke of 30 southern military
aircraft leaving Aden airport apparently heading for bombing raids in the
province of Abyan, to the north-east of Aden.
Southern officials claimed that North Yemeni units had been defeated in a
second push towards Aden from the north, at Lahj and Daleah, along the main
routes into the city. 'We are in a defensive position, but the northern army
is not making progress,' said a spokesman for the Yemen Socialist Party of
Mr al-Beidh in Aden.
Mr Robert Pelletreau, US assistant secretary of state for near eastern
affairs, confirmed yesterday that northern forces made no recent progress in
their push towards Aden.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Israel stresses role of US as peace mediator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria have reached a new level but will
depend entirely on active US mediation, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israeli deputy
foreign minister, said yesterday.
In an interview Mr Beilin said Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
would return to the region on Saturday for a diplomatic shuttle mission
between Damascus and Jerusalem aimed at advancing the talks over the return
to Syria of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace. It
will be Mr Christopher's second Israeli-Syrian shuttle in less than a month.
'I can't see any prospects for peace in the Middle East, especially peace
between us and Syria, without the US,' said Mr Beilin who visits London on
Wednesday.
'It's impossible to have high-level negotiations like we had with Egypt; its
impossible to have a secret channel as we had with the Palestinians and I
don't see any other mediator who is ready to take it upon himself.'
Mr Beilin, however, said Syria had made positive responses to Israeli
proposals during Mr Christopher's last shuttle which ended last Monday. 'For
the first time in our history we speak about withdrawal (from the Heights)
and Syria speaks about peace. It never happened before and it enables us to
find a solution.'
According to officials Israel has offered Syria a three-stage withdrawal
from the Heights over eight years with each stage accompanied by deepening
diplomatic and economic ties and security guarantees. Israeli newspapers
also reported yesterday that Israel is asking Washington for Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 3.35bn) in special US military aid to maintain Israel's strategic
advantage over Syria.
Mr Beilin said until Israel reached peace with Syria, Damascus could
continue to veto the establishment of official diplomatic ties between
Israel and more moderate Arab states in the Gulf and Magreb. Syria could
also successfully pressure Arab countries not to lift the Arab economic
boycott of the Jewish state.
On the Palestinian peace process Mr Beilin said the next phase - the
extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho to the rest of the West Bank -
would depend on the desire and capability of Palestinians to hold elections.
If the Palestinians did not hold elections Israel would merely transfer
limited autonomy or 'early empowerment' in areas such as health and
education.
'It is in our interest to enlarge autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza ..but
the elections are a Palestinian decision,' he said.
However, Mr Beilin, normally a dove on the left wing of the Labour party,
ruled out the possibility of evacuating Jewish settlements in Gaza and the
West Bank before Israel and the PLO agree a final and permanent status for
Palestinian aspirations by 1998. He said the issue of evacuating the 120,000
settlers was a 'time-bomb' which should not be faced until permanent
solution talks.
'Undoubtedly most of the settlements were built to prevent agreement on the
permanent solution and we will have to face this issue over the next five
years ...but I see evacuation of such a big number of Israelis as a big
mistake which may prevent implementation of the permanent solution or make
it much more difficult.' 'Evacuating settlements now,' Mr Beilin said,
'would be the biggest boomerang to the peace process.'

FT  09 MAY 94 / No welcome for observers in Hebron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HEBRON, OCCUPIED WEST BANK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After little more than an hour into their peace mission to the West Bank
town of Hebron, 117 international observers, dressed in bright white
uniforms, floppy caps and pinafores, got an immediate taste of the problems
that lie ahead in this flashpoint of Arab-Jewish violence.
The observers, from Italy, Denmark and Norway, sheltered from Palestinian
stone - throwers and Israeli soldiers firing teargas.
They are on a three-month mission in an effort to reduce tensions between
the Palestinians and armed Jewish settlers in the wake of the mosque
massacre on February 25 of 29 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish fanatic.
The observers were caught in the middle of an explosion of violence as angry
Palestinian youths shouting 'settlers out' stoned Israeli buses and soldiers
responded firing tear-gas in the main street.
The observers looked on helplessly, wiping their eyes from the stinging gas.
All the observers are unarmed and under the protection of the Israeli
forces.
Palestinians laughed and jeered as the observers scuttled for shelter and
turned their cars around from trouble spots. Some shopkeepers offered them
broken onions to ease the effects of the teargas which wafted through the
air.
'This is an unexpected welcome but we are prepared for our mission,' said
one Italian observer.
Unwelcome by Israel, which reluctantly agreed to the deployment, the
observers also seem to have little goodwill from Palestinians. Many Arab
residents in Hebron, which has been in a state of tension and under curfew
since the massacre, said they did not expect the observers to bring much of
a change in their lives.
'This is not a solution to our problems,' said Mr Abdel Kareem Yaghour. 'We
don't want international people to interfere with our lives. Thousands of
Moslems are being killed in Bosnia, Somalia and the rest of the world and
international people do nothing. Look, these men don't even have guns. What
will they do against the settlers and the army?'
Calming hatred between the 110,000 Arabs who live in Hebron and the 5,000
Jewish settlers will not be easy.
Most settlers live in nearby Kiryat Arba but 450 live in the heart of the
biblical town which is sacred to both Moslem and Jew.

President Bill Clinton said yesterday the US would stop sending fleeing
Haitians home without an asylum hearing, reversing a policy that some
critics had condemned as racist, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Clinton said he had ordered the change, to become effective shortly,
because of what he called stepped-up repression of the Haitian people by
Haiti's military rulers.
'The Haitian people will see we are not opening the floodgates to
indiscriminate refugee migration into the US but that we are going to try to
find those people who have left because they have a genuine fear,' he said.
'I hope that we will not have a flood of refugees but we are increasing our
naval resources to deal with that.'
Mr Clinton said the criteria for considering claims for political asylum
would remain unchanged. 'We will determine aboard ship or in other countries
which ones are bona fide political refugees,' he said in a briefing for
reporters at the White House Rose Garden.
Previously, the US had granted asylum hearings only to those who applied at
processing centres in Haiti, intercepting boats at sea and sending back
others without a hearing on their asylum claim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's President-designate Nelson Mandela, whose African National
Congress will be formally installed as majority party at the opening of the
new national assembly this morning, stressed over the weekend what is likely
to become the dominant theme of his presidency, calling for reconciliation
between races.
Outgoing President FW de Klerk continued to juggle with his selection of
candidates for the six cabinet posts allocated his defeated National party,
at the same time pursuing efforts to secure one of the security portfolios,
both of which have been claimed by the ANC.
Speaking to a cheering crowd at a Christian thanksgiving service led by
Archbishop Desmond Tutu at a stadium outside Johannesburg yesterday, Mr
Mandela stressed the need for everyone to carry through the peaceful spirit
of the election period.

<DATELINE>
   PANAMA CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Perez Balladares, the presidential candidate for the Panamanian
party driven out of power during the 1989 US invasion, appeared to take the
lead last night after the country's first fully free election in nearly
three decades, Reuter reports from Panama City.
According to unofficial figures - exit polls released by Panama's television
station TVN - Mr Perez Balladares, the opposition candidate for the
Democratic Revolutionary Party, had 39.5 per cent of the vote. The exit
polls put Mr Ruben Blades, the Caribbean salsa music star, in second place
with 23.6 per cent.
Earlier thousands of Panama's 1.5m voters lined up, some for more than an
hour, at 1,900 polling stations across the country, most of which did not
open on time.
Mr Perez Balladares had gone into the final stretch of the campaign with a
4-9 percentage point lead over Mr Blades. This marked a revival of the PRD,
which was founded in the 1970s by General Omar Torrijos but which fell into
disrepute under the rule of military strongman Manuel Noriega.
Mr Blades, who appeared in Robert Redford's film The Milagro Beanfield War,
wooed voters with lively music and the prospect of a clean break from
Panama's traditional politics but his economic platform was less clearly
defined.
As violence has marred Panama's elections for much of its history, the
government took pains to ensure a peaceful voting process, banning sales of
alcohol nationwide from Saturday and mandating strict security at the
polling stations.
Some 8,000 police were posted near polling stations, while an international
team of observers headed by former US President Jimmy Carter was monitoring
the process.
Voters were also choosing a new 71-member National Assembly and 67
mayoralties.

South Africa is throwing a party tomorrow. All welcome.
A national holiday has been declared so everyone can celebrate. As many as
150,000 will crowd into the gardens of the Union Buildings in Pretoria,
bastion of white rule for more than eight decades, to be present at the
inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president.
Inside, the guest list of 5,000 dignitaries ranges from Afghanistan, still
involved in its own civil war, to Zimbabwe, in the form of President Robert
Mugabe, who shook off minority rule north of the Limpopo.
After hurried preparations by the hosts and probably security fears on the
part of those invited however, few western leaders have decided that their
journey is necessary. Europe will be represented by an assortment of royal
spouses and heirs, as well as by the European Union at Commissioner level
and the current Greek presidency, and by the occasional foreign minister,
such as Britain's Mr Douglas Hurd, who is due to accompany the Duke of
Edinburgh.
Foreign governments jets began lining up at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts
airport, target of a bomb attack immediately before polling late last month
in the country's first all-race elections. Far-right whites opposed to the
elections were suspected, but since voting began nearly two weeks ago,
political violence whether prepetrated by the white right or by rival black
groups, has all but evaporated.
Pretoria has been declared a no-fly zone for the duration of the ceremony
(yes, rump Yugoslavia will be there too) and much of the city centre will be
cordoned off to road traffic. But even with a much reduced threat of a
terror assault, logistical problems look daunting. Officials insist there
will be space for the 150,000 who have tickets, in the face of reports that
the capacity of the enclosure is barely half that.
Confidence in the ability of the bureaucracy to handle an exercise of this
kind has been shaken, however, by the ineptitude shown in organising the
elections themselves, results of which were delayed by a week.
Salmon trout salad and rack of veal will feed more than 1,000 of the top
dignitaries, and the long-exiled Miriam Makeba will sing for the masses
beyond. But in the weekend festival atmosphere, few are churlish enough to
raise the question of cost, put by one estimate at R22m (Pounds 4m). 'We
just don't know - the accounts will come in afterwards,' says one civil
servant involved in the preparations.
On financial matters, the incoming government encountered its first public
relations setback when it was disclosed that Mr Mandela, who has been
calling for cuts in political salaries, will receive R575,000 a year before
allowances. This is well above the rate for most western heads of state and
considerably more than the salary of R266,000 enjoyed by outgoing President
FW de Klerk. Mr Mandela's income was fixed by a committee set up by the old
white-dominated government.
Tomorrow, though, is a day for counting heads rather than rands and cents.
From the EU, according to a list of acceptances obtained by the Financial
Times last night, only Denmark is planning to send its prime minister, along
with the presidents of the Irish Republic and Portugal.
In place of US President Bill Clinton will come Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore. Canada plans to send a deputy premier and from
Australia will come Mr Malcolm Fraser, the prime minister before last. Japan
is sending its defence minister, a choice it shares with Albania.
It was unclear whether Cuban President Fidel Castro, whose troops suffered
heavy losses fighting South African-backed forces in Angola, would show up
in person.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Multinationals seek investment treaty: EU and US companies
concerned about threats to national treatment principle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European and American multinational companies, concerned about
discriminatory investment policies on both sides of the Atlantic, have
launched a push for either a US-EU investment treaty or a wider investment
pact among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
'While the rules governing trade have advanced, most recently in the Uruguay
Round, the rules on investment have not kept pace,' said Mr Willard Berry,
president of the European-American Chamber of Commerce, which is leading the
campaign for a new international agreement. 'Practices are emerging
everywhere that denigrate the national treatment principle.'
The principle of national treatment, enshrined in numerous treaties,
guarantees that governments treat foreign-owned companies no less favourably
than domestic companies. However, the rise of domestic competitiveness
concerns during the last decade has spurred the emergence of 'conditional
national investment' rules.
The solution for Mr Berry and the 80 European and US multinational companies
which belong to the chamber is an international pact which would re-commit
governments to the national treatment standard. In exploratory conversations
with officials in the US and Europe, the proposal has been received
'warmly', Mr Berry said.
The chamber's plan is to develop a draft 'white paper' setting forth 'issues
of concern and possible solutions' by the end of this month for distribution
to US trade associations and European employers associations. A final paper
could be completed by June 30, with the goal of preparing the way for some
mention of a new investment pact at the meeting of the Group of Seven
industrial country leaders in July.
'On both sides of the Atlantic there is a new focus on greater
business-government co-operation to improve industrial competitiveness,'
said Mr Berry. 'In this new environment unconditional national treatment for
foreign-controlled firms can no longer be taken for granted.'
In the US, national treatment has been the unacknowledged focus of a debate
which had split the administration and Congress. At issue was whether
companies born and headquartered in the US ought to be given government
support unavailable to foreign-born companies although the latter may employ
thousands of US workers. For an administration which has started to hand out
hundreds of millions of dollars in matching grants for research and
development, the issue of eligibility is crucial.
According to Mr Berry, the administration has developed informal export
advocacy guidelines which give preference to US-based companies. Congress
has conditioned national treatment for in R&amp;D programmes, liberalised
antitrust treatment, regulatory relief, and participation in special
government programmes such as the clean car initiative.
Foreign-based companies can be shut out from these programmes unless their
governments extend reciprocal treatment for US companies, protect their
intellectual property and open their standard-setting processes. The
Swiss/Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, for example, has yet to be accepted by the
Energy Department for participation in a project to develop the next
generation of turbines.
In Europe, the newly strengthened parliament has emerged as an advocate for
reciprocity and domestic preferences. The controversy over Germany's refusal
to apply discriminatory provisions of the EU Utilities Directive - and the
extent to which it is prepared to challenge that refusal in the European
Court of Justice - has come to symbolise the threat to US companies.
If the court upholds the EU claim that the Treaty of Rome takes precedence
over the US-German friendship, commerce and navigation treaties, than no
national treatment commitments will be available to transatlantic business,
says the chamber.

FT  09 MAY 94 / War wounds still not healed in Tokyo: Nagano is only the
latest to say Japan was really the victim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 50 years after the end of the second world war, Japan has yet to find
a stable consensus on whether it came through that conflict as aggressor or
victim.
Just how far Japan's fragmented political establishment remains from coming
to terms with the country's wartime record has been vividly illustrated by
the events leading up to the resignation on Saturday of Mr Shigeto Nagano as
justice minister, a mere 10 days after taking office.
Mr Nagano was asked to resign by an angry prime minister Tsutomu Hata after
claiming in an interview with the Mainichi Shimbun that one of the worst
atrocities of the Pacific war, the massacre of more than 150,000 people in
the former Chinese capital of Nanking in 1937, never happened. He also
claimed that it was not a war of aggression.
Mr Nagano's claim - withdrawn later - angered China, South Korea and other
important Asian neighbours at a time when one of the prime objectives of
Japanese foreign policy is to make friends with them. It also contradicted
successive governments' officially apologetic line over the war, pushed
harder than ever by the former Hosokawa administration and supported by the
new Hata government.
So it looked, from the moment Mr Nagano's words were published, that he had
condemned himself to have one of the shortest Japanese ministerial careers
on record. He could not have been more out of line with the thinking of the
new reform-minded political establishment.
Mr Hata, who yesterday admitted partial responsibility as the one who
appointed Mr Nagano, has been weakened by running into this colossal blunder
in only the first week of his government.
He opened himself to charges of equivocation by saying, soon after hearing
of Mr Nagano's statement, that he still wanted to work with the justice
minister and described him as a man of balance. He was in Brussels at the
time which may account for his caution over events many thousands of miles
away.
Yet the Japanese press is not so forgiving. The affair was reminiscent of
the pre-Hosokawa tradition of vague apologies for the war, later devalued by
equivocation.
The two biggest-circulation daily newspapers, the Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri
Shimbun, yesterday criticised Mr Hata's slowness to axe the errant minister.
The Asahi seized on the wider repercussions, pointing out that Japan should
shelve its campaign for permanent membership of the United Nations security
council until it has first won its neighbours' full trust.
The Nagano affair shocked many people in Japan. But the signs are that his
remarks were no mistake; indeed they may have come from the heart.
As a conservative former army chief of staff, the 71-year-old Mr Nagano's
views were almost as well known as those of Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a member
of the right wing of the opposition Liberal Democratic party who colourfully
complained last year that Mr Hosokawa had gone too far in his war apologies.
So the Mainichi probably knew what it was doing when it invited Mr Nagano to
produce his standard line on Nanking.
Neither was he the first cabinet minister to prompt his own resignation with
such a remark. Two others in the past eight years have gone the same way.
Mr Seisuke Okuno resigned in 1988 as head of the National Land Agency after
arguing that Japan fought the war to secure its own safety. He refused to
apologise. Before him, Mr Masayuki Fujio was almost instantly fired as
education minister in 1986 after saying Japan's 1910 invasion of Korea was
justified.
Mr Nagano created more of a domestic fuss than did Mr Okuno and Mr Fujio,
indicating that Japanese public opinion feels more war responsibility now
than it did then.
Yet the affair is a reminder that many Japanese still feel their country was
a victim of the war, where the national record focuses on the US
fire-bombing of Tokyo and the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Visitors to Hiroshima, for example, report that the local war museum carries
almost no commentary on what caused the atom bomb to be dropped.
School history books remain vague on some crucial details of the war,
despite a series of highly publicised court cases against official
censorship.
Japan's international ambitions will force its public to face this rift in
the national consensus, between the reform-minded establishment and the
arch-conservatives of the older generation. War history will be a persistent
theme in public life as Japan's economic relations with its Asian neighbours
grow closer and as the government lines itself up for the UN security
council in the next few years.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Japanese minister quits over atrocity claim

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's controversial justice minister, Mr Shigeto Nagano, resigned over the
weekend, just 10 days after taking office, after denying that an infamous
wartime atrocity happened.
He was replaced by Mr Hiroshi Nakai, a centre-right member of the lower
house, who immediately tried to calm the row by saying that it was
'undeniable' that the Japanese army 'committed cruel acts' in the war.
Mr Nagano had earlier retracted his remarks, in which he said that Japan's
invasions of China - now its second largest trade partner - and other Asian
neighbours were not acts of aggression. However, the retraction only partly
appeased the anger of South Korea and was dismissed as inadequate by Japan's
opposition parties, which plan to exploit the blunder to the full.
Mr Nagano offered his resignation after meeting the prime minister, Mr
Tsutomu Hata, on Saturday.
Mr Nakai is a member of the Democratic Socialist party, a minor partner in
the five-party government coalition. Mr Hata chose him to avert opposition
criticism that the alliance was dominated by the right-wing Japan Renewal
party, which now has seven out of 21 cabinet seats. Mr Hata heads the JRP
and Mr Nagano is a member.
South Korea welcomed Mr Hata's decision. 'It is difficult for both the
victim and the perpetrator to overcome the past,' said a South Korean
foreign ministry official. Mr Hata's decision showed courage, he said.
However, Mr Hata's domestic opponents plan to pursue him after he faces
parliament to make his first policy speech tomorrow, when his comments on
Japan's wartime responsibility will be closely followed.
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, the biggest
opposition group, said Mr Hata bore 'great responsibility' for having
appointed Mr Nagano. The affair had jeopardised the efforts made by former
LDP governments to improve ties with Asian neighbours, said Mr Yoshiro Mori,
its secretary general.

The first of Panama's 1.5m voters cast their ballots yesterday in this
country's first fully free election in nearly three decades, Reuter reports
from Panama City.
Thousands of Panamanians lined up, some of them for more than an hour, at
1,900 polling stations across the country, most of which did not open on
time. (1200 GMT).
'We are confident that at the end of this day, we will come out on top,'
presidential frontrunner Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic
Revolutionary party (PRD) told reporters.
The most recent polls show Mr Perez Balladares, whose party was driven from
power after the 1989 US invasion, went into the final stretch with a 4-9
percentage point lead over Caribbean salsa music star Ruben Blades.
Mr Perez Balladares's lead heading into the elections marks a revival of the
PRD, which was founded in the 1970s by General Omar Torrijos but which fell
into disrepute under the rule of military strongman Manuel Noriega.
Mr Blades, who appeared in Robert Redford's movie The Milagro Beanfield War,
wooed voters with lively music and the prospect of a clean break from
Panama's traditional politics but his economic platform is less clearly
defined.
As violence has marred Panama's elections for much of its history, the
government took pains to ensure a peaceful voting process, banning sales of
alcohol nationwide from Saturday and mandating strict security at the
polling stations.
Some 8,000 police were posted near polling stations, while an international
team of observers headed by former US President Jimmy Carter was monitoring
the process.
Voters will also choose a new 71-member National Assembly and 67 mayoralties
in what appear to be the country's freest elections since the late 1960s.

The European Union backs plans by Gulf Arab states gradually to unify
tariffs, paving the way for a free-trade accord, the Greek foreign minister,
Mr Karolos Papoulias, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Riyadh.
'These positive developments undoubtedly lay the basis for significant
progress towards the completion of our co-operation framework. . . the aim
being to conclude a free-trade agreement,' Mr Papoulias said at the opening
session of talks in Riyadh between the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council
(GCC) and the EU. Greece holds the EU rotating presidency.
The GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Bahrain and Qatar, agreed last month to unify tariffs for one group of
products at a time as a move towards an overall free-trade accord.
Mr Papoulias also urged the oil-rich states to support environmental
protection - apparently a reference to a European plan for new energy taxes
to reduce fuel usage.
'The European Union and other industrialised countries have undertaken
commitments concerning the protection of the environment. On the other hand,
our partners in the GCC have not,' Mr Papoulias said. 'We consider this
vacuum could be filled through continuous, sincere and constructive
dialogue.'
GCC states have so far objected to proposed EU energy taxes as
discriminating against oil exporters and of dubious value in limiting damage
to the environment.
The economic and political talks were attended by GCC ministers and
officials from 12 EC countries, including six government ministers.

cabinet posts continues

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign leaders began arriving in South Africa yesterday for the
inauguration of President Nelson Mandela tomorrow in a ceremony due to be
televised live to millions around the world.
Mr Mandela, whose African National Congress will be formally installed as
majority party at the opening of the new national assembly this morning,
stressed over the weekend what is likely to become the dominant theme of his
presidency, calling for reconciliation between all races.
Meanwhile, outgoing President FW de Klerk continued to juggle with his
selection of candidates for the six cabinet posts allocated his defeated
National party, at the same time pursuing efforts to secure one of the
security portfolios, both of which have been claimed by the ANC.
The new government also encountered its first public relations setback when
it was disclosed that Mr Mandela, who has been calling for cuts in political
salaries, will receive R575,000 (Pounds 107,000) a year before allowances,
well above the rate for most western heads of state and considerably more
than Mr de Klerk's current salary of R266,000. The figure was fixed by a
committee established by the outgoing government.
After the parliamentary session, Mr Mandela will travel to Pretoria tonight
and will be formally sworn in as president tomorrow morning.
More than 180 world leaders, including more than 40 heads of state, are
arriving in the country for the inauguration and the overworked organising
committee is frantically trying to ensure adequate security precautions and
sort out last-minute logistical problems for the ceremony, which will be
attended by more than 150,000 people. Confidence in South Africa's ability
to handle an exercise of this kind has been shaken by the ineptitude shown
in the organising of the elections themselves.
Speaking to a cheering crowd at a Christian thanksgiving service led by
Archbishop Desmond Tutu at a stadium outside Johannesburg yesterday, Mr
Mandela stressed the need for everyone to carry through the peaceful spirit
of the election period.
'It is time for all South Africans to remember they are one people,' he
said.
Yesterday's rally was the culmination to a weekend in which Mr Mandela
addressed all the country's main religious groupings, attending a synagogue
and mosque in Cape Town on Saturday.
Although the ANC announced its list of cabinet ministers on Friday,
continuing the pragmatic approach displayed by all political leaders during
the election process, Mr Mandela suggested over the weekend that some
reshuffling might still occur. The National party is known to be
particularly unhappy that both the defence and law and order ministries have
been allocated to ANC officials.
Under the new constitution all parties receiving more than 5 per cent of the
national vote are entitled to representation in the cabinet.
The government will comprise 18 cabinet ministers from the ANC, six from the
National party and three from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
party.
Neither the NP nor Inkatha has yet announced its cabinet choices, but the
incumbent finance minister, Mr Derek Keys, will keep his job, a move
intended to reassure both the international community and the local business
sector that no radical economic policies are intended. It is not yet known
what portfolios will be offered to Chief Buthelezi, nor whether he himself
will accept a post.
The new parliament will sit for five years during which it will serve as
legislative assembly and, in conjunction with the senate, draw up a final
constitution.
Membership of the senate, which will have 90 members, 10 from each region,
has not yet been finalised. It is expected to meet for the first time later
in the week.
Meanwhile, eight of the country's nine new regional parliaments were sworn
in over the weekend and the new provincial premiers elected. The ANC assumed
control of seven of the legislatures while the National party, led by the
outgoing minister of law and order Mr Hernus Kriel, was installed at the
head of the Western Cape.
Because of the slow pace of vote counting in the province, the parliament of
KwaZulu/Natal, where Inkatha will have a wafer-thin majority, will only be
sworn in on Wednesday.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Banks to dispense adverts with cash in the high street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two high street banks are poised to cash in on their cash dispensers by
selling advertising space and issuing discount vouchers.
Instead of a vacantly blinking 'Welcome, please insert your card' sign,
customers will be met with an advertisement, whether for a local shop or a
national product. Money-off coupons will be dispensed with the cash. It is
likely that banks will combat criticism about potential litter by allowing
customers to opt not to receive the vouchers.
Two high street banks in the UK are planning to test the scheme later this
year at about 150 cash dispensers, according to Aimmedia International, the
Kingston upon Thames, Surrey-based company which has developed the system.
If the three-month trials are successful, the company hopes to market the
system to other UK banks which together have more than 18,000 dispensers.
Advertisers will pay an average of Pounds 110 a week for the exclusive use
of a cash machine, which will issue a maximum of 2,000 vouchers during the
week.
It will be possible to target particular cash machines to maximise the
effect of the advertising; for example, a dispenser near a large music shop
might issue vouchers for compact discs and audio tapes.
On the reverse side of the vouchers, banks will print their own, possibly
linked, advertising. A voucher redeemable against a holiday, say, could also
advertise travellers' cheques; a car test-drive offer might also promote the
bank's car loans.
In the US, the National Bank of Commerce, Tennessee, is testing out the
idea, and Aimmedia plans to approach banks in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France
and Scandinavia. Building societies could also be attracted to the scheme,
the company believes.
Mr Steve Ross, Aimmedia's managing director, said the advertising offered
banks the chance to make money out of their costly dispensers. Manufacturers
and retailers would be able to target consumers in the high street. 'A
computerised geographical information system will allow the advertiser to
specify the machines their vouchers are dispensed from,' he said.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Socialists ahead in Hungarian elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former communists continued their comeback in eastern Europe yesterday,
taking a commanding lead in the first round of Hungary's parliamentary
elections.
With nearly all the votes counted, the Hungarian Socialist party (MSZP) had
33 per cent. This was three times its tally in 1990 when the electorate
delivered its verdict on four decades of communist dictatorship.
The left relegated the ruling right-wing Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) to
a humiliating third place with just 12 per cent of the vote, as Hungarians
punished the government for the one-fifth decline in GDP since the collapse
of communism.
But the third force in Hungarian politics, the liberal Alliance of Free
Democrats (SZDSZ), benefited from a surprising last-minute surge and took 20
per cent of the vote.
The Hungarian elections establish as a firm trend the resurgence of former
communists on a tide of public disillusionment with the pain of economic
transition. Socialists are back in power in Poland and Lithuania, and only
in the Czech Republic have the ruling conservatives maintained their
popularity.
Foreign investors and the stock market reacted calmly, expecting Socialist
technocrats to continue or even accelerate economic reform. The party's
domestic opponents warn, however, that the Socialists will also come under
pressure to meet their supporters' expectations of an immediate improvement
in living standards and employment.
'Maybe we have reason to be happy, but we should not be too confident
because it will be difficult to govern,' said Mr Laszlo Bekesi, a former
Socialist finance minister likely to hold the same portfolio in the new
government.
The liberal revival may be sufficient to force the Socialists to look for
partners to form a government. The Free Democrats, their preferred allies,
say they would insist that a coalition follow the liberals' tough economic
programme.
Surprisingly, Socialist technocrats admit they would welcome the opportunity
to share responsibility for painful economic measures. As in Poland, the
Hungarian ex-communists may offer the premiership to the leader of their
coalition partner, the Free Democrats' Mr Gabor Kuncze.
The composition of parliament, in which six parties are expected to win
seats, will only be decided after the second round of voting on May 29.
Extrapolating from yesterday's trends, the Socialists would emerge with more
than 200 of the 386 seats in parliament. About 60 seats would go to the Free
Democrats and the MDF would get 30. But the liberals believe it has narrowed
to a two-party race and suggest that fear of an ex-communist landslide will
draw voters to them, denying the Socialists an outright majority.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Halifax plans drive to increase lending share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax, the largest building society in the UK, hopes to take a
'significantly bigger share' of mortgage lending as part of an ambitious
expansion put forward by Mr Mike Blackburn, its chief executive.
The new strategy, which includes diversifying into new forms of lending and
expanding existing operations such as estate agency, is a further sign of
growing competition in retail financial services. Following Lloyds' Pounds
1.8bn bid to take over Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society last month,
several banks have said they would like to buy societies.
In a document sent to its 24,000 staff, Mr Blackburn says a large proportion
of its 1.8m mortgage borrowers currently buy nothing else from Halifax,
'which is not the case with our closest competitors'. Although the document
says Halifax has 'an excessive dependence on mortgage income', it also
argues that it should expand its 19 per cent share of the mortgage market by
organic growth, and by buying mortgage books from others.
Mr Blackburn, who was recruited from Leeds Permanent last year, has set a
new 'mission' for it to be 'the biggest and best personal finance business
in the UK'. It already has the largest share of mortgages, and personal
savings.
He said that Halifax, which has assets of Pounds 67bn and is about twice the
size of Nationwide, the second-largest society, had not expanded other
services enough.
The strategy includes:
Achieving 'stronger growth' of current account and personal lending
business. The society also wants to expand its share of 'risk investments'
based on the performance of shares, such as unit trusts and personal equity
plans.
Having the highest credit ratings of any of its peers. Mr Blackburn said the
society should raise its current Aa1 long-term debt rating to the highest
Aaa.
Halifax also wants to diversify its funding base by issuing debt in a
variety of international capital markets. The society is among those
pressing for limits on wholesale funding to be raised by the government.
Diversifying into new lending markets. An example cited by Mr Blackburn is
private rental accommodation, which he said would be profitable 'with the
right kind of tax breaks from the government for landlords'. Expanding
Halifax's network of 530 estate agencies, possibly in Scotland and the south
west. Mr Blackburn said that despite losses, it had potential.
He said Halifax had no plans to convert to a public company because it
believed it could achieve its ambitions under its current mutual ownership.

FT  09 MAY 94 / Russia in deep crisis as output plunges by 25%: Capital
investment down 28% - Tax revenues hit / Debts spiralling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A deep deterioration in the Russian economy over the past six months, with
steep falls in production, investment and tax revenues, risks creating a
'social explosion', the Ministry of the Economy has warned the government.
In the past few days the ministry has released a string of data for the
first quarter of the year, which suggest the economy is in the midst of a
deep crisis. A 25 per cent fall in industrial production in the first three
months of this year compared with 1993 is threatening hundreds of thousands
of workers who are being laid off with little or no pay.
The prestigious Zil industrial complex in Moscow, which employs 85,000
workers making white goods and trucks, has put thousands on extended holiday
and plans to halve truck production to 50,000 this year. Mr Yevgeny Brakov,
the Zil general director, said the company was in a 'very difficult
position'.
According to the official Russian Information Agency account of the data,
the ministry warned that a drop in output of consumer goods 'threatens the
economic independence of the country and brings the danger of a social
explosion'.
The warning of the looming crisis was rammed home on Friday by Mr Oleg
Soskoevets, first deputy prime minister in day to day charge of the economy.
He told the official Tass news agency: 'Russia is living through the
toughest phase of its transition.'
Moscow is facing a critical choice. It could increase credits to help out
the ailing state sector, but that would compromise its fight against
inflation, which has come down to between 8 and 9 per cent a month from a
high last year of nearly 30 per cent. That reduction has been crucial in
gaining access to International Monetary Fund finance.
However, Russian economists warn that if it retains its tight monetary
stance, it could within months trigger a rise in unemployment to between 10m
and 15m which would threaten Russia's fragile social stability.
In an effort to alert his compatriots to the looming economic threat, Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, wrote in the weekly magazine
'Rossiya' that it was 'vitally necessary' to stop unwanted production -
citing tanks as one such sector.
The indicators of Russia's deepening crisis include:
The 25 per cent fall in industrial production in the first quarter of the
year appears to be accelerating, according to preliminary figures for April.
Production of sugar, shoes, fabric and clothes has fallen by between one
third and one half. Car, bus and truck production is relatively better,
standing at 85 per cent of last year's level. However, at some leading car
plants such as the the AZLK (Moskvich) factory in Moscow output is down by
between one and two thirds because municipal authorities have no money to
renew their fleets.
Investment in capital projects, including state investment in
infrastructure, in the first quarter shrunk to Rbs12 trillion (about Pounds
4.7bn) 28 per cent down on 1993. The economics ministry report says work on
most state and regional authorities' investment projects has stopped.
Foreign investment remains 'weak', with only Dollars 180m being invested in
the entire Russian economy in the first quarter.
Tax revenues are falling fast. Government figures show tax collection short
by Rbs3.4 trillion - or 15 per cent below budget - in the first quarter.
Regional authorites are increasingly reluctant to pass collected taxes on to
the central government, according to officials in Moscow. Debts held by
enterprises are spiralling as customers, other enterprises further up the
supply production chain, become increasingly unable to pay for supplies.
Many plants will refuse orders unless they are paid upfront in cash. The
economics ministry's figures show overall corporate debt has risen threefold
in the last six months, to stand at at about Rbs69 trillion. Public support
for continued reform is collapsing, according to a poll last week by the
Russian Academy of Sciences. It found support among Russians for reforms has
shrunk from above 40 per cent five years ago to less than 25 per cent at the
end of last year. The majority of those polled agreed that 'privatisation is
legalised theft' and between one-third and two-thirds of respondents
believed that privatisation was 'undertaken for the benefit of the
nomenclatura and criminals'.
Enterprises in the coal and oil region of Vorkuta in the north have
petitioned for the area to be designated one of 'special poverty', and
strikes are threatened for next month over wages unpaid since January.

FT  09 MAY 94 / PM under pressure to promise referendum on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major faces growing pressure to promise a referendum on the next
step of European integration in an attempt to unite the Conservative party
and bolster his faltering leadership.
Leading figures on both sides of the party believe a pledge to hold a
referendum on issues such as a single European currency may be the only way
to bridge divisions among Tory MPs.
Mr Major is understood to believe that promising a referendum now on
unspecified changes in the European Union which may be proposed after the EU
intergovernmental conference in 1996 is fraught with difficulties. But he
has not ruled it out if the crisis deepens.
However, reports that the Liberal Democrats may back demands for a
referendum on proposals for a closer union also increase pressure on the
prime minister.
There were clear signs of division within the cabinet over such a
referendum. Two ministers with anti-European credentials did not rule out
the prospect, but Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, came out heavily
against it.
Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, said that in the run up to the
European elections he did not want to talk about the changes to European
institutions that will be considered in 1996.
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary, also said the government should decide
whether to hold a referendum after proposals for a single currency are
finalised.
But Mr Clarke, a committed pro-European, said the idea could only confuse
voters. He told BBC Radio's The World This Weekend: 'The difficulty, as
other countries found during the Maastricht debate, is that when you have a
referendum, people do not answer the question in front of them.'
Mr Clarke's views contrast with some pro-European backbenchers who believe a
promise to hold such a referendum is the only way to heal the division over
Europe.
Some MPs also believe that Mr Michael Heseltine, the Trade Secretary, could
promise a referendum as a way of uniting MPs around his candidacy if there
were a Tory leadership contest this autumn.
Speculation over a referendum pledge coincided with renewed Tory criticism
of the way ministers had conducted themselves in last week's local
elections.
Mr David Mellor, the former Heritage Secretary, strongly attacked Mr Michael
Portillo, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and hinted that he should be
a victim in any cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Mellor said Mr Portillo 'need not have . . . made a mess' by creating
controversy over Europe in the last week of the campaign.

Tele-Communications, the largest US cable company, is making a small direct
investment in Australis Media, the stock market-listed Australian company
which holds one of the country's two publicly-available satellite
broadcasting licences and has pledged to introduce pay-TV services to
Australia later this year, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The US cable giant is also gaining boardroom representation at the fledgling
Australian company.
TCI is to acquire 6m convertible debentures at an issue price of ADollars
1.40 each, via its wholly-owned TCI-Australia subsidiary.
TCI already holds an indirect interest in Australis, via its interest in
Liberty Media, which is currently being merged into TCI. Liberty Media, in
turn, owns 49.5 per cent of Lenfest Communications, which owns 49.9 per cent
of Australis.
The net effect of the latest investment, plus the complex indirect holding,
is to give TCI a 26.5 per cent economic interest in Australis.

FT  07 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses resist the temptation
to overreact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
Bourses responded to the US jobs data, but resisted the temptation to
overreact, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was flat on the session, and volatile before and afterwards as it
awaited, then digested the US news. The Dax index rose 1.18 to 2,237.02 on
the session, a fraction lower on the week, after an early high of over
2,250; it fell to an Ibis-indicated 2,222.48 before closing the afternoon at
2,233.55.
According to Mr Nigel Longley, at Commerzbank, the afternoon recovery was
driven by short covering in bunds. However, Daimler dipped after hours, by
DM9.50 to DM882 in London, on news that it made a DM70 per share loss for
1993 according to the DVFA standard accounting formula.
Turnover fell from DM7.8bn to DM7.1bn. Mannesmann's loss and dividend cut
from DM6 to DM5 came too late to reverse the rise in the shares, up DM4.50
to DM465. Lufthansa recovered to DM210 after Thursday's profit-taking.
PARIS resisted a sharp correction following the US news and the CAC-40 index
closed only 4.40 lower at 2,158.22, barely changed over the week.
Interest was noted in the 'Euro stocks', with attention focused on the
official opening of the Channel tunnel and Euro Disney's results,
disappointing as expected. Eurotunnel slipped 90 centimes to FFr38.85, with
investors more concerned at present about the timing of a rights issue.
The theme park operator, off 75 centimes at FFr31.65, noted a 12 per cent
fall in first half turnover to March 1994 and said that the effect of its
restructuring programme would not come through until the second half of this
year.
UAP slipped FFr1.20 to FFr156 in line with the market: the government
announced a price of FFr155 per share for institutions and said that the
public offer had been 2.5 times subscribed.
MADRID was hit late in the day by the resignation of another prominent
socialist MP, Mr Baltasar Garzon, but still managed to close with the
general index 1.97 higher at 318.22, 2.2 per cent down on a painful week.
The gains were broadly based with banks strong, and some of the more
volatile construction stocks even stronger. But the US influenced Repsol
fell Pta45 to Pta34,455.
AMSTERDAM closed slightly ahead, although the market fell back from a
session high of 414.63 following the US data. The AEX index ended up 0.62 at
411.35, marginally lower on the week.
Royal Dutch and Unilever improved, respectively by Fl 2.80 and Fl 1.00 to Fl
203.50 and Fl 204.20, before first quarter results due out next week.
Hoare Govett expected a slight increase in Unilever's earnings per share;
but because of negative sentiment which has arisen following the so-called
'detergents war' with Procter &amp; Gamble in Europe, the broker maintained its
hold recommendation.
MILAN was heartened by signs that Mr Silvio Berlusconi was nearing agreement
with the Northern League on a government team, and the Comit index rose
26.90, or 3.5 per cent to 800.94, erasing declines suffered earlier in the
week.
Montedison advanced L54 to L1,572 while Edison, its subsidiary, was L376
higher at L9,119 after announcing improved 1993 results and plans for a
share conversion.
ZURICH caved in under pressure from US stock and bond markets and the SMI
index fell 40.8 to a year's low of 2,641.4, down 3.5 per cent on the week.
Banks remained out of favour. C S Holding bearers fell SFr15 to SFr584 after
Standard &amp; Poors, the credit rating agency, said that Credit Suisse's
acquisition of a stake in Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein could lead to a
deterioration of the bank's credit quality. UBS fell SFr24 to SFr1,078 and
SBC was SFr7 lower at SFr366.
Roche continued its decline, the certificates losing SFr75 to SFr6,450. The
shares have fallen by 9 per cent since it reported a 29 per cent rise in net
income on April 19.
ISTANBUL rushed to buy state-controlled companies after the Turkish
parliament passed a privatisation law, and lifted the composite index by
1,239.24, or 7.8 per cent to 17,139.92, up 13.5 per cent over five days
after an 18.3 per cent fall in the preceding week.
WARSAW fell after a brief rebound, the Wig index closing 537.1, or 4.7 per
cent lower at 10,852.3 as speculators unloaded shares.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo seeks to clarify options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five senior executives at the oil company, Lasmo, were granted options worth
Pounds 590,000 the day before the Takeover Panel told rival explorer,
Enterprise Oil, to clarify its bid intentions.
Lasmo said yesterday the options had been planned long before bid
speculation fuelled the recent sharp rise in the company's shares. The
options would normally have been granted immediately after the annual
results, on March 25, but had been delayed due to plans for the subsequent
Pounds 219m rights issue.
The executives were informed at the beginning of April that they would be
granted options at the closing price on April 25.
Some 401,991 options were granted to three board directors and two senior
executives at 147p. Of the directors, Mr Joe Darby, chief executive,
received 108,870; Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer, 61,530; and Mr
Richard Smernoff, finance director, 100,000. Mr C Dawson, personnel manager,
was granted 56,591 and Mr J Wedgwood, group secretary, received 75,000.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Scottish Tories in fourth place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, CHRIS TIGHE and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Conservatives were yesterday gloomily contemplating the fact that
Scottish politics seem to afford them almost infinite space to drop into,
after they finished in fourth place in the regional council elections in
terms of seats.
By contrast the Scottish National party, in second place, was celebrating
its best local election result, getting near the 30 per cent share of the
vote at which it could make big gains in a general election. The Liberal
Democrats in third place also claimed their greatest success. Labour, easily
the biggest party, was well content.
The Scottish Conservatives had not entered the regional elections with high
ambitions, controlling none of the nine regions, but they at least hoped to
hold on to the 52 seats they won in 1990. In the event, they lost about 20
seats. They performed especially badly in Lothian, a region they controlled
in the early 1980s, losing seven seats and ending with only five.
Their share of the vote dropped from 19 per cent to 14 per cent, exactly
mirroring a pre-election opinion poll. Yesterday Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, claimed that many Tory supporters had stayed at home and said the
party's Scottish performance was similar to that in England and Wales,
reflecting general discontent with the government.
The result is particularly painful because the party meets in Inverness next
week for its annual conference, which closes on Friday with a speech by Mr
John Major.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader, yesterday called his party the big winner of
the elections. It won a record 27 per cent of the vote, doubled its number
of seats to 73; came within one seat of taking control from Labour of
Tayside region; and became the second-biggest party in Grampian after the
Liberal Democrats.
The Liberal Democrats won 61 seats, a net gain of 20, gaining seats from all
the other parties and taking 11 per cent of the vote. Mr Jim Wallace, leader
of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the results were 'easily the best'
his party had had in Scotland.
Labour lost about five seats but still has more than all the other parties
combined. It took 42 per cent of the vote and its grip on Strathclyde,
Lothian, Fife and Central regions remains impregnable.
The outcome of the elections in northern England and the west Midlands,
though poor for the Tories, did not match the disaster in Scotland.
In Cumbria Labour wrested control from them of Barrow-in-Furness, and the
Liberal Democrats won enough seats in South Lakeland to make them the
biggest party on the council for the first time since its creation in 1974.
The west Midlands saw Conservative hopes thwarted in Birmingham, Dudley,
Solihull, Walsall, Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham and Stratford-on-Avon where they
either felt their grip loosened or failed to win. Only in Wolverhampton was
there a decisive move with Labour regaining control after a
Conservative-Liberal Democrat interregnum.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Postcode directory to go to businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bulky new directory is soon to join BT's phone books, Yellow Pages,
Thomson's directories and trade association year books on business
bookshelves.
Royal Mail, the letters division of the Post Office, plans to distribute
free postcode directories to 2m businesses in the UK.
Regional Postal Address Books will list the correct postal address and
postcode for business and residential addresses in each of 11 regions. The
directory will not include the names of householders, but will list business
names of offices, factories, shops and banks.
Its purpose is to improve the use of postcodes in business mailings to speed
up sorting and distribution. A quarter of all mail is currently incorrectly
addressed, with government departments and local authorities more likely
than average to omit the correct postcode.
The directories will be financed by advertising revenue and sales of other
regional volumes where required. They may eventually be distributed more
widely to homes, according to Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of Royal
Mail.
Distribution is due to begin in September and will be completed by March
next year.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Lawyer to probe union ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The CPSA civil servants' union is to appoint an independent lawyer to
investigate balloting irregularities that have forced a Pounds 100,000
repeat of its presidential election.
A re-run of the vote among the union's 131,000 members was ordered by the
High Court when Mr Alan England, a defence ministry branch official in
Harrogate, challenged his omission from the list of candidates in the
ballot.
Mr England discovered that his name had been obliterated with typewriter
correction fluid from presidential nomination forms.
The CPSA leadership said yesterday it was concerned about the circumstances
in which Mr England, who had been a member of the union for five months, had
earlier sought executive office in the NUCPS higher-grade civil servants'
union. Membership of more than one union is allowed under recent employment
legislation.
Both unions said Mr England had described himself in an NUCPS national
executive ballot as a member of a black racial group. The union's rules
allow for the election of black members with a much lower number of votes
than those for other candidates.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Merged chamber appoints chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A manufacturer specialising in cable communications was named yesterday as
the chief executive designate of the new North East Chamber of Commerce.
Merger of the Tyne and Wear, Teesside and Tynedale chambers has created one
of the five largest chambers in the UK.
Mr Bill Bates, selected for the Pounds 50,000-a-year post from more than 100
applicants, is managing director of Teesside-based Integral, the European
arm of the American-owned South Wire Company.
Mr Bates said yesterday he wanted the chamber to give north-east England's
business community an authoritative voice in speaking to local authorities,
central government and the European Union.
He identified as recurrent business problems red tape and form filling, late
payment and the cost of money.
The new Chamber, to be headquartered in Durham City, will come into
operation next January. Mr Bates will take up his new post by this July.

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 10,000 people attended a rally in Budapest yesterday as Hungary's
governing conservatives resorted to increasingly desperate measures to ward
off the widely predicted return to power of the former communists - now the
Hungarian Socialist party - in parliamentary elections tomorrow, Nicholas
Denton and Chrystia Freeland write from Budapest.
A leading conservative official warned of a far-right backlash if the
Socialists dominate the next government and, as the conservatives fear,
impose controls on the media.
'If the Socialists establish a monopoly, there would be a civil war,' Mr
Ferenc Kulin, leader of the parliamentary group of the governing Hungarian
Democratic Forum, said.
Yesterday evening also saw thousands of right-wingers praying at Budapest's
central cathedral for divine intervention.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market survived Conservative local election losses and put
up a strong defence in the face of a steep fall in US stocks and bonds,
which reacted to a much higher than expected increase in US employment. The
FT-SE 100 index began the session around five points higher and gradually
improved to stand more than 15 points ahead before the US figures were
announced, after which it dropped through the 3,100 level. It recovered
slowly to close unchanged at 3,106.0. London stocks, Page 15; Lex, Page 24;

Heavy ground fighting erupted throughout Yemen with air attacks against
several cities as the country entered its third day of an intensifying civil
war. Northern military leaders in Sanaa, the capital, said they aimed to
capture the southern port city of Aden and take control of the country. They
said the south fired a Scud missile at Sanaa which exploded close to the
presidential palace.
Fears about the conflict coincided with concerns about tight oil supplies to
push oil prices higher. North Sea Brent crude rose by 50 cents to Dollars
16.05 a barrel. Page 24; Background, Page 2

FT  07 MAY 94 / Hawks and Handsaws: For the chop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are on our way out, men. Our Dunkirk looms. Our irrelevance grows more
visible day by day. I am amazed at the speed of the distaff revolution: at
how quickly the seething mass of womankind has inveigled itself into
position for its attack on mankind.
First we had millions of years of progressive and sensible evolution, during
which we made our dispositions and thrashed out our gender roles. Then we
had feminism, which was initially quite cute, smacking, as it did, of
fairness and equality. Then - just like that - we were into post-feminism.
Do you remember that? It was over in a trice. Now men are facing their final
gory hour - the age of machisma.
Evidence? There is tons of it. My week started badly with a report, in The
Times, by Sally Jones, that well-known snoopy-drawers, on the horrible
success of English female sporting teams. 'Why can't our men be more like
our women?' was how the termagant Jones kicked-off her report, and on it
went from there.
Apparently, the English women's rugby team recently won the world
championship. Apparently, last summer, the English women's cricket team won
the World Cup. Apparently, the English women's football team has reached the
quarter-finals of the European championship without losing a game. All of
this, of course, in contrast to the various English men's teams, which are
not worth a toss.
I am too much the gent to describe the crop-haired, jetty-jawed,
quaking-thighed, punch-you-in-the-mouth monstrosities that play in women's
sports teams, especially England's.
But I confess I was driven to tears by the whingeing that the Jones creature
insinuated into her report, alongside the triumphalism. Apparently, sponsors
are uncommonly hard to find for women's sport. Apparently, it cost each
England female rugby player an estimated Pounds 6,000 to take part in the
world championship and the internationals that preceded it.
Not that this will last. The way things are going, female sports stars will
soon be awash in sponsorship money. The day of the first Pounds 1m lipstick
endorsement is not far away. Male sports stars, in contrast, will be
stripped of their contracts, denuded of their glamour, marginalised and
humiliated by the suddenly swelling horde of female sports writers: killers
all, I have met quite a few.
The second vicious experience of my unpleasant week was to be traumatised by
Maureen Freely's exploitative novel, Under the Vulcania, published by
Bloomsbury, whose name, as you know, is synonymous with shame. I can hardly
bring myself to explain what Vulcania is about; can hardly sit here at the
screen, typing these words, without falling into a froth. But I think I have
to try, if only to bolster my claim that the age of machisma has entered its
dawn-time.
Vulcania is a palace of pleasure, set on a sculpted hilltop, attended by
women - businesswomen, housewives - in order to recharge their batteries
with personal servicing by discreet and well-muscled male undergraduates.
I will not describe what goes on in the Rough Trader Saloon, the Hard-On
Cafe or the cubicles of the Roman Baths. Suffice it to say that Under the
Vulcania is scandalously voyeuristic, with no redeeming social or cultural
values. The men are playthings, without dignity or feelings, to be used -
and used again - and then cast away.
The week's third incident was the falling into my hands of yet another book:
Deadlier than the Male: Violence and Aggression in Women, by Alix Kirsta,
from HarperCollins. Whereas Vulcania is just pornography, Deadlier than the
Male is dynamite.
It is a study of female anger, violence, hate and criminality. It is the
first book, says the publisher, 'in which a woman dares to challenge the
most persistent and cherished images of her own sex. Drawing on recent
sensational criminal cases, diverse academic research and extensive personal
interviews with violent women, Alix Kirsta probes the blackest recesses of
the female psyche. The resulting revelations about women's aggressive
instincts (are) chilling and shocking . . . In demonstrating that women have
as great a capacity as men for destructiveness, she ensures that our view of
women can never be the same again.'
It is all quite clear, men. We are heading for the chop. Will we go quietly?
I maintain that we should.

FT  07 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Reality visits the race circuit
</HEADLINE>

Many may have shared my opinion of motor racing: a matter of getting the
best car available and putting your foot down. Noisy, dirty, tedious, you
have no idea who is winning. It is the one sport which is the opposite of
healthy exercise.
Indeed, it might even be disqualified as a sport if you accept the
definition laid down by an editor with whom I once worked: 'Do you have to
take your fag out of your mouth before you start?' If you can smoke while
doing it, then it isn't a sport - so motor racing ranks, or did, alongside
darts.
Yet, the tragedies of last weekend at Imola made me at least think again.
Motor racing is the only competitive sport in which those involved risk
their lives as a matter of course. The deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and
Ayrton Senna also demonstrated the role of the racing driver as a universal
modern icon. No other sport produces figures who attract the same
recognition, even awe, from a global public. The obituaries perpetuated the
myth of the driver-as-hero.
Reports and comment on the news also served to highlight contrasting
national attitudes. Not towards motor racing but to the meaning of life and
the significance of death as a spectacle.
In serious British newspapers, the events were a matter for the news and
obituary pages. But most main French dailies decided that the loss of Ayrton
Senna was worthy of the highest editorial consideration. The communist
Humanite drew an unsurprising Marxist conclusion: 'In spite of the
intervention of the drivers, the sporting authorities did not deign to
interrupt the spectacle when it was turning into a blood bath. Sponsors'
contracts prevail.'
For many, there was the problem of death-as-news. 'If, in itself, the death
of two drivers on a Formula One grand prix circuit is not more tragic than
the numerous daily victims counted in Bosnia, Rwanda or on our roads, the
death of Ayrton Senna arouses more than a passing emotion,' said La Nouvelle
Republique du Centre-Ouest.
It then went on to consider putting robots in cars, but concluded that no
robot could replace the man in the cockpit because 'once a fortnight, the
grand prix races bring to 1 1/2 bn viewers those heroes who bear their
highest aspirations.'
For France-Soir, the deaths provided yet another chance to contemplate the
nature of human folly. Investing billions to gain a few seconds was only one
facet of futility - less serious, perhaps, than the other news of massacres
and civil war. Nonetheless, it provided a more serious moral: 'In adoring
the Golden Calf - or, if you prefer, the Dollar Calf - men, tempting the
devil, finish by enraging the gods.'
Contrast this with Germany. One lone pontification, and that only from the
Magdeburg Volksstimme: 'There will be a world-wide outcry against excess
speed, first and rightly against unsafe circuits. In coming days, the chain
of unfortunate events will be held responsible for the battlefield of Imola,
but man himself is the cause.' This kind of thing might encourage even
Anglo-Saxons to see virtues in French intellectual pretension.
It was, however, the Italian sporting press which showed the greatest
qualities. The Sunday edition of La Gazzetta dello Sport ran a huge
headline: 'Tragedy at Imola,' and an editorial headed: 'No, it's not a video
game.' One must repeat: that was on the Sunday, the day after Ratzenberger's
death but before Senna's. Nobody else took much notice of Ratzenberger.
Good journalism means, among other things, spotting the story first and La
Gazzetta proved this in its editorial on Ratzenberger's crash: 'It had to
happen sooner or later. And not only because of the iron law of statistics.
For too long, Formula One has been considered a kind of video game where
cars travel at the greatest speed and only occasionally crash. The driver
walks from his box, enters another and entertains the public again. Death
becomes virtual reality.'
For its next issue, the headline proclaimed that Formula One had died with
Senna. Its commentary described this category of race as 'a sort of 'citadel
of madness' . . . .creating paragons of mystification from a better past,
and a present flying towards perdition.'
The Latin temperament communicates the symbolic significance of events which
stolid northerners find hard to reconcile with their fixed hierarchy of
values. The latter feel ashamed of agonising over the death of racing
drivers, so trivial in a world of mass tragedy. For Latins, though, all
tragedies are linked; Imola and Bosnia are part of the same reality. It is
all beyond me but, certainly, I now see motor racing in a different light.

I was never beaten as a pupil, in spite of being sent away as a prep-school
boarder at the age of seven. When I emerged from the private education
system, approximately 14 years later, my bottom was as serenely untouched as
it had been at the outset.
Some might say that my parents did not get what they paid for. But, unless I
am suffering from what psychologists call denial, I cannot recall any
occasion on which I was beaten at home, either. In other words, I am not
well qualified to enter into the great flogging debate.
This was started by the Singapore government's decision to give Michael Fay,
an 18-year-old US resident, six strokes of the cane. It was augmented, by
revelations in the UK, of the over-zealousness with which Anthony
Chenevix-Trench, a former headmaster of Eton, is said to have beaten his
pupils.
It appears that President Clinton's biggest foreign policy triumph to date -
persuading the Singapore authorities to reduce Michael Fay's sentence from
six strokes of the cane to four - has not been greeted enthusiastically in
the US.
Apparently half the population would rather like to see the same sort of
punishment carried out in America against vandals such as Michael Fay. It
seems to me absurd that a president, who as Governor of Arkansas gave the go
ahead to the judicial execution of a mentally impaired criminal, should
lecture another country on 'barbaric practices'.
In England too, there has been public approval of Michael Fay's caning.
Across the top of yesterday's Daily Mail newspaper there is a garishly
colourful picture of a cane, under the banner headline: 'IS THIS THE ANSWER
TO BRITAIN'S SOARING CRIME RATE?' Whether it would be or not, is,
unfortunately for the Daily Mail's characteristically vigorous campaign,
irrelevant.
The European Courts have already decreed that such corporal punishment is
not to be allowed in the European Union, as the legislators in the Isle of
Man discovered to their irritation. No doubt the restoration of violent
corporal punishment would give a lot of people enormous pleasure. The Daily
Mail was not the only newspaper which lingered long and lovingly over the
details of Micheal Fay's flogging. It was with a slight air of
disappointment that one newspaper revealed that the Singaporean authorities
allow the administering of a slight anaesthetic to the recipients of their
judicial canings. Which brings us to Anthony Chenevix-Trench.
He, it is alleged, derived sexual satisfaction from flogging naughty
Etonians, which, we are told, he carried out in a state of intoxication. In
The Spectator, the British political weekly magazine, Charles Moore, a pupil
at Eton during the end of Chenevix-Trench's headmastership, argues that the
old boy's excesses - which he never experienced at, um, first hand - should
not be criticised at all.
'Since imaginative gifts are vital for good teaching and since sexual desire
stimulates the imagination, it is not surprising that many great teachers
are driven, in part, by desire for their pupils,' argues Moore.
I do not know if Moore would continue to take such an unruffled attitude if
his own son were to experience the same bizarre form of affection when he
goes to Eton: but then the situation is hardly likely to arise. Eton has
abolished flogging. As Moore mournfully points out in his article: 'Schools
are freer than ever of such men (as Chenevix-Trench) and they are the poorer
for it.'
What we can say is that present day Singapore and the Eton of 25 years ago
have much in common: a very hierarchical system within a closed society,
self-confident about its own rigid values, whatever the outside world says.
Perhaps those in this country who miss that, should consider settling in
Singapore. I believe that it is still very much open to immigrants.
Otherwise, I continue to believe that those who enjoy the idea of a good
flogging should not be prevented from the innocent pleasure of pursuing
their perversion in the sanctity of their own home. All they have to do is
read the newspapers.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Private View: The enemy of the cultural classes - Capitalist
apostle, Michael Novak, believes that society is under attack and that
welfare harms the poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An odour of sanctimony clings to those who have seen the light. If the
pitiless puritanism of the ultra-left is ugly, there is a sickly smell, too,
about the certitude of the righteous right.
No doubt Michael Novak, a Catholic American theologian and political writer,
is sincere to the bottom of his boots. He stands for liberty, democracy and
morality. Much of what he says in praise of capitalism is probably correct.
He is not (at least in US terms) on the extreme right. Nor, I am sure, would
he endorse the claim of his professional publicist to be 'one of the world's
most original thinkers of the late 20th century'.
And yet . . .
Novak was this week presented in London with the Dollars 1m Templeton prize
for 'progress in religion', an obscure award designed by its founder, a
retired Wall Street investor, to overshadow the Nobel. Among the judges were
Baroness Thatcher and her former adviser Lord ('wealth is no sin')
Griffiths.
Novak is said to have been studied by the leaders of Solidarity in Poland,
Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, Margaret Thatcher and even - it is rumoured -
by the Pope. He is an habitue of the right-wing Institute of Economic
Affairs in Westminster, so it was there that I met him this week.
I found a plump 60-year-old, smiling faintly and speaking in a high-pitched,
somewhat effeminate voice. It was hard to imagine the robust youth he
described who, at 14, entered a Catholic seminary in order to protect his
priestly vocation from the temptations of football and girls.
Novak will not of course be spending his Pounds 650,000 prize money on fast
cars and finest claret. He wants to set up scholarships at his old college
in Massachusetts in memory of his parents and brother, a missionary murdered
in Dacca 30 years ago. He will replace the old van which his artist wife
uses to transport her paintings, educate their first grandchild and use the
rest to buy more writing time.
His priestly vocation fell before the final hurdle of ordination. In those
days an instinctive socialist - as he says most Catholic clergy are - he was
gradually forced to the conclusion not only that socialism had done nothing
to end poverty but that welfare was paralysing 'the able-bodied poor'.
He is not a laissez-faire libertarian. That, he said, was too narrowly
individualistic, too abstract. He accepts the label neo-conservative even
though it was used by his one-time hero, the Catholic socialist writer
Michael Harrington, to describe defectors. Novak says that where formerly he
was lionised, now he was 'excommunicated'.
Novak's thesis, advanced with a hint of heretic pride, is that the free
society is everywhere under attack. The century had taught us that democracy
was better than dictatorship and capitalism better than socialism. But
democratic capitalism would not survive without the 'habits of liberty', the
moral dimension.
When I suggested he was still fighting the cold war, Novak talked about the
enemy within.
'The heights of our culture, the journalists, the intellectuals, the
universities, the artists, those responsible for the ideals and symbols by
which we live are still predominantly to the left and anti-capitalist, with
a passion and vigour.'
Why are you so concerned, coming from the country least susceptible to
socialism?
'Well, we have a president whose ideal society is Germany - its health
system and so forth - and we have a large body of elite opinion moving in
that direction. So it's not a dead issue. It's really not.'
With the churches losing their grip, where is the morality you speak of to
come from?
The Christian ethic was still strong in the US, he said. 'But it's a real
problem for secular Europe. It isn't that when people stop believing in God
they believe nothing. They believe anything. It's a quip of Chesterton's.
The most remarkable passions are sweeping through our highly educated
classes. It's a sad thing that morality becomes the fashion of what you call
in Britain the chattering classes.
'Journalists are going to play the critical role because journalists are the
media through which everything goes, then academics, professionals and, God
willing, the churches.
'It can't be that all the blood that was shed for free institutions was shed
for Madonna (he meant the singing one) and Phil Donahue and the rest of
popular culture. There's got to be more than that. We've got to give more
serious thought, or we will perish in the 21st century.'
Apocalyptic stuff. But journalists as saviours of civilisation?
Novak continued: 'That's where the greatest moral threat comes from today -
our cultural classes.' Television and cinema had huge power over the souls
of people but no guidelines or responsibilities. They were led by instinct,
by what was popular.
I accused him of creating a straw man out of the remnants of socialism in
order to make his attack seem more robust.
'If you don't think political correctness can go to absurd lengths, come to
America for a while and you'll see the logic of uniformity pressed to its
utmost.'
But they're just a joke, I said.
'It isn't a joke.'
We discussed the defects of capitalism and I cited the dereliction of upper
Manhattan. Novak contrasted the entrepreneurship of the early immigrants
with the welfare dependency of today's ghetto-dwellers. The devastation, he
argued, was caused by welfare. Government intervention should be minimal,
and welfare restricted to the old, young, ill and crippled.
What about the poor of Brazil?
'I have been asked many times: What, sir, would you do if you had the power?
Well, after overcoming the feeling of power rushing to my fingertips, I
would do three things. The first would be to change the law to make it easy
for poor people to incorporate their own businesses, cheaply and easily -
say Dollars 30, through the mail in two weeks with no bribes and fees.'
Entitling them to sell matches on the street?
'No, to do several things, to do what they undertake as a legal matter.'
Like prostitution?
'That's a stupid question.' Novak was stung. 'That's a stupid question.'
A study in Peru, he continued, had shown that 90 per cent of public
transport and 60 per cent of housing was provided by illegales or informales
who could be locked up for it.
'Most poor are entrepreneurs. They are not peasants. They are fleeing the
land in tens of millions. They are not proletarians, they are buyers and
sellers and also very good little manufacturers.'
The other two necessary reforms, he said, were access to credit and
education.
In Britain he detected 'a larger sense of pride and belonging to a vital
nation' as a result of neo-conservative policies.
There's also been a large increase in the number of young people sleeping on
the street, I said.
'I am not an expert in the British situation. But if it is at all parallel
to ours that goes along with how hard it still is in Britain to incorporate
businesses. The greatest employer of youth is the small business. There's no
shortage of work to be done, of housing in need of painting and plastering
and so forth.'
Capitalism tempered by conscience, and the marketplace as the fusion of
individual interests for the common weal. But was he telling us anything
new?
'It's the fate of people who work in theology and philosophy, that whatever
you uncover, if you uncover it well, should be said by others to have been
there all the time.'
Yet your appeal seems to be to the past, I said: the Founding Fathers,
minimal government, low taxation, self-reliance, community, a charming,
pastoral picture of early America.
'But I think it's a quite combative picture in this part of the 20th
century, a battle well worth fighting. Thomas Jefferson said that every
generation has to recover the secrets of liberty. Because they are secrets.
One reason they are so fragile is that any one generation can freely give
them away, by neglect or by a wilful act, can turn off the lights and walk
out.'

A visit to London by the Emerson String Quartet is always eagerly awaited,
and the group's concert at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday fulfilled
expectations.  As one of the foremost chamber ensembles around today, the
Emersons provide a special kind of musical nourishment all too rare.
The American group, founded in 1976, has a reputation both for its
performances of standard works and for expanding the repertory with
significant commissions.  Each work on Thursday's weighty programme - early
Ives, late Beethoven and Shostakovich - revealed in turn another of the
group's strengths.
It was the sheer beauty of the group's sound that characterised its playing
of IVe's First Quartet, 'A Revival Service'. Ives drew inspiration for the
piece form his work as a church organist.  Hymns spiced up beyond the
approval of the ladies' committee found their way into the quartet, but some
of the textures are recognisably organ-like, and the Emersons filled the
hall with the deep sonorities.
All the textures in Shostakovich's Quartet No. 14 were carefully balanced
too.  The Emersons played with restraint in the mournful Adagio and radiant
conclusion, and made light of the virtuosity the composer demands elsewhere.
 Intonation in the high octaves of the first was impeccable.
The group's serious-mindedness was epitomised in its approach to the
Beethoven, No. 15 in A minor, Op. 132, in which the players sustained the
long musical arguments, welding the juxtaposed blocks of material together
impressively, never loosing sight of the work's symmetry. The central
Heiliger Dankgesang unfolded in all its rapt mystery, leaving one in awe
both of the music and the musicianship of the Emersons

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Lisbon looks to its cultural laurels - But Richard
Fairman feels that the real Portugal lurks elsewhere
</HEADLINE>

The European cultural roundabout has almost finished its first spin. The
honour of being Europe's cultural capital city is being rotated year by year
among the member countries and there are only a couple left to go, although
the four new members who join in 1995 could prolong the scheme.
This year it is the turn of Lisbon. With the examples of the cities who have
gone before, Lisbon has planned a wide-ranging programme of events. One of
the ways of making sure that the benefits are not all spent in the course of
one year is to put investment into capital projects. Glasgow, for example,
built the Royal Concert Hall and Lisbon has followed suit by refurbishing
the Coliseu, which is used for the city's most prestigious concerts.
Another is to delve back into the city's cultural history. This is to mine a
rich vein in Lisbon. In a gallery at the National Museum of Archaeology,
part of the mightily imposing Hyeronimite Monastery at Belem just outside
central Lisbon, an exhibition called Subterranean Lisbon follows the history
of the various civilisations that have settled in the area up to the
earthquake and fire of 1755, which devastated so much of the city.
As far as the performing arts are concerned, a cultural capital only derives
lasting benefit from its year in the spotlight if it can use some of the
money being made available to encourage home-grown performers. A number of
smaller Portuguese groups have won a hand-out from Lisbon 94 to put towards
new work, which should raise the output of cultural activity even if it
cannot be guaranteed to raise the standard.
Modern dance is apt to be a hit-or-miss affair. At the Teatro Sao Luis two
choreographers - Francisco Camacho and Vera Mantero - presented a joint
programme of new dance events early in April. The first involved three women
with multi-faceted talents. One ironed her dress while she was still wearing
it. Another fondled a head of Medusa. The third poured water into her right
ear from an oil-can. All three stood stock still for about half an hour.
Maybe I am old-fashioned, but I always thought dance involved movement of
some kind, even if it was only the occasional pirouette. The Edinburgh
fringe beckons.
A visit to the opera is likely to be a safer bet. Unlike Spain, which
produces a stream of world-class opera singers, Portugal has not imposed
itself on the international operatic scene to an equivalent degree.
Nevertheless, it does have the Teatro Sao Carlos, which is worth a visit on
its own account. In the 18th century Lisbon briefly enjoyed the most
splendid opera-house in Europe, which opened in March 1775 and was destroyed
by the earthquake a few months later. The Sao Carlos, inaugurated in 1793,
replaced it, beautiful, simple but elegant. Callas famously sang La traviata
there in the 1950s, but the challenge now is to encourage more indigenous
talent.
The new production of Beethoven's Fidelio was sung mostly by visiting
foreign singers, but produced and designed by a Portuguese team. By and
large they did themselves credit. According to the libretto, the opera is
set next door in Spain, as was customary at the time for any difficult
political subject, but few productions interest themselves any more in
identifying a particular locale (unless it be Nazi Germany).
The producer Paulo Ferreira de Castro and designers Manuel Graca Dias and
Egas Jose Vieira contented themselves with an unspecified modern location.
Guards wielding rifles formed an ominous presence. Searchlights periodically
scanned the auditorium. Most of the action was par for the course, but the
producer has an eye for a coup de theatre. At the end, pages of Beethoven's
score floated down from the ceiling, while the chorus appeared among the
audience in boxes on the upper tiers - a splendid conclusion, as their
singing raised the roof from there.
There were two strong voices in the main roles: Nadine Secunde as Leonore
and Jan Blinkhof as Florestan. John Macurdy was a laid-back Rocco. Elvira
Ferreira (evidently a local favourite) and Gunnar Gudbjornsson were an
acceptable Marzelline and Jacquino. Bodo Brinkmann's blustering Pizarro was
upstaged in his aria by the prison alsations, which let out a ferocious din
as he strode to the front of the stage to start singing - a hair-raising
effect. The conductor Thomas Fulton was at his best in the noise and energy
of the final scene.
Yet, after all this, the suspicion remains that real Portuguese culture is
lurking elsewhere. Lunch at a small restaurant off the beaten track was
interrupted by the arrival of a lottery-ticket salesman, who introduced his
wares in the traditional fashion - with a fado, to the untutored ear a cross
between folk singing and a quiet yodel. 'You can't learn fado', our
Portuguese guide observed, 'you have to be born with it'. Perhaps that is
the secret of an indigenous culture in any country.

The roving eye of a talent scout could be discerned behind Wednesday's
concert at the Barbican, writes Richard Fairman. For Rossini's Stabat Mater
the plan was to bring together four leading young Mediterranean voices.
As it happened, the final score was only three out of four. The intended
tenor was replaced by Bruce Ford, these days a well established Rossini
singer, but missing that open, sunny ring that is second nature to an
Italianate voice.
Both the soprano and the bass were Italian. Barbara Frittoli applied her
firm, lyrical soprano conscientiously to the work's most demanding solo
part. In the 'Inflammatus' she was outgunned towards the end, where Rossini
asks his soprano to sally forth with top C's blazing. Simone Alberghini,
still only 20, was the somewhat dour bass, but his voice rises to a
brighter, well-placed top.
One sensed that in this company the Greek mezzo Markella Hatziano was keen
to be a good colleague, keeping her voice down and holding in check a
personality several sizes larger. Once let loose in her own solo, Hatziano
gave notice that she is no mere promise for the future, but a singer who has
arrived.
The Brighton Festival Chorus was well rehearsed; the Stabat Mater gives all
the performers an equal chance and Carlo Rizzi conducted the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra in a clean Italianate style.
                        *      *      *
Simon Keenlyside is already a noted talent on the operatic stage, writes
John Allison, but his Wigmore Hall recital on Tuesday brought reminder that
he is equally at home in Lieder. He is a communicative, physical performer,
bringing each song to vivid life. He projects a firm line, has an impressive
control of dynamics, and commands plenty of tone throughout his range up to
a tenorial top, all combined in an intelligent, musicianly way.
The first half, devoted mostly to Poulenc, opened with a group of four
Debussy songs, including a mellifluous account of the composer's first
published work, 'Nuit d'etoiles'. 'Mandolin', a Verlaine setting, was hazy
and evocative. A hint of strain made itself felt in some of the Poulenc, but
Keenlyside captured the mood of each song. We heard 18, perhaps too many:
each was effective, but in danger of cancelling the previous one out. But
the vigour of 'La belle jeunesse' from the hedonistic Chansons Gaillardes,
and the deep emotions of 'C' remain firmly in the memory.
Throughout the evening Malcolm Martineau was an impressive accompanist,
nowhere more than in Schumann's Dichterliebe, in which he was an equal
partner with Keenlyside in a performance of profound insight.
                        *      *      *
Young pianist Mark Anderson - well, he must be 30 now: he was one of the
oldest competitors at Leeds last September - appeared at the Wigmore Hall on
Wednesday, writes David Murray.
The BBC-2 viewers who judged this American pianist's performance of the
Brahms D minor Concerto the best in the Leeds final round would also have
admired his semi-final performance of Brahms Third Sonata. Here it was
slightly less brash but even more gorgeously laid out. Anderson has a
wonderful gift for achieving great warmth in the whole piano-sound whilst
keeping every strand clear and luminous. He boasts not only the requisite
full-scale grasp of the music, but the immaculate pedal-technique needed to
realise it (a rare commodity among British pianists, unfortunately).
Add to those his vital rhythmic instinct and his old-fashioned respect for
structure, and you can imagine why I agreed with the BBC audience that he
ought to have won the Leeds competition. He was quite right to include again
Bartok's seminal but under-performed Improvisations (1920), because Anderson
plays this superbly original piano-music more or less to perfection.
Rightly, the most prominent virtues in his Bartok were his flexible,
sprung-steel rhythms and his heartfelt rubato. But a detached ear might also
have noted his extreme finesse with tone-colour; his Wigmore programme gave
less scope to that than his Leeds recital, which included some exquisitely
imagined Debussy.
The major exhibit should have been his account of Beethoven's late Sonata in
A, op. 101, but Richard Goode's performance five weeks ago still keeps
singing in my head. But the comparison was positive enough: like Goode,
Anderson plays with unaggressive flair, but with great lyrical intelligence.
He is a musician eminently worth hearing.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Some wondered what all the fuss was about . . . /
Review of Damien Hirst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How disappointing. After all the excited anticipation comes the let-down,
the false step at the top of the stair. For here, as curator of the
exhibition, we were to have had Damien Hirst, at once the art world's
wunderkind and William Brown of the 1990s, making his choice of the art of
his generation. Goodness, what fun, what shocking fun it was bound to be,
what blood and guts and flies on the meat for the sceptical critic to get
his teeth into. Well, we get Damien and his pals all right, in this
exhibition curiously titled Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away, but far from being
the Bash Street Kids or Outlaws of our hopes, they seem far closer to Rupert
Bear and friends.
It is all so safe, so predictable, so orthodox, so . . . how shall I put it?
. . . so avant-garde. How we long for something as radical as a painting of
a flower in a pot, perhaps, or a tree, or even the life model in the studio.
We look out of the windows, to the trees of Kensington Gardens, caught in
the sun of the late afternoon, and the world and his significant partner
jogging past. Interesting, visually interesting stuff, all of it. But, oh
dear, such things are far too risky for the ambitious young: better far to
leave them to the Royal Academy, as we shall see in a week or two.
Hirst tells us he has been working for three years on putting this show
together, which is to say the work of 15 artists, including himself,
amounting to something around three dozen exhibits. One of his own
contributions, predictably enough, is yet another carcass suspended in a
tank of formaldehyde, this time that of a dead sheep, with tiny bubbles of
air still trapped in the fleece and escaping quietly to the surface,
petillant, like lemonade, or greenish champagne.
Another of his works is a large white canvas on which are painted ten rows
of nine large dots in several colours, or nine of ten, depending on how you
look at it. Beside it hangs a large box by Robert Peacock painted half grey,
half orange, and called, yes, 'Grey and Orange Box 1994'. Hirst said of his
fellow artists the other day, that 'it's just that they appeal to my sick
taste . . . I thought they had visual excitement.'
'I don't think it's shocking exactly', he went on; 'it's just got to get
people involved in art. The worst thing is if someone just walks in and out
without seeing anything.' And here we begin to get to the heart or, if you
like, the wool of it. For this is not just a chance remark to a passing
reporter, but, in its Candide-like innocence, a declaration of faith. Hirst,
along with so many of his art-student contemporaries, who took in the
message, wide-eyed and open-mouthed at their mentors' feet, really does
believe that 'it's got to get people involved in art.'
There we have it. Art is nothing to do with the artist simply getting his
work right in its own terms, and then leaving us to come to terms with it as
experience of our own. Not at all. His job is to get us involved, to coerce
us into attention. Anything less and his work, whatever its inherent
qualities, is a wasted effort. Visual excitement, you see: 'the worst thing
is if someone walks in and out without seeing anything.' The worst thing?
The worst thing is only that the work should be no good.
But there it is, and Hirst dutifully sets out to chivvy us to attention. He
shows us the photographs of Hiroshi Sugimoto, of tableaux of murderers in
the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's. He leans Andreas Slominski's
bagman's bicycle against the wall, suitably over-hung with baskets, bags and
panniers of all sorts. 'This work is extremely fragile' says the caption. He
hangs Michael Joaquin Grey's orange fibreglass cast of Rodin's Balzac from
the ceiling, upside down. The life-size photographs of tombstones by Sophie
Calle are laid out upon the floor. A rubber shark by Ashley Bickerton, hung
about with coconuts and plastic containers, is suspended by the tail in
mid-air.
So it goes on. Abigail Lane's manikin down-and-out slumps on the floor.
Michael Joo slings expanding metal poles from wall to wall, wedging an
eight-limbed plastic bear at one side, a rubber ball, a rubber testicle and
a lychee nut at the other. Kiki Smith's 'Virgin Mary' is a standing wax
figure, life-sized and flayed as though in anatomical demonstration. Such is
the visual excitement that catches the breath and stops us leaving without
seeing anything. And is it well done? Well, the photographs are photographs,
the bicycle a bicycle, the metal poles metal poles, the sheep a sheep. Miss
Smith perhaps could have done with some old-fashioned lessons in modelling
the figure from life.
The last word, perhaps, should be left to the show's apologist, Richard
Shone, in his catalogue essay. 'An urge to bring order to chaos - the search
for meaning in the seemingly random flux of experience - has existed as a
fundamental human motivation throughout history . . . Works of art are one
of the major sources of data in the explanation of this universal need.'

W2, until June 5, then on to Helsinki, Hannover and Chicago: sponsored by

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: How a closet comedian came out - Nigel Andrews talks
to Leslie Neilsen, 'Naked Gun' hero and cinema's surest serial
laughter-raiser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consider the bizarre career of Leslie Nielsen. A man is born near the Arctic
Circle. Descending to the US, he ascends the Broadway stage as a leading
actor and soon after becomes a name in lights in Hollywood (The Vagabond
King, Forbidden Planet). He spends 20 years drifting through lead roles in
smallish movies and historic cameos in big ones: including the Captain who
capsized the Poseidon. (Single indelible line: 'Ohh my Gohhd]') Then he
turns to comedy, in Airplane and The Naked Gun, and starts to carry entire
hit films on his now 60-year-old back.
It must be sorcery. Ever since America's centre of witchcraft moved from
Salem, Massachusetts, to Hollywood, California, this kind of thing has gone
on. But Nielsen embodies something else too: he is modern Hollywood looking
back post-modernly on old Hollywood. The characters Nielsen plays for laughs
are the same, to all purposes, as the ones he played 40 years ago with a
frown.
Re-script his earnest spaceship captain in Forbidden Planet for the new
gobbledegook, and you would have an advance simulacrum of the Airplane
doctor who said 'Don't call me Shirley' or of Lieutenant Frank Drebin in The
Naked Gun.
'They spotted me for what I was, a closet comedian,' Nielsen says of the
Airplane/Gun team, David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams. We were sitting
in armchairs in his agent's office in Hollywood. Or rather Nielsen was
sitting on a whoopee cushion and I had been reacting politely to his re-run
of a rude-noises routine he had once done on the Wogan show.
As modern cinema's surest serial laughter-raiser, this man now thinks he
ought to be comic off screen. But it is Nielsen's non-comic persona that
makes him funny: that craggy face lined with wisdom and topped with
Biblical-white hair; that bass voice made to boom orders or to purr
fathomless authority.
Set them up; burnish them to a glow; then have his characters drive into
dustbins, mispronounce names or have 'safe sex' with Priscilla Presley
(Naked Gun) wrapped in a body-sized condom.
Nielsen, though, thinks the incongruities were there from the beginning.
'I'm bow-legged,' he explains, recalling his first movie. That was The
Vagabond King, a sort of medieval musical. 'They make armour for
straight-legged people, so as soon as I put it on, I went 'Yeeaggh]' They
had to bend my leg-casings. Then I had to walk across the ballroom floor to
confront the Dauphin, and the director Michael Curtiz (of Casablanca), who
was Hungarian, said 'Leslie, I vant you should move quickly for my tempo.' I
said, 'Yes, Mr Curtiz' and off I went. Two years later I saw the film and
watched this guy going across the floor looking like a giant egg-beater. If
they'd thrown 10,000 eggs in, I could've made breakfast for the army.'
I had barely noticed his bow legs, I said. But perhaps they are the
concealed motley on a man born to move from Hamlet to clown, even though it
took three decades. Nielsen himself cannot believe his career kismet - or
that he now thrives in big-city Lotusland. 'Where I was born (Regina,
Canada), you had different priorities. I had no choice to become streetwise,
because we had no streets. I knew about animals and wheat and mud and gumbo
and 64 below zero. Coming from that to Los Angeles, I was someone with a
monumental sense of not belonging. I was afraid I'd be found out as
untalented and sent back to Canada.'
Instead he rose to fame during the incredibly earnest 1950s. His air of
avuncular command on screen - a sort of Eisenhower with hair - must have
massaged a nationful of bruised postwar nerves and egos. Nielsen himself has
a fascination with that time and what it was about. 'Change. Americans were
called on to respond to so many changes so rapidly, it's a testimony to the
vitality of the society itself that it has survived.
'But changes make you vulnerable, and the values you're talking about' - I
had been going on about Doris Day and the squeaky-clean movement - 'became
very important to hold on to. Because you did feel there was something
slipping away, and 'squeaky clean' means you think you know what you're
doing. It's a lack of reality about change; not seeing things as they really
were; wanting to keep everything the same.'
And 1950s styles and pseudo-certainties, surely, are what movies like
Airplane and The Naked Gun are now lampooning?: that daft sense of never had
it so good, of 'Someone is in charge', of keep the clay feet hidden and our
heroes will remain heroes. The affluent, overconfident 1980s/early '90s saw
a mirror image giggling back at them from the 1950s. Airplane's point of
departure was an old Doris Day movie, in which the perfect virgin steered a
troubled passenger aircraft to safety. And The Naked Gun series takes off
from - and takes off - all those 1950s police shows like Dragnet and Highway
Patrol where civilisation was saved by cops with deep voice-overs.
Nielsen himself received only one unalterable rule from Messrs Zucker,
Zucker and Abraham when he was thrown into Airplane. 'They said, 'At no time
behave in a way that tells the audience you're trying to be funny.'' Nor was
any improvising allowed on the script. 'Comedy is very honed. The smallest
deviation can kill the joke.' So he and fellow veterans Robert Stack and
Lloyd Bridges donned the frowns and speak-your-weight voices and provided
the most powerfully assured old-timers' reunion in all of movie comedy.
Now Naked Gun 33 1/3 is about to discharge itself on screen (UK, May 19) and
Leslie Nielsen has become a millionaire of stage, screen and cider
commercials. He must be afraid that after decades of being typecast as a
straight man, with no escape route into comedy, he is now typecast for life
as a funnyman.
'No. I am so grateful. My career has been such an incredible roll of the
dice. I have no ambitions to play Hamlet.' Well, but now he mentions it - if
Mel Gibson and Arnold (Last Action Hero) Schwarzenegger can do it . . .

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Good times are coming - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years spent rattling the collection tins, in less than nine months the
arts, to say nothing of sport and charities, will be enjoying the
extraordinary experience of being pelted with cash.
By January the National Lottery should be on stream, with good causes
receiving around a quarter of its takings, and already the cautious
estimates made by Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, are being increased.
With over 20m people viewing the televised Saturday night jackpot
ceremonies, the thinking is that instead of the arts sharing Pounds 70m a
year the sum could well be over Pounds 100m. Each month the lottery
department at the Arts Council will be asking the council to approve cheques
totalling around Pounds 10m for dozens of arts organisations around the UK.
Jeremy Newton, from Eastern Arts, has been chosen as lottery director and
Peter Gummer is to be chairman of the National Lottery Advisory Board.
Newton anticipates that the awards will fall into two categories: lots of
small sums, from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 50,000, going to help rebuild a
village concert hall, or an inner city video workshop; and Pounds 50,000 to
Pounds 10m donations, perhaps announced each quarter, for a regional theatre
renovation or an opera house back stage re-vamp.
The money must go on capital projects, and the recipient arts organisation
must rustle up some matching funding, perhaps only 25 per cent of the total
if it is a priority project, but up to 75 per cent for a less essential
facelift.
No one can doubt that the arts scene in the UK will be totally transformed.
But who will actually fund the performances taking place in these smartened
venues? The company operating the lottery is likely to become very
profitable and will be under pressure to give back some of the excess by
sponsoring arts events. If Richard Bransons's syndicate wins, all the
surplus will be re-invested. All in all it sounds too good to be true.
Surely there must be a catch?
                           *      *      *
The City of London is finally embracing the arts with enthusiasm. Its Pounds
30m a year budget means that it is actually the third biggest patron of the
arts in the UK (after the Arts Council and the BBC) but fears of crass
comments by philistine members of the corporation has meant that it has
played down its largesse in the past.
Not any more. This week it announced that it was putting up Pounds 950,000
over the next four years to give the annual City of London Festival much
needed impact. Richard Hickox has been appointed artistic director and he
starts next year with a major themed festival, 'Purcell and his successors'.
The City's money must be matched by sponsors, but since sponsors have
contributed Pounds 1m between them over the past four rather tame years,
this is not causing many sleepless nights.
                           *      *      *
David Puttnam is the natural successor to Lord Attenborough as the advocate
and conscience of the British film industry. Taking time off from pointing
out to the government how even minimal support could work wonders for the
hard pressed British film industry (Ireland is now awash with film crews
after introducing a marginal tax incentive), Puttnam this week came out as a
supporter of a common sense approach to censorship. He has expressed his
approval of the new law on video nasties.
But he was careful to distinguish the evil of violence from less
reprehensible sex and bad language. Indeed, he revealed, he had to tack on
an extra scene for the American version of his first great success Chariots
of Fire just to add in the word 'shit'. Without it, the film would have
qualified for a family audience certificate, and been characterised as a
Disney type production. One swear word meant it needed parental guidance,
making it a serious movie, and led to an Oscar.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: New 'Cos' with a twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question one always wants to ask at this opera is 'How do the couples
pair off at the end?'. Mozart and Da Ponte left the conclusion of Cos fan
tutte ambiguous and it seemed that productions have tried out every possible
answer - until this one came along.
The new management at English National Opera has already stated that it sees
one of its prime duties as renewing the standard repertoire. During the
1980s Mozart was kept out of the hands of ENO's band of fire-raisers, who
wanted to watch traditional stagings burn. Jonathan Miller and John Cox were
more interested in period social values and left behind Mozart productions
of a gentler nature.
Nevertheless, a start has to be made some time and this new Cos fan tutte is
presumably the beginning of a renewal of the Mozart/Da Ponte trilogy. The
opera is an open invitation to a producer. Its six characters live in a
world of their own, untouched by any outside intervention as they play out
all the roles in a patently unreal comedy. Almost any time or place will do.
ENO's producer, Nicolette Molnar has chosen the 1950s. The villa has a
telephone, natty silk pyjamas are coming into fashion and the home-help
finds an amusing new use for her vacuum cleaner, but all this is mere
cosmetics: despite its trendy 1950s hairstyle, the opera has the same
profile underneath. In Jacqueline Gunn's semi-abstract set, a mixture of
decaying neo-classical columns and fancy 1950s iron work, the locale also
remains Naples.
Despina is very much a dark-haired Neapolitan, neatly played by Sally
Harrison. Don Alfonso looks more a debonair man of culture from the North,
in whose cravat and white trousers Richard Van Allan looks entirely at ease,
even if he needs more voice these days. Neill Archer is a vocally rugged
Ferrando; Christopher Booth-Jones puts the words across strongly as
Guglielmo. The two men play well together and their disguise as a gross pair
of Texan cowboys works better than one feels it should.
Like the production, the conductor Nicholas Kok gives the opera more pace
than depth. One of the main pleasures is the musical care taken over the
ensembles, not least the well-matched singing of the two ladies. Vivian
Tierney's soprano has a fine strength and poise, while Susan Bickley's mezzo
complements her with a darker bite to the tone. After the men have left for
war, it is touching to see Fiordiligi cuddling her teddy and Dorabella
sniffling into her tissues - humour and sentiment on a knife-edge, as they
always should be in this opera.
And what of the twist at the end? As the two couples get ready for the
wedding, it is Fiordiligi and Dorabella lookalikes under the brides' veils
who are masquerading this time. The real girls are making a quick exit out
of the back door, leaving the men to learn their own lesson. After all, if
they think all women are the same, it does not matter which they marry: Cos
fan tutte indeed]

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Drama in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Terence Frisby wrote the memorably named play There's a Girl in My Soup. A
slightly Noel Coward piece about a wine and food critic who expects to
seduce every pretty girl in sight, it ran for over six years in the West
end, starting in 1966.
Fashions change, however, When I went to look it up, I was convinced that it
must have been called There's a Man in My Soup. No-one treats philandering
so lightly today.
Frisby has changed too: out with the frivolous, in with the serious. The
only common element between Soup and Rough Justice is that the central
character is a media man who also writes books. But they are writers of a
very different kind. Robert Danvers in Soup is pompous and vain and would
never have written about ethics. James Highwood in Rough Justice, represents
 -as his name suggests - the higher journalism.
The trouble is that this paradigm of liberal virtue is up in court for
having killed his brain damaged baby son. Or so it seems. But I shall not
give away the plot, save to say that it you are of a sentimental frame of
mind, you can probably guess the outcome.
The action takes place in the Old Bailey, mainly in court, sometimes in the
defendant's cell and occasionally in a corridor outside where deals between
lawyers can be done. As in most court dramas, the characters tend to be made
out of cardboard. Nevertheless, there is a Wimbledon-like fascination in
watching the exchanges between the prosecuting counsel Margaret Casely QC
(Diana Quick) and the defendant played with some anguish by Martin Shaw.
Alan Dobie's judge sits as the umpire in the middle.
Issues abound: the case for so-called mercy killing and the distinction
between murder and manslaughter. The law which comes in for most abuse
(rightly in my view) is contempt of court: it allows the judge and the
prosecution ruthlessly to bully anyone conducting their own defence and
smacks, in this play, of a lawyers' cartel.
Rough Justice is not very profound. It conforms effectively to the
middlebrow rule of treating controversial subjects without much risk of
offending anyone. Some of the characters, especially the wife, might be more
developed. Still, the piece can hold an audience. I enjoyed it. Direction is
by Robin Herford.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: A bedroom farce turns tragic / Review of Cocteau's
'Les Parents terribles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean Cocteau's play Les Parents terribles, as staged by Sean Mathias at the
Lyttelton Theatre, represents an unusual genre: the farce with
recriminations. Just as the play seems merrily set up as bedroom knockabout,
with the requisite sexual confusions and infidelities, its humour is apt to
freeze at the source, and a terrible reckoning of the human consequences be
forced upon us. Never till the - actually tragic  - end is one sure how far
this process is going to go. The balance of misery and witticism,
truthfulness and fun, is too fine for comfort.
Cocteau wrote the work (apparently in a mere eight days when under the
influence of opium) in 1938, and it is not to be confused with his 1929
novel, Les Enfants terribles. Both works were made into films, the latter by
Jean-Pierre Melville in 1950, the former by Cocteau himself two years
before. The premiere and subsequent revival of the play of Les Parents in
Paris were banned as immoral, and it is not hard to see how Cocteau's
unsparingly frank analysis of hypocritical and emotionally sterile upper
bourgeois life must have genuinely hit its target.
The play is built round a central, gallically precise opposition of disorder
and order, the mock-gypsy squalor of George and Yvonne's apartment (for Acts
1 and 3) and the clinical austerity of the young woman Madeleine's (for Act
2). The long marriage of the first two has become loveless and suffocating.
Yvonne is a semi-invalid who spends all her time in a darkened room and
lives only for her son Michael; George a failed inventor whose emotional
deprivation has led him into what proves a desperately tangled affair with
Madeleine, with whom Michael fall in love passionately.
For the ultimate benefit of everyone - a spinster aunt Leonie, who has
sacrificed her life for George and Yvonne, completes the tight little cast
of five - Michael needs to escape the messy gloom symbolised above all by
his incestuously possessive mother, and break into space and light. The
contrast between Stephen Brimson Lewis's two sets - a crepuscular tumble of
clothes and shoes and bits and pieces versus a modernist realm of sanitary
whiteness with its giant spiral staircase - defines the dilemma perfectly.
But there proves no way into a shining brave new world in this Pelleas et
Melisande of the boulevards.
Jeremy Sams has translated the play into a fluent modern English that does
not court the dangers of topicality. Its slang ('peachy') is wisely already
dated, its manipulation of cliche ('strike while the iron is hot') carefully
knowing. There is a useful snippet of Yeats ('rag and bone shop of the
heart'); and true to Cocteau, everything that happens is 'unbelievable'.
The cast is strong. Sheila Gish as Yvonne is as blanched and consumptive -
actually diabetic - as any moribund operatic heroine (the problem for the
other characters is that she insists on being one). Her instant overreaction
to the sweet reasonableness of Michael's confession of love for Madeleine is
gloriously funny.
Frances de la Tour as Leonie brings off the tricky feat of having to seem
both embittered and kindly; and Alan Howard's muttering George is a
brilliant study of frazzled and hopeless but nonetheless Machiavellian
middle-aged discontent. The role of Madeleine does not really allow Lynsey
Baxter to offer much more than a sketch; but Jude Law's Michael is a
full-blooded (and in the bathroom scene full frontal), romping, almost
flatteningly extrovert portrayal. When the whole box set is recessed on its
Lyttelton tracks at the end, however, messiness of a purely theatrical kind
wins out.
