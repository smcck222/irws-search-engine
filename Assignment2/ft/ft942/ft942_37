FT  29 APR 94 / Arts: Discovering Holberg - Fringe Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
Roll up, roll up, for London's Holberg revival. The what? Who? Well . . .
Ludvig Holberg (1684-1754), known as the Moliere of the North, wrote 28 or
more comedies for the Danish theatre, which opened in 1722. In both Denmark
and Norway, he is called 'Father Holberg'; statues of him stand beside the
National Theatre of Oslo and the Royal Theatre of Copenhagen; his plays,
Ibsen wrote, were 'almost the only book I never tire of reading'. Oliver
Goldsmith knew his work - but few London theatre-goers today do.
Now, however, the London fringe has two different Holberg comedies. Watching
both in quick succession has made me curious to know more of his work, and
to investigate his importance in the Danish-Norwegian theatrical tradition.
The Gate Theatre - the venue celebrated for introducing foreign classics to
London - has produced his Jeppe of the Hill (1722). Meanwhile the much less
well known Greenwich Studio Theatre (which has started to follow a similar
repertory - of unknown European classics in translation) has revived its
1993 staging of his Erasmus Montanus (probably 1723).
The difference between the two stagings is instructive. The Gate actors
perform Jeppe of the Hill with panache and sophistication, but often as if
condescending to the old play and indeed as if amused by the 18th century.
The Greenwich Studio actors are, by comparison, amateurish; but they absorb
themselves in Erasmus so that it becomes far the more stirring and touching
of the two.
The title character of Jeppe is a henpecked peasant who escapes his shrewish
wife only to drink himself silly. Baron Nilus, coming across his dead-drunk
body, has the whim of (a) putting him to bed in the castle and having the
castle staff treating him as a lord - for a day; and then (b) returning him
(drunk again) to the dung-heap and having him arrested for assaulting the
castle staff. There are moments when Jeppe, as alcohol colours his worldview
rosy, sounds like Falstaff. More often he resembles Bottom, never quite
understanding his visit to 'paradise' and never capable of explaining it.
The play becomes more arresting the more you can believe in poor, passive,
all too human Jeppe. If the play is to have any heart, he must be its most
intensely human character. Jonathan Coyne is pleasant but lightweight. Like
his colleagues, he wastes too much time addressing the audience,
panto-style. Bernadette Roberts has provided an admirable single set that,
with various props, becomes four different locations. Kenneth McLeish, the
translator, has written that Holberg's script was intended as 'a skeleton, a
template for performance . . . to be filled out and expanded by the company
in characteristic commedia dell' arte style'. OK; but, although everyone in
Ben Crocker's direction is charming, nobody seems really to believe that
Jeppe's world could ever be three-dimensional. Or that Holberg might be
worth serious attention.
The title Erasmus Montanus sounds rather learned - but actually is a joke.
Rasmus Berg is a farmer's son who goes to university and comes back so
disgustingly learned that he insists on being called 'Erasmus Montanus'. So
far, the sympathy is all against him. But he also insists that the earth is
round and that it rotates around the sun - which the farm folk regard as
repulsive heresy Rasmus Berg is vilified, and finally has to recant.
Suddenly, for a while, the Moliere of the North seems to have prefigured
Brecht's Galileo; and I watched with tears as well as laughter.
Both these Holberg plays have a highly conservative sting in thir tails.
Jeppe ends with the moral that peasants are best in their place, for, if
allowed to rule, they behave all too boorishly. Erasmus Montanus winds up
more subtly, with the university-educated lieutenant telling Rasmus that
true learning teaches tact, proportion, good manners. What makes Holberg an
artist larger than these conclusions is his humanity, and I loved Julian
Forsyth's staging of Erasmus Montanus far more than Jeppe because it did
more to bring to life its characters.
Jeppe is at the Gate Theatre, W6, until May 21; Erasmus at the Greenwich
Studio Theatre until April 30

The BBC's new classic serial, Hard Times, starts today - at noon on BBC 2.
It may be perverse of the BBC to put together such a splendid cast,
including Alan Bates, Bob Peck and Harriet Wilson, in the Dickens tale of
class strife in the industrial north, and screen it at such an odd hour. But
it demonstrates a continuing commitment to culture and education.
Television's two obsessions - sickness and crime - can be seen tonight. In
Secret Service (BBC 1, 7pm), Dylan Winter takes a hidden camera into the
maternity unit of Lincoln County Hospital and sits with pregnant women
waiting for their waters to burst.
Then on ITV at 9pm, Crime Story recreates a 1977 crime in which a conman
becomes a butler with the aim of preying on a rich woman. He finds he enjoys
the life, and all is well until an acquaintance from his past arrives on the
scene.
Late Friday night is the time for oddities, and there are few things wierder
than Eurotrash (Channel 4, 11.05pm), in which Jean-Paul Gaultier and Antoine
de Caunes make indifferent film clips strangely beguiling.

FT  29 APR 94 / Management: Designer canteens - Superior staff cafes feed
morale as well as the body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANTA RAYMOND and ROGER CUNLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolff Olins's staff cafe in London has a wonderfully attractive view - on to
the canal at the back, complete with ducklings in the spring.
Colour is the delight of the Designers Guild cafe: blue walls, with magentas
and oranges setting off delicious food displayed on a stainless steel
counter.
At Imagination, a design and communication company, employees eat at tables
spilling out into an atrium, surrounded by exotic objects and plants.
The trend of designer food in designer surroundings for staff is spreading
to banks, accountants, law firms and computer companies. But these staff
restaurants are not just internal and external shop windows  - the more
creative are using them to encourage communication and bonding.
Gary Hawkes, chief executive of caterers Gardner Merchant, confirms that the
staff canteen should be 'an experience, a genuine change from the office,
and friendly, so that people may be relaxed and be brought together. The
lunch facility demonstrates that people's well-being matters - that what
they do matters - that they are important to the firm'.
The layout, decor, furniture and lighting of the successful staff cafeteria
have to be put together with the same care, and with many of the same
criteria, as the most successful restaurant in a city centre.
As more people eat out, go abroad, have new experiences, so they also expect
more if they are to use - and benefit from - corporate catering. Ethnic or
theme food - haggis and whisky trifle on Burns Night, for example - may fill
the house on special occasions but however seductive the facility, no more
than half of any workforce will normally eat in-house, unless it is raining.
Hugh Cade, a partner in Touche Ross, confirms a tendency for companies to
cut costs by reducing subsidies, although food is still a tax-allowable
perk. Normal practice is for the staff to pay the cost of the raw food plus
VAT, amounting to about Pounds 2.50 for a three-course meal.
In North America, where employment has been historically seen as partnership
rather than patriarchy, workers pay around Dollars 11 (Pounds 7.50) for
perhaps better food in a nicer environment.
Breakfast at work is now common in international companies, with some
providing it free, but generally food is served during quite restricted
periods and not at the end of the day, except for special occasions.
A few organisations offer a 24-hour service; others say they intend to at a
later date.
Although it sounds an expensive option, food - good food - can keep the
motor going and the morale high.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, feeding more than 1,000 people a day, with 60 different
menu items a week, is particularly conscious of trends. The self-service
restaurant caters daily for about 700, with 60 formal or buffet meals being
served in the surrounding dining or meeting rooms. A further 400 people buy
sandwiches or other snacks from the adjacent 'deli'.
Smoking is allowed in the beautiful coffee area in the atrium, with street
cafe furniture, white canvas umbrellas, and a waterfall to drown the noise
from the Underground 5m below. Although the restaurant is licensed, alcohol
is served only in the dining rooms.
Among many workers in general, however, casual feeding, 'browsing' and
'brown bagging' are on the increase. Even the French are following the
international trend of convenience foods and unstructured eating habits.
Vending machines are taking over, with 'heat your own' microwaves joining
the soft and hot drinks and candy bars.
In future there may well be machines delivering the baked potato direct to
the dealer's desk, complete with favourite topping.
This is feeding faces, though, rather than nourishment; the well-designed
and well-serviced cafe should provide nourishment of the mind, body and
spirit. On some days, at least, workers should be encouraged to pause, sit
down and get to know each other better, in a setting where the food and the
surroundings help the pressured worker to unwind.
As Jane Scruton, a founder partner of Wolff Olins, observes: 'Our cafe shows
the staff that we care for them, and the client that we have high standards,
a single level of excellence, and generosity without extravagance. Our food
reflects our work ethic: simple ingredients, not dolled up, good looking,
wholesome, creative.
'Our way of eating is a training programme for our staff, demonstrating the
sort of work we aim to do.'

FT  29 APR 94 / Management: 'Um . . er . . um you're fired' - Dismissing an
employee is never an easy task. Richard Donkin on how to handle the job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Harrods discovered this week, firing the managing director can have
embarrassing public consequences. But dismissing anyone, be it a boss like
Harrods' Peter Bolliger or whole sections of the workforce when a company
goes into receivership, is almost always a delicate task.
The language of dismissal appears to have as many euphemisms as that of sex
and death. Those unfortunate enough to find themselves on the street may
often wonder if they have been let go, terminated, discharged, fired,
sacked, axed, given the boot, pushed or chopped.
The euphemisms for executives are more gentle. They retire, leave by mutual
consent, part company to spend more time with their family, pursue an
alternative career or accept a fresh challenge.
One of the most subtly disguised dismissals appeared in the film
Philadelphia, when the actor Tom Hanks, playing an Aids victim, was told by
his bosses: 'We can't make the best use of your talents.'
At least the words 'You're fired' have a certain ring to them, evoking 1960s
American television sitcoms. But does anyone really say that any more? It
appears that Mohammed Al-Fayed, Harrods' owner, did or at least say
something very similar in last week's acrimonious parting, though this is
disputed by Bolliger himself. The Harrods press release - in response to
Bolliger's side of the story in a Sunday newspaper - was a masterpiece of
corporate vitriol and left no impression that the parting was in any way
amicable.
Someone who did enjoy firing people was the late Robert Maxwell. The story
goes that he sacked a workman for smoking in the corridor, counting out a
month's salary from a wad of notes in his pocket. Only later was it
discovered that the man had been repairing a photocopier and worked for
someone else.
Anna Reece, Maxwell's former corporate communications manager, recalls that
she was sacked simply for waiting at the wrong door of the Savoy Hotel when
he arrived to interview a leading Russian politician.
'I had told his secretary and his driver we would be waiting at the main
entrance but he told the driver to take him to the riverside entrance
instead. In the time it took him to walk the length of the hotel he had
called me on his mobile phone to tell me I was fired,' she says.
The incident, Maxwell told her, had called into question her ability to
communicate and her attention to detail. 'He fired a lot of people,' says
Reece, now head of communications at the Institute of Personnel Management.
The experience of dismissal - Maxwell style or otherwise - can be disastrous
for the morale of individuals.
Alan Fowler, a personnel specialist with 20 years' experience of informing
employees that it is time to leave and author of a book on redundancy, says
the best way of dealing with dismissal is to be direct, honest and
reasonable.
Some employers exacerbate the problem by rushing to withdraw access passes
for security reasons. This is often, he argues, an unnecessarily draconian
action, leading to a perception by departing employees that they cannot be
trusted. For the same reason, he says, there is rarely an excuse for
immediate repossession of the company car.
'The most difficult situation for a company is the one where the person is
not performing sufficiently well but is not so bad that it is obvious. In
those cases it is a matter of judgment,' he says.
'Problems arise when managers take the decision that someone should go but
try to find other reasons for saying so, rather than being honest about it.
The best approach when someone is not doing their job well is to tell them
what's required, where they are falling short and give them time to put
things right.'
Unfortunately, he says, the dismissal itself is often not dealt with openly.
'Managers feel embarrassed by the situation and might exaggerate a person's
shortcomings in order to make themselves feel better about the decision.
Others may give no explanation why they are doing it.'
The risk here is opening the way to possible legal action from the
disgruntled employee since unreasonable behaviour is one of the grounds for
accusing the employer of constructive dismissal.
Using an outplacement agency to counsel staff and help them find new careers
is often helpful, he adds, though some companies see this solely as a
convenient form of conscience-salving.
Roger Shipton, a partner at KPMG Career Consultancy Services, believes
counselling can dramatically affect how individuals approach a new career.
'We have had client companies who have told us that they have noticed a
great increase in the morale of those about to leave, often contrasting
markedly with low morale among those staying.'
The point is underlined by Ewart Wooldridge, director of resources at the
South Bank Centre, London, who had to arrange his own departure along with
that of everybody else when he was director of personnel at TVS.
The company lost its independent television franchise near the end of 1991.
'Redundancy impacts within the whole organisation, with those staying as
well as those leaving. You are much more likely to come out with a positive
workforce if you do it properly and that means counselling, helping people
plan and consulting them.'
Get the dismissal right and you may find yourself as embarrassed as Fowler.
He says: 'On some occasions when I have explained at length what had to
happen, people have walked out thanking me for taking the time and trouble
to do so. That's hard to take when you're sacking someone.'

FT  29 APR 94 / Property: The empty quarter - James Harding on converting
vacant offices into houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has nearly 900,000 vacant homes and some 35m sq ft of empty office
space, enough to accommodate more than 1m people, equivalent to the
population of Birmingham.
In an attempt to galvanise property developers into filling 'the empty
space', Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, last week told a housing
conference in London that 'empty homes are wasted homes'. The private
sector, with more than 760,000 vacant houses, must be 'the main engine of
growth in tackling empty homes', he added.
At the conference, organised by the Empty Homes Agency, a housing charity,
and the Association of District Councils, Mr Gummer said local authorities
must make landlords more aware of the opportunities of short-term leases
which, under the assured shorthold tenancy provision of the 1988 Housing
Act, allow them 'to regain possession of their property easily'.
Beyond these exhortations, the government has been responding to growing
criticism of the rising number of empty properties with pump-priming
measures designed to assist landlords to fill long-standing vacant space.
These include:
The government's short-life housing programme;
The Housing Corporation's approved development programme;
housing association grants.
These schemes all provide funds for renovations on condition that the
property will be leased to a housing association for a period of between two
and 15 years.
In addition, for landlords reluctant to deal directly with private tenants,
the government has established the Housing Association as Managing Agents
scheme, which establishes an institutional middle-man - a housing
association - to manage the property.
The government initiative most widely praised by landlords, housing
associations and tenants alike has been the 'Flats over Shops' scheme, in
which the Department of Environment has invested Pounds 25m over three years
to return an estimated 90,000 potential homes to use.
The West Country Housing Association, for instance, converted a Torquay
property into four flats. Photofirst, the retail tenant, said that the
repairs carried out by the housing association under the scheme saved it
about Pounds 40,000. The property's value has risen by 10 per cent since
completion.
However, even supporters of the 'Flats over Shops' scheme believe that,
collectively, the DoE initiatives only scratch the surface. Mr Roland Buck
of estate agents Chestertons said that the 'Flats over Shops' scheme should
be extended beyond 1995 because as it stands 'it is only nibbling at the
edges'. 'Investors still shy away from conversions,' he said.
In contrast, investor interest in commercial property is strong. In spite of
the fact that the equivalent office space of 25 Canary Wharfs is currently
standing empty, planning consents for a further 54m sq ft of new offices are
already in the planning process.
A surplus of office space and rising demand for housing provides commercial
property owners with a compelling reason for converting more offices to
residential use. According to a Home Office report published last year, the
average annual cost of maintaining a 20,000 sq ft office block is Pounds
15,000, with a further Pounds 70,000 for security and Pounds 200,000 on
rates. Converting such a property to residential use would make financial
sense, says the report.
However, even for office blocks built more than 25 years ago in prime
residential locations, the dual obstacles of local authority opposition and
the high value added tax on conversions and residential lettings continue to
deter deve-lopers.
Mr Malcolm Beckett, a director of MBE Homes, which specialises in
conversions, believes that local authority decisions are based on an
outdated view of viable commercial space. Mr Beckett, writing in Planning in
London magazine, argues that changes in working practices - particularly the
onset of computer-based offices - are leaving old-style offices permanently
empty and that local authority decision-making on conversions should reflect
this change.
The onerous 17.5 per cent VAT forces property developers to seek, often
unrealistically, a high return to make their investment worthwhile. All too
often, however, owners let their their property fall into disrepair ahead of
a reconstruction on which they can reclaim VAT.
Mr Gummer is rightly proud of the 25 per cent fall in the number of empty
local authority homes over the past seven years. To build on this success,
he is placing the onus on private-sector initiatives.
But private-sector developers remain dependent on the public purse to
initiate conversions. They are only likely to take up Mr Gummer's challenge
if they believe that profits can be made free of subsidy. And that, say
developers, will occur only when local authorities relax planning
restrictions and the government eases the tax burden on conversions.

FT  29 APR 94 / People: Jones lands on GKN's board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Jones, the chairman of Westland who unsuccessfully defended the company
against a hostile bid from GKN recently, has now accepted a place on GKN's
board. Jones, who is widely credited with turning round the ailing
helicopter-maker, will continue to run Westland's operations.
In contrast to its difficulties in the 1980s, Westland now has good order
prospects, notably for British Army attack and RAF support helicopters.
At the start of the bid in February Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman, said he
did not intend to make any management changes if he won control of Westland,
and offered Jones a place on GKN's board.
As the bid became more contentious, however, the relationship between the
two cooled noticeably. Any differences now seem to have been resolved.
Although Jones joined Westland as chief executive in 1989, he had only the
briefest tenure as chairman. He took the chair when Sir Leslie Fletcher
retired at the agm on February 17 this year and finally conceded defeat to
GKN's bid on March 31.
Jones had been involved in bids before. In 1989 he resigned as head of
Plessey's defence business to move to Westland at the height of the hostile
bid from GEC and Siemens. His departure was seen as weakening Plessey's
defences.

FT  29 APR 94 / Property: IPD all-property return for March
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The IPD all-property return accelerated to 3.1 per cent in March, according
to Investment Property Data, a research group. The improved performance was
reflected across all sectors.
The retail sector improved in March with both total return and capital
growth up by five points to 3 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively.
Over the long term, the decline in rental values continues to slow,
recording a fall of 1.9 per cent for the year to March.
Capital growth in the office sector was up by 0.8 percentage points in March
to 2.4 per cent. This was reflected in a total return for the month of 3.1
per cent compared with 2.3 per cent for February.
Rental value decline has slowed and values have fallen by 1.8 per cent over
the first quarter of this year. For the quarter to March offices showed a
capital growth of 4.9 per cent and a total return of 7.3 per cent.
Total return for industrials rose to 3.5 per cent in March. This was led by
an increase in capital growth from 2.3 per cent in February to 2.7 per cent
in March. Capital growth for the first quarter of this year stood at 6.3 per
cent, nearly 2 percentage points above the level for the quarter to December
1993.
Rental values fell by 1.5 per cent for the quarter to March, compared with a
fall of 1.1 per cent for the corresponding period in 1993.

FT  29 APR 94 / Technology: The lottery of life - Clive Cookson examines the
latest advances in multiple sclerosis treatment, in a continuing drug series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for the first drug proven to have an effect against multiple
sclerosis, Betaseron, outstrips supply to such an extent that a lottery is
used to decide which patients should receive it.
When Schering of Germany launched Betaseron last September in the US, the
only country in which it is licensed for sale, doctors registered 80,000 MS
patients who wanted the drug. The company's computer then picked 15,000 at
random to begin treatment, at a cost of Dollars 9,500 (Pounds 6,500) a year
each.
Schering's US subsidiary, Berlex, says 20,000 patients are now receiving
injections of Betaseron - a form of beta-interferon - and a further 20,000
are preparing to start treatment. Chiron, the Californian biotechnology
company which manufactures Betaseron for Berlex from genetically engineered
bacteria, is increasing production rapidly; it forecasts that the US waiting
list will have disappeared by 1995.
Schering hopes to submit a European licence application for Betaseron next
month. European supplies will be manufactured by Germany's Boehringer
Ingelheim.
Meanwhile two competing beta-interferons, developed by Ares-Serono of
Switzerland and Biogen of the US, are moving through clinical trials in MS
patients. Ian Broadhurst, a pharmaceutical analyst with BNP Capital Markets,
predicts that Betaseron will not enjoy more than two years free from
competition, though it could still bring Schering DM600m (Pounds 250m) in
sales in 1995.
Besides the interferons, many other 'new generation' MS drugs are at various
stages of research and development. A BNP report last month listed 25
commercial R&amp;D projects in progress around the world; the most advanced are
shown in the table. Together they represent progress on a broad front
against MS, the most common disease of the nervous system in young adults,
which affects an estimated 2m people worldwide.
Effective MS treatments could give the pharmaceutical industry a huge new
market. Potential US sales are Dollars 1.8bn a year, according to an
estimate by Genetic Technology News, a biotechnology newsletter.
Although the precise molecular cause of MS is not yet known, scientists
agree that it is an auto-immune disease in the same broad category as
rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. The body's immune system, which is
intended to defend it against germs and other foreign invaders, turns
against its own cells. The self-attack is probably triggered by a
combination of genetic and environmental factors.
In MS, white blood cells (T-cells) destroy the protein sheath called myelin
which protects nerve fibres. This stops the nerves working properly and the
patient begins to lose control of muscles. Symptoms include partial
paralysis, blurred vision and speech difficulties.
But the progress of MS is variable. In the worst cases of
'chronic-progressive MS' the neurological problems become steadily more
severe and eventually kill the patient. In 'relapsing-remitting MS' the
disease flares up at unpredictable intervals - and may even disappear
spontaneously.
Neither beta-interferon nor the other experimental drugs can cure MS but,
for the first time, they do promise a significant amelioration in the
disease. Until now, doctors have only been able to offer patients 'comfort
therapy' such as pain-killers and anti-inflammatory drugs, which control
some of the symptoms but have no effect on the underlying disease.
MS specialists such as George Ebers, a Canadian neurologist at the
University Hospital, London, Ontario, are understandably cautious about
claims for new treatments because 'there have been so many false dawns -
therapies which have been widely used but found on further study to be
ineffective'. For example, hyperbaric oxygen treatment (subjecting the
patient to high pressure oxygen) became fashionable in the 1970s and was
discredited in the 1980s.
Researchers also claimed success with drugs such as cyclophosphamide and
cyclosporin, which suppress the patient's whole immune system, but these too
turned out to be ineffective against MS when tested properly. The only
acceptable clinical test is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
trial: patients are divided at random into two groups, one of which receives
the drug and the other an identical dummy, and neither patients nor
investigators know until the end who is getting what.
Tested under those conditions on patients with relapsing-remitting MS,
Betaseron reduced the number of attacks by one third and reduced
significantly the amount of nerve damage shown by magnetic resonance
imaging. But, as Ian McDonald of London University's Institute of Neurology
points out, Betaseron has not yet been shown to have any effect on patients'
long-term development of disability.
Interferons are natural proteins which perform a wide range of functions,
including modulating the immune system. All three kinds - alpha, beta and
gamma - have been tested on MS. Alpha had no effect, while gamma made the
disease worse; scientists now believe natural gamma-interferon may play a
role in the progression of MS.
It is not clear how beta-interferon brings about an improvement. According
to Ares-Serono, it may both decrease the activity of the immune cells that
destroy myelin and counteract the disease-enhancing effects of
gamma-interferon.
The Ares-Serono and Biogen beta-interferons differ slightly from Betaseron.
They are made by genetically engineered mammalian cells, rather than by
bacteria cultures. As a result they have sugar chains on the protein
surface, like natural human interferon but unlike the Schering product. In
theory this could give them a clinical advantage - in terms of fewer
side-effects and improved efficacy - but there is no evidence to show
whether they work better in practice.
Most of the other MS treatments under development aim to disable the
specific part of the immune system that is responsible for MS, without
suppressing the other immune functions that are essential for fighting
disease. Those most advanced in the development process include:
Deoxyspergualin (DSG), a natural bacterial extract discovered by Nippon
Kayaku in Japan and developed by Hoechst of Germany. It suppresses harmful
T-cells and may also stimulate the regrowth of damaged myelin. If clinical
trial results due next month are encouraging, Hoechst will apply for a
marketing licence. Regulatory approval could follow quickly since DSG is not
a genetically engineered product.
Myloral, a formulation of bovine (cow) myelin, developed by AutoImmune, a
Massachusetts biotechnology company. It is an 'oral tolerance therapy'. The
patient is fed the protein so that the immune system comes to tolerate it
and therefore is less inclined to attack his or her own myelin. After
promising early results, Myloral is now in large-scale clinical trials.
Copolymer-1 (Cop-1), a synthetic chemical resembling myelin protein,
developed by Teva in Israel. When injected into the patient, this decoy
attracts the immune cells away from the real myelin. It is in the final
stage of clinical trials.
At earlier stages of development, the biotechnology industry is testing
several experimental drugs, including antibodies and vaccines. These are
aimed either at specific types of T-cell which the researchers believe are
responsible for the immune attack in MS or at 'antigens' in the myelin which
provoke the attack.
However, there is vigorous debate between MS specialists about whether the
fundamental defect lies in a very narrow sub-group of T-cells - in which
case a specific drug could in theory cure the disease - or whether a wider
range of immune cells are responsible. If so, MS will be harder to treat.
Ebers inclines to the latter view. Even so, he says, 'the mood, among a
sceptical audience, is now approaching optimism'.
The series continues next month with a look at blood products.

<TEXT>
Haruko Fukuda has been appointed to the newly created position of vice
chairman of Nikko Europe, the highest ranking post held by a woman at the
Japanese securities company.
Fukuda was educated in the US and UK, as well as Japan, and holds an MA from
Cambridge University. She was already the top woman at Nikko in her previous
position as board director, which she took up in 1988. Her areas of
responsibility in that job included corporate finance and European strategy.
Previously, she was a partner at James Capel, where she headed the Japanese
department.
'Although Japanese by nationality, Haruko Fukuda is a prominent and highly
respected City figure. Her appointment is yet another signal of our
intention to place responsibility for our future growth and success on the
skills and knowledge of local staff,' a spokesman said. 'As local staff
herself, she will be spearheading this change, providing as she does a
unique bridge between Japanese and English business cultures.'
The promotion of local staff to senior positions is a relatively new
development at Japanese financial institutions, which in the past have
tended to appoint senior managers on assignment from Tokyo for relatively
brief stints.

Miller, 43, joined L&amp;G in 1988, initially as group legal services manager.
It was her close involvement with Lautro during the discussions on the
compliance failures and the subsequent report she prepared for the board
recommending the establishment of the new job that convinced L&amp;G that she
should take on the task.
While she reports primarily to the sales and marketing managing director,
she also has a direct - if dotted - line to the board as a whole.
'It will give me the opportunity, if necessary, to talk to the non-executive
directors,' she says. 'Also, the board was very unhappy that we should be
disciplined, and this system will allow (the directors) to have confidence
that I'm competent and they're happy with the compliance arrangements.'
She plays down the need to undertake a morale-boosting exercise in the light
of the Lautro criticism: 'The publicity and everything clearly made everyone
feel very unhappy, but the charges and disciplinary action were historic to
some extent (they related to 1991-92), and we have moved very considerably
since that time.'
She is clear that compliance cannot simply be a question of a small
department policing a salesforce, but emphasises that the monitoring of the
systems and procedures which Lautro found unsatisfactory for checking that
sales agents had complied have already been strengthened.

FT  29 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Ice-detectors save on de-icing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new way of detecting ice on aircraft, developed by RVSI (Robotic Vision
Systems), has generated interest at the US Federal Aviation Administration,
which has awarded a Dollars 460,000 contract to fund further research.
The US company says its technology - called ID-1 and using electro-optical
methods - can be adapted to ground-based and airborne detection systems. The
compact, mobile sensor operates in the dark and in severe weather. As a
visual system with a video display, the ID-1 can pinpoint the location of
dangerous ice build-up.
RVSI says the device's precision also has environmental benefits, as
over-use of potentially hazardous de-icing fluids can be reduced.

For buildings infested with small rodents, a UK company has developed a
high-tech mouse trap. Mouse Alert uses infra-red detectors and low-power
radio signals to warn customers when a mouse has been caught.
Developed by Radio Data Systems for Rentokil, it comprises a number of
trapping boxes placed around the building, and a wall-mounted control
console. Instead of traps having to be checked regularly, the detectors on
each trap transmit a signal to the console.
Mouse Alert can also be put in unstaffed areas such as automated
distribution centres and storage and production sites.

A small UK company, Biotal, is using fungi to take toxic and other stubborn
residues out of the soil. It makes a compost by mixing in woodchips; a white
rot fungus is grown which produces enzymes to break down the organic
compounds.
In Finland, it has treated soil containing chlorinated phenols which were
quickly reduced to below 10ppm. The process worked in severe winter
conditions and Biotal is researching treatment of soils with other

The unit, incorporating a filtration and treatment system, can handle some
550 litres an hour, using chlorine dioxide to clean the water as it comes
from the contaminated source. 'Dams have been built, boreholes drilled and
water tanks erected but if the water is tainted or contaminated, disease and
death will follow,' says John Wright, managing director.
Meaubile can also be used by breweries and food and drinks companies.

FT  29 APR 94 / Sinclair gives bikes a push
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Clive Sinclair, inventor of the ill-fated C5 car and the Zike electric
bicycle, yesterday unveiled his latest brainwave - a battery-powered motor
for push bikes to take the work out of going uphill.
The Zeta (Zero Emission Transport Accessory) attaches over the rear wheel
and is activated by a switch on the handlebars. Sinclair Research says it
can be strapped on almost any standard bike.
Sir Clive said the Zeta would be 'the next major breakthrough' in the
bicycle market, and that it can supply half the power needed for a 12-stone
person to go up a one-in-10 gradient at 10mph.
The Zeta, which weighs less than 10lb, transmits the drive by a
pulley-mounted belt. This minimises friction to prevent tyre wear, unlike
petrol-driven motors.
The rechargeable battery gives a range of one to three hours, or 10 to 30
miles. An overnight recharger comes as part of the package.
The Zeta costs Pounds 144.95 mail-order and will be advertised in national
newspapers this weekend. It is expected to be in the shops by the autumn.
In contrast, the Zike is a bike with a completely integrated electric motor
and battery. It costs Pounds 499 and has sold 2,000 since its launch in
1992.
Olympic cycle designer Mr Mike Burrows was sure there was a market for Zeta.
'It's for little old ladies in Hampstead who are a bit worried about getting
back up the hill,' he said.
'Serious cyclists wouldn't need it and kids will get bored with it and wreck
it in no time. But there is a market.'

FT  29 APR 94 / DTI threatened with inquiry over delayed EU payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative MEP is threatening to ask the European parliament to
investigate the Department of Trade and Industry's administration of a
European Union structural fund for customs brokers, who prepare customs
documentation for shippers.
The inquiry would be the first by the ombudsman's office, which is being set
up under the Maastricht treaty on European union. The ombudsman, who will
have wide powers to investigate EU institutions, will be appointed after the
European parliament elections on June 9.
Mr Christopher Jackson, MEP for East Kent, says there have been virtually no
payments from the scheme, set up in 1992 to help customs brokers to
diversify after the implementation of the EU single market in January last
year. European Commission documents show that Ecu30m (Pounds 23m) was
earmarked to finance diversification by EU brokers.
The DTI, which received just under Ecu1m, has paid out only Pounds 21,000.
Mr Jackson said the scheme was the worst example of poor administration by
the Commission he had seen in 15 years as an MEP. He added that the DTI had
delayed payments by imposing unnecessary conditions.
In particular, the DTI has required brokers to prove that diversification
costs have been paid before allowing transfers from the structural fund.
Mr Jackson says this breaches the regulation setting up the scheme, which
specifies 60 per cent of funds be paid in advance. 'It is clear that the
intention of the European parliament to get speedy help to customs brokers
is not being achieved. I shall be asking the Commission to prepare a report
and I am actively considering making this the first case for the new
European ombudsman,' he said.
Some brokers say the delays could force businesses to close. Spedimec, a
Kent broker which is claiming Pounds 110,000 from the fund, said it had
diversified into transport distribution, but had been forced to borrow to
keep the venture afloat. 'This project is definitely in danger. We have only
kept it going because we have put in everything we have,' a Spedimec
director said.
The DTI said there had been delays in the transfer of funds from Brussels,
and difficulties in communicating with directorate general V, the Commission
department which supervises the scheme.

FT  29 APR 94 / Housing benefit cuts drawn up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Social security ministers are preparing wide-ranging plans to reduce
spending on housing benefit and mortgage interest relief for low-income
groups, amid fears that the department's expenditure plans are overshooting
government targets for the current financial year.
Cuts in housing support - which would affect people on low incomes - could
be one of the main features of this year's public spending round.
Ministers believe housing benefit and mortgage relief paid through income
support are among the fastest growing elements of the department's budget -
nearly 15 per cent of the overall total of Pounds 85bn.
Attempts to curb spending in housing support could create a political storm,
and reduce the willingness of banks and building societies to lend to low
income groups.
Last year the government took initial steps to limit the amount of mortgage
relief offered to people on low incomes, lowering the ceiling for mortgages
on which such payments could be made from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 125,000.
DSS officials said yesterday that a further reduction in the ceiling was
being considered because of concern that some recently unemployed people
were receiving help with mortgages, while continuing to live in luxury
accommodation. Officials said the government was seeking ways to encourage
people to take out private insurance against job loss, rather than relying
on the state.
The department is also looking at ways to reduce the Pounds 8.8bn spent on
housing benefit, which goes to 4.5m people living in rented or local
authority accommodation.
People on very low incomes can theoretically have all their rent paid for in
housing benefit. Ministers are concerned that this pushes up the price of
private rented accommodation, and discourages people from looking for
cheaper housing.
They are looking at a variety of ways to reduce the housing benefit budget,
including imposition of maximum rents. Local authorities could also be given
a legal duty to find cheaper alternative accommodation for families.
The government's encouragement to people to buy their own homes makes it
politically difficult to reduce support if they become unemployed.
Banks and building societies might be less willing to offer mortgages if
they think people are less likely to receive state support when they are in
financial difficulties. This could restrain the recovery in the housing
market.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty over whether Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in
receivership, will be sold as a going concern is delaying the proposed
creation of an enterprise zone for the area, Chris Tighe writes.
A Tyneside zone 'in the event of substantial job losses' from Swan Hunter
was promised by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, in the Commons last
May.
He promised the government would 'urgently' examine possible sites for a
zone, a device used to help regenerate local economies by means of tax
concessions, exemption from business rates and a simplified planning regime.
About 1,400 of Swans' workforce, then 2,500 strong, have since been made
redundant by receivers Price Waterhouse and more jobs will go next month.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday a decision on the zone's
proposed area was unlikely until it was known whether Swan Hunter would find
a buyer.

FT  29 APR 94 / Wind farms win public support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey of people living near three wind farms in Wales has found that
nearly three-quarters would be prepared to see further development.
No fewer than 68 per cent of those interviewed said the wind farms had had
little impact on their area - in spite of the turbines being visible for up
to 15km (nine miles).
The survey was commissioned by the Countryside Council for Wales as part of
its evidence to an inquiry being held by the Commons Welsh affairs
committee. A total of 457 people were interviewed.
The positive attitudes to wind farms come as planning objections to them
have been increasing. Most interviewees felt the farms were neither
intrusive nor noisy, and at least half thought they were in keeping with the
countryside. Most hostility to wind farms was found among a 'control' sample
near Brecon, Powys, where there are none.
The survey included the National Wind Power site at Llandinam in Powys,
which is the largest in Wales with 103 turbines. The other two sites were at
Rhyd-y-Groes on Anglesey, and Llangwyryfon near Aberystwyth.

FT  29 APR 94 / Pre-pension executive salary rises rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executives should not be allowed to boost their salaries sharply just before
retirement in order to qualify for a larger pension, Mr Tom Ross,
vice-chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, said yesterday.
Speaking at the association's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Ross, a
partner at consulting actuaries Clay and Partners, said: 'I don't like the
fact that senior people have their salaries booted up sharply just before
retirement.'
He said the effect was to reduce the amount that schemes had available to
improve benefits for lower-paid workers, and such moves were never
sufficiently disclosed to shareholders.
Mr Ross outlined what he stressed was a personal view about how the
structure of pensions should evolve. He urged maintaining the basic state
pension at 15 per cent to 20 per cent of national average earnings instead
of allowing it to slide to roughly 7 per cent by the middle of the next
century. He also urged the creation of a separate earnings-related scheme,
in place of the state earnings-related pension, into which employers and
employees would make compulsory contributions. He advocated financing
improved state benefits by raising state pension ages to 75.
Meanwhile Mr William Hague, pensions minister, defended the government's
handling of personal pensions following attacks by conference delegates. Mr
Bill Day, national pensions officer of the GMB, the UK's third-largest
union, asked Mr Hague whether the government would consider making it a
criminal offence to mis-sell personal pensions.
Mr Day said that 10 days ago the GMB had set up a hotline for those who
feared that they had inappropriately contracted out of Serps through a
personal pension. The GMB has sent out 300,000 pamphlets to members about
personal pensions and has had 'loads' of calls from worried people, he said.
In only 25 per cent of cases has the GMB been able to reassure them that
they had made the right move.
Mr Hague said that the government was awaiting the results of a study by the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, to
complete a review into pensions transfers.
Separately, Mr Hague said that while the government was anxious not to
impose too great a burden on employers with its new regulatory framework for
occupational pensions, companies should expect some increased costs. 'It is
difficult when you look at the Goode committee report and its 218
recommendations to see how it could be implemented without some increased
costs.'
Asked whether the government would seek to lower employers' costs by
revoking a 1990 law requiring those with surpluses to use them first to
improve pension benefits, Mr Hague demurred. But he said the government
would address the so-called limited price indexation rules as part of its
overall white paper on occupational pension reform expected in June or July.

FT  29 APR 94 / Farmers reap home-baked benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only 9.30am and Mrs Chris Welch has already baked 72 cakes. As a
Hertfordshire farmer's wife, rising early and working hard comes naturally.
But when she set up her bakery business to save the farm from decline, it
meant a 2am start each day.
'I go to bed at 8pm,' she said. 'The children come and say good-night to
me.'
It was one of several sacrifices the Welch family made in building up the
bakery business from an annual turnover of a few hundred pounds to a
'six-figure sum' in five years.
Farmers are diversifying into everything from ostriches to steam railways,
bed and breakfast to corporate entertaining, and the trend is growing.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, yesterday urged more farmers
to consider new businesses as a way of boosting their income and relieving
rural unemployment. Nearly 80,000 farm-based jobs were already reliant on
non-farming activities. She said diversifying could ease some of the
problems associated with fundamental change in the industry.
The agriculture ministry last year abolished the farm-diversification grant
scheme, under which Pounds 8m was paid to 1,500 farmers. It said the scheme
had 'put diversification on the map'.
Farm-based accommodation accounts for Pounds 70m of farm output in England
and Wales and benefits the rural economy to the tune of Pounds 115m, Mrs
Shephard said yesterday.
Mrs Welch and her husband Ian, who benefited from a Pounds 3,250 grant in
1991, decided to diversify when expansion of their arable farm appeared
doomed by the approaching clampdown on overproduction in the 1992 reform of
the European Union's common agricultural policy.
'Our business didn't look as though it was going any further,' said Mr
Welch. 'We were looking for something which wasn't going to be governed by
Common Market policy.'
In fact, the reforms have so far been a boon to most arable farmers and the
Welches are now farming more land under contract. But at the time there
seemed an urgent need for a new outlet.
They knew from neighbours with farm shops that there was a market for
home-produced cakes and pies 'like Mum used to make', so they deliberately
set out to retain the farming image. 'To be successful you've got to be
unique,' said Mr Welch. 'We don't try and compete with Mr Tesco or even Mr
Kipling.'
The Bury Farm Bakery, outside Royston, now produces more than 1,500
home-made cakes and pies a week and employs eight women part-time. The
customers are mainly farm shops within a 25-mile radius of the bakery. But
just over a year ago the Welches won a contract to supply Neal's Yard - the
wholefood chain based in London's Covent Garden - and output soared.
The bakery has moved into a 100 sq m stable building that has just been
refurbished at a cost of Pounds 45,000.
Mr Welch's recipe for successful diversification is a dedicated staff and
good advisers, keeping overheads low - deliveries started 'out of the back
of an estate car' - and insisting on cash on delivery.

FT  29 APR 94 / Top four fund managers boost market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four-largest fund managers tightened their grip on the pensions market
last year and are now responsible for investing just over half of all
externally managed pension-scheme assets in the UK.
A survey from actuarial consultants Hymans Robertson found that the 'big
four' fund managers - Mercury Asset Management, PDFM, Schroder Investment
Management and Gartmore - invested 51 per cent of funds where an outside
manager is used. Five years ago they managed 43 per cent.
The top five fund managers accounted for 56 per cent of all funds externally
managed, up from 48 per cent five years ago, and the top 10 fund managers
invested 73 per cent of all funds, up from 66 per cent five years ago.
Hymans Robertson said the increasing concentration of funds in the hands of
the four managers reflected the fact that their performance had been
distinctly better than that of their peers. Also, the study found that
in-house managers tended to perform worse than the industry average of
external fund managers.
The consultants warned that performance-measurement statistics, which
trustees often rely on to help select a fund manager, may not mean what
trustees believe.
Performance-measurement statistics for each manager include some 'balanced
discretionary' funds for which the manager makes all the investment
decisions and some funds where the scheme trustees set the investment
strategy.
Hymans Robertson said: 'The performance measurers may have to create
sub-sets of their universes consisting only of funds which are unconstrained
and can properly be described as 'balanced'. This would allow those trustees
who wish to follow the perceived wisdom of the average manager to compare
themselves against a universe of similar funds.'
Also, when submitting the performance of their various pools for
measurement, managers do not include all their pools. By eliminating pools
with poor performance, managers could distort their overall figures.
The consultants found that for the top 25 managers in its 'universe' of
pension-fund managers, the proportion of their total balanced funds included
in the measurement statistics ranged from 25 per cent to 100 per cent of all
such funds.

FT  29 APR 94 / Mortgage lenders criticised by MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lenders yesterday came under pressure to spell out more clearly the
valuation and administration fees they charge borrowers.
A report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on residential mortgage
valuations said that the failure of some lenders to tell borrowers about the
administration fees that might be charged with valuation fees was distorting
competition.
It recommended that where lenders referred to valuation fees, they should be
required to specify separately any related administration charges.
However, the inquiry found that though there was a complex monopoly in
favour of a number of mortgage lenders, in most areas their practices did
not act against the public interest.
Among the lenders highlighted as not making clear the position on valuation
fees were the Nationwide, Woolwich and Alliance &amp; Leicester building
societies. All three said yesterday that they were re-examining their
practices.
The MMC inquiry began two years ago after complaints that lenders refused to
take valuations from independent surveyors and used only small lists of
approved valuers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said he had asked Sir Bryan
Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, to consult the Council of
Mortgage Lenders about issuing advice to its members.
Mr Hamilton urged careful consideration of the MMC's recommendations that
lenders should be ready to consider a valuation with a more extensive
structural survey by a surveyor nominated by the borrower, and that those
accepting only certain valuers should make this clear at the start.
The report was attacked by the Consumers' Association for failing to address
the need to give the borrower a genuine choice of surveyor.

FT  29 APR 94 / MPs urge flexibility in dividend payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday urged leading institutional investors to adopt a more flexible
approach to corporate dividend payments as part of a blueprint for
increasing long-term investment in British industry.
In a report on UK competitiveness, the Conservative-dominated Commons trade
and industry committee said pressure for 'consistent' dividends was 'an
example of the interests of institutions and companies (and the UK economy
as a whole) being in conflict'.
For institutions to insist on companies retaining the same dividend level
throughout an economic cycle was to treat companies 'as if they were banks'.
What was required was 'not consistent dividends but consistent investment by
industry'.
Questioned on a statement by one institution - M&amp;G Investment Management -
that dividends should not be cut because of temporary fluctuations in
profit, Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, said that
members thought M&amp;G should change its approach.
Yesterday's report precedes by about three weeks the government's
competitiveness white paper, expected to be published on May 16. Labour said
yesterday that it would shortly publish its own 'programme for industrial
competitiveness'.
As expected, yesterday's report recommended that the Department of Trade and
Industry should take over primary responsibility for training from the
Department of Employment as part of a government drive to give training a
higher profile.
'As long as funding for training is in the Department of Employment it gets
corrupted and distorted into being funding for unemployment,' said Mr Keith
Hampson, a Conservative committee member.
The report also called for consideration of a compulsory element of training
and some form of remissible payroll levy if voluntary training targets were
not met.
MPs proposed a series of measures to address short-termism in manufacturing.
These included:
Modifying the tax system to encourage scrip dividends.
Imposing 'limited' controls on hostile takeovers.
Making institutions' tax privileges conditional on locking in a proportion
of their funds with particular companies for long periods.
Among steps to improve financing of smaller companies, the report proposed
changing rules for life assurance companies to allow unquoted investments to
be valued in full, up to a specified proportion of assets.
The Trades Union Congress said the proposal for training levies was an idea
whose time had come.
But Ms Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors,
said: 'The conclusions . . . are rehashes of old ideas about the role of
government which is generally counter-productive.'

FT  29 APR 94 / Political pacts put away for the day: David Owen reports on
the council 'lovebirds' who will become election rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Crowhurst, a 77-year-old Labour activist who has trudged through
more local election campaigns than some voters have had hot dinners,
explains the position succinctly: 'When you are canvassing, you don't say
anything good about anyone but yourselves.'
Mr Crowhurst is one of a quartet preparing to go knocking on doors and
doling out window-stickers in north Portsmouth.
All over the city, groups of Labour sympathisers have been getting back into
the habit of campaigning against the Liberal Democrats after running
Portsmouth City Council in partnership with them for three years.
It is a position that will be replicated across the country with increasing
frequency.
Similar partnerships between two or more of the leading parties have been
springing up, especially at county level, in response to election results
that have left an unusually high number of councils under no overall
control.
Most observers expect more councils to be in this position after polling
next Thursday.
In this traditionally Conservative port, with its centuries-old ties to the
Royal Navy, activists from both the Labour and Liberal Democrat camps insist
that their innovative partnership has neither changed nor cramped their
campaigning style.
They say there are enough policy disagreements on emotive local issues such
as waste management and leisure facilities to enable them to campaign on
distinctive platforms.
The contest is given further edge by the residual mistrust felt by some
Labour supporters for Mr Michael Hancock, leader of the Liberal Democrat
group on Portsmouth council, and Hampshire County Council leader. Mr
Hancock, a former Social Democratic party MP, was once in the Labour party.
There certainly was not much evidence of partnership in the city's
distinctive guildhall on Tuesday, where the last council meeting before May
5 meandered towards its conclusion. The meeting was marked by good-tempered
but strongly worded exchanges between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour
group, headed by Mr Alan Burnett, the council leader.
'It seems once again I have to be the referee between the two lovebirds,'
observed Mr Ian Gibson, leader of the Tory group whose members kit
themselves out in blue-edged black cloaks at council meetings.
The Labour top brass admits, however, that there have been accommodations as
a consequence of the enduring Lib-Lab partnership.
'It has meant we probably have not been as hard on the Liberal Democrats in
our literature and vice-versa,' says Mr Brian Pope, the council's deputy
leader. 'You cannot knock their record without knocking your own. It is very
difficult to attack them on their voting records.'
Under these circumstances, Labour is bringing the record of the Liberal
Democrat-led Hampshire council into play. 'We point out it is a Liberal-led
Hampshire County Council that put up its share of the council tax bill by 13
per cent,' says Mr Burnett.
Politicians from both camps report a marked increase in the electorate's
understanding of the consequences of tactical voting, possibly as a result
of their co-operation agreement.
'Four or five years ago, tactical voting was a very hard message to get
across, but now people accept it,' says Ms Julie Spurgeon, a Liberal
Democrat councillor.
'People weigh up who has the best chance of beating the Tories,' says Mr
Pope. He draws a distinction between Labour's prospects at a national level,
where he thinks the party could 'win on its own', and Portsmouth, where 'in
the short term, I don't think we can'.
As a pioneer of the sort of arrangement now catching on in hung councils
throughout the country, the Portsmouth Labour group has come under the
somewhat disapproving eye of the party's leadership. 'Walworth Road were not
very enthusiastic to put it mildly,' Mr Burnett said.
But in this part of the south coast at least, the new-style Lib-Lab pact
appears to be an idea whose time has come.
'A lot of people say they like what the coalition has done,' says Ms
Spurgeon, using a word that still makes many Labour officials cringe. 'If it
hadn't worked here we would never have got agreement to do it in Hampshire,'
says Mr Hancock.
With Labour defending eight of its 15 seats on the 39-member council - the
Tories have 17 and the Liberal Democrats seven - the arithmetic suggests
that the council will stay hung after May 5. In such an event, most
observers expect the Lib-Lab partnership to continue.
Committee chairmanships are divided in approximate proportion to council
seats, with the other party taking the vice chairmanship, but the
arrangement is looser than it once was. A code of conduct - 'framed out of
naivety' according to Mr Pope - was discarded some time ago.
But Mr Burnett disputes Tory suggestions that the partnership has become
increasingly fractious and could be on its last legs.
'We have our ups and downs. I hope we can carry on next year. Walworth Road
has come to the conclusion we are not flagrantly breaking their guidelines.'

FT  29 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Revolutionaries storm the borough barricades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revolution seems to breaking out all over Camden, the ultra-correct Labour
borough which runs from Hampstead Heath to the council estates of Kentish
Town in north London.
Apart from the usual crop of independent candidates, three groups are
putting up candidates demanding independence or devolution for areas
including Hampstead, Kilburn and St Pancras. Helen Marcus, an opera singer
standing for Hampstead Charter in the Tory-held Frognal ward, says the group
is fed up with town hall bias against the borough's leafier northern areas.
The unrest started among council tenants, annoyed at maintenance problems,
and Camden Charter, in the south of the borough, may have the best chance of
winning a seat - one of its candidates came second in a Labour ward in the
last elections.
But the council has also produced a raft of highly unpopular parking
restrictions which have annoyed just about everyone. One group, in leafy
Primrose Hill, has even asked the High Court to quash the policy on the
grounds that it is illegally designed to raise funds rather than administer
parking. The council should watch out. The group is chaired by Mark Cran,
the QC who has appeared for Sony in its case against the pop singer George
Michael.
* * *
Jim Coxon, Conservative candidate for Birmingham's Billesley ward, is
anything but shy. Coxon warns in his election leaflets that a Labour victory
would lead to a leftwing council that would 'make Brent look sensible'.
Warming to his theme, he claims that Labour's 'loony extremists' are lying
low until after the election. He warns voters: 'Don't let Birmingham become
a laughing stock like Brent.' Only one problem: Brent has been
Conservative-controlled since 1991.
* * *
Theresa Stewart, leader of Birmingham's ruling Labour group, is also
fighting off the loony label. But Bernard Zissman, Brum's Tory leader, is
having almost as much trouble as Coxon in making the charge stick.
Zissman's line is that Stewart is a dangerous revolutionary who exasperated
Labour's moderates and fell out with the leadership during the 1980s. But
Stewart is the sort of woman you'd leave your children with. Nestling behind
her spectacles, she looks like an inoffensive granny who is really rather
surprised to be Labour leader. Anyway, she reads books in the bath.
Ironically, Zissman is less than convincing as the Tory rabble rouser. A
genial businessman, he belongs firmly in the 19th century Birmingham
tradition of commerce and council. Strange how politicians sometimes
misrepresent themselves as much as their opponents.
* * *
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, who is running the
Conservative campaign in London, is unpopular with some cabinet ministers
after the fuss caused by his recent musings on the quiet majority. But watch
out for further doses of rightwing philosophy.
On holiday recently at the sumptuous Gazelle d'Or resort in Morocco,
Portillo puzzled guests by spending most of his time by the swimming pool
writing reams of notes. Eventually, someone plucked up the courage to ask
him what he was doing. 'Preparing a series of keynote addresses I intend to
deliver in the summer,' replied Portillo. John Major, you have been warned.
* * *
What a shy lot Conservative MPs are. Most of them spend their working hours
lecturing the rest of us on the merits of the Conservative party. So why are
so few of them advertising the party's local election candidates in the
front windows of their London homes?
Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is the most prominent offender  -
no sign of Tory life in the windows of his Islington terrace. At least he
has the excuse that the Conservatives have a hopeless task on solidly Labour
Islington council.
No such excuses in fashionable Westminster, where the ruling Conservatives
are fighting off a determined Labour attack. Offenders include Jonathan
Aitken, defence minister, and Teresa Gorman, the hyperactive rightwing MP
for Billericay. All the fault of Westminster's local Tories, says Mrs
Gorman. 'They haven't given us any posters. I'll have to get some now.'
* * *
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, is often misrepresented by
opponents who claim, scurrilously, that he is less than popular with his
rank and file. So clearly untrue is this that Lib Dem eyebrows are being
raised in Kingston upon Thames, the London borough the party hopes to wrest
from the Tories. Ashdown told party workers he would campaign there on
Tuesday, two days before polling day. 'We told him not to bother,' says John
Tilley, leader of the Lib Dem councillors. 'He would make far better use of
his time by going somewhere else.' Mr Tilley has nothing against Paddy, of
course.

FT  29 APR 94 / Directors set out business manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Directors yesterday launched a 'business leaders'
manifesto' for the European elections calling for a wholesale reform of the
European Union's political structure, Jenny Luesby writes.
The IoD argues that the structure has led to a proliferation of regulations
that have held back European businesses.
The European Commission is responsible for initiating EU legislation but is
both undemocratic and unaccountable in that it is a bureaucracy rather than
an elected body, the IoD says. As a result it has 'every incentive to become
an activist lawmaker' without needing to consider the costs to Europeans of
that legislation.
Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers, which has the ultimate say on what
should become law, has little control over policy direction.
The IoD says the effect of this structure has been that the impetus in the
EU 'has been towards centralisation, harmonisation and adoption of the
highest-cost solution to economic and social problems'.
It adds: 'Investment, time and money have been diverted from profitable
business activities to regulatory compliance hampering the competitiveness
and dynamism of the European economy.' It estimates the costs of complying
with regulations at more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product.

FT  29 APR 94 / Call to freeze hospital cuts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A freeze on all bed and hospital closures in London was demanded by Labour
leaders yesterday as they sought to make dissatisfaction with the National
Health Service a central issue in next week's local government elections.
In the Commons Mr John Major, the prime minister, accused Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, of turning the NHS into a 'political foot-ball'.
The prime minister's charges were reinforced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
health secretary, who gave an 'absolute commitment' that health services in
London would only change for the better.
Mr Smith insisted that the Tomlinson report, on which Mrs Bottomley is
basing her policy of closures and amalgamations of medical institutions in
London, was now 'wholly discredited'.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour spokesman on London, insisted that 'the cuts must
stop before it is too late' when he launched an attack which accused the
government of undermining the capacity of the health services in the
capital.
He denied that his call for a 'genuine review' of what needed to be done was
a repudiation of the 'status quo is not an option' statement by Mr David
Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, when giving Labour's initial reaction
to the Tomlinson report.
Mr Blunkett was absent from the Labour front bench when Mr Dobson opened the
debate, and Mrs Bottomley suggested he had been 'binned in order to give Mr
Dobson a bit of pre-election Lebensraum'.
Earlier, Mr Smith had claimed that he had only been allowed to visit St
Bartholomew's hospital before the debate began after the prime minister had
overruled a ban imposed by Mrs Bottomley.
The prime minister's intervention swelled the media circus which accompanied
Mr Smith and gave an unexpected fillip to the campaign to avert the closure
of Barts' accident and emergency department.
Mr Smith said: 'This is one more example of the government's ability to
mismanage just about everything. The net result is that my visit has
received far more media coverage than it would have done.'
The hospital's 'magnificent' accident and emergency facilities served not
only the local community but the thousands who worked in the City.
Mrs Bottomley told MPs during the debate that the accident and emergency
unit at Barts was small and, as the local population fell, was becoming
'ever less viable'.
Mrs Bottomley said health spending per head in inner London was Pounds 553 -
46 per cent above the national average.
Inner London had more acute beds per person than the rest of the country and
twice as many consultants, she said.

FT  29 APR 94 / Worry on council election turnout dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnout in council elections is increasing in spite of the general belief
that the public is losing confidence in local government, research published
today shows.
Public attitudes towards local government are in fact no less respectful
than they are to central government, and there is general satisfaction with
local government structures.
The newly formed Commission for Local Democracy, an all-party think-tank
chaired by Mr Simon Jenkins, former editor of The Times, also found that
there was no consistent pool of 'non-voters', as some commentators had
claimed.
Research by Mr Michael Thrasher and Mr Colin Rallings of Plymouth University
suggested that the creation of local government 'one-party states' had not
had a negative impact on turnout, and non-voters in a particular election
frequently used their vote in another year. Council tenants, however, were
more likely to vote than owner-occupiers.
The research shows that the rise in turnout is made more significant by
registration officers' increased efficiency in compiling electoral
registers.
Councils where residents regularly turn out to vote in high numbers include
Rossendale in Lancashire, Richmond upon Thames and Stockport, but Newham,
and Barking and Dagenham in east London - both of which hold parliamentary
by-elections later this year - have consistently low turnout. Wigan,
Sandwell in West Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent and Hull also have low turnouts.
One concern raised by the commission was that among councillors, women,
younger adults and ethnic minorities were significantly under-represented.

FT  29 APR 94 / Portillo assails Labour record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party yesterday underlined the importance of next week's
local council elections in London by launching an all-out attack on the
record of Labour-run boroughs in the capital.
With only a week to polling day, the Tories produced an extensive dossier on
the policies of Labour councillors, claiming that they levied the highest
taxes, were the worst at collecting their rents and have run up the largest
debts.
Mr Michael Portillo, the minister in charge of the party's London campaign,
said: 'Labour councillors in London, as elsewhere, are more interested in
their latest politically correct scheme than with providing high-quality
services.'
He claimed that race and sex equality programmes in Greenwich had cost local
taxpayers Pounds 15m in one year alone, some 7 per cent of council spending.
Labour immediately hit back at allegations of over-staffing in their borough
departments. It argued that Tory councils had disguised manpower levels by
transferring staff to the private sector via compulsory competitive tender.
The party also rebutted criticisms of corruption in its councils, claiming
that 'Tory Westminster' was the 'biggest single corruption scandal in local
government'. A district auditor has claimed that the party wasted more than
Pounds 21m through an unlawful 'designated sales policy'.
Tory party managers hinted yesterday that they regarded the poll in the
London Borough of Brent as one of special significance. The party has had
overall control for four years and says that the controversial record of the
previous Labour administration has made the opposition unelectable.
'Under Labour, Brent was Britain's nightmare borough,' said Mr Bob Buckman,
the council leader.
However, Tory control is under threat since Labour needs less than a 5 per
cent swing in votes to take control.

FT  29 APR 94 / Council tax 'successfully implemented'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The council tax has been successfully implemented, but local government
reorganisation could yet make it as unpopular as the domestic rates, the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation says today.
According to a report by the social research organisation, replacing English
county and Scottish regional councils with smaller unitary authorities would
mean changes in the distribution of government grants and business rates.
These account for between Pounds 80 and Pounds 90 of every Pounds 100 spent
by councils.
Mr Tony Travers, a co-author of the report and director of the Greater
London group at the London School of Economics, said: 'Since local tax now
raises a comparatively small proportion of total revenue, any loss of
central resources could produce a disproportionately large rise in council
tax.' But the tax was broadly seen as fair, he added.

<TEXT>
Nissan's new import and export terminal on the Tyne, designed to handle as
many as 300,000 vehicles a year, began operating yesterday, Chris Tighe
writes.
A cobalt-blue Micra made at the Japanese carmaker's nearby plant at
Sunderland was the first vehicle to be driven from the 27-acre terminal on
to the waiting car carrier. The ship City of Sunderland - built in Hiroshima
because Nissan was unable to find a British shipyard able to construct such
a ship - left the Tyne four hours later, carrying Micras and Primeras
destined for the carmaker's Amsterdam distribution terminal which serves
northern and eastern Europe.
Her sister ship, City of Barcelona, is due to cross the North Sea today with
another 900 Sunderland-made cars. This weekend the first imports to the Tyne
arrive in one of the company's 5,500-car capacity ships.
Nissan, which last week won its third successive Queen's Award for Exports,
is the UK's biggest car exporter. Last year its exports were worth almost
Pounds 1bn to the UK. This year the Sunderland plant will export up to
180,000 cars to 36 countries, including Japan.
Until now most Nissan exports and imports went through Teesport. Winning the
business was a coup for the Port of Tyne, which built the terminal for lease
to Nissan.

FT  29 APR 94 / Cleaning deal is boost for job rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISS Cleaning Services, the world's largest cleaning company, yesterday
signed a landmark agreement recognising Unison, the UK's largest
public-sector union.
The move signals a shift in contractors' attitude to Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, known as Tupe. These
rules, where they are held to apply, oblige companies which tender
successfully for public-sector contracts to take on existing workforces with
unchanged pay and conditions.
Contractors have opposed the regulations, but acceptance that Tupe applies
is written into the deal with Unison.
Mr Martin O'Halloran, managing director of ISS, said the move would help
change the image of cleaning as a 'low-wage, low-quality industry'.
Mr Roger Poole, Unison assistant general secretary, said the deal was a
'major breakthrough' which would help create a 'well-paid, well-trained and
well-motivated workforce'.
Rival contractors are unlikely immediately to follow ISS by recognising
Unison. But the Clause 26 Group, which represents most of the largest
contractors, including ISS, also decided yesterday to change its stance on
Tupe. It told a meeting of Conservative MPs yesterday it was prepared to
accept that Tupe covered competitive tendering for local government and
health service contracts.
However, Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, director of Clause 26, said that in these
circumstances the government could only gain savings from competitive
tendering by adopting the more radical model used in France. This would
involve all contracts being awarded to external companies, although they
would use the same workforce. If existing managers wanted to maintain their
role they would be forced to set up their own companies to bid for the
contract.

FT  29 APR 94 / Names get Dollars 500m finance aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is putting the final touches to a new financing facility
designed to help relieve potential cash-flow problems of the syndicates that
underwrite business, and take pressure off hard-pressed Names, the
individuals whose assets support the market.
The facility will initially make Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) - and possibly
up to Dollars 1bn - available to syndicates, including those no longer
accepting premiums, from the end of September, it is hoped. The funds will
be secured against acceptable reinsurance recoveries on paid claims.
The money for the scheme is to be raised from a combination of bank debt and
five-year to seven-year bond issues.
A number of financial institutions are involved but have 'requested
anonymity until the final structure has been agreed', according to a Lloyd's
market circular. The institutions would provide funding initially for three
years.
Lloyd's said the scheme was similar to factoring, where invoices are
discounted. 'You are getting money up front for reinsurance recoveries which
take some time to emerge,' it said.
The initiative should make it less necessary for hard-pressed syndicates to
make cash calls from Names in order to meet medium-term financing needs. In
turn this should relieve pressure on the central fund, which pays claims
when Names are unable to meet their obligations. Lloyd's disclosed this week
in its latest annual report that more than two-thirds of the central fund
had been 'earmarked' to meet Names' unpaid obligations by the end of last
year. Earmarkings had risen from Pounds 354.9m at the end of 1992 to Pounds
661.6m at the end of 1993.
Pressure on the central fund is expected to increase this year after Lloyd's
announces its latest results for 1991 - in line with its three-year
accounting system.
Losses are expected to amount to more than Pounds 2bn, bringing cumulative
losses since 1988 to more than Pounds 7bn.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, is understood to have played a central
role in the initiative, but Lloyd's has delegated responsibility for
administering and managing the programme to Reinsurance Finance Management
(RFM), a company jointly owned by Trinity Square Services and the Randall
Group, two insurance services companies.
A new special purpose vehicle will be set up to receive the finance, acquire
the debts and receive reinsurance settlements. RFM, Lloyd's, and the
institutions will all sit on the supervisory board.
The money will be made available in US dollars, sterling and Canadian
dollars. Lloyd's said that the amount offered would depend on the quality of
underlying reinsurance recoverables due. Costs would compare favourably to
those available on the market.
The scheme will have no impact on syndicates' relationships with brokers.

FT  29 APR 94 / Glaxo closer to Zantac court battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo moved closer to a courtroom clash with one of its biggest rivals,
Swiss drugs company Ciba, by filing a lawsuit yesterday alleging patent
infringement by a Ciba subsidiary in the US.
Also named in similar suits were a Spanish subsidiary of Huddersfield
company Holliday Chemical Holdings, called Union Quimico Farmaceutica, and a
US chemicals distributor, Interchem Trading.
At stake are the fortunes of the world's biggest-selling drug, the ulcer
treatment Zantac. It has annual sales of Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.32bn) -
Dollars 2bn in the US alone.
Last month Ciba said it had found a way round the patents protecting Zantac
that would allow it to launch a cut-price generic - or unbranded - version
in the US by the start of 1996.
This case is unlike previous challenges to Zantac's patents in that Ciba
wants to manufacture a version of the drug which has never been
commercialised and whose US patent expires at the end of 1995.
In the past, Glaxo has not tried to defend this 'Form 1' patent,
concentrating successfully on the patents covering Zantac - made from 'Form
2'. Forms 1 and 2 are chemically identical but with different crystalline
forms.
One effect of the legal action will be to postpone regulatory approval of
the Ciba drug by 30 months. That period can be changed by a judge, but if it
stands it would have the effect of extending patent protection of Form 1
until October 1996.
Glaxo said: 'We believe that the patent rights on Form 2 have been and will
be infringed. This is based on evidence given to us voluntarily and in
confidence by Geneva (Ciba's generics subsidiary).'
Ciba insisted yesterday that it remained confident that its method for
making Form 1 did not involve Form 2 in any way.
However, Mr Robin Gilbert, a drugs sector analyst with stockbroker Panmure
Gordon, said the involvement of a non-Ciba subsidiary - Union Quimico
Farmaceutica - as the manufacturer might have weakened Ciba's position.
Colorado-based Geneva and its co-defendants have a further 30 days to lodge
a reply to Glaxo's action in a US district court in New Jersey.

FT  29 APR 94 / MoD criticised on costing of projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Audit Office has found that the Ministry of Defence is too
optimistic about the timing and cost of large defence projects.
According to the government watchdog's report, most projects miss their
budgets because of unforeseen technical difficulties or underestimation of
costs by the MoD. It concludes that the ministry should pay more attention
to the early stages of projects, to obtain a more accurate picture of final
costs. A particular focus of concern is mid-life updates of existing
equipment such as the Tornado and Sea Harrier aircraft, Challenger 1 tank
and Trafalgar class submarines. Here the MoD has underestimated the risks
arising from over-ambitious aims and over-optimistic cost estimates.

FT  29 APR 94 / Sweatshop pay rates anger Usdaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing number of businesses are taking advantage of the abolition of
wages councils to pay sweatshop labour rates, Usdaw, the shopworkers' union,
said yesterday.
A survey of 27 Jobcentres found wage rates for trainee hairdressers had
dropped to about Pounds 1 an hour.
One job for a trainee chef in Faversham, Kent, paid Pounds 35 for a 39-hour
week - 89p an hour. The people aged 16 and 17 at whom it was aimed were
expected to work split shifts and weekends.
A Cardiff store was seeking 'ambitious and motivated' shop assistants, with
three GCSEs, to earn Pounds 1.66 an hour for a 38-hour week.
Some of the poorest-paid jobs were in the retail sector. An adult assistant
at a butcher's in Bury, Lancashire, was offered Pounds 80 for a 40-hour
week.
Even jobs which expected high standards or unsocial hours offered wages at
much less than the minimum rates set by the former wages councils.
Two other features emerging from the survey were the absence of overtime
rates in low-paid sectors and the growth in jobs offering less than 16 hours
work a week, preventing low-paid workers claiming benefits.
'Many bosses seem to be taking full advantage of de-regulation to force down
hourly rates in some of the poorest-paid sectors of employment,' said Usdaw.
It feared that if cheaper rates became the norm they could force
better-paying employers to cut pay rates in order to compete.

FT  29 APR 94 / Lloyd's moves to calm fears on liabilities plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday moved to calm fears that the insurance market
may not have enough capital to set up NewCo, a reinsurance company into
which most of its US asbestosis and pollution liabilities would be
transferred.
Ms Heidi Hutter, director of the NewCo project, said she did not 'want to
play down the complexities of the capitalisation issue' but 'this should not
be a major source of concern for Names'.
Ms Hutter was speaking at a conference of about 300 Names, the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market, organised by the
Association of Lloyd's Members.
The insurance market announced that it aimed to transfer assets and
liabilities on policies underwritten before 1986 into NewCo last year.
Earlier this week an independent report claimed Lloyd's ability to obtain
capital for the new venture by discounting its reserves - taking into
account the value of future investment income - was limited. This is due to
the use by Lloyd's syndicates of so-called 'time-and-distance' policies.
These are reinsurance policies similar to investment contracts designed to
mature as pollution and asbestosis claims emerge.
The report said that as much as Pounds 2.8bn of about Pounds 4bn held in
reserve by Lloyd's was in the form of such policies.
Ms Hutter conceded that some of the reserves had already been discounted in
this way, but said she became 'impatient when I read suggestions that the
purchase of the T&amp;D policies has somehow left a hole in Lloyd's reserves'.
She added: 'We know that the market holds significant reserves that have not
been invested in time-and-distance policies and might therefore be
discounted without compromising the security afforded to policyholders.'
In addition, Lloyd's had other sources of capital available to it, including
the central guarantee fund, which pays claims when Names cannot meet their
obligations, and outside investors.
NewCo expects to reach a preliminary assessment of the market's assets and
reserves in relation to pre-1986 assets and liabilities later this year. It
aims to obtain approval for the new company from the Department of Trade and
Industry next year, in time for the company to begin operation in December
next year.

FT  29 APR 94 / Alarm bells ring for life insurers: Research into new
commission disclosure rules predicts extra costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The onus that will be placed on life insurance sales agents to volunteer
their commission is likely to lead to a 10 per cent drop in sales, according
to research published yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog.
This fall was classified as a benefit to consumers by National Economic
Research Associates, the economic consultancy which carried out the
research. Its report was released to coincide with the publication yesterday
of the final forms of the documents that all sales agents will have to show
to customers from the beginning of next year.
That classification of a fall in sales as a 'benefit' is likely to reinforce
the industry's suspicion about the introduction of commission disclosure.
The findings themselves could well set alarm bells ringing more seriously.
The findings suggest there will be:
Benefits to customers of some Pounds 800m a year in reduced charges, taking
account of reductions in commission of about 20 per cent.
About Pounds 100m a year less in sales, with the main impact felt through
direct sales forces and tied agents.
About Pounds 100m a year in benefit from a reduction in the number of cases
where policies lapse in the early years.
One-off implementation costs to the industry of about Pounds 100m, excluding
management time.
Continuing costs of Pounds 50m a year to the industry.
Extra operating costs of Pounds 500,000 a year for the regulators, which
would be passed on to the industry.
The consultancy conducted its survey earlier this year, interviewing 24 life
insurers, including two banks and a building society, six large groups of
independent financial advisers and two friendly societies.
It set the estimated costs and benefits against the background of what has
happened in the life insurance industry since 1980.
It noted, for example, that the average actual commission rate for matched
policies payable to independent financial advisers seemed to be some 30 per
cent to 70 per cent above the 1981 levels, with many tied agents - those who
sell the products of one particular life insurer - receiving significantly
higher rates. The overall reduction in commission rates, which it expects to
reach some 20 per cent by 1997, would represent a direct benefit to
customers of some Pounds 500m a year, but would still leave commission rates
higher than their levels before 1990.
The consultancy estimates that competition would also drive down the charges
for maintaining policies in a way that would benefit consumers by about
Pounds 300m a year.
In terms of reduced sales, the consultancy noted that total premiums in
respect of new business were more than Pounds 17bn in 1992, and that they
expected them to be significantly reduced, perhaps by one-tenth compared
with what they would otherwise have been, as a result of disclosure.
Noting that the cost both to consumers and to the industry was high where
payments for regular premium policies were not maintained, the consultancy
said it had taken the view that the disclosure plans would cut the 'lapse
rate' - of policies which are given up in the early years - by 2 percentage
points a year.
It also saw an unquantifiable but significant benefit in the impetus towards
the design and selling of more suitable products and the general increase in
competition as a result of the new regime.
The three main costs it identified for the industry in introducing the
change were the initial costs, relating for example to computer systems,
training and new-product literature; continuing expenses; and the
opportunity cost of management time.
While the overall conclusion was that benefits far outweighed the costs of
commission and product disclosure, the consultancy did make a few
exceptions.
The main one was the need to prepare information specific to the client in
the case of policies where the premiums were very small - where the premium
paid in a year is below Pounds 120.
This could cover much of the 'industrial branch' business, in which premiums
are collected on a monthly or weekly basis.

The US telecommunications giant AT&amp;T said yesterday it had won a long-sought
contract to sell its products and services in China, Reuter reports from New
York. It said the agreement would be 'worth billions of dollars over time'.
The company has won more than Dollars 500m in sales contracts in China since
signing a memorandum of understanding last year to explore opportunities for
a long-term partnership.
The deal signed yesterday in New York specifies what AT&amp;T will do to help
China upgrade its telecommunications infrastructure in six areas.
Mr William Warwick, chairman of AT&amp;T China, which was formed after last
year's memorandum was signed, said the deal would solidify the company's
role in the world's largest telecommunications market.
The company would not give a specific amount of the value of the new
agreement, which calls for AT&amp;T to invest more than Dollars 150m in China
over the next 24 months. It expected to triple its current workforce of 800
employees in China over the next couple of years.
One potential problem is the US government's impending decision whether to
extend China's most favoured nation trading status.

FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: US to plug holes in flat panel industry -
Louise Kehoe looks at a bold initiative for development and manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration's plan to provide about Dollars 700m (Pounds
479m) for the development and manufacture of flat panel displays represents
the boldest US industrial policy initiative in many years.
The goal is to create a new US industry, where virtually none exists today.
The Dollars 4.6bn world market for flat panel displays (FPDs), such as those
used in portable personal computers, is dominated by Japanese producers,
with a handful of small US manufacturers holding about 3 per cent of the
market.
The Clinton administration aims to start high-volume FPD manufacturing in
the US with federal funds, expected to be about Dollars 350m in the form of
research grant incentives to US companies or groups of companies,
constructing up to four FPD factories.
The proposals also call for continuing existing FPD research and development
programmes funded by the departments of defence and energy at about the
current level of Dollars 70m a year for five years.
The increased funding for FPDs reflects a consensus within the US
electronics industry that flat panels represent a 'critical technology' in
which the US is seriously lagging.
'The flat panel display industry is critical to US national and economic
security,' the American Electronics Association, an influential trade group,
said in a recent report which called for increased government funding.
FPDs are classified as a 'dual use technology' as defence contractors use
the displays in the cockpits of aircraft, tanks, ships and in command and
control systems.
The far bigger commercial market for FPDs encompasses portable computers,
consumer electronics and a broad range of electronic instruments.
Dependence on foreign suppliers has long concerned the Pentagon, which began
modest funding for display research in 1989. These concerns have been
exacerbated because US defence contractors have faced problems in obtaining
FPDs, according to US industry officials.
Japanese display manufacturers, geared to high-volume manufacturing of
standard displays for the computer and consumer electronics industries, have
apparently been unwilling to manufacture custom versions in smaller
quantities to meet the special needs of US military equipment manufacturers.
The US computer industry's interest in domestic FPD manufacturing was
fuelled when, in 1991, the Bush administration slapped dumping duties of 63
per cent on Japanese-made displays. Although these duties have been lifted,
their effects on the US computer industry has not been forgotten.
More recently, shortages of FPDs, particularly advanced colour versions,
have limited US production of popular portable computers and again focused
the US computer industry's attention on the issue.
Despite agreement that the US should have its own FPD industry, no US
company has been prepared to make the substantial investment required to
construct a high volume manufacturing plant.
'There are high barriers to entry in the FPD industry,' says Mr Peter Mills,
chief executive of the US Display Consortium, a group representing existing
US display manufacturers.
A single large scale FPD production plant is expected to cost about Dollars
300m and the complexities of the production process mean that even the best
Japanese manufacturers are said to achieve a production yield of only about
30 per cent.
Although demand for FPD's outstrips supplies and the world market is
expected to exceed Dollars 20bn by the end of the decade, display
manufacturing represents a high cost, high risk investment.
Attempts by existing US manufacturers to raise funds for expansion have so
far failed and large users of FPDs in the US computer industry have rejected
proposals that they co-invest in FPD production. Hence industry groups led
by the American Electronics Association have called for a new level of
'co-operation' with the federal government.
The Clinton plan for FPD funding is, however, controversial. By including
incentives for the construction of manufacturing facilities in its
proposals, the administration appears to be taking a significant step beyond
previous US government involvement in commercial activities.
Most prior US funding for industry has been in the form of either
procurement or research grants. One exception is Sematech, the US
semiconductor industry consortium established to regain US technology
leadership in chip manufacturing technology, which gets half of its annual
Dollars 200m budget from member companies and the balance from the defence
department.
However, even Sematech's activities are restricted to 'pre-competitive
research,' and in practice much of the consortium's spending has comprised
technology development grants to US semiconductor production equipment
manufacturers.
It is a measure of the changing political climate in Washington that when
Sematech was formed the US semiconductor industry backed away from initial
plans to include manufacturing in the consortium's activities, recognising
that this would not win the approval of 'free marketeers'.
It may now appear that the US is moving closer to an interventionist
industrial policy by providing incentives for commercial manufacturing
enterprises. Yet the private sector will retain the lead role, industry
officials insist. Grant awards will be subject to review by private sector
experts and recipients will have to provide at least half of the funds for
manufacturing ventures.

The US government is showering grants - to be matched by contributions from
private industry - on a wide range of industries, Nancy Dunne writes from
Washington.
Negotiations are still under way for shipbuilding subsidies, and congressmen
this week urged the passage of two grants for textile research.
The National Textile Centre, a consortium of four universities in textile
producing regions, last year received Dollars 9m (Pounds 6.1m). The Tailored
Clothing Technology Corporation, a consortium of businesses, labour unions,
government and academia was allocated Dollars 3.4m.
Congressman John Spratt, a South Carolina Democrat, urged the approval of
new funding 'because our domestic industry can only survive the elimination
of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement if it remains competitive on the world
market.'

<TEXT>
Gatt's subsidies committee yesterday agreed to establish an independent
disputes panel on a complaint from Brussels that the US breached fair trade
rules in imposing anti-subsidy duties on carbon steel flat products from six
EU member states.
The duties were imposed definitively last August on exports from, among
others, France, Britain and Germany. The EU disputes the US subsidy
calculations, such as the inclusion of payments to redundant steel workers.
The panel is the second to be established by the committee to investigate US
countervailing duties slapped on steel imports last year.
The duties followed a wave of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits filed by
American steel producers in 1992, after a voluntary export restraint
arrangement expired. Most, though not all, of the suits were later thrown
out.
The subsidies committee also adopted two panel reports, one on Norwegian
salmon exports to the US and the other on Brazilian milk exports to the EU.
However, an attempt by the chairman of the committee, Mr Ole Lundby of
Norway, to secure adoption of several much older panel reports met with less
success.

Westvaco, the New York-based US paper and packaging company, will establish
its first European plant in the Czech Republic as a springboard to markets
in central and eastern Europe, the company announced yesterday.
The state of the art packaging plant to be built at Svitavy, about 120km
east of Prague, will require an initial investment of Dollars 25m (Pounds
17.1m), but further investment will follow as business expands. 'We would
expect that amount to be doubled over the course of the decade,' Mr John
Luke, chief executive, said.
The plant will manufacture packaging materials and will be the first of its
kind in central and eastern Europe, Mr Luke said. Production will start in
late 1995.
Westvaco has had a sales and distribution company in Brussels for about 30
years, but this is its first manufacturing venture in Europe.
Following the opening up of the former communist countries several packaging
companies plan to move into the region leading to fierce competition. This
month, Austrian-based Mayr-Melnhof, one of Europe's top carton board and
packaging groups, raised Dollars 270m to finance acquisitions in west and
east Europe.

<TEXT>
Nine Venezuelan and international groups have been given the green light to
tender for Aeropostal, a government-owned airline to be auctioned off next
month.
Aeropostal, with domestic and international routes, is the first asset
offered for sale under an ambitious privatisation programme by the
three-month-old administration of President Rafael Caldera.
The Venezuelan Investment Fund, a financial agency in charge of
privatisation, said the groups prequalified for bidding on Aeropostal were:
British Aerospace/Avro International Aerospace; Air France; Iberia; American
Airlines; Continental Airlines; Aerolineas Centrales de Colombia; and three
consortia led by Venezuelan financial institutions (Banco Progreso, Banco
Itlao Venezolano/S F Profesional and Banco Union). Minimum price for the
airline would be Dollars 62m (Pounds 41.1m).
The Caldera administration has said 'accelerated' privatisation is an
important part of its economic recovery plan. But privatisation has been
delayed since March, when the first sale was originally set.
The previous government got more than Dollars 2bn from privatisations and
was set to auction Aeropostal and other assets. But political instability
that began with a failed coup in 1992 limited progress.
The Caldera government also plans to auction three electric power companies,
several hotels and horseracing tracks.

Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, has won an order from Japan Airlines
to supply it with up to seven 737-400 short-haul aircraft in a deal worth
about Dollars 280m (Pounds 191.70m).
JAL said the aircraft would meet its new domestic service requirements and
help improve local business prospects.
The 150-seat aircraft will be fitted with engines from GE, the US company.
The Boeing 737-400 is the latest version of the twin-jet with a high-tech
cockpit operated by a two-man flight crew. JAL expects to receive the first
aircraft in June.
Airbus Industries in Paris said that the European consortium, which has been
trying to increase sales in Japan, had not been invited to make a proposal
for JAL's needs. Airbus has a short-haul aircraft, the A320, and recently
won an order for 20 such planes from All Nippon Airways, Japan's second
largest airline.
JAL, however, has a history of buying Boeing jets. 'After an in-house study
of small-capacity airliners, the decision went to the Boeing jet, which fits
JAL's requirements regarding performance, operational economy and
reliability,' the company said.
JAL's subsidiary based in Okinawa has already ordered the Boeing 737-400,
enabling the two airlines to co-operate in parts purchases, maintenance and
pilot training.

Prospects of a peaceful solution to Yemen's political crisis appeared to
have diminished sharply yesterday with an assassination attempt on Mr Hassan
Makki, a deputy prime minister, and clashes between northern and southern
military units at Amran, 35 miles north-west of Sanaa, the capital.
Mr Makki, a supporter of northern leader Gen Ali Saleh, was shot while
leaving an emergency meeting of the ruling General People's Congress,
convened to discuss the latest outbreak of fighting between troops of the
former North and South Yemen. Mr Makki suffered two bullet wounds and three
of his aides were killed.
Northern and southern leaders have blamed each other for starting the battle
which broke out on Wednesday, a year after Yemen's multi-party elections,
the first held in the Arabian peninsula. The fighting, which continued
yesterday, is the latest in a series of clashes which have marred the peace
agreement brokered by Jordan's King Hussein and signed in February by Gen
Saleh and Vice-President Ali Salem al-Biedh, leader of former South Yemen.
Gen Saleh and Mr al-Biedh had jointly ruled the country following
unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990. But in August last year Mr
al-Biedh returned to his power base in Aden where he has since remained. In
September 1993 he issued a reform programme and demanded its implementation
as a condition of his rejoining Gen Saleh. Gen Saleh and Mr al-Biedh signed
a modified version of the programme in Jordan, but it has yet to be
implemented.

FT  29 APR 94 / Whites contemplate a volkstaat bolt-hole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID ALBINO and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
of many Capetonians, proud of the city's liberal traditions, they face the
prospect of becoming the nearest thing to a volkstaat, or Afrikaner
homeland, that the new South Africa can constitutionally encompass.
If the ethnic arithmetic is correct, Mr FW de Klerk's National party could
emerge, if not the majority party, at least the largest single party in the
Western Cape, one of the nine provinces which will have their own
legislatures.
Most of the province's 1.3m 'coloured' (mixed race) electors appear likely
to support the National party, the 658,000 white voters are divided between
it and the liberal Democratic party, and the bulk of the estimated half
million black residents support the African National Congress.
A city that saw itself as a bastion of liberalism will have Mr Hernus Kriel,
the outgoing minister of justice who now leads the party's provincial list
of candidates, as the regional premier. It was no accident that Mr de Klerk
chose to wind up his election campaign last Saturday with a rally in the
city, or that Mr Joe Slovo, one of the ANC's big guns, was sent to reassure
a coloured community clearly nervous about the prospects of black majority
rule.
On the face of it, Mr de Klerk won the day. The packed audience at the
centre was overwhelmingly coloured, and responded warmly to the National
party leader's appeal to them to return to what he called their traditional
home.
It was a poignant event, given the tortured relationship between white South
Africa and the coloured community. Despite relegation to second-class
citizens, and their eviction in the 1960s from District Six, their
historical home at the heart of Cape Town, much of the coloured community -
bound as kith and kin, and speaking Afrikaans as their first language -
seemed to have responded to Mr de Klerk's appeal.
In theory the Western Cape could become a cultural as well as political
redoubt of the National party.
And though in the new South Africa it is not always considered polite to say
so, many whites are starting to see the province as a physical bolt-hole,
one which they have no immediate intention of using, but are nonetheless
taking comfort from its presence.
The ANC, however, may yet take the Western Cape. It has the support of many
coloured voters, and - judging by the long queues outside polling stations
in Nyanga, Crossroads and other townships - the number of black voters may
have been underestimated.
These sad urban slums have become home to many thousands, if not hundreds of
thousands, of black settlers, who have come into the city environs since
influx controls on migrant labour were eased from the late 1970s.
Here, say optimistic ANC officials, is their heartland where there may be
enough support to confound the pollsters. These shanty dwellers were among
thousands of Western Cape ANC supporters who gave a huge eve-of-election
boost to the party's hope in the region by swamping the ceremony marking the
hoisting of South Africa's new flag in Cape Town this week - their cheerful
chants virtually drowning out the speeches at the ceremony. They underlined
the vigorous battle for control of the new province being fought with the
National party.
'This is a great moment,' said a jubilant ANC supporter. A white man next to
him expressed a different emotion: 'It's kind of sad to see that flag go.
It's got a lot of history behind it, not all of it bad. But we must look
forward.'
Predictions that the Western Cape could be the NP's stronghold appeared to
galvanise into action voters who massed at the polling stations in spite of
drizzle and chilly temperatures. Queues of enthusiastic voters up to three
miles long formed on Wednesday at Mitchell's Plain, a predominantly coloured
area outside Cape Town, where the National party sees strong support.
'I won't tell you who I'm voting for, but I bet there's going to be a few
surprises,' said Mrs Sophie Cupido, who had waited patiently since before
dawn.
In the suburbs on the slopes of Table Mountain, the queues contained voters
for a mix of parties. An ANC table, set up at a discreet, and legal,
distance from the polling station, was doing brisk business.
'We're not surprised by the level of support. It's to be expected. We're
confident of success,' an ANC official said.

FT  29 APR 94 / Oxfam warns of Rwanda genocide

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lives of up to half a million Tutsi in Rwanda are in 'grave danger,' the
British aid agency Oxfam warned yesterday, adding that the 'pattern of
systematic killing' in the central African country 'amounts to genocide'.
Only 30,000 Tutsi refugees had crossed the river which marks the
Rwanda-Burundi border, said Mr Maurice Herson, an Oxfam official. The
refugees had been attacked along the way, and some had been mutilated, with
their fingers or one foot cut off, rather than killed.
Refugees have told aid workers that local militias have systematically
hunted and killed people.
When violence first erupted on April 6, says Oxfam, it appeared that forces
within the Rwandan government armed and directed its youth militias to
attack the Tutsi and also Hutu liberals and opponents of the regime.
Despite calls by ministers in the new Rwanda government for an end to the
massacres, the militia have continued to slaughter Tutsi.
'It appears that the attacks are being incited and organised by powerful
political and military groups,' said Oxfam yesterday.

FT  29 APR 94 / Confusion and the miracle of KwaZulu
</HEADLINE>

   ULUNDI, KWAZULU

<TEXT>
At 3pm yesterday Mr Joseph Jiyane was sitting on a bench under a tree,
outside the empty KwaMame polling station over which he presides. Inside,
bored electoral officials sprawled in chairs or slept on benches, waiting
for the ballot papers without which voting could not continue.
This was a common sight yesterday in the KwaZulu black homeland, the support
base of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party.
KwaMame's story was typical: on Wednesday Mr Jiyane
had ballot papers, but had none of the stickers showing the IFP, virtually
the only party supported by local residents, which had to be affixed to the
ballots because of the party's late entry to the race. Yesterday he had
stickers but no ballot papers.
Though the Independent Electoral Commission said it had airlifted 100,000
ballot papers to Ulundi, capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland', none had reached
KwaMame, only some 20km away down a good tarred road, and no one could
explain why this was so.
As has become common throughout the three days of South Africa's first
all-race poll, explanations from the IEC were less than satisfactory.
Yesterday Mr Dikgang Moseneke, IEC commissioner, visited the Prince
Dabulamanzi polling station near Ulundi, and emerged to tell the press that
the station was using some of the new ballots delivered by airlift. But Mr
Peter Mohapi, presiding officer, insisted that this was not so, and said he
had complained to Mr Moseneke, a lawyer at the Pretoria bar, that new ballot
papers had not arrived.
It seemed, once again, that the IEC was either confused or had failed to
convey the real picture. So it is scarcely surprising that Mr Mohapi said he
thought there was 'something fishy' about the role of the IEC in KwaZulu.
But if the IEC largely failed the voters of KwaZulu, the same cannot be said
of the KwaZulu government, whose facilities were used shamelessly to ensure
IFP voters got to the polls, even if that meant travelling many kilometres
by KwaZulu government bus to find a polling station with ballot papers, IFP
stickers, invisible ink, official stamps and all the paraphernalia required
to make voting possible.
At Nsabekhuluma School, where Mr Henry Buthelezi, presiding officer, had
managed to assemble all the necessary materials, one packed bus was driving
away as we arrived, and another arrived soon afterward.
Voters came from distant rural areas, where ballot papers were scarce, to Mr
Buthelezi's polling station, situated in the Mhlabatini district which is
the seat of the large Buthelezi clan over which Chief Mangosuthu presides.
Passengers filed out of the buses and stood in rigid queues, clutching
KwaZulu government identity cards, waiting to vote.
Their quest for a polling station finally over, they could return home
knowing they had voted for the party of their choice. As Mr Buthelezi
pointed out, it was not too difficult to guess which that might be.
Gesturing over the high hills of rural Zululand, Mr Buthelezi said he
believed all the voters of Mhlabatini district would have voted, with the
help of some politically motivated bussing, by the end of the day.
But he doubted whether those in deep rural areas would have had the same
chance.
The extension of voting to today may permit them to do so. But it will have
been a long and unnecessarily frustrating process, for which the blame must
be shared between Chief Buthelezi for his tardy entry to the election, and
the IEC for its failure to organise in KwaZulu.
Still, matters could have been much worse: KwaZulu has been almost entirely
violence-free for the first time in months. That, in itself, was a miracle.

Thailand's expanding economy produced a 16.8 per cent rise in exports and a
12.4 per cent increase in imports in the first quarter, but Bank of Thailand
statistics yesterday show higher inflation.
Consumer prices rose 4.8 per cent in the quarter. The bank wants to hold
inflation at 4.2 per cent this year, against 3.3 per cent in the last
quarter of 1993.
The relative decline in Thai interest rates and a slide in Bangkok share
prices chased out 'hot money', non-resident baht accounts and portfolio
investments. More surprisingly, foreign direct investment showed no
recovery, after a 29 per cent fall in 1993.
Mrs Tanya Sirivedhin, head of economic research at the bank, said other
countries such as Malaysia had also recently been affected by a slowdown in
direct foreign investment, following generally slow growth in western
economies.
The current account deficit shrank slightly to Bt44bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the
opening quarter against Bt48bn in 1993.
Industrial production rose 8.5 per cent in the first quarter compared with
1993, below the central bank's target of 9.7 per cent for the year.

FT  29 APR 94 / Chinese tax reform 'collapsing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ambitious reforms of China's taxation system, introduced only at the
beginning of the year as part of Beijing's drive to re-establish control
over the economy, may already be failing.
Mr Gerald Segal, senior fellow of the International Institute for Strategic
Studies, said yesterday that reform of the tax structure had 'completely
collapsed'.
Mr Segal told a Financial Times conference on Asian capital markets that
Beijing had been trying for several years to regain power lost to the
provinces as a result of economic liberalisation, 'and each time they (the
central authorities) are made to look more and more foolish'.
The changes made in January included new tax-sharing arrangements between
the centre and the provinces, as well as a value-added and other new taxes.
However, mechanisms for central tax collection were not yet in place.
Introduced with financial and currency reforms, the tax reforms are part of
the government's plan to have better macroeconomic control so that the
economy ceases to swing wildly from boom to bust. They are also intended to
reduce the central government's chronic budget deficit.
Yesterday, Beijing received a welcome sign that attempts to slow rampaging
growth may be working, with news that annual inflation in big cities eased
in March to 24.5 per cent from 25.9 per cent in February.
'We have achieved initial success in curbing price rises, thanks to improved
market control at the central and local level,' the State Statistical Bureau
said in Beijing.
At the London conference, however, Mr Segal said both Beijing and the
provinces were complaining about implementation of tax reforms and there was
little sign of the new tax-sharing arrangements being put in place.
Mr Richard Margolis, managing director of stockbroker Smith New Court Far
East, agreed implementation of the new system had failed.
Mr Margolis felt the relationship between the centre and provinces would be
taken in hand after the eventual death of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's
89-year-old leader, as part of an assertion of control by leaders needing to
build political stock.
Mr C G Wu, general manager of the London branch of the Bank of China, a
state-owned commercial bank, said the tax reforms 'will definitely go
ahead', since they were a key part of government policy.
They would take time because of the amount of work that had to be done in a
country of China's size.
However, Mr Francis Leung, managing director of Asian securities house
Peregrine Investments, said many foreign investors were worried about the
effect of new taxes on their investments, particularly the property and
value added taxes.
'Such uncertainty, if not properly and immediately addressed, will adversely
affect international investors' confidence,' Mr Leung said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The African Development Bank needs a radical overhaul of its lending
policies, projects and internal structure, a panel of outside consultants
recommends, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
They give warning of the consequences if the 30-year-old bank fails to
reform. 'If not strengthened, it may end up by destroying itself. That is
the stark choice before the entire bank community,' says their confidential
report, submitted earlier this month to Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's
Senegalese president.
The 'task force on project quality,' chaired by Mr David Knox, a former
World Bank vice-president, began its study on Africa's premier lending
institution last August. The report blames both African governments and the
25 non-regional countries led by rich western powers who own 36 per cent of
the bank.
The report says the bank is 'pulled in all directions by conflicting goals
and attitudes of its shareholders' who are divided about its role and
policies. It criticises the way many of the bank's hundreds of projects are
identified, prepared and appraised. Highlighting an atmosphere of distrust
and uncertainty that pervades and weakens the bank, it calls for a rethink
of the relationship between the president and the boards of governors and
directors.
The Addis Ababa-based Economic Commission for Africa said yesterday it would
appeal to rich nations for Dollars 869bn (Pounds 577bn) to bring about
sustained economic recovery in the next decade.

A total of 32 white supremacists had been arrested in connection with an
election bombing campaign that has killed 21 people, South African police
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. But Mr Eugene
TerreBlanche, leader of the white extremist Afrikaner Resistance Movement
(AWB), said he expected more bomb blasts until Afrikaners achieved a
homeland of their own.
'We made another arrest late last night,' Police Colonel David Bruce told
Reuters yesterday. This followed a news conference on Wednesday, when police
announced the arrest of 31 men in a series of swoops. They also seized a
quantity of explosives, arms and ammunition.
Col Bruce said all those arrested were members of the AWB's elite
black-garbed Iron Guard (Ystergaarde).

FT  29 APR 94 / Li Peng tip-toes along the old silk route: China seeks wider
ties with Central Asia without ruffling Moscow's feathers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's premier, Mr Li Peng, trod carefully during his tour of ex-Soviet
Central Asia. He did not want to kick up any dust from the decades of
suspicion and rivalry between Russia and China. 'The idea is to reduce the
hostility, the perceived threat from China,' a diplomat in Alma Ata, the
capital of Kazakhstan, said yesterday. 'He can't do it in one visit, but he
is trying to start the process,' he added.
During his 12-day tour, the first by a top Chinese leader to the land once
called Turkestan, Mr Li has entered territory over which Moscow still claims
suzerainty. Until the 1920s the region was a nest of Chinese and Russian
spies seeking to undermine each other, but now there is little to suggest
that Moscow could be dislodged any more than Beijing could be unearthed from
Sinjiang.
Moscow, which has remained silent over the arrival and travels of Mr Li,
could be forgiven if it harboured some apprehensions about the Chinese
premier's visit, which ended yesterday. This is mainly because few
Sino-Russian observers believe Beijing has genuinely dropped its historic
claims to the region, where the Han dynasty ruled till the second century.
If anything, Mr Li's constant references to reviving Marco Polo's Silk Road
have only underscored China's interest, and growing influence, on its
western border.
'Li would be happy to increase Chinese influence here,' said a western
analyst in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent, Mr Li's first stop on the tour.
'Chinese leaders know that historically the countries on their borders have
the greatest opportunity to destabilise the mainland,' he added.
While appearing to want to demonstrate the opposite, Mr Li and his Central
Asian counterparts have displayed a mutual interest in China's recovered
regional influence.
Arriving in Uzbekistan last week, Mr Li was publicly feted and in
Turkmenistan he was asked - and agreed - to examine a plan to pipe the
republic's abundant natural gas to Chinese Turkestan's rich Tarim Basin, to
connect with a future 1,500-mile pipeline to China's east coast. In
Kyrgyzstan, Mr Li was presented with a horse and in Kazakhstan he was
treated like a delicate potentate, shielded from protesting Uigur
nationalists and from foreign journalists.
Everywhere, to Mr Li's gratification, he was assured that there would be no
support for the local Uigur nationalists, who claim responsibility for
repeated bombings in Sinjiang.
Russian commercial, military and political influence dwarfs all other comers
to Central Asia. But the ramifications of Mr Li's visit are sizeable. By
improving its links with China Central Asia is not placing all its hope and
trust in Moscow and the Russian economy.
Mr Li sees the same potential as the western investors who have flocked to
the region to exploit its huge oil and natural gas reserves. While Moscow
has made it clear that it expects to share the profit from exploitation of
the region's resources, for China the Central Asian nations could help
relieve a projected chronic energy shortage.
Now a net energy exporter, China is expected to become an oil importer by
the end of this year.
Thus, though the suggestion to build a natural gas pipeline from
Turkmenistan might seem preposterous, since routes through Turkey and Russia
are far nearer the sea, a second glance shows that it might not be so
far-fetched. After all, Turkmenistan must build an alternative to the
Russian pipeline that transports its natural gas - virtually its only
hard-currency source - if it ever is to gain some independence from Moscow.
Since Beijing plans anyway to build a pipeline from Tarim, China and Japan
are willing at least to consider an additional leg from Turkmenistan.
China, next to Russia, has become the biggest foreign trader in energy-rich
Kazakhstan. Last year Uzbekistan sold seven IL-76 aircraft to China - the
aircraft were made in the republic's huge Soviet-era plant - and Mr Li
expressed interest in buying more.
Mr Li and his entourage of 100 aides, journalists and businessmen have
trumpeted the tour as a way to showcase increased trade on the old Silk
route. And he has made it clear that he expects support in suppressing the
manageable Uigur rebellion.
But he also had a third, probably more important aim. A diplomat in the
Turkmenistan capital, Ashkabad, described his tour as an epitaph to the
former Soviet Union and Moscow's sphere of influence in the region.

FT  29 APR 94 / New line-up packs few shocks: Most key posts go to the PM's
own party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Born in uncertain circumstances, the cabinet formed by Prime Minister
Tsutomu Hata yesterday contained few appointments that might surprise or
disturb.
Most key posts went to members of the Shinseito, or Japan Renewal party, led
by Mr Hata and the former Liberal Democratic party political operator Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, who is thought to be the real power behind Mr Hata's gentle
facade.
With the departure of the Social Democratic party, Shinseito, which held the
reins from the start, has become the largest party in the coalition and won
eight cabinet posts, including those of chief cabinet secretary, finance
minister and international trade and industry minister.
Komeito, the Clean Government party, which is linked to the Buddhist Soka
Gakkai movement and has worked hand in hand with Shinseito, received six
posts as its reward. They include Posts and Telecommunications, Transport
and Construction.
Of particular interest to the international community will be the new
foreign minister, Mr Koji Kakizawa, head of the seven-member Jiyuto (Liberal
party), which recently joined the coalition after defecting from the Liberal
Democratic party.
Judging from his personal history, Mr Kakizawa (at 60 he looks at least 10
years younger) seems a natural choice for the post. He entered the Ministry
of Finance straight out of Tokyo University's economics department, a
beginning that virtually guarantees a shining career in status-conscious
Japan.
During his years as a bureaucrat, Mr Kakizawa, who speaks both French and
English, trained at the French Finance Ministry and served at the Japanese
embassy in Belgium. His contribution to Franco-Japanese friendship (he
happens to be a wine lover) brought him the Legion d'Honneur in 1989.
He entered politics in 1977 when, ironically, he ran for a seat in the Upper
House, under the banner of the New Liberal Club, headed by Mr Yohei Kono, at
present leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats. He won that seat and has
since been elected five times to the Lower House.
As a politician, Mr Kakizawa has directed his talents toward foreign
affairs. As parliamentary vice-foreign minister, a post he kept until last
year, he paved the way for deployment of Japanese UN peacekeepers in
Mozambique and acted as right-hand man to Mr Michio Watanabe, then foreign
minister.
His closeness to Mr Watanabe, known for his right-wing tendencies, indicates
his views are likely to be in line with those of Mr Ozawa, the brain behind
the coalition's policy.
Similarly politically correct is Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, former trade minister
and Shinseito member, who has become chief cabinet secretary.
Mr Kumagai, a career bureaucrat before turning to politics, kept a fairly
low profile as trade minister but is far from lacking in force.
He caused an uproar as trade minister when he unexpectedly sacked a senior
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry for promoting
another bureaucrat who was planning to run for parlia-ment.
Mr Kumagai is also known as being more vocal than most about Japan's need to
deregulate. As trade minister he was not afraid to stand up for Japan in its
confrontations on trade with the US.
The man who replaces Mr Kumagai at trade has more of a reputation for tact.
Mr Eijiro Hata, also from Shinseito, was at the helm of the Agriculture
Ministry during one of its most turbulent years, when Japan finally agreed
to open up its rice market to imports and was forced at short notice to let
in imported rice due to a shortage caused by cold weather.
If Mr Hata's career history is any guide, the Trade Ministry might expect
some changes. Known for his forward-looking approach, Mr Hata was
instrumental in the privatisation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1985
when privatisation was not the trend it is today.
Also of note is the appearance in the cabinet of Mr Kunio Hatoyama as labour
minister. A former education minister, Mr Hatoyama comes from one of the
most blue-blooded families in Japanese politics.
His great-grandfather was a former Lower House speaker, while his
grandfather was prime minister in the 1950s. His brother is a Lower House
lawmaker who once served as deputy chief cabinet secretary.
Other members of his family include former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
and a former minister of education. Outside politics, other family members
include an honorary chairman of Daiichi Kangyo Bank and a nationally-famous
composer.
But Mr Hatoyama, 45, does not need to rely on the fame of his relatives. As
education minister he unleashed a heated nationwide debate by proposing to
scrap private business exams which he felt encouraged excessive competition
among schoolchildren.

FT  29 APR 94 / Conservatives dominate Hata's ministerial team: Surprise
appointment of recent LDP defector
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday produced a
conservative-dominated minority cabinet, unlikely to last more than a few
months in the absence of his former socialist allies.
Japan's new administration will bring little change to the former Hosokawa
government's policies of economic deregulation, tax and political reform,
the search for a solution to the US trade dispute and a commitment to follow
any United Nations action against North Korea, according to the new team
members' first pronounce-ments.
The line-up is dominated by the partnership of the Japan Renewal party and
the Buddhist-backed Komeito clean government party, which together hold 14
of 21 cabinet seats. Of the top jobs, the prime ministership, the chief
cabinet secretary's job plus the finance, international trade and industry
and home affairs ministries are held by Mr Hata's own JRP, with eight
cabinet posts.
One surprise is the appointment of Mr Koji Kakizawa, who defected from the
Liberal Democratic party only last week, as foreign minister, the job Mr
Hata held in the last government. Mr Kakizawa - who is respected for running
the foreign ministry well as deputy to an ailing Mr Michio Watanabe, former
foreign minister - is a keen advocate of Japanese full time membership of
the United Nations Security Council.
The line-up otherwise reflects the weight of JRP and Komeito in a diminished
coalition. Only five parties are represented in the new cabinet, following
the walk-out of the Social Democratic party on Tuesday, over the formation
of a centre-right voting bloc, called Kaishin, or Innovation. Four members
of the old cabinet keep the same jobs.
Mr Hata, Japan's sixth prime minister in the past seven years, is thought
likely to last even less long than his predecessor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
who held on for eight months.
The SDP has promised to help him put this year's budget through parliament,
but has warned that it might call a vote of no confidence afterwards.
According to Japanese news reports, the SDP is about to launch an inquiry
into the finances of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, Mr Hata's political mentor, deputy
leader of the JRP and an influence in the birth of Kaishin.
For the time being, Mr Hata aims to bring as much normality to government as
possible with the first minority administration since that of Mr Ichiro
Hatoyama in 1955, and the weakest in post-war history.
With the cabinet now in place, Mr Hata's first important official task is
likely to be a visit to Italy, France and Germany next week. The tour,
during a a Japanese holiday period, was originally scheduled for Mr
Hosokawa, was intended to cement European relations before the group of
seven summit in Naples in July.
On his return, Mr Hata plans to deliver his first policy speech to
parliament on May 10, paving the way for debate on the budget, to beginning
in mid-May.
The government agreed to a stop-gap budget from the beginning of the fiscal
year in April, after the opposition boycotted proceedings to put pressure on
Mr Hosokawa to come clean over the financial allegations which eventually
brought his resignation on April 8.
Final agreement on the budget will take a some weeks, so most analysts are
bargaining that the next round in Japan's internal political battles will
take place some time in June, possibly leading to an election.

FT  29 APR 94 / Tokyo policy on Iran seen as being naive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The revelation that Iran may have been training Japanese terrorists to
conduct assassinations in Europe and the US will produce acute embarrassment
in Tokyo.
The discomfit is caused not merely because members of the Japanese Red Army,
one of several left-wing terrorist groups which burst onto the international
scene in the 1970s, might be planning attacks in western cities, but because
of Japan's controversial policy of courting Iran with aid and finance.
The warnings yesterday by the US and UK governments that Iran must halt its
apparent support for terrorist groups will put pressure on Tokyo to review
its own policies towards that country, which have been based on the idea
that it is assisting moderates in Tehran.
This justification for Japan's policy, formulated by Mr Kunihiko Saito, a
permanent foreign vice minister and former ambassador in Tehran, is that the
moderate and technocratic faction in the Iranian government is being led by
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. This faction, argues the foreign
ministry, wants to develop economically - and therefore socially and
politically - and should be encouraged.
Japan's western allies believe the Japanese foreign ministry is being naive.
They say no evidence exists that President Rafsanjani opposes state
sponsorship of terrorism. Indeed, they insist he in fact heads the top-level
Supreme National Security Council which orders executions.
The Tokyo policy, motivated, at least in part by Japan's desire to secure
adequate energy for a country that has almost no natural energy resources,
has included providing Tehran with much needed aid and finance. During late
1992, Tokyo, in spite of western reproaches, resumed aid to Iran, and the
following May released Y38.8bn (Pounds 255m) for the Karun Dam project. A
second tranche is due to be provided shortly.
Last month, in a separate move, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran
announced Tehran had arranged the final details necessary to reschedule
Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.57bn) in loans from Japan. The terms allowed a grace
period of 24 months and the loans would be repaid over the following three
and a half years.
Both the US and Britain have been anxious to prevent Tehran rescheduling its
short-term debt as a means of bringing pressure to bear on Iran and its
shaky economy which has been crippled by the Iran-Iraq war and the low price
of oil.
They hope solidarity among the G7 on terrorism and the case of Mr Salman
Rushdie, the author of the controversial work, The Satanic Verses, should
help force a change in Iran's policies.
Western diplomats are bewildered by the Japanese policy, particularly as
they believe Japan has suffered from Iranian-inspired terrorism. In July
1991 Professor Itashi Igarashi, the Japanese translator of Mr Rushdie's
book, was murdered.
Japanese police believe the assassination was the work of trained assassins
from Vevak, the Iranian ministry of intelligence and security headed by Mr
Ali Fallahian. The Iranian embassy in Tokyo provided logistical support for
the killers.
In addition, say western diplomats, the North Korean missile programme
threatening Tokyo is being developed with Iranian money and technical
co-operation.
North Korea's Rodong-1 missile is being tested in Iran, for example.
Western governments are clearly anxious to use the latest revelations to
bring pressure to bear on Tokyo.
However, the foreign ministry in Tokyo yesterday insisted it had not so far
seen any conclusive evidence of Tehran's involvement in state-sponsored
terrorism. If the British government could provide clear evidence,
appropriate action would be taken, it added.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK terror claim underlines prickly relations: Roger Matthews
reports on some of the contradictions of Iranian foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's accusation yesterday that Iranian intelligence agents had been in
contact with the IRA will lengthen the already long shadow hanging over
relations between the two countries. It also serves to underline the
complexity of maintaining links with Iran, which often appears to be
pursuing contradictory foreign policy aims.
Officially, Iran wishes to improve its contacts with Britain and with most
other industrialised nations. Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the senior Iranian
diplomat in London, said after being summoned to the Foreign Office
yesterday the meeting had been very friendly. 'I was informed about their
concern', he said. 'I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact with
my country - definitely it is not right.' Mr Ansari is often seen at
diplomatic receptions in London, smiling, affable, and presenting the face
of Iran which is in line with official policy.
But a visit to Tehran serves as a reminder that Iranian policy also remains
committed to the export of the revolution and to offering assistance to
'oppressed Moslems' throughout the world. Officials deny there is anything
sinister in this ambition. Words are our bullets, they say, stressing that
many Moslems look to them for guidance. How those people choose to pursue
their own domestic political struggles is a matter for them to decide.
Similarly, they say, Iran cannot stand by when Islam is blasphemed, as was
claimed the case with British author Salman Rushdie. Mr Javad Larijani,
foreign policy adviser to President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in an
interview last year that to withdraw the fatwa condemning Mr Rushdie to
death would be like disowning Islam and the Koran.
'The withdrawal of the fatwa is not the sort of condition which British
politicians should put on relations with Iran. It is quite unreasonable',
said Mr Larijani. Britain has been equally adamant that full diplomatic
relations could not be restored with Iran unless the fatwa was lifted.
British officials add privately that at the very least they need assurances
from Iran that no attempt will be made to carry out the fatwa, which was
issued originally by the late Ayatollah Khomeini in February 1989. But in
the absence of a single central authority in Tehran such an assurance would
lack credibility, especially as the Iranian regime continues to pursue
policies in the Middle East which are fundamentally opposed to British and
other western interests.
Iran, for example, is totally against the peace process under way between
Israel, its Arab neighbours and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is
the main supporter of Hizbollah, the radical Shia faction in Lebanon, and
would welcome an Islamic government in Algeria. Officials in Tehran find
nothing contradictory in pursuing such policies while also seeking to
establish a better working relationship with Britain. For them it is a
matter of the British coming to terms with the reality of the Islamic
republic.
However, the accusation of links with the IRA can but lend support to US
assertions that Iran should be shunned by the international community
because of its links with terrorist organisations and alleged attempts to
secure a nuclear weapons capacity. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, was quick yesterday to express his anger at 'the continued terrorism
projected by Iran' and to urge other countries against offering any economic
assistance to Tehran.
Guilty or not, Tehran is sure to seek popular support by presenting the
British charges as evidence of further western attempts to undermine the
Islamic government, and probably as an attempt to distract international
attention from what is happening to the Moslem community in Bosnia. It is an
interpretation which will be comfortably accepted by many Iranians,
including those who did not support the revolution. Such people, steeped in
conspiracy theories, continue to believe that the UK helped to topple the
Shah in 1979, and claim that if anyone lifted up Ayatollah Khomeini's beard
they would find stamped the words 'Made in Britain'.

Claiming to defend minority Catholic population in Northern Ireland,
'volunteers' have continued campaign of violence against majority
Protestants, security forces, commerical targets and members of British
political establishment.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent years, developed sophisticated structure of command aimed at
minimising risk of infiltration, and strengthened itself financially
and militarily with support from Middle East and US and series of
illicit business enterprises in Ireland and UK.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Believed to have hard core of several hundred trained terrorists with
several thousand sympathisers. Political wing, Sinn Fein, campaigns
in democratic elections on both sides of the Irish border.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Carried out series of bombings in Tokyo, one in busy Ginza district
killing eight, injuring 385; involved in bloody hijackings culminating
with seizure of Japan Air Lines aircraft in Kuala Lumpur.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
After 1977, group disappeared until 1986, when, at time of Tokyo G7
summit, home-made rockets were fired at Japanese embassy in Jakarta,
though no one hurt. Then implicated in series of attacks in Europe and
Middle East.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Member indicted last year for 1988 bombing of American United Services
Organisation club, Naples, which killed five and injured 18.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Japanese Supreme Court recently upheld death sentences on two leaders
for 15 murders.

<TEXT>
Japan's Management and Co-ordination Agency said the country's unemployment
rate in the year to March stood at 2.6 per cent, up 0.4 percentage points
from the previous year, and the highest level in seven years, news agencies
reported from Tokyo.
Meanwhile, housing starts fell for the first time in 22 months in March,
dropping 0.7 per cent from the year before to 118,852 units, the
construction ministry said.
In a separate report, the labour ministry said the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of labour demand, fell last fiscal year to 0.71
from 1.0 in the previous year to March.
The figure means that were 71 jobs for every 100 people seeking employment.
In March, the jobless rate stayed flat from the previous month to a
seasonally-adjusted 2.9 per cent, but the agency indicated that the demand
for workers in some industries remains weak.
The decline in housing starts, which came in spite of a rise in starts on
owner-occupied homes and houses for sale, came from a decline in starts of
rental houses, the ministry said. In February, housing starts were up 6.3
per cent.
Starts on owner-occupied homes increased 2.9 per cent to 42,516, rising for
the 10th month in a row. Those on houses for rent declined 18.9 per cent to
43,258, falling for the second straight month.
In the year to the end of March, construction starts grew 6.3 per cent from
the year before to 1,509,787, rising for the second straight year.
Starts for owner-occupied homes rose 11.5 per cent from the previous year to
536,908, up for the second year in a row.
Construction of houses for rent declined 5.1 per cent to 651,563, showing a
turnaround from an 18.0 per cent rise in the previous year.

FT  29 APR 94 / Intelligence points to IRA-Iran drug connection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, DAVID OWEN and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA has been drawing on financial support from Iran, possibly linked to
drugs transactions, and may have been on the verge of securing a large arms
shipment.
This information, gathered by intelligence agencies, including Britain's
MI6, appears to be behind the decision by the Foreign Office yesterday to
warn the Tehran government to desist from further contacts with the Irish
terrorist organisation.
British officials insist they had no alternative to taking yesterday's high
profile action because of the firm nature of the information gathered.
Although some money is believed to have been exchanged between Iran and the
Irish Republican Army, the action was largely pre-emptive and designed to
stop the links from strengthening.
UK intelligence has been monitoring political links between the IRA and
Tehran since the early 1980s.
Recently the suspicion has grown that the IRA may have been aiming to secure
financial and military support from Tehran as an alternative to Libya, which
has been a main supplier of weapons and explosives.
The tilt towards Tehran follows intense efforts by the FBI and UK security
forces to stop funding and logistical support from the US, and a crackdown
on racketeering in Northern Ireland linked to the IRA.
Yesterday's announcement follows the recent arrest in Greece of two German
subjects allegedly linked to a drugs operation involving the IRA and the
Middle East.
The latest disclosure comes at a particularly sensitive time in Northern
Ireland, with violence again on the increase and the main political parties
in the province - including the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein - gearing up
for the European election. This will inevitably be seen in Northern Ireland
as a referendum on the Anglo-Irish peace initiative.
According to observers, there would be few more effective ways of
undermining support for Sinn Fein in advance of this crucial poll than by
linking the IRA to drug trafficking.
Republican leaders have traditionally been careful to disassociate
themselves from drug-related crime and have frequently resorted to gun law
to punish alleged traffickers.
Earlier this week the IRA killed one alleged dealer and injured 16 others in
an offensive whose timing was felt by observers to have been heavily
influenced by the election.

FT  29 APR 94 / Venezuela appoints bank chief to head off crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who has had extensive experience as chief
financial officer in Venezuela's oil industry, was appointed last night by
President Rafael Caldera to be the president of the country's central bank.
Mr Casas, who is currently representing Venezuela's national oil company
PDVSA in London, takes over the bank during a crisis of confidence. Mrs Ruth
de Krivoy quit as chief executive last Tuesday as she felt the executive
branch was trying to compromise its autonomous status.
Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government has proposed cutting its bloated state
payroll by giving shares in state-owned companies to government employees
who leave their jobs voluntarily or are made redundant.
Under the plan, the government would pay for employees' severance benefits
with shares in PDVSA, and the CVG heavy industry group, which includes
steel, aluminium, iron ore and hydroelectric power interests.
Mr Asdrubal Baptista, state minister for reform of the economy, in a speech
on Wednesday reaffirmed the Caldera administration's intention of 'opening
up new spaces for private investment,' especially in the petroleum sector
and in CVG. Mr Baptista touched on a previously taboo topic, saying domestic
prices for petrol and refined products must rise.
Under Venezuelan law, both the government and private companies are obliged
to set aside financial reserves for employees' severance benefits.
In the government's case, revenues will never be sufficient to cover these
reserves, so far thwarting plans to make big reductions in Venezuela's 1.1m
government workers.
Private businessmen said the plan to offer shares as a severance benefit
could resolve a sizeable government problem, but would also reward employees
who are generally considered less efficient than private sector workers.

FT  29 APR 94 / Lula wins hearts, minds, not the media: Brazil's
presidential frontrunner evokes a mixed response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of Brazil's left-wing Workers' Party
(PT) and frontrunner for president in October's elections, visited the
sleepy coastal town of Sao Luis earlier this month hoping to grab headlines
with his plans for agricultural reform and improved social welfare.
Instead, the Estado de Maranhao, a conservative local newspaper, printed a
storming editorial against the PT's liberal attitude to homosexuality and
its calls for easier access to abortions, a sometimes sensitive but never
national issue.
It was a strange choice of topic in a country with one of the world's most
unequal income distributions and as many as 30m people suffering real
hardship and hunger.
But the incident highlighted Mr da Silva's election problems. He faces a
largely hostile media, mainly controlled by the right and business
interests. Although Mr da Silva is a moderate, the media and his opponents
are playing on the public's perception that his party is filled with
radicals who threaten to shatter Brazil's consensual politics with
controversial change.
Mr da Silva, usually known as Lula, is leading his nearest rival, Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister, by 35 points to 20 in
most polls. A former metalworker and unionist, Mr da Silva helped found the
PT as Brazil emerged from the harshest period of military dictatorship at
the end of the 1970s. An amiable man with a liking for Cuban cigars, his
biggest political assets are his rousing oratory and bridging role between
the different wings of the PT.
Recently, he appears to be winning an argument within the party to present
an electorally acceptable rather than ideologically correct manifesto.
Recently, he and other moderates defeated calls for a PT government to
declare an immediate moratorium on the country's foreign debt.
The PT's draft manifesto, still subject to further discussion, is remarkably
thorough and details the party's proposed policy on subjects ranging from
farm subsidies to road deaths. It is an unusual document in Brazil, where
politicians usually offer little except vague but tempting promises.
The document is also full of good ideas to reform the bankrupt state, reduce
corruption and tackle poverty. It includes policies which might normally be
associated with the right, for example government decentralisation and
reduced resources for the state.
There are also sections which will be less appealing to business interests
and foreign investors. The document calls for a freeze on privatisation and
introduction of potentially expensive minimum wage laws. However, private
investment in key sectors such as telecommunications will be allowed, so
long as the state retains overall control.
Mr Alozio Mercadente, a close adviser to Mr da Silva and a possible finance
minister, says the party would concentrate on four areas: reducing hunger,
improving education, starting rural reform and creating jobs. 'This is not
an ambitious programme, but it is incredible that a society like ours can
end the century talking about basic problems like hunger,' he says.
The PT's policies are regularly criticised by its opponents as too expensive
for a developing country like Brazil. There are doubts that PT pledges to
more than double education spending to 10 per cent of GDP are feasible, even
over the medium term. Mr Mercadente says precise spending and budget
projections will not be ready until later this year.
But he says the programme will be bankable, and will be paid for by better
public spending and - in another policy idea reminiscent of the right -
fewer taxes but better tax collection.
Mr da Silva is especially vulnerable to charges that the PT lacks experience
in government, although it is gaining local government experience and making
impressive changes. In Diadema, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo under PT
control since 1982, infant mortality has fallen from 92 to 20 per 1,000 due
to healthcare improvements. The number of health workers has increased from
300 to 1,800. Violence is decreasing and there are less than five murders a
week compared to five a day 10 years ago.
In the lobster fishing village of Icapu in Ceara state, eight years of PT
rule have cut illiteracy by more than half. Money which used to disappear in
expensive public works and corruption is now being used to improve services.
These changes were introduced by a simple, but in Brazil still rare, method
of local democracy. Budgets and spending plans were discussed with the
community and different priorities assessed. According to Mr Jose Airton,
recently re-elected mayor, the aims were popular participation, government
transparency and decentralisation. 'These ideas can be applied anywhere in
Brazil. There is no secret, it's simply the will to work with the
population,' he said.
However, there have been setbacks, including disappointing PT governments in
Sao Paulo and Fortaleza, while Icapu and Diadema still face serious
problems. And, even if Mr da Silva wins, the PT is a small party which will
have difficulty governing effectively without alliances in Congress. In
Brazil, alliances often spell compromise and inaction.

FT  29 APR 94 / Speeding US growth enters slower lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew at an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in the first quarter,
an unexpectedly sharp deceleration after growth at an annual rate of 7 per
cent in the final period of last year, official figures indicated yesterday.
In a separate report the Commerce Department said new orders for durable
goods rose 0.4 per cent last month, the seventh rise in eight months.
Most Wall Street analysts had expected gross domestic product to grow at an
annual rate of 3-3.5 per cent from the fourth quarter of last year. Orders
were expected to rise by about 1 per cent.
The deceleration in growth mainly reflected a big increase in the trade
deficit in the first quarter, an erratic decline in government spending at
an annual rate of 6.2 per cent, and severe winter weather which depressed
several sectors, including construction.
Overall private-sector spending however grew at an annual rate of 4.6 per
cent in real terms from the fourth quarter.
The figures are unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from signalling
further increases in short-term interest rates in coming months. Allowing
for distortions, the economy remained vigorous in the first quarter. GDP was
3.6 per cent higher than in the opening period of last year. Consumption and
non-residential investment were up 4 per cent and 12.8 per cent
respectively. The economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.8 per cent in
the fourth and first quarters combined - well above the economy's long-run
potential rate of growth.
The administration welcomed the report as evidence the economy was not
overheating. Ms Laura Tyson, the White House chief economist, said it should
calm fears 'inflation is about to spike upwards'. The data were consistent
with her projections of 3 per cent GDP growth this year and inflation of
about 3 per cent, she said.
Bond prices rose following release of the report but later declined sharply
as traders focused on an apparent increase in a broad measure of inflation.
The fixed weight GDP deflator increased at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in
the first quarter against 2.3 per cent at the end of last year. Share prices
followed bond prices lower with the Dow Jones industrial average closing
31.23 points down at 3,668.31.
Many analysts are projecting a rebound in the growth rate in the present
quarter to an annual rate of 3.5 per cent or higher, reflecting a catch-up
of spending. First quarter figures were based on incomplete data and could
be revised substantially.

Bankers in Caracas said the central bank began to apply unofficial
restraints on its sales of US dollars to financial institutions on
Wednesday. They asserted the bank was questioning potential buyers about the
reasons for their purchases of dollars.
The central bank denied any restrictions were being applied to dollar sales.

FT  29 APR 94 / Banks bill could spark row with EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US and the European Union could be heading for a clash over the
reluctance of Congress to lift restrictions on the opening of new branches
by foreign banks.
Both chambers of Congress have passed bills that would loosen restrictions
on interstate branching by US banks, which currently must set up a new
subsidiary in each state they want to do business in. Foreign banks which
have a separately incorporated subsidiary in the US  - such as Barclays Bank
of the UK - would, in both versions of the bill, have the same freedom to
open new branches. However, the Senate version, which must be reconciled
with the House version before the measure can become law, would still
prevent foreign banks which operate in the US through a branch - for
example, Lloyds of the UK - opening new branches.
Mr John Mogg, director general of the European Commission's financial
services division, has written to Senator Donald Riegle, chairman of the
Senate banking committee, to complain that 'our banks would continue to face
restrictions on their activities throughout the US in ways that US banks
would not', and that the Senate version of the bill would therefore not
provide full national treatment.
Mr Frank Newman, undersecretary of the US Treasury, has also written to Mr
Riegle to oppose the provision, arguing that the US 'has repeatedly objected
to similar requirements imposed by foreign countries on US banks that
operate abroad'.
Leading senators remain adamant, however, insisting that foreign banks
operating as direct branches otherwise enjoy a competitive advantage over US
banks because they can escape US laws on consumer protection, community
reinvestment and fair lending.
'Nothing in the Senate bill prohibits a foreign bank from establishing a
subsidiary as a US chartered bank, which then has available all of the same
rights and privileges of interstate banking and branching this legislation
provides to US banks,' said Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky. 'But to obtain
these privileges, they must pay the same price as US banks - compliance with
all relevant laws which apply to chartered institutions.'
Bankers' associations from 17 states have backed the Senate provisions.

The French National Assembly voted unanimously last night to proceed with an

reported a loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 800m) in 1993 and will get a state
bailout and a capital injection. A 12-member National Assembly commission,
headed by Assembly President Philippe Seguin, will examine the bank's
financial problems and the effectiveness of the banking system's
surveillance mechanism. Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery told parliament
the inquest was 'probably the only way to calm the doubts that may have
arisen about the quality of banking surveillance in France'.

The Bank of France yesterday took a further cautious step in its policy of
gradually lowering interest rates, shaving its intervention rate, the key
short-term official interest rate, by 10 basis points to 5.7 per cent. The
move was the second reduction within a week and reflects the central bank's
strategy of reducing borrowing costs in line with Germany. On Wednesday the
Bundesbank reduced its repo rate by 11 basis points to 5.47 per cent.
Yesterday's lowering of the French discount rate was the fifth this year.
All of the reductions have been 0.1 of a percentage point. The French
currency took yesterday's move in its stride, strengthening slightly to
trade at FFr3.429 to the D-Mark.

Carmakers yesterday took a big step forward in dealing with the
environmental problem of the 9m-10m cars scrapped annually in Europe.
Renault, Fiat and BMW signed an agreement in Brussels under which each
company will recycle the others' cars as well as its own. The three groups
have a combined European market share of more than 28 per cent, and the
agreement is likely to cover more than 1m of the cars scrapped annually. It
is expected to include the UK's Rover Group, now owned by BMW.
The agreement is part of a planned European recycling network for the
collection and recycling of scrapped cars agreed between the European
Commission and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).
Similar agreements are expected to be signed eventually by all Europe's
carmakers.

Turkish central bankers will today meet foreign creditors to explain
government plans for restructuring three Turkish banks which closed this
month. One foreign economist estimated the total foreign liabilities of the
three banks - Turkish Turizm ve Yatirim Bank, Marmara Bank and Impexbank -
at Dollars 200m. The banks' creditors are understood to include French,
German, US and Swiss banks. Turkish newspapers reported that the main
creditors were UBS and SBC of Switzerland. In the event of liquidation of
the three banks, domestic depositors are likely to have first call on the
banks' assets. A ceiling of TL150m (Pounds 3,240), raised from TL50m, has
been set as the amount payable to individual depositors.
Turkey will want to reassure foreign creditors, on the eve of talks with the
International Monetary Fund which start today. The talks are aimed at
winning Fund approval for Turkey's austerity programme, to pave the way for
Turkey to return to the commercial debt markets.

<TEXT>
Workers at Heineken's two main Dutch breweries are to end their eight-day
strike after a judge in The Hague said the blockades of the Zoeterwoude and
Den Bosch plants were illegal. The Netherland Union Federation members will
return to work under a pay deal which has been accepted by the two other
unions. The agreement gives workers a retroactive 0.5 per cent rise from
January 1, a further 1.5 per cent increase next year and a one-off bonus
payment of 1 per cent later in 1994.
The federation had earlier rejected the deal. Although its members were
returning to work, it indicated it would not sign the new collective labour
agreement and would not co-operate in reorganisation plans. The strike,
which was unusually bitter by the standards of the company and the country,
forced Heineken to import beer from its plants in France, Spain and Italy to
meet strong demand ahead of tomorrow's 'Queen's Day' national holiday.

<TEXT>
Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, moved yesterday to end a
confrontation between the Solidarity union and the government over wage
controls in state industries. He said the controls, which the union is
fighting to abolish, were not essential. Mr Kolodko, 45, an economist whose
nomination was approved yesterday by President Lech Walesa, said the
government would soon prepare measures to eliminate the risk that inflation
would be fuelled by dropping the controls. The statement came after Mr
Walesa had expressed doubts about the usefulness of the controls.
Solidarity said token stoppages yesterday had 'finally brought the union's
demands to the fore'. The union would continue to insist that the government
implement a system of collective wage bargaining to replace the wage
controls. Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, privatisation minister, said his ministry
would speed up 'commercialisation' of state companies, which would
streamline management and give the government greater control over wage
decisions.
Mr Kolodko is a specialist on inflation who was in the past critical of
Poland's shock therapy reform programme. But lately he has argued for
stringent monetary controls and said that as finance minister he would
concentrate on reducing the budget deficit and reforming the welfare system.
He advocates selling bonds which would be exchangable for state property as
a way of reducing the national debt. Mr Kolodko concedes that, in the light
of Poland's 16 per cent unemployment, the 30 per cent a year inflation rate
can only be reduced gradually.

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Projected gains by the far-right in the Netherlands' general elections next
Tuesday could tarnish the country's reputation for tolerance.
Polls show that the Centrum Democraten (CD), a far-right party which won a
large number of city council seats in municipal elections in March, is
projected to win up to eight seats in the 150-seat lower house of
parliament.
At the last general election in 1989 the CD managed to win just one seat,
but this was enough to cause serious alarm in a country which cherishes its
liberal tradition.
The Netherlands' best-known far-right politician, the CD member of
parliament and party leader Mr Hans Janmaat, is currently standing trial for
making discriminatory remarks and inciting hatred towards foreigners.
He and his party are campaigning under the political slogan 'The Netherlands
Is Full Up', and they suggest that immigrants, ethnic minorities and an
annual inflow of 50,000 asylum seekers are affecting the country's
prosperity and social security system.
The rising popularity of Mr Janmaat has forced the Netherlands' mainstream
establishment to rethink its response to the far-right.
Until the 1994 general election campaign, politicians and journalists
completely ignored Mr Janmaat in the hope that a lack of publicity would
staunch his support. Newspapers did not cover his party or interview him,
and politicians in parliament refused to engage him in debate.
This has now changed. HP/De Tijd, an Amsterdam-based news and arts magazine,
recently interviewed Mr Janmaat under the banner 'Dumbo or Demon?' Other
magazines have infiltrated the CD and smaller extremist parties and
published exposes on their members.
Lobby groups working on behalf of ethnic minorities, such as the Dutch
Centre for Immigrants (NCB), oppose the media attention given to Mr Janmaat.
But Mr Tinus Heijmans, NCB spokesman, says: 'I can well imagine that
although politicians would rather shun the CD, they sometimes feel forced to
speak out.'
A more serious and controversial view is that mainstream Dutch parties are
moving to the right in their views on immigration and asylum seekers. Mr
Heijmans believes that it is the tone, rather than the substance, of the
other parties that is worrying.
Mr Frits Bolkestein, head of the Liberals, a pro-business party that formed
part of two government coalitions in the 1980s, has taken a lead in trying
to foster a national debate about immigrants.
Mr Bolkestein denies that he is opposed to foreigners. But he says that the
Netherlands is attracting more asylum seekers because of a perception that
it is an easier option than France or Germany, both of which have tightened
their procedures.

Media magnate Silvio Berlusconi yesterday crowned his four-month career in
politics by being asked to form Italy's 53rd post-war government which he
pledged would carry out a big liberalisation of the economy, introduce a
more federal constitution and shake-up the inefficient public
administration.
'I promise to introduce a new way of doing things in Italy,' he said in a
sombre statement after meeting President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
Recognising the enormity of the task ahead of him, he refused to be drawn
into when he would announce his cabinet. But he is unlikely to be sworn in
before the end next week and he will then have to obtain votes of confidence
in both houses of parliament, which are virtually assured.
The ministerial team will be formed from the four-party Freedom Alliance
that won a landslide victory in the March 27/28 general elections.
Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the populist Northern League of Mr
Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance are all new to
government. Only the small Christian Democratic Centre, formed from the rump
of the old Christian Democrat party, have had experience in office.
Mr Berlusconi's political rise represents the most rapid in recent Italian
history. It is also the first time in a modern democracy that a man with a
significant business empire, present in sensitive areas of national life
like television, has been nominated prime minister.
The 57 year-old proprietor of Fininvest group, Italy's second largest
business employing 33,000 people, was summoned to the presidential palace
yesterday afternoon to be formally told of his investiture only after the
final issues surrounding the conflict of interest had been resolved.
It was agreed that a three-man watchdog body be formed to guarantee that Mr
Berlusconi retains a proper distance as prime minister from his Fininvest
empire. Mr Berlusconi said the committee would consist of three prominent
jurists drawn from the constitutional court, the council of state and the
academic world. They would be responsible for checking existing legislation
and proposing new safeguard laws.
Mr Berlusconi also said he thought the existing anti-trust laws, if properly
applied, would help to ensure there was no conflict of interest. President
Scalfaro also pledged his help, in his role as guarantor of the
constitution.
President Scalfaro had been obliged to postpone the call to Mr Berlusconi on
Wednesday because of serious differences over how best to avoid a conflict
of interest.
When Mr Berlusconi entered politics in January at the head of his new Forza
Italia movement, he made no attempt to confront the issue and has only begun
to tackle it in earnest during the past 10 days.
The financier who channelled bribes from Italy's Ferruzzi group to
politicians was sentenced to eight years' jail and ordered to pay damages at
the end of a corruption trial last night, Reuter reports from Milan. L150bn
(Pounds 62.3m) from the foods-to-chemicals group for use as bribes.
He will have to pay over L168bn in damages to two Ferruzzi companies, court
costs and a fine of L16m. He will serve the jail sentence only if it is
confirmed by a higher court.

FT  29 APR 94 / Schneider affair errors leave dent in Deutsche Bank's
reputation: David Waller explains how Germany's biggest bank allowed itself
to be deceived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany is in the grip of 'Schneider fever', says Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief
executive of Deutsche Bank, following the disappearance of property
entrepreneur Mr Jurgen Schneider, which triggered Germany's biggest property
bankruptcy in decades.
The shock waves are such that even Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president,
went out of his way this week to tell New York businessmen that the
Schneider affair - closely following the near-demise of the
Metallgesellschaft metals, mining and industrial group earlier this year -
was not symptomatic of a general crisis in the German economy.
With property experts adamant that the collapse is a 'one-off' which will
not lead to widespread crisis in Germany's fragmented property sector, those
most likely to feel financial hardship as a result of the affair are small
businessmen owed money by the bankrupt group.
At the other end of the scale - the powerful Deutsche Bank - the damage to
image and pride has been far worse, as Mr Kopper conceded on Monday.
The bank's exposure to Schneider is DM1.16bn - a mere 0.03 per cent of the
bank's lending volume, of which 'only' a few hundred million are at risk.
But as a poll this week in Die Woche newspaper revealed, 72 per cent of
those polled blamed Deutsche Bank for the property debacle - and only 18 per
cent the fugitive Mr Schneider himself, who fled the country having taken at
least DM219m of the group's money.
In a press offensive this week, Mr Kopper sought to play down the
implications of the affair. In an interview with Die Zeit newspaper
yesterday Mr Kopper blamed the surge of public hostility on 'typically
German feelings of envy' triggered by resentment at the bank's sheer
profitability.
But for all Mr Kopper's attempts to treat the collapse as a normal, though
big, bankruptcy, the debacle has once again raised the question of what
Deutsche bank knew and when, and whether it missed opportunities to prevent
the group's demise. The same questions were asked of it in the
Metallgesellschaft case.
As internal enquiries at the bank got under way, Deutsche officials
disclosed this week that the bank took a policy decision to stop lending to
Mr Schneider in 1992 when its exposure amounted to DM1.5bn out of the
property group's total borrowings of DM2.8bn.
But Mr Kopper explained that this decision was merely part of a general risk
diversification strategy. It was only last year, according to Mr Ulrich
Weiss, the board member responsible for the Mannheim area from which
Schneider borrowed money, that the bank's credit committee decided to watch
Schneider critically.
Last February, Mr Weiss went so far as to question Mr Schneider closely
following press reports chronicling his legal battles with suppliers over
his failure to meet payments, and information from the Bundesbank which put
the group's debts at over DM5bn.
Mr Weiss said Mr Schneider's answers were plausible. He promised to mend
fences with the suppliers and said that the Bundesbank figure was caused by
statistical errors.
The last contact with Mr Schneider was ten days before Easter when he and Mr
Weiss fixed up a meeting to discuss the group's future. This was for last
Monday and, not surprisingly, Mr Schneider - now facing fraud charges - did
not turn up.
Mr Weiss stressed on Monday that despite the critical questions, there was
no evidence that the group was in financial difficulties until April 7. On
that Thursday he received a letter from Mr Schneider in which he announced
that he had left the country on medical grounds and asked Deutsche Bank to
provide a bridging loan. Deutsche refused to make the loan and the main
holding company for the group filed for bankruptcy on April 15.
As fellow Deutsche board member Mr Georg Krupp explained on Monday, Mr
Schneider was up until the last minute prompt and punctual in meeting
payments of interest and capital. He also had DM583m cash at his disposal at
the end of last year- all but DM5m of which has now vanished.
But were there not other warning signs? Two smaller banks, Norddeutsche
Landesbank and BfG Bank are known to have demanded further security from Mr
Schneider at the beginning of the year. Their scepticism was based on an
audited statement of Mr Schneider's personal financial position as at the
end of last year. This statement claimed that the Les Facettes shopping
development in the centre of Frankfurt had a market value of DM983m - while
property specialists put the value at less than DM200m.
It is this development which forms the basis of Deutsche's fraud claim
against Mr Schneider. The claim says he falsified documentation when
applying for a top-up loan for the project earlier this year. It emerged in
the context of this claim that Deutsche lent DM415m against the project -
more than twice the market value.
The loan was made on the basis that it would yield DM57m in rental income on
more than 20,000 square metres of lettable space. In fact it yielded just
DM8m on only 9,000 sqm.
Mr Kopper claimed that the biggest mistake the bank made was to 'allow
ourselves to be deceived'. But critics are much harder.
'There appears to have been a total breakdown in internal control,' said Mr
Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in London.
'At no stage did anyone ask the obvious questions about valuations. Proper
oversight would have rec-ognised the anomalies and picked them up.'

Dutch gross domestic product grew 0.2 per cent in real terms in 1993
compared with 1.4% growth in 1992, according to the Hague-based Central
Bureau for Statistics. In the fourth quarter of last year GDP shrank 0.4 per
cent from the previous quarter, although it was 0.3 per cent up on a year
earlier. Both those figures were downgraded from the original estimate of a
0.3 per cent contraction in the fourth quarter from the third and a 0.5 per
cent GDP expansion from the final three months of 1992.
German plant and machinery orders rose a real 7 per cent in March and by 3
per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the VDMA industry group
reported yesterday. Domestic orders for March were up 3 per cent while
foreign orders grew 11 per cent.
German inflation rose by 0.3 per cent in April over the previous month,
remaining at 3.2 per cent a year, the Federal Statistics Office announced
yesterday.
Belgium's annual inflation rate was a preliminary 2.41 per cent in April,
compared with 2.31 per cent in March, according to the Foreign Ministry.

FT  29 APR 94 / Dutch parties cross swords over welfare: Voters preoccupied
with preserving and paying for social security provisions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
With its high standard of living and an unusually generous and extensive
welfare state, the Netherlands is preoccupied with one issue as it prepares
for national elections next Tuesday - social security and how to continue
paying for it.
Parties vying for the attention of voters are more or less agreed on the
need for European integration, on the importance of cutting the budget
deficit and on the desirability of creating more jobs.
Where they differ most is on social security, a perennial preoccupation for
a prosperous country which is home to some of the world's richest pension
funds.
It is a sign of the times that one of the fastest growing parties, besides
the far right, is the Algemeen Ouderen Verbond, or General League of the
Elderly.
Founded just four months ago, it is poised to win up to four seats, marking
the first time that the Netherlands' retired people - and people who hope to
retire one day - have sent their own representatives to parliament.
Its lead candidate is Mrs Jet Nijpels, a 46-year-old former city councillor.
The party is winning support from people aged 40 to 80 and its list of
candidates includes economists, business executives and medical
practitioners, with an average age of 62.
'Our appeal is not just to people who are already retired but also to
40-year-olds who want to be sure that in 20 years' time they'll be able to
draw a substantial old age pension,' says Mr Will Verkerk, a 55-year-old
civil servant who is one of the party's candidates.
The party's appeal has been aided by the uproar among the elderly that
followed the unveiling of plans by the Christian Democrats (CDA), the party
of outgoing Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers which until now has been the largest
in parliament.
The CDA's call in January to freeze the state old-age pension in order to
find money to stimulate job creation has badly hurt the party's standing.
However, calculations made by the Central Planning Bureau, an independent
economic forecasting body within the Dutch government, show that the
policies of the three other main parties will also lead to a decline in
purchasing power for pensioners.
Mr Frits Wester, campaign spokesman for the CDA's new leader, Mr Elco
Brinkman, acknowledges that social security is a main issue for the party,
as part of a wider focus on security at large.
'The emphasis is on security in its widest sense, in combating crime and
ensuring that education is well funded and jobs are created,' he says.
Nevertheless, the CDA's support has halved since 1989, creating the most
wide-open Dutch election in decades.
The most radical plan for social security put forward by any of the parties
is the 'mini-system' proposed by the Liberals, who served as junior partners
in two of Mr Lubbers' cabinets in the 1980s but who lost this role to Labour
in 1989.
The Liberals want to cut unemployment, health and social security benefits
to 60 per cent of the minimum wage, in order to encourage people to find
jobs.
People seeking fuller protection against the risk of unemployment or ill
health would have to take out supplementary private insurance.
Although coalition negotiations will not start until after May 3, the
Liberals' plan is already dominating the pre-election jostling among parties
sizing up possible coalition partners.
Mr Dig Istha, the campaign spokesman for Labour, says such drastic cuts in
the social welfare system are unacceptable because they would hurt the
weakest members of society.
Labour is particularly sensitive to reform of the social security system
because it is still recovering from a sharp drop in support after it agreed
to wide-ranging changes to disability insurance in the early 1990s.
'Those changes were made, not to do weaken the system, but to ensure that it
could survive. Many voters saw this as an attack on social security, and it
has been difficult to explain to them,' Mr Istha says.
The fourth main party, D66, a left-of-centre grouping which may hold the
balance of power after May 3, is also critical of the Liberals' plan for
sharp cuts in benefits but has ruled nothing out.
With the four main parties about equal in the opinion polls, it is clear
that negotiations on the future coalition will be difficult, because at
least three parties will be needed to create a majority, a break from the
1980s when CDA-dominated two-party coalitions held sway.
'None of the parties has ruled out working with any of the others, and there
are a quite a few possible combinations,' Mr Istha notes.
Nevertheless, the defining element to the talks is likely to be the parties'
views on the social welfare system and its future.
The Liberals will come under pressure to soften their stance, and the other
parties will be encouraged to meet them part of the way.
A three-party coalition, and the concessions needed to hold it together,
would seem to argue against a radical change in government policy.
Referring to the prospect of a multi-party coalition, Mr Herman Wijffels,
chairman of Rabobank, told a gathering of foreign bankers in Amsterdam last
week that the Netherlands was likely to 'muddle through' over the next few
years rather than take any decisive action.
The next government will have to tackle more than simply the future of the
social security system. It will also have to find ways of boosting jobs at a
time of rapidly rising unemployment.
Mr Wim Duisenberg, the president of the central bank, used his annual press
conference yesterday to warn against any easing of the fight against the
budget deficit to stimulate employment.
'At the end of the day, sound public finance and sustainable job creation
are inextricably linked,' he said.

The French privatisation programme has brought 2.5m first time share buyers
into the market, according to a survey by the Commissions des Operations de
Bourse, the French stock market watchdog, and the Sofres market research
consultancy. This increase in the number of private investors to 7m reverses
the late 1980s trend whereby the French switched out of equities to return
to cash investments such as Sicavs, the popular money market funds. The
number of shareholders in France rose to 6.2m in 1987, at the height of the
last centre-right government's privatisation programme, only to fall to 4.5m
by late 1992.

<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday took a further cautious step in its policy of
gradually lowering interest rates, shaving its intervention rate, the key
short term official interest rate, by ten basis points to 5.7 per cent. The
move was the second reduction within a week and reflects the central bank's
strategy of reducing borrowing costs in line with Germany. On Wednesday, the
Bundesbank reduced its repo rate by 11 basis points to 5.47 per cent.
Yesterday's lowering of the French discount rate was the fifth this year.
All of the reductions have been of 0.1 of a percentage point. The French
currency took yesterday's move in its stride, strengthening slightly to
trade at FFr3.429 to the D-Mark.

FT  29 APR 94 / Bank plans to restructure its activities into two wings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England unveiled a plan to restructure its management yesterday
that may result in its wide activities being concentrated into two broad
wings.
In a move designed to make its mission clearer, improve communication and
increase its ability to respond to rapid and potentially dangerous changes
in financial markets, the Bank is proposing to group its activities in a
'monetary stability wing' and a 'financial stability wing'.
The monetary wing would bring the Bank's economic analysis and monetary
operations, such as its activity on the foreign exchange and gilt-edged
markets, under one umbrella. Its supervision of banks and financial markets
in Britain and its monitoring of banking conditions and regulations abroad
would be combined with its efforts to enhance the competitiveness of UK
financial centres in the financial stability wing.
The proposals have been worked out by Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, the deputy
governor, over the past five months in consultation with staff. The Bank
will forward final details in mid-May with a view to having the wings in
operation by July 1.
If the reorganisation goes ahead, the Bank's international division will
close, and its members will be allocated to the two wings.

FT  29 APR 94 / Enterprise Oil in hostile Pounds 1.45bn bid for Lasmo: Deal
would create group valued at over Pounds 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil launched a Pounds 1.45bn hostile takeover bid for rival
explorer Lasmo yesterday. If successful, the offer would bring together the
UK's two largest independent oil and gas explorers into a single group
valued at more than Pounds 3bn.
The offer is the largest hostile bid in the UK since BTR's Pounds 1.47bn
offer for Hawker Siddeley in 1991. If Lasmo shareholders accept the
unusually structured all-paper offer, the enlarged company would rank fourth
among North Sea explorers, after British Petroleum, Shell and Exxon.
Enterprise virtually ruled out any prospect of a cash sweetener. 'I do not
see any need for it,' said Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief
executive. The group's policy was to pay for big acquisitions with paper, he
added.
Mr Hearne said Enterprise's strong cash generation over the next few years -
after completion of the Nelson and Scott fields - would meet Lasmo's need
for funds to bring its exploration opportunities on stream. He rejected
suggestions that Lasmo's recent Pounds 219m rights issue was enough to fund
the loss-making company's future needs.
Lasmo, however, attacked the bid as a 'contrived paper offer . . . which
would dilute significant growth potential for shareholders'. Mr Joe Darby,
chief executive, said the combination of the two companies 'would add no
value for shareholders'.
Initial reaction in financial markets appeared to support his view.
Enterprise's shares closed 21p down at 425p, while Lasmo fell 5 1/2 p at
157p. 'This bid is good for neither Lasmo shareholders nor Enterprise
shareholders,' said Mr David Basham, a Kleinwort Benson oil analyst. 'By
1996, they will have to find 164m barrels every year just to keep their
reserve base stable.'
Another analyst criticised the strategic logic, saying: 'You could drive a
horse and cart through the gaps.' The structure caused some comment. 'It is
hard to see what Lasmo shareholders will be getting in this offer,' said
another analyst. Credit agency Moody's said it was reviewing ratings of
Enterprise for potential downgrade and Lasmo for possible upgrade.
The offer comprises, for every 80 Lasmo shares:
27 Enterprise A shares which will convert to ordinary shares in 1997 and
will carry a 3p annual dividend between 1994 and 1997. That is equivalent to
the dividend Lasmo indicated it would pay in those years when it launched
its recent rights issue, plus
12 Enterprise warrants exercisable from 1997 to 2001 at 407p.
Enterprise says that values Lasmo shares at 150p, based on the A share price
of 407p and a warrant price of 86p.

FT  29 APR 94 / Terrorism claims link Iran with IRA and Japan group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and the US joined yesterday in warning Iran over its alleged support
for international terrorism after obtaining intelligence information that
Tehran was stepping up its links with groups including the IRA and the
Japanese Red Army.
In London, Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, was summoned
to a meeting with Mr Douglas Hogg, a foreign office minister, and told that
the UK government had evidence of contacts between Iranian intelligence and
the IRA.
The US has long accused Iran of sponsoring international terrorism and
seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and it has urged other countries not to
offer the Islamic regime economic assistance. The allegations will put
particular pressure on Japan, which has a relatively good relationship with
Tehran.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, emphasised Washington's
concern after contact with Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary,
Mr Ansari last night emphatically denied any involvement by Iran in the
supply of arms or money to the IRA. He said: 'Iran has always strongly
condemned any terrorist action in any place in any form or any time.'
Asked whether Mr Hogg had produced any evidence at the meeting that there
had been contacts between the IRA and the Iranian intelligence service, he
replied: 'There was no evidence.'
In the Commons, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs the
government was 'quite satisfied' there had been contacts between Iran and
the IRA, while Ulster Unionist MPs demanded sanctions against Tehran.
The IRA is thought to have been drawing on financial support from Iran and
may have been on the verge of securing a large shipment of arms. According
to western diplomats, Iran has also been training Japanese terrorists to
conduct assassinations in Europe and the US.
The allegations, if proved to be true, may embarrass Japan, which has been
conducting an independent foreign policy with Iran. The Japanese foreign
ministry said yesterday it was aware of reports that the Japanese Red Army
was being assisted by Iran, but that it had seen no evidence.

FT  29 APR 94 / Treasury mandarins' cost controls strike home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury's mandarins are threatened with eviction from the grand English
Renaissance-style building that has been a symbol of their power for half a
century. They cannot afford to refurbish it.
The creme de la creme who run the most powerful of Whitehall's empires have
no one to blame but themselves. In their anxiety to impose financial
austerity on the rest of the government machine, the custodians of the
nation's finances have left themselves with an agonising choice.
They can spend tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to refurbish
the run-down offices behind the elegant colonnades, porticos and domes which
face the House of Commons across Parliament Square.
Or they can practise the thrift they preach by selling up to a big City
institution or Japanese hotel developer and joining less exalted colleagues
in a 1960s concrete monstrosity.
Treasury civil servants gaze out on the most imposing sights in Westminster
and Whitehall. Their building, designed in English Renaissance style by one
JM Brydon, was completed in 1915 on five acres of the most prime land in
London.
It has Portland stone facades facing St James's Park, Parliament Square,
Whitehall and the adjacent Foreign and Commonwealth Office in King Charles
Street. The five entrance halls and staircases are built in Mezzaro marble,
the interior offices lined with forests of wood panelling.
But the grandeur of this perfect emblem of empire has been fading since the
Treasury moved in from more modest accommodation along Whitehall during the
last world war.
Workmen have been painstakingly patching up some of the superficial faults.
But one of those now notorious firms of private consultants has discovered a
battery of more serious troubles. Water is flooding the basement, miles of
electrical wiring must be ripped out, stonework is crumbling.
The consultants - and, yes, they are being carefully supervised to ensure
value for money - are to come up with a detailed series of options by the
end of the year. But more officials will have to move out anyway in 1996 and
the present assessment is that proper refurbishment could take nearly a
decade.
So the mandarins are facing up to the possibility of a permanent move. In a
saner world it would be quickly ruled out. Public buildings have a value
beyond the balance sheet. The FCO, after all, is just completing a Pounds
100m refurbishment.
But the Treasury is the promoter of market forces as well as taxpayers'
guardian. There is plenty of cheaper space to be had. With awful mistiming,
it has chosen to prove it is as tough on itself as it is on the rest of
government by launching a fundamental review of how to contain its costs.
You can already hear the sniggering in Whitehall's spending departments.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: GEC offer for Ferranti units cleared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GEC's purchase of parts of Ferranti International will not be referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as the Office of Fair Trading has
concluded that the deal did not raise competition concerns, writes Bernard
Gray.
GEC agreed to buy Ferranti's defence systems integration business and its
training and simulation business from the receivers on March 30.
It is thought to have offered about Pounds 100m for the two businesses. GEC
is thought to be interested in Ferranti's 50 per cent stake in a sonar joint
venture with Thomson, the French electronics company.
Ferranti's systems integration business designs command and control systems
for ships and air defence.

FT  28 APR 94 / SAS close to sale of two biggest non-core units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) said yesterday it was well on the way to
selling its two biggest non-core business units, SAS Leisure and SAS Service
Partner, to European buyers.
The airline said it had almost finalised a SKr870m (Dollars 111m) deal to
sell SAS Leisure, Scandinavia's leading tour operator, to Airtours, the UK
holiday group.
It added that it was about to begin detailed discussions with Swissair over
the sale of its Service Partner airline catering unit. This unit has been
valued at up to SKr2.5bn.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, has long expressed the desire to
expand into continental Europe. Airtours, the second biggest UK tour
operator after Thomson, said it is also close to agreement to buy a cruise
ship for Dollars 24m. The vendor of the cruise ship is believed to be
Kloster Cruise of Norway.
Last year SAS Leisure made a SKr199m pre-tax loss on sales of SKr4.44bn.
The performance followed a SKr209m profit in 1992 and reflected depressed
travel industry conditions, recession in the Nordic region and the weakness
of the Swedish krona.
The deal, which could be finalised today, received a cool welcome from the
City of London, which marked Airtours' shares down 18p to 448p. Airtours has
been criticised in recent weeks for its acquisition record.
SAS Leisure's operations include two tour operators, Ving and Always, a 50
per cent stake in Premiair, the charter airline, and a 49 per cent stake in
Spanair, another charter operator. It also owns 14 hotels, mainly around the
Mediterranean.
SAS wants to concentrate on core flying operations after four consecutive
years in the red and last year's failed attempt to merge with Swissair,
Austrian Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in the Alcazar project. The
group is also cutting costs by SKr3bn by shedding nearly 3,000 jobs over the
next 18 months.
SAS said Service Partner would be combined with Swissair's catering
division, Gate Gourmet, if talks with the Swiss airline were successful.
The unit achieved a SKr170m profit last year on sales of SKr4.8bn.
Earlier this month SAS sold Diners Club Nordic, a credit and charge card
operation. It has also sold a stake in LanChile, the Chilean airline.

FT  28 APR 94 / IBM to sell its chips to rival Hitachi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to sell the microprocessor chips that are
at the core of its future mainframe and parallel computer products, to
Hitachi of Japan, its long and bitter rival in the mainframe computer
market.
The move is an extraordinary alliance of former enemies. For years, IBM
feuded with Hitachi and other Japanese computer makers over allegations of
stolen trade secrets. Instead of fighting to protect its technology, IBM is
now willing to sell it, even to one of its largest competitors.
Mr John Thompson, IBM senior vice president, explained the move saying:
'There is, quite simply, a very strong business case for us to do this.
'We will make more money by licensing our technology, than we would by not
doing so.' The benefits to IBM include better use of its semiconductor
manufacturing capacity, and the potential to expand the market for large
scale systems, he said.
The agreement also means IBM has effectively neutralised the threat of
competition from Hitachi. 'Each Hitachi sale will mean revenue and profit
for IBM,' said Mr Thompson. 'IBM will gain access to Hitachi's customer
base, especially in Japan.'
Under the agreement, IBM will supply Hitachi with future versions of its
System 390 microprocessors. These chips represent the core technology of a
new generation of IBM mainframe computers that will not require the
elaborate cooling systems of today's mainframe computers. They are built
using the same complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology
used in personal computers.
The chips supplied to Hitachi will be modified to include Hitachi's
specifications, IBM said, and will be used in computers being developed by
Hitachi for introduction in 1996.
IBM will also supply Hitachi with its latest Powerparallel computers, to be
resold by the Japanese company. These computers were introduced only a few
weeks ago and represent a new generation of large scale computers which IBM
believes will play a central role in computing in the next decade.
Hitachi plans to develop its own products for this sector of the market,
based on IBM's PowerPC microprocessors and will make the IBM chips 'one of
its primary architectures' for the future.
The companies have also agreed to study the potential for shared development
of future CMOS mainframe microprocessors.
Other areas for possible future collaboration include promotion of industry
standards in large scale computing.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Argentina may face sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Washington has threatened Argentina with trade sanctions unless it
introduces intellectual property protection laws, stalled in Argentina's
Congress since 1991.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, told Mr Domingo Cavallo,
Argentina's economy minister, who was on an official visit to Washington,
that he would place Argentina on a US government priority list. This would
lead to investigations into whether Argentina's laws damaged US companies,
particularly pharmaceutical laboratories. If this was confirmed, Washington
would impose trade sanctions.
Argentina's pharmaceuticals market has annual sales of Dollars 3bn and has
grown rapidly in the past three years. Piracy of multinational companies'
products has been estimated at Dollars 500m-Dollars 900m a year.
However, Mr Cavallo said the threat was 'irrelevant and unilateral' and said
Argentina would appeal against US measures to a panel of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He added that Argentina would introduce legislation to conform to new
intellectual property rules included in the Gatt's Uruguay Round.
Developing countries have a four-year grace period to bring their laws into
line with new international minimum standards.
The government has failed to convince Congress to approve a bill first
introduced in 1991 to replace its existing 1864 patent legislation. US
officials claim that Congress has not passed the law because the government
has not given it a high priority.
Local laboratories claim the new laws would raise drug prices and accused
the US of 'extortion'.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Israeli companies look to Egypt
</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli telecommunications companies, denied direct access to Middle East
markets by an Arab boycott of their country, say they hope to use Egypt as a
springboard to launch their products in the region, Reuter reports from
Cairo.
Delegates from the six companies, in Egypt to attend a trade fair, said they
were looking for partnerships with Egyptian companies which might produce
their goods under licence for sales elsewhere in the Middle East.
Egypt is the only Arab state to have signed a peace treaty with Israel and
is exempt from an Arab League boycott of the Jewish state.
Mr Haim Ashkenazi, an executive with the Israel Export Institute, said the
companies were the first Israeli telecommunications companies to exhibit in
the Arab world.
Mr Elisha Ben-Nachum, sales manager at cables manufacturer Teldor, said his
company would be discussing possibilities of joint ventures with Egyptian
companies.
The Arab boycott of Israel also blacklists companies with major investments
in the Jewish state, but there have been signs that this 'secondary' boycott
is slipping.
Mr Ron Brown, US trade secretary, on a visit to the region in January, said
a number of US companies on the boycott blacklist had been prominent
exhibitors at a trade show in Riyadh that month.
Another Israeli company at the Cairo show said it was looking for
joint-venture agreements with Egypt or other African countries to produce
its emergency back-up generators.
One of the companies, national telecommunications operator Bezeq, is using
the occasion to inaugurate a direct telephone line linking Israel and Egypt.
'This is a big breakthrough. It is the first direct link between Israel and
an Arab country,' said Bezeq official Mr Daniel Charbit.
The terrestrial fibre-optic line can carry thousands of calls between Cairo
and Tel Aviv. At present calls have to be routed via submarine lines to
Italy, Mr Charbit said.

   THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch and Belgians have tentatively agreed to set up a joint naval
command headquarters to cut costs at a time of shrinking defence budgets, a
Dutch navy spokesman said yesterday. The two nations will merge their
command units at the Dutch naval headquarters in Den Helder, 86 km north of
Amsterdam. Operations will be directed by the headquarters by a single
binational staff. The accord has to be formally approved by defence
ministers of both nations. Belgian navy headquarters in Ostend will be
closed, while there will be a cut in Dutch staff at Den Helder. Belgium
froze its defence budget last year at Dollars 2.85bn a year until 1997. It
is also aiming to halve its armed forces to 47,500 soldiers. After the
restructuring, Belgium will have three frigates, 11 minesweepers and hunters
and two other command vessels. The Dutch defence ministry will be cutting
its number of frigates from 22 to 16, submarines from six to four, and all
its 12 minesweepers will be abolished.

FT  28 APR 94 / France's Gaullists join UDF in Euro-alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's RPR Gaullist party has decided to make an historic switch, a
spokesman confirmed yesterday, by joining its French UDF ally in allying
itself with the christian democrat European Peoples party (EPP) in the
Strasbourg Parliament.
This will have the immediate result, after June's European Parliament
elections, of consolidating the EPP as the main conservative grouping at
Strasbourg. It could also pave the way to a united centre-right party in
France where for decades conservatives have been split between the
essentially nationalist movement created by General Charles de Gaulle and
the more free-market liberals represented by the UDF federation, put
together by ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
It is this conservative split that helped President Francois Mitterrand win
the past two presidential elections and that is fuelling the rivalry between
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR party leader,
for next year's presidential contest. Even though Mr Balladur is a Gaullist,
too, he has proved unusually popular within the UDF whose support has given
the prime minister a counterweight to the hold that Mr Chirac has over the
RPR party machine. When in opposition in the late 1980s, Mr Balladur wrote
several articles urging a formal RPR-UDF merger.
But an RPR spokesman said yesterday it would be 'reading far too much' into
his party's decision to sit alongside the UDF in Strasbourg to believe that
it would have such far-ranging domestic political consequences.
The RPR's decision to join the EPP was at the urging of the UDF which Mr
Giscard d'Estaing led into the christian democrat grouping a couple of years
ago. Mr Alain Lamassoure, the UDF minister responsible for European affairs
and a close associate of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, yesterday vaunted in an
interview with Le Figaro newspaper 'the triple accord' by which the UDF and
RPR are fighting the June election, with a single list of candidates running
on a common policy platform and agreement that their successful candidates
should all wear the EPP label in Strasbourg.
Up to now, the Gaullist Euro-deputies have been part of a ragbag of other
conservative nationalists, mainly Irish Fianna Fail deputies, in the
European Democratic Rally - just as British Tory Euro-MPs sat with some
Danish conservatives in the European Democratic Group until a couple of
years ago when they became associate members of the EPP. Like the Tories,
the Gaullists have now seen the advantage of joining the big battalion of
the christian democrats, despite the EPP's federalist and religious
overtones. But the RPR spokesman yesterday did not rule out the possibility
that his party's Euro-deputies might form a sub-group of the EPP, like the
Tories.
An opinion poll published in Paris yesterday put support for the RPR-UDF
list at 38 per cent, with dissident anti-Maastricht conservatives at 4.5 per
cent and the National Front at 9 per cent. On the left, the poll gave 18.5
per cent to the Socialists, 9 per cent to a radical list led by Mr Bernard
Tapie, the maverick businessman, and 6 per cent to the Communists.

FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close to an optimistic trading
session - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The closure of US securities markets for the funeral of former President
Nixon left markets in Europe to focus favourably yesterday on interest rate
trends in Germany. UK equities put aside their fading hopes for a cut in
domestic rates, and also some mild disappointment with the outcome of the
day's auction of British government bonds, to move higher across the range
of the market.
The tone of the market was particularly firm at the close, with the FT-SE
Index 24.7 up at the best of the day, with both gilt-edged and stock index
futures also in good form. The FT-SE Index closed at 3,150, regaining
another important market benchmark.
Takeover speculation played an active part in the market advance, with the
oil sector agog with excitement as Lasmo topped the active stocks list and
the share price ran well above the level at which Enterprise Oil, one of the
suggested bidders, yesterday ruled itself out of the listings.
After a cautious start, UK equities turned higher with other European bond
and stock markets after the Bundesbank repos tender disclosed a further
reduction in yields of 11 basis points. This set a favourable tone for
today's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy council, although the markets
would be pleasantly surprised to see any further move this morning.
The Footsie quickly added more than 18 points, although prices topped off
with UK gilt-edged stocks after some specialists reacted negatively to the
yield of 7.46 per cent and cover of 1.7x on the Pounds 2bn of bonds
auctioned yesterday. Bond prices soon recovered their poise, however, and
provided support.
Already reflecting the absence of a lead from Wall Street later in the day,
activity in UK stocks slackened at mid-session, and the gain on the Footsie
was reduced to around 14 points in the second half of the session. However,
increased business towards the close brought widespread gains among the
second line stocks. At the close, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 16.2 ahead at
3,793.9 and the Footsie 100 stocks found renewed support. Bid speculation
enjoyed a revival after some weeks of absence from the market scene.
The day's Seaq total of 618.8m shares, boosted by more than 40m shares
traded in Lasmo, was more than 18 per cent down on the previous session;
Tuesday's 753.6m shares represented Pounds 1.56bn in retail worth, at the
higher end of recent daily averages.
This week has brought some signs that economic recovery is beginning to show
itself in company profits and dividends. The corporate list was less heavy
in London yesterday , but ICI stood out strongly as dealers waited to see if
the profit figures, due today, will reflect the improved earnings trend
reported already by such global leaders as Hoechst, Bayer and Du Pont.
While wary of expressing too much optimism after a session lacking a lead
from Wall Street, and well aware that a further tightening in Federal
Reserve credit policy remains a fact of life, analysts commented on the
improved confidence shown in the UK market.
When the US markets re-open today, they will face a list of important
Federal data on US gross domestic product and unemployment claims, as well
as a bond auction. The UK stock market showed earlier this week that it can
still be highly vulnerable to developments in credit markets on the other
side of the Atlantic.

FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upsurge in corporate activity prompted increased turnover in the options
market yesterday, although the futures continued the week's familiar pattern
of thin trading and direction-less drifting, writes Christopher Price.
The June futures contract opened brightly at 3,140, near its low of the day,
inspired in part by a good showing from gilts and bunds.
Consolidation followed, although there was a slight hiccup in the contract's
slow forward momentum in mid-morning with disappointing results from the
gilts auction. However, this proved only a temporary glitch and June
continued to edge forward with trading confined to a tight 20-point range
for most of the day.
With Wall Street closed, there was no directional help for June in the
afternoon session, and the contract drifted, finally closing at 3,153. With
seemingly little investor enthusiasm, volume was a thin 6,900. But dealers
reported an upturn in after hours trading, with June moving up to 3,164.
Lasmo again topped the stock options as the speculation over its future
attracted heavy buying. Turnover hit 7,581 contracts, equivalent to 7.5m
shares in the equity market. Overall turnover reached 37,037, with FTSE
volume at 7,517. Hanson was the second top stock option at 3,395.

FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullish remarks by Lord Rockley, chairman of Kleinwort Benson, at the
merchant bank's annual meeting, triggered a burst of heavy buying for
Kleinwort shares and a general upturn in the merchant banks.
These have suffered badly in the market following the steep falls in
international bond markets in the wake of the US Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy. Many of the big US investment banks are said
to have suffered big losses in markets.
Lord Rockley said the bank's overall performance in the first quarter was in
line with that for the same period last year. The news was greeted with
widespread relief by dealers and analysts.
Kleinwort shares jumped to 485p before ending 38 higher at 483p. Other
merchants also attracted heavy support, with Hambros adding 13 to 364p,
Schroders 30 to 1285p and SG Warburg 22 to 732p.
Consideration of BAT Industries' acquisition of American Tobacco saw the
tobacco to insurance conglomerate's shares improve 4 1/2 to 461p, while
sector stablemate Rothmans International gained 15 to 408p.
Pharmaceutical issues rebounded after a period of extended weakness. Glaxo
and Wellcome bounced 11 apiece to 564p and 510p.
ICI spurted forward 16 to 853p ahead of first quarter figures today.
Transport and hotels group P &amp; O slid 12 to 715p as analysts fretted at the
change in depreciation policy for bulk and container ships mentioned in the
company's report and accounts.
NFC shed 3 to 232p after a block of 650,000 shares was placed in the market
at 231p.
A shortage of stock sent conglomerate Hanson forward 4 3/4 to 275p after
Lehman Brothers reiterated its but stance. The US investment bank believes
the shares are worth 300p in the short term.
The oil majors attracted further strong support from UK fund managers, with
BP moving up 9 more to a record 399p on turnover of 9.3m shares. Shell,
still sustained by the Pounds 350m boost to second quarter income by a big
asset sale in the far east, added 8 at 736p.
The takeover action involving Lasmo produced interest in the smaller oil
stocks where Goal edged up 2 to 73p and Premier the same to 31p.
In a generally firm utilities sector East Midlands Electricity jumped 8 to
568p following a strong buy recommendation from the Smith New Court
utilities team.
The leisure sector was deeply divided over the latest deal from Compass,
which confirmed it is to spend Pounds 300m on buying US food service group
Canteen. It is to be partly funded by a 6-for-19 rights issue at 270p
raising Pounds 145.9m.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court was positive. 'It's in a business they
understand and substantially increases prospects for earnings growth.'
Others were less impressed, including NatWest Securities which removed the
stock from its buy list. Mr Mark Finnie said the deal 'takes Compass into
unchartered territory and raises the risk profile of the company.' Compass
shares slid 6 to 310p.
Logica, the software consultancy group, improved 15 to 300p as Hoare Govett
issued a buy recommendation. The house argues that the new management team
is well poised to improve margin growth.
VSEL, the submarine manufacturer, rose 15 to 995p on hopes of a Ministry of
Defence order.
Holiday group Airtours confirmed its intention to buy a Scandinavian tour
company for Pounds 74m, to be funded largely by a rights issue. The shares
fell 18 to 448p. Williams Holdings fell 9 to 379p on turnover of 10m after a
Pounds 267m rights issue.

FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bids alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of bid activity in the London market saw a number of old
speculative targets taken out of the cupboard and dusted down. The main
vulnerable companies were seen to be Vickers, Fisons and United Biscuits,
but each were also supported for other reasons.
UB was being linked with American Brands, flushed with cash from this week's
Dollars 1bn deal with BAT, although food manufacturing analysts said a
link-up with US food giant Nabisco would make more strategic sense for the
UK company. However, they also pointed out that UB was benefiting from good
results from the snack division of PepsiCo, the US food and drink group. UB
shares advanced 11 to 359p.
Fisons a perennial takeover subject, rose 6 to 155p, the shares receiving
help from a strategic overview published by Smith New Court. The house has
added the company to its list of core stocks. The house also added Reckitt &amp;
Colman to the list. The thinly traded stock jumped 16 to 664p.
Vickers gained 5 to 199p ahead of its annual meeting today. Robert Fleming
Securities argue however that the main support lies in the recovery of the
company's Roll's Royce car division.

FT  28 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lasmo stakebuilding/takeover story that has been bubbling since the
group announced its Pounds 219m rights issue two weeks ago burst into the
open yesterday when Enterprise Oil admitted that it was considering a bid
for the oil exploration group.
The story took a further turn late in the day when rumours swept the market
that British Gas was about to wade in with a 180p a share bid. It was Gas
that triggered the flurry of takeover bids - involving Britoil, Lasmo and
Tricentrol - in the late 1980s when it launched an unsuccessful dawn raid on
Lasmo.
The Enterprise statement triggered a fresh flurry of activity in Lasmo
shares which raced to 167p before closing 9 1/2 higher at 162 1/2 p on
turnover of 44m. The nil-paids leapt 8 1/2 to 57 1/2 p with 7.2m traded. The
traded options were the market's most active with the equivalent of 7.6m
shares changing hands.
Enterprise shocked the market and triggered an immediate mark-down of its
own shares which hit a low of 425p before rallying to close 6 off at 445p.
Dealers said the recovery came as the market picked up the scent of a
British Gas bid which would enable Enterprise to walk away from what is
being viewed as an increasingly expensive acquisition.
Analysts were perplexed at Enterprise's role in the saga; 'If they wanted to
bid for Lasmo why did not they move a couple of months ago when the company
was in real trouble, with no real management and big financial problems?'
said one specialist. Gas shares, weak earlier this week as talk of a
possible bid for Lasmo circulated, eased 2 1/2 more to 295p.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan reaches another
eight-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milan's continued on its record setting way and the rest of Europe took
encouragement, in spite of Wall Street's unscheduled closure, from an easing
in the German repo rate, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN saw some profit taking late in the day as the appointment of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi as prime minister was expected imminently. The Comit index
registered a rise 11.65 to another eight-year high of 813.63.
Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers remained enthusiastic for the market,
even at current heady valuations. He noted that it had underperformed other
European markets over the past four years and its valuation in comparison
with bonds was still cheap. 'I think that the market could still go higher.
If political uncertainties caused a correction of, say, 10 per cent, I would
view that as a further buying opportunity,' he said.
Speculative selling hurt the biggest recent gainers. Olivetti fell L67 to
L2,999 in heavy volume of 23.6m shares in largely technical trade after its
strong advance through resistance at L2,900 on Tuesday. The shares peaked at
L3,140 yesterday, well short of the next resistance target of L3,500, before
sellers moved in.
Cir, the group's industrial holding company rose L64 to L2,890 amid renewed
rumours of a merger with Cofide, the ultimate holding company for the De
Benedetti family's interests. Cofide rose L79 to L1,837.
FRANKFURT was encouraged on a number of fronts: a reduction by the
Bundesbank in the repo rate, ahead of today's meeting of the council,
further good figures from the chemical sector, Bayer being the latest group
to announce results, and a boost for Daimler from its Mercedes unit
forecasting an improvement in 1994 sales.
The Dax index closed the official session up 10.37 at 2,253.57.
There was also help from the futures market and in the after market the Ibis
indicated index improved further to 2,256.
Daimler added DM7.30 to DM889 while Bayer, which forecast that profits would
rise by 15 to 20 per cent this year gained DM8.80.
In contrast Volkswagen lost DM14.30 to DM524.50 on news of further
investigations involving Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez Arriortua.
AMSTERDAM failed to hold onto Tuesday's gains and the AEX index declined
1.10 to 417.32, mainly due to selling of financial stocks. ING, for example,
lost Fl 1.30 to Fl 240.10.
The market overall was particularly affected by Akzo Nobel trading ex a
dividend of Fl 5.00, the shares losing Fl 3.70 to Fl 223.20. In contrast DSM
added Fl 1.20 to Fl 138.90.
Heineken, off 90 cents at Fl 240.10, said that it was to take legal action
against unions following strikes at its domestic plants which have hit
production.
PARIS was encouraged by hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates today and
the CAC-40 index advanced 16.41 to 2,147.32. Eurotunnel was up FFr1.75 to
FFr43.20 after its announcement that it was to raise some Pounds 650m in
senior bank debt as part of its refinancing package.
ZURICH continued firmer, in quiet trade, with direction again provided by
stronger bond futures and firmer bourses elsewhere in Europe. The SMI index
rose 15.1 to 2,791.3.
Insurers were again the strongest sector as they catch up after recent
underperformance. Zurich bearers rose SFr30 to SFr 1,282.
Nestle was unchanged at SFr1,210, with investors unimpressed with the
outcome of its press conference. The group announced volume growth, a
measure of the absolute number of goods sold, rose by 1.5 to 1.7 per cent in
the first quarter, compared with expectations of a rise of 2 per cent or
more.
MADRID saw gains across the board, in response to foreign market trends and
the German repo rate cut, which took the general index 3.32 or 1 per cent
higher to 325.38 in heavy turnover of Pta3.13bn.
Banesto rose Pta100 or 15 per cent to Pta580 and Santander recovered Pta100
to Pta5,810.
James Capel commented that having got over the initial shock of the
successful bid of Pta762 per share for 60 per cent of Banesto and having
received timely presentations from Santander on the rationale for the offer,
the market has made the appropriate adjustment to the Santander share price.
From this level, the shares have every chance of performing at least as well
as any other Spanish bank stock on a one year view.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuelan markets stagger in wake of
resignation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela
Financial markets reeled following the resignation of Ms Ruth de Krivoy,
president of the central bank, which traders interpreted as a vote of
no-confidence in government economic policy, analysts said.
The Caracas Stock Exchange registered sharp losses, with the Merinvest
independent index plunging 4.28 per cent downward to close at 108.90.
Ms de Krivoy, who assumed the central bank presidency in April 1992, had
kept monetary policy tight to bring down inflation, now at an annual rate of
45 percent, and to protect foreign reserves.
The bolivar came under immediate pressure, weakening 0.20 against the US
dollar in the morning to trade at 117.45/117.55 in banks.
Canada
With Wall Street closed, Toronto stocks rose in quiet trading, with the
market focusing on a flood of first-quarter financial results. The TSE 300
index added 23.97 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 4,287.77.
Advances led declines 398 to 306, volume of 42.29m shares compared with
Tuesday's 65.01m, and trading value was CDollars 504.9m against CDollars
870.1m.
Ten of the 14 stock groups rose and one was unchanged. Mining gained 1.24
per cent, industrial products, golds, banks and consumer products were
somewhat higher, and energy stocks were flat.
Mexico
Stocks closed higher, but off their session highs, following a drop in
short-term Mexican interest rates and remarks by Mr Pedro Aspe, Finance
Minister, that Mexican interest rates had peaked.
The 36-share IPC index closed up 48.65 points, or 2.13 per cent, at 2,332.78
after pulling back from a high of 2,363.87 around midday.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up in low volume,
Hang Seng down
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Most investors were absent ahead of the Golden Week holidays, but buying by
financial institutions and investment trust funds helped stocks post modest
gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 100.22 to 19,729.15 after a low of 19,612.82 and a
high of 19,813.86 just before the close. Volume was 210m shares, the lowest
for the year as many investors refrained from activity due to the string of
holidays which start on Friday, and uncertainty over domestic politics and
currency movements.
Small lot buying amid low volume pushed share prices higher along with a
rise in futures prices. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose
3.59 to 1,601.51 while the Nikkei 300 gained 0.57 to 292.70. Gainers led
losers by 514 to 457, with 193 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.98 to 1,307.83.
Individual investors were seen trading speculative shares. Some traders see
the moves connected to the political unrest as the possibility of an early
election has increased due to the Socialist Democratic party's departure
from the coalition government earlier this week.
Sumitomo Coal Mining, the most active issue of the day, rose Y38 to Y993 on
speculative trading. Pacific Metals, which fell Y15 to Y455, was initially
higher on early buying by individual investors, but closed lower on profit
taking.
Remarks by the chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation that steel
demand was bottoming out, supported steel stocks. Sanyo Special Steel rose
Y8 to Y440 and Kobe Steel advanced Y3 to Y288.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, a benchmark for investor confidence, fell
Y1,000 to Y885,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 44.79 to 21,957.33 in volume of 14.2m shares.
Nintendo rose Y60 to Y6,620 on bargain hunting.
Roundup
Profit-taking left a number of regional markets lower.
HONG KONG finished sharply lower, unable to find reasons to extend Tuesday's
gains. The Hang Seng index lost 215.39 or 2.31 per cent, at 9,113.25, just
above its low for the day. Turnover was a light HKDollars 2.98bn against
Tuesday's HKDollars 4.06bn.
Property issues were squeezed by profit-taking after they led Tuesday's
rise.
Cheung Kong slipped 75 cents to HKDollars 37, Henderson Land lost HKDollars
1 to HKDollars 39 and SHK Properties fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 47.75.
MANILA fell back as investors paused to take profits after three days of
gains. The composite index fell 26.61 at 2,840.98, prompting expectations
that the correction will last for another two days before the market tries
to break through resistance at the 2,900 level.
AUSTRALIA was left lower by one arbitrage-related transaction worth about
ADollars 390m and bonds also finished weaker.
The All Ordinaries index closed 9.7 down at 2,059.7 after climbing to a high
of 2,083.2 early in the session.
Among leading stocks, News Corp ended 4 cents higher at ADollars 9.29 but
BHP slipped 8 cents to ADollars 16.84, off a high of ADollars 17.14.
SINGAPORE continued to give way to profit-taking ahead of today's closure of
Wall Street and the release of the US first quarter gross domestic product
figures tomorrow.
The Straits Times Industrials index closed 23.56 or 1 per cent lower at
2,290.71.
TAIWAN picked up after Tuesday's fall as buyers returned for plastics and
papers issues. The weighted index, still unable to break out of the
5,800-6,000 range, rose 31.82 to 5,882.98, off a low of 5,805 points, in
turnover that fell to TDollars 63.1bn from the previous TDollars 89.9bn.
China Airlines fell TDollars 2.00 to TDollars 54.50 after Tuesday's crash of
a CAL airliner in Nagoya, Japan.
SEOUL was helped higher as demand switched from low priced issues to blue
chips during the afternoon and the the composite stock index closed 9.79 or
1.1 per cent higher at 897.43. The market also heard rumours that the
government was close to a decision to ease regulations on stock
transactions, although the finance ministry officials said nothing has been
decided and no announcement was due in the near future.
BANGKOK built its hopes for improved first quarter results from listed
companies and the SET index rose 10.92 or 0.9 per cent to 1,274.71 in thin
trading.
KUALA LUMPUR remained weak on profit-taking but gains in blue-chips limited
the fall in the composite index to just 0.12 at 1,053.35.
BOMBAY dipped in sluggish trading which left the BSE 30-share index ended
27.44 lower at 3,753.08.
JAKARTA was firmer in active trading on local and foreign buying of blue
chip stocks, and the official index rose 7.38 to 641.70.
NEW ZEALAND saw higher prices for a number of mid-tier stocks which lifted
the NZSE-40 capital 11.17 to 2141.35.
Lion Nathan added 8 cents to NZDollars 3.68 in response to half year profits
that were at the top end of expectations and a higher dividend.
KARACHI's 100-share index fell 47.20 or 2 per cent to 2,361.40 on heavy
selling by retail investors seeing uncertainty oin the political outlook.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Fundamentals in place in spite of
setback - John Pitt surveys trends among emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tightening of US monetary policy has made its effect felt on the world's
emerging markets this year. After impressive gains in many of the markets
throughout 1993 a reversal of fortune has been witnessed during the last
quarter.
According to Baring Securities' April issue of Global Strategy, emerging
equity markets attracted some Dollars 40.5bn during 1993 (this figure
excludes Hong Kong and Singapore), with most of that originating from the
US. Looking at the regional division of the fund flow reveals that almost 50
per cent went to Latin America, with some 45 per cent going to the Pacific
Rim. Surprisingly only Dollars 2bn or 5 per cent was directed towards
Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, suggesting caution on the part
of investors from western Europe.
In spite of recent setbacks, Barings asserts that 'stronger economic
fundamentals of emerging markets should reassert themselves by the second
half of 1994'. Dividing the markets into three groups - export-led (north
east and south east Asia), resource producing (Latin America) and
consumer-orientated (eastern and southern Europe and Indian sub-continent) -
Barings suggests that external factors, higher commodity prices and faster
world trade growth, 'will ultimately raise the liquidity of the first two
emerging market groups, and of these it is the resource producing that stand
to enjoy the greater profit gains, given their higher fixed cost
structures'.
But, they add, while such external influences remain weak, outperformance
should be seen from, in particular, India, Brazil and 'the reforming eastern
European and southern European markets'.
Brazil was, according to research from Kleiman International in Washington,
one of the first quarters best performers in dollar terms. 'Foreign
investors placed some Dollars 5.5bn into the country in 1993, five times the
1992 figure, 80 per cent into stocks and the rest in debentures and bank
deposits,' says Kleiman.
Over the last week or so the equity market has corrected sharply, although
clawing back slightly this week, in reaction to the rise in US interest
rates.
The longer term picture is clouded by congressional and presidential
elections in October, and efforts by the present administration to secure
support for its constitutional reform programme.
Looking elsewhere, the case for Africa is being made by a number of brokers
and analysts, not the least Blakeney Management in London.
Aside from South Africa, which is hardly an emerging market, the sub-Saharan
countries are likely to benefit from higher commodity prices. According to
Blakeney, 'higher prices for copper, gold, coffee, cocoa, phosphates,
platinum, nickel and other commodities will bring prosperity to Africa,
while the 'dragons' struggle to protect their processing margin'.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Toronto marks time in the absence of
Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada
In the absence of Wall Street Toronto stocks edged higher led by gains in
the precious metals, real estate and mining sectors.
Dealers said that the market would continue to focus on results from the
current first quarter earnings period.
The TSE 300 index was up 5.99 at 4,269.79 by mid morning on volume of 4.3m
shares valued at CDollars 46.5m. Advances led declines 133 to 92, with 168
stocks unchanged.
Of Toronto's 14 sub-groups, 10 indices gained ground in early trading.
The gold and silver index climbed 62.32 or 0.67 per cent, to 9,328.62.
Strong gold stocks were led by Placer Dome, up CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 28
1/8 in light volume.
Other rising sectors included mining, up 24.93 to 3,487.64, and real estate
which rose 20.67 to 3,046.21.
Among active stocks, Northern Telecom extended Tuesday's gains after posting
an unexpected first quarter profit. The stock gained CDollars 3/8 to
CDollars 41 3/8 on 27,500 shares.
Venezuela
Venezuelan equities fell back following the resignation on Tuesday of the
president of the central bank over a disagreement regarding the government's
economic policies. President Ruth de Krivoy said her decision was
'irrevocable'. The bank said that three other directors had also resigned.
On Tuesday the general index lost 0.5 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo recovered from earlier lows, but remained down at
mid-morning in thin trade as the market awaited news on whether congress
would vote on anti-inflation legislation. The Bovespa index was off 1.4 per
cent at 15,618 in thin volume of CR52bn (Dollars 42m).

FT  28 APR 94 / Markets Report: German rates lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a decisive decoupling of US and European interest rates was
improved yesterday by another generous cut in the German repo rate, writes
Philip Gawith.
The Bundesbank cut the repo by 11 basis points to 5.47 per cent, more than
most commentators had expected. The dollar failed, however, to gain strength
from lower German rates, closing in London at Dollars 1.6727 against the
D-Mark from Dollars 1.6801. It fell to Y102.650 from Y102.925 against the
yen.
Afternoon trade was subdued with most US financial markets closed to honour
the late President Nixon.
Elsewhere the pound held on to the gains it had made on Tuesday, with the
sterling index finishing slightly higher at 80.5 from 80.4. It was half a
cent up against the weaker dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5066 from Dollars
1.5015. Against the D-Mark, it closed slightly weaker at DM2.52 from
DM2.5226.
For the second time this month, the UK money markets were witness to the
fairly rare spectacle of a daily surplus rather than the normal shortage.
The surplus was Pounds 100m.
The Bundesbank's move appears to confirm that futures markets have become
too bearish about the outlook for European interest rates. Mr Nick Parsons,
treasury economist at CIBC, said the aggressive rate cut was 'signalling
that the decoupling of European rates from the US will continue.'
Interest rate sentiment has deteriorated dramatically in recent months. Mr
Parsons notes that the spread between the March 95 euromark contract and the
June 94 contract shrunk from a high of 84 basis points on January 11 to
actually become negative earlier this week. Both contracts finished at 94.80
yesterday.
The CIBC analyst said he attributed the Bundesbank's fairly aggressive
stance on interest rates to a desire to stop the decline in sentiment.
Noting that in each of the last three rate cut cycles, the pace of easing
has accelerated after 18 months, Mr Parsons said this pattern is repeating
itself.
The Bundesbank's first cut in this cycle was in September 1992. He predicts
German three month money, currently at 5.35 per cent, will fall to 4.30 per
cent at the year end. The December euromark contract, by contrast, closed at
94.86, discounting short rates of about 5.15 per cent at the end of year.
While the repo rate fell, call money rates rose sharply to about 6 per cent
from 5.35/5.45 per cent. Traders said the Bundesbank had not delivered the
funds the market had anticipated at the repo.
The D-Mark was slightly firmer in Europe. It closed at FFr3.434 against the
French franc from FFr3.432, and L961.5 against the Italian lira from L958.4.
Apart from a late flurry of activity, the interest rate futures markets were
fairly quiet. Sentiment was improved by the Bundesbank cut, with the June
euromark contract finishing six basis points higher at 94.80.
Traders reported that just before trading closed, a US investment bank had
placed a huge order for 20,000 June contracts.
Mr Richard Phillips, futures analyst at brokers GNI, said the market was
currently characterised by spread-trading, with investors unwilling to take
a longer view. Trade is very volatile, but in a fairly small range.
'The nature of the market is such that the investors are simply not there.
Everybody who plays the market is a trader. Nobody is prepared to take a
directional view,' said Mr Phillips.
Short sterling futures also had a better day. Although volumes were fairly
thin, the June contract closed three basis points firmer at 94.61. The
French market was descibed as 'listless'. The June PIBOR future settled four
basis points firmer at 94.32.
Opinions about the outlook for sterling are mixed after the UK currency
maintained its break above Dollars 1.50 against the dollar.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said said he was
bullish about sterling. He cited three factors lending support to the pound:
the perception that UK rates were unlikely to fall in the near future; the
sharp cut from the Bundesbank; and scepticism about how fast the Fed will
tighten rates in the US.
'The fundamental buoyancy for sterling is also backed up in a lot of
exchange rate charts,' said Mr Norfield. He predicted that the UK currency
was 'reasonably well set up' for a 1 per cent increase in the next few days.
Others were more sceptical, arguing that sterling strength would evaporate
as soon as the dollar recovered. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency
strategist at Citibank doubts whether sterling can rise above its high for
the year of DM2.6250.
He attributed current sterling strength to the view in the money markets
that 'any chance of an early rate cut is slim, to say the least.' He said
the CBI dropping its call for lower rates was also seen as an important
event.
The surplus in the money markets was attributed to seasonal factors which
see more money flowing in at this time of year. Overnight rates moved in the
1 1/2 - 4 3/4 per cent range.

FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee retreats after Brazilian
sales agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When trading re-opens in New York today after the day of mourning for
ex-President Nixon, coffee prices are expected to slip back. There has been
a sharp fall in the London market.
Trading was light at the London Commodity Exchange, where July robusta
coffee futures fell Dollars 13 to Dollars 1,476 a tonne. Traders suggested
the market was taking a breather after the recent run-up in price.
But the New York market could show a reaction to Tuesday's agreement in
Brazil on plans for the sale of 2.4m bags (60kg each) from the government's
stockpile this year in spite of strong opposition to it.
The Brazilian government has agreed to auction 150,000 bags to the soluble
industry in May and June along with 300,000 bags to the roasters. The rest
will be staggered over the following months although the government says the
sale will be dictated by necessity.
Traders believe that, although the Brazilian coffee auction is directed at
the domestic market, it is bound to have a knock-on effect on international
trade by freeing more supplies for export. 'It does slightly change the
fundamentals of the market and in my view, reduces its potential,' one
trader said.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at GNI, said that the Association of
Coffee Producers, which is sticking to the export retention scheme, was
worried that Brazil's stock sales would delay the return of resonable market
prices to the industry. 'Indeed, the repercussions could even trigger a
price collapse if the aftermath forces the ACPC to disband,' he warned in
GNI's latest futures and options briefing.
Coffee producers are expected to halt retention of arabica coffee for export
after the daily indicator price reached 80 cents a pound yesterday. On
Monday the indicator for robusta coffee broke through 70 cents a pound,
which is the level that should trigger stock releases. Retention plan
officials will meet in London next month to discuss any sales.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Zinc and nickel make late gains at
the LME - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals ended the day trading in recent well-established ranges with the
closure of the New York Commodity Exchange stifling activity in the COPPER
market. But zinc and nickel prices moved higher as buying picked up in the
after hours 'kerb' session.
ALUMINIUM weathered Chinese selling to maintain early gains reflecting
speculative buying and short-covering. Last business for the three months
delivery position was at Dollars 1,296.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50.
Three months ZINC recovered from a low of Dollars 932 a tonne on the back of
late brisk commission house buying and short-covering. It closed at Dollars
945, up Dollars 9 from Tuesday.
NICKEL, after finding support at Dollars 5,300 a tonne for three months
delivery, moved higher in late trading amid European trade buying to end at
Dollars 5,365, a gain of Dollars 35.
Trading was very slow on the precious metal markets after a featureless
options expiry.
GOLD fixed at Dollars 374.25 a troy ounce, just 10 cents down on the morning
setting and 5 cents below the Tuesday afternoon fixing. 'Everything has come
off a bit. There is very little business going on,' one dealer said.
Gold had gained some early support from the rather fraught start to polling
in South Africa and was marked up a couple of ticks after news of the bomb
at Johannesburg airport, dealers said.
SILVER was quiet all day and slipped to a cent under the Dollars
5.17-Dollars 5.19 opening by mid-afternoon after gaining a couple of cents
earlier.

go-ahead earlier this year for a Dollars 9bn liquefied natural gas project
that will by the end of the century make gas almost as important as oil to
the sultanate's export revenues.
The shift in emphasis to gas is part of strategy to lead the country away
from dependence on its limited oil reserves, which will start to decline
within the next 20 years. Most recent discoveries have been of
non-associated gas (found separately from oil fields) and this makes the
economies of a large export facility more attractive. More than five
trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas was found last year.
'Reserves keep on improving every month and we're quite confident that
current estimates of 20 trillion cubic feet of gas will double by the end of
the decade, and will be enough for 50 years,' said Mr Khalifa al-Hinai,
director general of gas, after the LNG project was given the green light in
February.
But the low oil price, which has had a knock on effect on LNG rates, has
made Oman rethink its original plans and it is considering where costs can
be cut. The USDollars 9bn price tag was always at the top end of
expectations and Mr Khalifa al-Hinai believes that shaving costs will not
diminish the project in any way.
The gas will come mainly from three large fields in the central Wusta region
of the country - Sayl Rawl, Sayh an Nugaydah and Barik. These fields are
recent discoveries and between them have proven reserves of 6.3 trillion cu
ft.
A pipeline is to run north through the Wahiba Sands to a point near Sur,
where it will branch along the coast to the site of a new Dollars 2bn
liquefaction plant and loading facilities at Simmah. It will run underwater
for some of the way to protect the area's stunning natural beauty.
The upstream part of the project will be 100 per cent owned by the Omani
Government and operated on its behalf by state-oil company Petroleum
Development Oman. But a new company, Oman LNG, has been formed to handle the
downstream processing. Partners include Shell (34 per cent), Total (6 per
cent), Partex (2 per cent) and Japan's Mitsubishi (3 per cent), Mitsui (3
per cent) and C Itoh (1 per cent). The government will hold the remaining
capital.
Start up is scheduled for August 1999 and Omani oil minister Said bin Ahmed
al-Shanfari has said that the plant's capacity will be 5m-6m tonnes a year.
'This will make LNG production equal to that of oil and make gas Oman's
second largest foreign exchange earner after oil. It is a world-scale
project, like the projects in Qatar and Abu Dhabi,' he explained.
When the gas starts to flow there will initially be a high percentage of
condensate (a light liquid gas), which will gradually decline over the
lifetime of the project, said Mr Khalifa al-Hinai.
The involvement of Japanese companies in OLNG betrays the major destination
for the gas - Tokyo Gas has visited Muscat to negotiate buying LNG from the
project. But ministry officials have said that southern European utilities,
particularly from Spain, Italy and France have expressed an interest. Other
Asian countries, like south Korea and China, Taiwan, Thailand and India are
also being targeted.
Oman's LNG export is an important part of in a growing gas network in the
Gulf region. A Dollars 5m pipeline to transport gas from Oman to India is
under consideration and long-term the UAE, Qatar and Oman are thinking of
linking their gas systems together to provide a unified export route to
Asia. Yemen is on the edge of its gas exploitation, although its
non-membership of the Gulf Co-operation Council will hamper its inclusion.
The attraction of Oman as an export terminal is its strategic position on
the right side of the Straits of Hormuz. Japan, in particular, is worried
that another Gulf war would close the straits and considers Oman a safer
political bet.

FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa losing its appeal for
Malaysian growers - Producers are grubbing up trees as hopes of higher
prices fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so long ago cocoa was referred to as 'green gold' by planters in Sabah,
East Malaysia. In 1990 production of cocoa beans in Sabah rose to 145,000
tonnes out of a total Malaysian production of just under 250,000 tonnes.
But now increasing numbers of planters, despairing of a sustained rally in
world cocoa prices, are grubbing up their cocoa trees. Cocoa production in
Sabah fell 9 per cent to 122,000 tonnes last year while total Malaysian
production fell 10 per cent to 200,000 tonnes.
'There was an upswing in prices at the end of last year' says Mr Hashim
Abdul Wahab, head of the Malaysian Cocoa Board. 'But it wasn't enough to
make people stay in cocoa. Once again we are seeing a reduction in areas
planted with cocoa. In 1990 420,000 hectares of land countrywide was given
over to cocoa. Last year it had come down to 375,000 hectares.'
In recent years the structure of Malaysia's economy has been transformed. In
1987 commodities and mining made up 55 per cent of export values. By 1993
manufactured goods accounted for more than 70 per cent of the total value of
exports.
Increasing numbers of people have left the land for the factories in the
towns. Malaysia's GDP has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the last
six years. Wages have been rising: there are serious labour shortages in
many country areas. But international prices of most Malaysian commodities
have continued to fall.
Most of Malaysia's tin miners have given up the struggle for survival.
Rubber producers are turning increasingly to the more profitable palm oil.
Cocoa growers are following suit.
'It's very tough - especially for those in primary cocoa production,' says
Mr Hashim. 'What we are trying to do now is go into more downstream
activities and absorb more of the cocoa crop ourselves. We also need to
search out new markets like China.'
The Ivory Coast and Brazil have for some time been the world's biggest cocoa
producers, but the big change in production patterns in the last three years
has been a surge in Indonesian cocoa output. Most estimates put Indonesian
production at more than 260,000 tonnes last year.
Indonesia has plentiful supplies of cheap labour. The Jakarta government has
also been offering considerable subsidies to cocoa growers in order to open
up new plantations and encourage resettlement in sparsely populated areas.
Malaysian cocoa growers cannot compete with Indonesian production costs. It
now costs about MDollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,115) a tonne for cocoa produced on
Malaysia's estates - MDollars 2,400 on smallholdings. Costs in Indonesia are
about 25 per cent lower. Though cocoa prices on the Malaysian market have
climbed to MDollars 2,800 per tonne in recent months, many feel cocoa has
had its day in Malaysia.
The Malaysian Cocoa Board is fighting to stop a wholesale abandonment of the
crop. It points out that though Malaysia is a high cost producer, it is none
the less an efficient one. Some estates in Sabah are producing 2,000kg of
cocoa a hectare. In Africa the average is about 500kg per hectare.
Hopes that world cocoa prices will continue to rise, have been partially
revived by the agreement reached recently by producing and consuming
countries on a new five-year world cocoa agreement aimed at bringing supply
and demand into balance.
While cocoa statistics are notoriously unreliable, most analysts agree that
world production has lagged behind consumption in each of the last three
years. But world stocks are still around the 1m-tonne mark and the
international cocoa organisation has meanwhile pledged to liquidate its
buffer stock of 180,000 tonnes by 1998.
'The key is proper monitoring of world production and perhaps most
important, more commitment to encourage wider cocoa consumption,' says Mr
Hashim.
'Malaysia has been open about its production figures. We have also made
great efforts through various campaigns to increase public consumption of
cocoa. We hope other countries take similar measures. If not, we will never
achieve our aim of achieving fair prices.'

FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rice futures contract set to
join Chicago's big boys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's only rice futures contract is about to come of age.
The Chicago Board of Trade, which trades futures and options on maize,
wheat, soyabeans and other agricultural and financial commodities, plans to
adopt as its own the rough rice futures contract now traded on its tiny
subsidiary, the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.
The CBoT wants to shift the contract, which trades in units of 200,000
pounds of No. 2 or better long grain, rough rice, deliverable in 12 counties
in eastern Arkansas, under its own banner because of a recent surge in world
rice trading.
Production shortfalls in 1992 and 1993 have resulted in Japan purchasing
significant amounts of rice on the world market for the first time since
1984.
'The CBoT believes the rice contract is destined to grow as more and more
countries open up their markets to free trade. The CBoT can provide greater
visibility and a broad range of opportunities for the rice contract,' said
Mr. Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman.
Rice futures were launched in 1981 at the now-defunct New Orleans Commodity
Exchange. After three years of listless trading, the contract shifted to
Chicago, and came under the jurisdiction of the MidAmerica Exchange. Still
lightly traded, 7,621 rice futures contracts changed hands at the MidAm
during March.
US rice production has averaged about 8m tonnes a year since 1990, with long
grain rice representing about 70 per cent of that total. According to CBoT
statistics, about 50 per cent of US long grain rice is grown in Arkansas,
the deliverable area for the futures contract.
Although the US accounts for only 1 to 2 per cent of world rice production,
it exports about 40 per cent of its crop, making it the second leading rice
exporter in the world after Thailand. In 1993 the US exported 2.7m tonnes of
rice out of total world exports of 16m tonnes.

FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zaire's problems make room for
cobalt competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world had room for the substantial new cobalt production currently
planned, suggested the Cobalt Development Institute after reporting a 23 per
cent fall in output by its members in 1993.
Cobalt is a metal essential in some of the superalloys used by the aerospace
industry and for some motor industry products.
All of the 1993 drop, to 13,843 tonnes, was accounted for by Gecamines, the
state-owned producer in Zaire, once the world's biggest producer but whose
output has dwindled as the country has sunk into political chaos. The
institute said that Gecamines' output last year was 2,200 tonnes, down from
8,625 tonnes in 1992. In 1987 the company produced about 12,000 tonnes.
The other six producer-members of the institute have been increasing output
 -by 17 per cent in the past five years to 11,643 tonnes. Outokumpu of
Finland and Sherritt of Canada each have nearly doubled production in that
time to 2,200 tonnes and 1,218 tonnes respectively.
The institute estimated that, when non-members and other sources were
included, 17,263 tonnes of new cobalt was available in the western world
last year, down from 22,781 tonnes in 1992. With 3,000 tonnes left in stock
at the end of 1992, the institute said it would be safe to assume that
20,260 tonnes was available. This was in line with demand (outside Russia),
which it estimated at 19,200 tonnes.
The institute pointed out that 'the underlying trend of rapidly falling
output from Zaire asserted itself and the price going into 1994 effectively
doubled over the Christmas period.'
It added: 'There is much new cobalt production, in embryo or close to
hatching stage, in various parts of the world. They should be born into a
receptive world.'

FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continuing zinc glut forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The zinc market faced severe difficulties because of oversupply, the
International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group, an inter-governmental organisation,
warned yesterday. It dropped a broad hint that member governments should
urge their industries to take action to halt the oversupply that is swelling
stocks and depressing prices.
The study group said that information supplied by its members showed that
zinc metal production outside the former communist countries was on course
to repeat last year's record of 5.47m tonnes. Imports from eastern Europe
might be a little below the 'extremely high' 415,000 tonnes reached last
year, 'but at present there is little indication of a major reduction'.
Meanwhile, zinc consumption was forecast to improve by 1.6 per cent to 5.57m
tonnes, thanks to strong growth in North America and South East Asia.
The study group warned that 'a further substantial surplus of metal appears
inevitable unless metal production is reduced from levels currently
planned.' Stocks already are equivalent to nearly four months consumption
with 1.14m tonnes in London Metal Exchange warehouses alone.
Zinc prices have fallen by 10 per cent from the already-depressed Dollars
1,040 a tonne reached just before European producers admitted in
mid-February that their attempts to end over-capacity by the co-ordinated
closure of one or two smelters had collapsed. It was the second attempt to
deal with the structural overcapacity that has plagued the European zinc
industry for 20 years via the industry sharing the cost of smelter closures.
It is widely believed that the zinc smelter 'shut-down' deal fell apart
because producers believed some rivals had such huge financial difficulties
that they would be forced to close smelters anyway.

South Korean companies issued Won491bn in convertible bonds in the first
quarter of this year, against Won398.2bn for all of 1993, the Securities
Supervisory Board said, Reuter reports from Seoul. In 1992, they issued
Won146bn in convertible bonds.
In April, South Korean companies planned to issue convertible bonds
totalling Won298bn, which will bring the four-month aggregate to Won789bn,
an official said. Analysts expect such issues to total between Won2,000bn
and Won 3,000bn for all of 1994.
The bonds are favoured by domestic companies keen to cut costs, as they
normally carry lower interest rates than corporate bonds.
Foreigners will be allowed to buy some convertible bonds from around June.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: EC may widen derivatives
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission may modify its solvency ratio directive so that it
will cover a broader range of derivative instruments.
Mr Paolo Clarotti, head of banking and financial institutions at the
Commission, said the changes 'will increase the charges to banks for
so-called off-balance sheet risk'.
Currently, foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are covered under
the solvency ratio directive. In the future, equity, metal and other
commodity derivatives may also be covered. In addition, the two levels of
capital required for derivatives maturing in less than or more than one year
are likely to be expanded to three categories: less than one year, one to
five years, and more than five years.
In addition, the scope for netting - which allows banks to offset exposure
to the same counterparty - will be expanded.
The EC solvency ratio directive was issued in July 1988, in conjunction with
the Basle Committee's rulings on solvency ratios.
The Basle Committee is currently working on new rules for market risk, but
this work is likely to take considerably longer to complete. These rules
force banks to set aside capital to cover various types of risk.
Mr Clarotti also said that he would head a working group on derivatives to
be set up by the Commission in June. The group, which will include bankers
from various member states, will look into the risks to the financial
markets posed by derivatives.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Bonds: Good demand for Elf Aquitaine's
FFr1.5bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and REUTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the US Treasuries market closed for a national day of mourning for
former US President Richard Nixon, activity was thin and only a handful of
issuers braved the sluggish market.
The day's largest deal was a FFr1.5bn issue of 10-year 7 per cent bonds for
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine. According to a syndicate official at lead
manager Societe Generale, the paper met good demand from domestic investors.
Credit Local de France increased its outstanding issue of 5 1/4 per cent
bonds due December 1999 by another Ecu100m to total Ecu400m. The deal got a
muted response, with some dealers arguing that the coupon compared
unfavourably with recent Ecu paper, such as the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development's 6 per cent five-year bonds.
Noodle giant PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, a member of the country's largest
conglomerate, the Salim group, plans to go public on July 7 by floating 21m
shares or 2.75 per cent of its enlarged share capital, Reuters reports.
Indofood issued Dollars 500m of exchangeable bonds due 1997 in late March
via UBS which pay a step-up coupon of 3.5 per cent in the first year, 5 per
cent in the second year and 6 per cent in the third year. The bonds are
convertible to Indofood shares eight months after approval by the capital
market supervisory agency (Bapepam). A full conversion would represent about
18 per cent of the company's paid-up capital.
Standard &amp; Poor's has placed its AA- and and A-1 ratings of BAT Capital
Corporation, A-1 rating on BAT International Finance and AA- rating on
British-American Tobacco Investments - all guaranteed by BAT Industries - on
credit-watch with negative implications. About Dollars 2.9bn of long-term
debt is affected.
The move follows the announcement that BAT Industries plans to acquire
American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn in cash.
'The proposed acquisition would increase BAT's exposure to the extremely
competitive US tobacco market which is currently facing a number of
challenging issues,' the agency stated.
In a related move, S&amp;P placed its AA- claims-paying ability rating of Eagle
Star Insurance Company and its AA- financial strength rating of Eagle Star
Life Assurance Company on credit-watch with negative implications.
Historically, a key factor in both insurance company ratings has been the
firmly-stated commitment of BAT, their ultimate parent, to financial
services, and its provision of tangible support and maintenance of strong
capital at the Eagle Star group, S&amp;P noted. 'Any material diminution of
BAT's financial flexibility may affect its ability or willingness to
continue to provide similar levels of support to the insurance group going
forward,' it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade is negotiating to extend its participation in
Globex, the electronic trading system, even as it explores alternatives for
after-hours trading.
The futures exchange, which earlier this month voted not to continue its
Globex partnership with Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Matif,
was due to drop off Globex trading screens today.
However, the CBoT and the CME are under pressure from their member-firms to
reach a compromise. The CBoT has said it would develop its own local
after-hours trading system, but it would not be available until late summer.
Globex customers hope at least to keep the CBoT on line until an alternative
is available. 'We'd love to see no time in the dark (for CBoT T-bonds),'
said Mr John Benjamin, a managing director of Smith Barney Shearson in
Chicago.
A statement issued jointly by the CME, Matif and Reuters late on Tuesday
said: 'At the request of the CBoT, (we) are prepared to offer an extension
of the period for listing the CBoT's instruments on Globex until May 20
1994. This offer is made in view of the overwhelming support for Globex by
members and customers and their desire for the CBoT to reverse its decision
to withdraw from Globex.' Mr Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman, said the
extension had not been agreed upon. 'They've set a price tag (for the
extension) that we haven't agreed to,' he said.

FT  28 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank repo rate cut prompts European
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bond markets rallied yesterday, helped by the
Bundesbank's decision to lower its repo rate by a further 11 basis points to
5.47 per cent.
But market participants said they did not expect to see the German central
bank follow up its repo move with further cuts in the key discount and
Lombard interest rates.
The Bundesbank accepted bids amounting to DM55.1bn in its latest round of
13-day securities repurchase agreements at rates of 5.47 per cent and above,
down from last week's rate of 5.58 per cent.
The bund market remained firm on the news, and the Liffe bund futures
contract, which opened at 94.66, traded from a low of 94.52 to a late
afternoon high of 95.12.
'The bond markets see that (11 basis point repo cut) as reasonably
generous,' said Mr Adrian James, bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets.
Mr Reimat Jochimsen, Bundesbank council member, was quoted as saying that
the German central bank did not have to worry about any special inflationary
factors at present. However, he added that the trend in M3 money supply
growth made it difficult to make decisions on interest rates.
German M3 grew at an annualised rate of 15.2 per cent in March from 17.5 per
cent in February, way above the Bundesbank's target growth range of 4 to 6
per cent.
French government bond prices followed the German bund market, as the rate
cut raised hopes that the Bank of France may lower its intervention rate
today.
UK gilts slipped back in the wake of the Bank of England's auction
yesterday, reflecting disappointment at the cover ratio, but the market
later recovered to close little changed on the day.
The Bank of England sold Pounds 2bn of the 6 per cent stock due 1999 at an
average price of 93.23, corresponding to a yield of 7.46 per cent.
The lowest accepted bid was 93.21 (yielding 7.47 per cent) and the highest
bid was 93.26 (yielding 7.44 per cent). The cover ratio, which is the ratio
of total bids to the amount of stock actually sold, was 1.7 times, which
dealers said was below expectations.
The gilt market fell back immediately after the auction results were
announced, and the auction stock traded down to about 93.12 in the afternoon
before recovering.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 107.07 and fell to a low of
106.13, but then climbed back to settle at 106.27, almost unchanged on the
previous day's close.
In the US, trading in Treasury bonds was suspended as the country observed a
day of mourning in honour of former president Richard Nixon, who died at the
weekend.
The more positive tone established over the past week is likely to be tested
this morning when the commerce department is scheduled to release its
preliminary estimate of first-quarter GDP.
Forecasts centred on a growth rate of 3.4 per cent in real terms, although
several economists were expecting the figure of less than 3 per cent. Many
of them had shaved a half percentage point from their earlier forecasts a
fortnight ago, when the government revealed a big decline in exports.
Mr Jack McIntyre, an analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said that if GDP
comes in below 3 per cent, bond prices are likely to jump and the yield on
the benchmark 30-year Treasury could test the 7.00 per cent mark. At
Tuesday's close, the long bond was yielding 7.10 per cent.
Japanese government bonds ended close to the highs of the day, buoyed by the
strength of the currency and the release of weaker-than-expected economic
data.
Dealers said the market tone remained firm, with the Japanese currency
trading at around Y103 to the dollar, and the release of retail sales
figures - which were down 3 per cent year-on-year - showed that consumer
demand remained poor. The June futures contract opened at 111.94 and reached
a high of 112.48, ending Tokyo trading at 112.44.

A surge in beer sales helped Anheuser-Busch, the biggest US brewer, report
an unexpectedly good start to the year yesterday.
After a long period of lacklustre volume growth and indifferent results,
first-quarter net income rose by 5.4 per cent from Dollars 194.1m to Dollars
204.4m. Anheuser-Busch said if its tax charge had not risen from 34 to 35
per cent, the profits rise would have been 7.1 per cent.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, boosted by an aggressive stock repurchase
programme, rose 10.1 per cent
Higher sales produced the profits growth, the company said. Turnover rose by
4.8 per cent to Dollars 3.02bn, with beer deliveries to wholesalers rising
by 4.4 per cent and sales to retailers - a more accurate indicator of
consumer demand - rising by more than 5 per cent.
Anheuser-Busch said the growth was led by Bud Light, one of the Budweiser
family of beers, which continued to grow at double-digit rates, and by Ice
Draft, a new type of beer brewed through an ultra-cold process. Ice Draft
had steadily gained market share since its launch in January, the company
said.
The company's market share rose by 1.1 percentage points to 44.3 per cent of
total US beer sales in the quarter, reaffirming its position as market
leader. It has held the number one slot since 1957.
Mr August Busch, chairman, said the company was extremely pleased with the
performance of Ice Draft and planned to introduce Ice Draft Lite in selected
markets in May. He looked forward to favourable demographic trends in the
company's market as the 'post baby boomer' generation reached legal drinking
age.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Samsung defies car plant report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, is to press ahead with
the production of passenger cars in spite of possible government opposition.
It said it would start building a factory for passenger cars in July at a
yet undetermined site and begin producing vehicles at the end of 1997,
making it the country's fifth car company.
The statement followed a report on Tuesday by a state research institute
warning that Samsung's entry into the car industry could lead to excess
production capacity.
Samsung Heavy Industries is holding negotiations with Nissan and Toyota on
the supply of vehicle technology.
Korea's big three carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - have also expressed
opposition to Samsung's entry, claiming it would severely disrupt the Korean
motor industry.
The government may try to block Samsung's proposed car project by turning
down its application for the import of foreign technology. Samsung is
expected to file an application with the ministry of trade and industry next
month.
The ministry has the right to refuse a foreign technology import request if
it threatens the national economy.
The report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade
(KIIET), which is associated with the ministry, could be used to block
Samsung. It was commissioned by the Korea Automobile Manufacturers'
Association, and warned that Samsung's import of Japanese technology would
damage efforts to achieve technical self-sufficiency in the motor industry.
It would also lead to increased imports of Japanese car components, harming
the trade balance.

CRA, the Australian mining and resources group in which RTZ of the UK holds
a 49 per cent interest, yesterday warned it was unlikely to match its 1993
operating profit result in the current year.
Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting in Melbourne that 'if metal
prices and currencies remain as they are at present there will be a
substantial reduction in sales revenue in 1994, compared with last year,
making it difficult to come near the 1993 level of profit from operations in
1994'.
Last year, CRA saw sales of ADollars 5.93bn (USDollars 4.17bn) and an
operating profit before tax of ADollars 1.06bn, up from ADollars 730.7m. Mr
Uhrig said while the year 'had started fairly strongly,' coal profits had
been hit by industry-wide stoppages called to protest at price agreements
reached between the Australian producers and Japanese buyers.
'The next three quarters will feel the impact of lower prices for iron ore
and coal sold to Japan,' he said.
The company also said it expected to concentrate around 70 per cent of its
exploration efforts in Australia this year.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Kia considers supply deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kia Motors of South Korea is considering supplying Ford of the US and Mazda
of Japan, its two largest shareholders, with its Sportage four-wheel-drive
sports utility vehicle.
Under the proposed arrangement, Kia would start shipping Sportage vehicles
to Ford and Mazda later this year for sale in the US and Japan under their
own badges.
In addition, Ford would assemble the Sportage in Australia and Taiwan from
knock-down kits supplied by Kia, while Mazda would do the same in south-east
Asia. The supply would be 50,000 units.
But the proposal is being resisted by some Kia officials, who fear that it
will reduce sales of the Sportage by Kia's expanding distribution network in
the US.
Kia started establishing a distribution network in the US this year, with
its two main products being the Sportage and the Sephia compact car.
Industry analysts predict that the Sportage could be particularly popular in
the US, since its only direct competition is Suzuki Motors' Sidekick, a
version of which is also sold by General Motors' Geo franchise.
Sportage is also helping Kia's export drive into western Europe, started
last autumn with the Sephia. On Tuesday Kia announced that it planned to
assemble up to 30,000 of the vehicles annually in Germany in co-operation
with Karmann.
Ford and Mazda, which hold 10 per cent and 8 per cent of Kia respectively,
initially asked to be supplied with the Sportage last year. Kia turned down
the request, saying that its annual production capacity of 50,000 Sportage
vehicles could not meet their demand.
The company is now reconsidering the proposal at their request and holding
negotiations on royalty payments.
If it accepts the proposal, Kia would boost production of the Sportage to
100,000 units by the end of the year at its factory in Asan, South Korea.

<TEXT>
Lion Nathan, the New Zealand brewing group, yesterday reported a 42.2 per
cent rise in tax-paid profits to NZDollars 113m (USDollars 65m) for the six
months to February 28, helped by an improving contribution from its
Australian interests.
Mr Douglas Myers, chief executive officer, said profits from the Australian
subsidiaries received a setback during September and October, during
industrial trouble that cut production. He said market share had recovered
in the last quarter, although continued problems were being encountered by
the fall in the overall Australian beer market.
In New Zealand the company had increased its market share of the beer market
to 59.3 per cent, against the Singapore Breweries-Heineken joint venture
which recently gained control of DB Group, Lion Nathan's leading competitor.
Mr Myers said the company was confident profits would exceed NZDollars 200m
in the full year before any abnormal items.
The interim dividend from retained earnings is being lifted by 1 cent to 7.5
cents a share.
Earnings per share were 20.6 cents, against 17.3 cents.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: US power behind the telephone -
Nynex Network Systems will be advising an emerging Chinese network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nynex Network Systems, the principal international subsidiary of Nynex
Corporation, the US telecoms company, yesterday stole the march on its
competitors and announced plans to advise LianTong Communications, China's
nascent second telephone operator, on its future development.
LianTong, which is the main beneficiary of the ending of the ministry of
post and telecommunications' domestic telecoms monopoly last December, plans
to become a nationwide provider of telecoms services in China within 10
years.
Foreign equity participation in the mainland telecoms market is not
permitted, but Nynex is well placed to benefit from any relaxation in
policy. It is advising on the best way to structure what will be China's
second common carrier, which has ambitions to control around 40 per cent of
the mainland's market within the next decade.
Although China has scaled back plans to develop the country's telecoms
infrastructure to 70m telephone lines by the year 2000, from the 100m
originally planned, most observers still believe Beijing will have to allow
foreign ownership. There are currently around 20m lines in China.
LianTong is jointly owned by three central government departments -
electronics, power, and railways. The latter two possess extensive 'private'
telecoms networks throughout China.
The company is capitalised at Y600m (Dollars 5.8m), but may need as much as
Dollars 10bn through a combination of loans and equipment credits if it is
to realise its ambitious growth plans, according to Nynex executives.
Nynex and the ministry of electronics industry (MEI) will jointly study the
feasibility of interconnecting the telecoms networks operated by the power
and railways ministries. The railway telecoms network is the largest
'private' network in China.
In addition, they will study the technologies needed to deploy advanced
telecoms systems, such as combined telephony and entertainment systems, in
selected Chinese markets. Nynex also said it and the MEI would study the
formation of a joint venture that would help plan a second national telecoms
network in China.
Mr Joseph Farina, president of Nynex Network Systems, said the ministry of
electronics was at the forefront of the movement to transform
telecommunications in China. He said both parties would benefit by 'testing
21st century communications services'.
Mr Henry Van Demark, executive managing director, greater China, said China
was in a special position in being able to consider introducing advanced
technology solutions for basic telecoms needs.
The cost of providing a system capable of providing telephony, video on
demand and karaoke is not much more expensive than a system providing a
basic telephone service. But the longevity of the system - some 30 to 50
years - would be greater, he said.
Initially, however, the Nynex/MEI study will look at how to connect the rail
and power ministries' telecoms networks to see if they could be used as the
foundation for the second telecoms network which LianTong has been approved
to offer. Approval has been given for excess capacity on the rail network to
be used for long-distance communication.

speculation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Marietta, the US defence contractor that failed in its takeover bid
for the smaller Grumman defence company earlier this month, yesterday
stirred up speculation about its next target by describing the sort of
company it wanted to buy.
It said it was seeking acquisitions with annual revenues of about Dollars
1bn, and was especially interested in companies involved in high technology,
information systems and engineering.
Mr Norman Augustine, chairman, also teased speculators by hinting that the
company might be seeking to enter the airframe business because many other
large manufacturers had pulled out of the sector recently.
'Clearly, six (airframe manufacturers) may have been too many,' Mr Augustine
told shareholders at the annual meeting in Atlanta, 'but the industry has
now shrunk enough that it's beginning to be a viable business.'
He made it clear Martin Marietta was still aggressively seeking acquisitions
to fuel growth in a shrinking defence industry.
In February, Martin Marietta, which last year bought General Electric's
aerospace division for Dollars 3.05bn and General Dynamics' space launch
business for Dollars 208.5m, made a Dollars 1.93bn friendly takeover offer
for Grumman. However, it lost the acquisition to Northrop which made a
higher offer.
The Grumman takeover was the latest in a series of moves that have come with
the consolidation of the US defence industry, which has been struggling with
sharply-lower Pentagon spending since the collapse of the Soviet empire. Mr
Augustine predicted the industry shake-out would continue until at least
1997.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter result climbs 14%
at BCE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising demand for value-added telephone services helped BCE, the Canadian
telecommunications holding company, boost first-quarter earnings by 14 per
cent.
But BCE, Canada's biggest private-sector company, warned yesterday that
regulatory barriers in Canada could slow the convergence of telephone, TV
television and computer technologies, which has become a high priority of
its corporate strategy.
'Investors are increasingly nervous about (the policy and regulatory)
environment,' Mr Red Wilson, chief executive, told the annual meeting in
Toronto. 'They perceive the regulatory framework as being uncertain, the
direction of government policy as being unclear. We need to know which
markets will be open to us as investors in Canada.'
First-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 251m (USDollars 181.8m), or 74 cents
a share, from CDollars 221m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were
CDollars 5bn against CDollars 4.73bn.
The bulk of the earnings came from Canadian telecommunications, mainly Bell
Canada, the country's biggest phone company. Bell contributed CDollars 180m
to consolidated earnings, up from CDollars 132m last year.
The performance reflects higher sales of a growing array of optional phone
services, growth of network access services, and payments from long-distance
competitors for access to local networks.
BCE's other interests include a 53 per cent stake in Northern Telecom, the
telephone equipment maker; 20 per cent of Mercury, the UK telephone company;
and 30 per cent of Jones Intercable, a US-based cable-TV operator.

Bombardier, the Canadian transport equipment maker, lifted fiscal 1994
earnings by almost a third, due chiefly to a surge in demand for its
recreational snow vehicles and water craft.
The Montreal-based company's railway rolling-stock business continues to
suffer losses from its Eurotunnel contract, though this segment is expected
to return to the black this year. The quarterly dividend has been raised to
7.5 cents from 5 cents.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 175.6m (USDollars 127.2m), or CDollars 1.12
a share, in the year to January 31, from CDollars 132.8m, or 85 cents, in
the previous 12 months. Revenues rose to CDollars 4.77bn from CDollars
4.45bn.
Pre-tax earnings from the motorised consumer products division soared to
CDollars 76.4m from CDollars 28.6m. The sharp increase was attributed to
strong sales of the Sea-Doo (which resembles a waterborne motorcycle), a
revamped line of Ski-Doos (which is a motorcycle with skis instead of
wheels) and snow-blowers.
Aerospace income fell to CDollars 136.5m from CDollars 180.6m.

<TEXT>
Northern Telecom has taken another step in its top-to-toe restructuring by
selling its US finance arm to GE Capital, the fast-growing US financial
services group controlled by General Electric.
Northern Telecom Finance Corp, based in Nashville, Tennessee, has a
receivables portfolio of USDollars 600m. Net proceeds from the sale will be
somewhat lower, although the company declined to give a precise figure.
Northern plans to use the proceeds mainly to reduce its long-term debt,
which stood at Dollars 1.51bn at the end of 1993.
The sale will not only relieve Northern of a peripheral and
increasingly-complex business, but also give it access to GE Capital's
financing muscle and expertise.
GE Capital has launched an ambitious expansion strategy in recent months,
ranging from a Dollars 2.2bn bid for Kemper, the Chicago-based financial and
mutual funds group, to the acquisition of Canada's biggest vehicle-leasing
company, and an Austrian computer finance business.
Its assets totalled Dollars 118bn at the end of 1993, and it has a strong
balance sheet, having been one of the most consistently profitable US
financial-service companies.
Northern has already raised more than Dollars 1bn from asset sales. In the
most recent, it sold the UK-based submarine cable business and a fibre-optic
manufacturing plant in Saskatchewan.
Mr Jean Monty, Northern's chief executive, said yesterday the sale of the
finance unit 'will accelerate our strategy to focus on our core business
strengths'. Further details of Northern's plans are likely to be outlined at
today's annual meeting in Toronto.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: China introduced to new
foreigner-friendly exchanges - The SEC has eased regulations to encourage
more overseas companies to list shares in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is
expected to sign a memorandum of understanding with his Chinese counterparts
today in what should be the first step towards allowing more companies from
that country to list their shares on US stock exchanges.
The agreement, which commits the SEC to provide technical assistance to
Chinese regulators, can be seen in the context of a long-running campaign by
the SEC to attract more foreign companies to sell their shares in the US. It
follows a series of measures adopted by the SEC last week designed to make
it easier and cheaper for foreign companies to tap the US capital markets.
In lightening the regulatory load on prospective foreign issuers, the SEC
wants to ensure the US remains competitive with other important world
markets as a source of capital for foreign issuers. It also wants to ensure
that demand from US investors for foreign securities is not stifled by the
SEC's strict reporting requirements, which many foreign companies find
costly and time-consuming.
Last week's measures include:
allowing foreign companies to present cashflow statements prepared in
accordance with international accounting standards, rather than US
accounting principles as currently required;
allowing more companies to use a shorter form of the SEC's standard
documentation, which will reduce the cost of filing the forms;
and simplifying the process of registering share issues with the SEC.
Other, earlier, changes in a similar vein have involved broadening the
category of US institutions allowed to buy and resell privately-placed
securities issued by foreign companies; accommodating foreign reporting
practices, which do not include the release of US-style quarterly reports;
and granting individual companies exemption from SEC rules governing the
trading of securities immediately after their distribution.
Ms Linda Quinn, director of the SEC's division of corporation finance, says
of the recent changes: 'This is all part of a concerted effort by the SEC to
make clear to foreign issuers that they are welcome in the US. While
information is the key to accessing the US market, we recognise the issue of
cost and try to be responsive to that without compromising the quality of
the information being provided.'
The SEC has been looking to accommodate foreign issuers' needs - it knows
that in the past, its strict standards of financial disclosure have deterred
many foreign companies from selling their shares in the US. With US investor
demand for foreign stocks growing rapidly, the SEC did not want to obstruct
the market's growth.
'There is tremendous appetite from US investors' for foreign securities,
says Mr David Boyle, head of Citibank's ADR and corporate trust business. He
points out that in 1982, US investors owned Dollars 19bn of non-US equity
securities. 'By 1992, that figure had grown to Dollars 190bn and, by the end
of the decade, it is forecast to approach nearly Dollars 1,000bn.'
The growing hunger for foreign investments in the US has caught the eye of
overseas issuers, many of whom - particularly the newly-privatised companies
of central Europe and Latin America - find that their domestic markets are
incapable of supplying enough demand to meet their capital needs.
Consequently, foreign stock issuance in the US is running at record levels.
According to the financial information group Securities Data, Dollars 2.7bn
of common stock was sold by non-US companies in the first quarter of this
year, well up on the the Dollars 1.3bn in the same quarter of 1993. At the
current rate, 1993's record total of Dollars 9.05bn in non-US stock issuance
should be broken this year.
The one area where the US capital markets do not lead the world is in
foreign equity listings on stock exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange, for
example, lags some way behind the London Stock Exchange - its main rival in
the global securities markets - in foreign listings.
London lists 635 foreign stocks. Excluding the shares of Canadian companies
 -which have long been listed on US markets and which trade much like US
companies - the NYSE lists only 138 foreign company stocks. Among other US
markets, the Nasdaq market lists 100, and the American Stock Exchange just
25. (In most cases, these are not listings of common stock, but of ADRs, or
American depositary receipts, which bundle individual shares into baskets
sold to investors).
US exchanges have blamed the SEC's strict reporting requirements for the
fact they lag behind London. The most commonly-cited result of the SEC's
restrictions is the absence of German or Swiss company share listings in the
US.
German and Swiss accounting principles differ greatly from those in the US,
especially in that they allow companies to disguise the true nature of their
earnings performance. For years, the SEC insisted that German and Swiss
companies meet US accounting standards; for years, German and Swiss
companies refused.
A year ago, however, the SEC and Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
group, reached a compromise that allowed Daimler to list its shares on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Although most of the compromising was done by Daimler, the company's arrival
on the NYSE was hailed as a breakthrough. The NYSE hoped it would persuade
other German and Swiss companies to seek a US listing.
Yet, since Daimler, no other German or Swiss companies have come to the
NYSE. Mr Richard Breeden, SEC chairman when Daimler decided to come to the
US markets, is not surprised by this lack of follow-up.
'Typically, there is often a period of longer than a year after the first
company from a country comes in. Other companies tend to sit back and watch
(the first company's) experience for about a year, to see how the trading in
the securities looks like, and what the benefits seem to be.'
These days Mr Breeden helps foreign companies sell their shares in the US in
his capacity as head of the financial services group at Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
NYSE chairman Mr William Donaldson, while applauding the SEC's efforts to
make it easier for foreign issuers to tap the US markets, still admits to
some frustration at the slow pace of change. 'We're moving in the right
direction, but I'd like to see it happen faster,' he says.
However, Mr Breeden points out that the SEC is not a trade association for
US stock exchanges. 'The SEC's core mission is to protect investors.' He
says it should not become involved in a global race to lower disclosure
standards.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Leisure product sales bolster
Bombardier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bombardier, the Canadian transport equipment maker, lifted fiscal 1994
earnings by almost a third, due chiefly to a surge in demand for its
recreational snow vehicles and water craft.
The Montreal-based company's railway rolling-stock business continues to
suffer losses from its Eurotunnel contract, though this segment is expected
to return to the black this year.
The quarterly dividend has been raised to 7.5 cents from 5 cents.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 175.6m (USDollars 127.2m), or CDollars 1.12
a share, in the year to January 31, from CDollars 132.8m, or 85 cents, in
the previous 12 months. Revenues rose to CDollars 4.77bn from CDollars
4.45bn.
Pre-tax earnings from the motorised consumer products division soared to
CDollars 76.4m from CDollars 28.6m. The sharp increase was attributed to
strong sales of the Sea-Doo (which resembles a waterborne motorcycle), a
revamped line of Ski-Doos (which is a motorcycle with skis instead of
wheels) and snow-blowers.
Aerospace income fell to CDollars 136.5m from CDollars 180.6m. Although
revenues and operating income were unchanged, interest charges rose steeply,
reflecting heavy capital investments.
Bombardier's aerospace interests include stakes in Short Brothers of
Northern Ireland, the US business jet maker Lear, and De Havilland, the
Toronto-based commuter aircraft maker.
Pre-tax losses from railway equipment narrowed to CDollars 23.9m from
CDollars 72.6m, with revenues growing slightly to CDollars 1.3bn.
The company predicted a 'slow recovery' in this segment in 1994-95,
attributed partly to the settlement reached with Eurotunnel last December.

at Chevron
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chevron has become the latest US oil group to suffer from declining oil
prices, with a 14 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, to Dollars 424m.
After special charges of Dollars 36m to cover environmental remediation
costs and the resolution of certain royalty issues with regulators, the
group posted net income of Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.19 a share.
Blaming lower oil prices for the earnings decline, Mr Ken Derr, chairman and
chief executive, said the group's 'crude oil realisations averaged about
Dollars 4 per barrel less than in last year's first quarter'. He also said
temporary stoppages squeezed the group's sales margins.
The negative impact of these developments was partly offset by higher
production volumes and downstream sales margins from international
operations, rising US natural gas prices, and lower operating and
administrative costs, which fell 5 cents a barrel to Dollars 6.47.
Total group revenues fell to Dollars 8.3bn, from Dollars 9.1bn in the same
quarter a year ago.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: BCE ahead 15% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rising demand for value-added telephone services helped BCE, the Canadian
telecommunications holding company, boost first-quarter earnings by 14 per
cent.
But BCE, Canada's biggest private-sector company, warned yesterday that
regulatory barriers in Canada could slow the convergence of telephone,
television and computer technologies which has become a high priority of its
corporate strategy.
'Investors are increasingly nervous about (the policy and regulatory)
environment,' Mr Red Wilson, chief executive, told the annual meeting in
Toronto. 'They perceive the regulatory framework as being uncertain, the
direction of government policy as being unclear. We need to know which
markets will be open to us as investors in Canada.'
First-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 251m (USDollars 181.8m) or 74 cents
a share, from CDollars 221m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were
CDollars 5bn against CDollars 4.73bn.
The bulk of the earnings came from Canadian telecommunications, mainly Bell
Canada, the country's biggest phone company. Bell contributed CDollars 180m
to consolidated earnings, up from CDollars 132m last year. The performance
reflects higher sales of a growing array of optional phone services, growth
of network access services, and payments from long-distance competitors for
access to local networks.
BCE's other interests include a 53 per cent stake in Northern Telecom, the
telephone equipment maker; 20 per cent of Mercury, the UK telephone company;
and 30 per cent of Jones Intercable, a US-based cable-TV operator.
Northern Telecom contributed CDollars 63m of BCE's first-quarter earnings,
up from CDollars 47m. But most of the 1994 contribution came from a CDollars
51m gain from the sale of a plant in Saskatchewan.
Mr Wilson said while recent results have been disappointing, BCE has firmly
positioned itself in the telecoms business by selling all non-telecom
assets. After costly diversification in the early 1980s, Mr Wilson pledged
that telecoms is 'the only business that we intend to pursue'.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Agco clinches Massey takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Agco, the acquisitive US farm machinery group, yesterday clinched its most
ambitious deal yet with the Dollars 330m takeover of Massey Ferguson, the
UK-based group which is one of the best-known names in the world tractor
industry.
Agco, based near Atlanta, is paying Dollars 310m in cash and 500,000 of its
own shares to Massey's parent company, Buffalo-based Varity, which wants to
concentrate on its core interests in Perkins diesel engines and Kelsey-Hayes
automotive braking systems.
The deal thwarted a Dollars 350m offer from a European group of managers led
by Mr John Sword, a former chief executive of Massey.
But, as expected, Agco won the contest because of its close ties with Varity
following its 1992 purchase of Massey's North American marketing and
distribution operations.
The historic sale ends a long association between Mr Victor Rice, Varity's
ebullient chairman, and the farm equipment industry. Mr Rice led Massey
Ferguson, then based in Toronto during its financial restructuring and
retrenchments of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The parent company name was
changed to Varity in 1986.
Yesterday's deal was greeted with relief at Massey, which has seen Varity's
strategic priorities changing as it has become more deeply engaged in the
automotive industry. 'Agco is in the farm equipment business, which is our
business,' said Mr Dominic Chauvin, Massey's president.
The deal will more than double Agco's size, giving it sales of about Dollars
1.5bn this year. It will allow Agco to expand its North American farm
equipment distribution network worldwide, and give it a significant European
manufacturing base. Massey's last North American factories closed in the
1980s and its remaining plants are at Coventry in the UK and Beauvais,
France.
Massey has dealers in 140 countries, which Agco plans to use to market
equipment lines now sold principally in North America.
Mr Chauvin said the deal would reinforce Massey's position in North America,
and offer extra opportunities for the two European plants. He stressed that
Massey would continue as an entity and as a brand.
Mr Robert Ratliff, Agco's chairman, said it had agreed to pay a premium to
book value for the first time because of the high regard the Massey Ferguson
trademark commands. Agco intends to finance the purchase with an equity
offering or through subordinated debt.
Varity said it expected to use the proceeds to reduce debt and invest in
'high-return high-growth' product programmes at Perkins and Kelsey-Hayes. It
said Agco had negotiated a 10-year supply agreement with Peterborough-based
Perkins, whose engines are fitted on virtually all Massey's products.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: June date for launch of Euro
Disney rights issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks yesterday finalised plans to underwrite a FFr6bn
(Dollars 1bn) rights issue as part of the troubled leisure group's FFr13bn
rescue package, and hope shortly to officially launch the issue.
All the 61 international banks belonging to the Euro Disney loan syndicates
were asked to participate in the underwriting of the rights issue, which
forms a critical part of the rescue deal.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, is committed to taking up its full entitlement, leaving the banks to
organise underwriting for the remaining FFr3.06bn in shares.
The banks, which last week endorsed proposals to waive their entitlement to
interest payments from Euro Disney for 18 months, have for weeks been in
intense discussions over the underwriting arrangements. However, a senior
banker involved with the negotiations said that by yesterday the
underwriting had been over-subscribed.
Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution, will
be the leading underwriter after Walt Disney, having volunteered to
subscribe for FFr790m of the issue. Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque
Indosuez, joint heads of the banks' steering committee, have offered to take
up FFr300m and FFr200m respectively.
The banks now plan to press ahead with the final preparations for the rights
issue. The terms of the issue and price of the shares will be announced
within the first two weeks of June. The issue is scheduled for completion by
July 14 at the latest.
BNP and Indosuez are now attempting to secure unanimous agreement from the
banks to authorise the entire FFr13bn rescue package, which includes Euro
Disney repaying half its FFr20.3bn net debt and Walt Disney waiving its
entitlement to fees from the European company.
A majority of the 61 banks have already formally accepted the package. BNP
and Indosuez originally set a deadline of yesterday for the remaining banks
to agree. However, some 10 banks last night had not yet given their
agreement. BNP and Indosuez hope to have secured their approval by early
next week.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Zenith Data aims to break even
to aid privatisation of Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zenith Data Systems, the loss-making microcomputer subsidiary of Groupe
Bull, the French state-owned computing group, expects a strong increase in
sales this year and aims to break even at the operating level, Mr Jacques
Noels, chief executive, said yesterday.
An improved financial performance at ZDS is seen as an important element of
plans to privatise Groupe Bull.
The French company is currently negotiating with industry partners which
could take stakes in the group as part of the government's plans to reduce
its 73 per cent holding.
Mr Noels said that sales should rise by about 30 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn
this year, following a strong first-quarter performance in which turnover
grew by 73 per cent over the same period in 1993. The strong growth
contributed to a 21 per cent increase in sales in the parent company, to
FFr6.2bn (Dollars 1.06bn), in the first quarter of 1994.
According to Mr Noels, the improved sales performance reflected recovery in
the US market, where ZDS is based, improved consumer demand for portable
computers and the benefits of its strategic relationship with Packard Bell
of the US.
Last June, ZDS took a 20 per cent stake in Packard Bell and agreed to supply
note-book and sub-notebook computers to its partner. In return, ZDS gained
access to Packard Bell's marketing and distribution network, which includes
7,000 outlets in the US market.
The ZDS chairman said that he hoped the company would return to profit at an
operating level this year, with profits at the net level targeted for 1995.
He said that cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in the workforce
from about 1,700 to 1,500 by the end of the year, would help achieve this
objective.
Mr Noels declined to specify the results achieved by ZDS last year, but it
is thought to have been a big contributor to Groupe Bull's FFr5.07bn loss.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble slips 4%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble's recently-revealed losses on financial derivatives
resulted in a 4 per cent fall in third-quarter net profits to Dollars 482m
from Dollars 502m, the US consumer products group reported yesterday.
Earlier this month Procter &amp; Gamble said it would be taking a charge of
Dollars 102m against after-tax profits in the latest quarter to close out
two highly-leveraged interest rate swap contracts that turned sour.
Without the charge, which the company described as an unusual item, net
earnings would have risen by 16 per cent to Dollars 584m.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, said that the quarter had been
a strong one.
Pre-tax operating profits were up 20 per cent from the comparable period, he
said, partly as a result of cost-cutting measures and partly because the
group had seen solid unit volume gains in the US and double-digit volume
growth internationally.
Last year the group embarked on a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000
jobs to cut costs and defend its brands against competition from low-price
and own-label products.
Sales in the latest quarter improved by only 1 per cent to Dollars 7.44bn
from Dollars 7.35bn. Earnings per share, fully diluted and including the
Dollars 102m charge, fell to 64 cents from 66 cents.
For the nine months to date, sales fell by 1 per cent to Dollars 22.79bn
from Dollars 23.07bn - though the company said if the impact of exchange
rates were excluded, they would have risen by 3 per cent.
Net income for the nine months was Dollars 1.81bn.
Procter &amp; Gamble said comparisons with the previous year's Dollars 563m were
not meaningful because the earlier figure had been restated to reflect
accounting changes.
Underlying earnings, excluding the Dollars 102m charge, had risen by 13 per
cent to Dollars 1.91bn from Dollars 1.69bn and on the same basis, fully
diluted earnings per share had increased to Dollars 2.51 from Dollars 2.22.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Xerox starts off year with 5%
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox, the US document processing company, reported a 5 per cent increase in
first-quarter net profits from Dollars 125m a year ago to Dollars 131m on
its core operations. It said the increase would have been 21 per cent
without the effect of a Dollars 17m tax credit in last year's first quarter.
However, fully diluted earnings per share on the document processing
business fell from Dollars 1.08 to Dollars 1.04 because of a 10 per cent
increase in issued equity following last June's stock offering.
Total group net income fell from Dollars 189m to Dollars 129m, but Xerox
said this comparison was not meaningful because last year's figures included
Dollars 77m from discontinued operations - mainly a Dollars 62m gain on the
sale of Van Kampen Merritt, an asset management company.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive, said the increased income
from document processing was due to productivity improvements and strong
growth in equipment sales.
The world-wide document processing workforce declined by 4,200 in the first
quarter in line with company's restructuring plan announced in December.
Document processing revenues rose 1 per cent to Dollars 3.27bn - the rise
would have been 5 per cent without the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.
Revenues from digital products grew 21 per cent net of currency effects, and
now represented 19 per cent of revenues.
Inflation in Brazil meant foreign currency losses shot up from Dollars 23m
to Dollars 61m.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: European trading holds back 3M
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
3M, the diversified US manufacturing group, said that economic softness in
Europe and Japan and unfavourable currency fluctuations continued to hamper
its performance in the first quarter.
Net income slipped to Dollars 306m, or 72 cents a share, from Dollars 330m,
or 75 cents, in the first three months of 1993.
If a previously-announced charge of Dollars 35m related to breast-implant
litigation were excluded, earnings would have come in at 77 cents a share.
All figures were adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective
last month.
In spite of solid gains in the US and other Asian markets, sluggish
conditions in Europe and Japan limited overall growth in sales volume to 6
per cent. That level represents a slowdown from the past few quarters, when
volume has grown by 7 per cent on average.
The volume gain translated into a meagre 3 per cent increase in revenues to
Dollars 3.62bn, as improvement was limited by the strength of the dollar and
a 2 per cent decline in prices worldwide.
The group, whose products range from recording tape and arts supplies to
industrial adhesives and sealants, said that its performance in the US was
encouraging, as it outpaced the rate of economic growth.
Operating income in the home market climbed 13 per cent, offsetting a slight
decline overseas.
The results were in line with the expectations of Wall Street.
In spite of the lacklustre first quarter, Mr LD DeSimone, chairman and chief
executive, said the company saw no reason to revise its forecast that 1994
earnings would exceed last year's Dollars 2.91 a share.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: CRA puts Pasminco stake up for
sale
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pasminco, the only primary producer of refined zinc and lead in Australia
and a leading force in the zinc industry, has in effect been put up for sale
by CRA, the Melbourne-based diversified mining and resources company in
which RTZ of the UK has a 49 per cent interest.
CRA said yesterday it was prepared to sell its 29.9 per cent interest in
Pasminco 'subject to receiving an offer which is satisfactory as to price
and conditions'.
In addition to its current shareholding, CRA has an option over a further
19.2 per cent of Pasminco - shares which are held by North Broken Hill Peko
(North), another Australian mining and resources group. This expires on June
6.
If CRA were to exercise the option and sell on the shares, it could provide
interested buyers with a 49 per cent holding in Pasminco. Analysts estimated
that a stake of that size could fetch about ADollars 500m to ADollars 600m
(USDollars 357m-USDollars 429m).
Speculation over possible bidders for ranged widely. Names mentioned
included international companies such as South Africa's Gencor and Minorco,
and Canada's Teck, as well as local mining groups, such as Normandy Poseidon
and BHP. Pasminco shares closed 5 cents lower at ADollars 1.77.
CRA said the sale of the Pasminco shares would release cash which would be
used to fund the development of the Century zinc-lead-silver deposit in
Queensland. A year-long study is under way there, and Mr John Ralph, CRA's
chief executive, said any development would probably involve an open-pit
operation.
He added that the company had yet to decide on its initial size and capacity
of development, but regardless of the mine's size, expected a development
cost of about ADollars 600m to ADollars 800m. This would make Century one of
the largest projects in the zinc and lead industry as an initial
development, said CRA.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Hutchison stands by its Orange -
The Hong Kong group is bullish about the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who less than five months ago killed Hutchison Whampoa's Rabbit
CT-2 phone system at a costs of HKDollars 1.4bn (Dollars 182m), Mr Canning
Fok, chief executive, is surprisingly gung-ho about UK telecommunications.
The 42-year-old Hutchison chief yesterday launched the company's Orange
Personal Communications Network (PCN) in the UK, saying Hutchison has
expanded its budget for the system, due to the increasingly positive
outlook.
'When we did our business plan in September, we didn't envisage the current
level of growth. We are extremely encouraged by the market-place,' said Mr
Fok.
He will have to go some way to silence detractors, who feel Hutchison would
do better to concentrate on its core area: the higher growth economies of
Hong Kong and China.
The detractors have history on their side. The push by Mr Fok's predecessor,
Mr Simon Murray, to diversify Hong Kong's largest trading conglomerate away
from its reliance on the colony, has achieved little more than management
turmoil and losses.
In 1991 and 1992, the company wrote off HKDollars 2.2bn against its
investment in Husky Oil, the Canadian energy company, which had collapsed.
In 1993, as Husky recovered, the UK telecommunications business contributed
an exceptional loss of HKDollars 1.4bn, and operating losses all but wiped
out the sizeable contribution from the successful Hong Kong
telecommunications business.
Analysts say the overseas businesses may have lost HKDollars 5bn between
1989 and 1994. The latest cost is the HKDollars 17.4m redundancy payment to
the strategy's main architect, Mr Murray. Since Mr Fok took over in
September, overseas operations have scarcely rated a mention in company
statements and annual report.
The latter states that Hutchison 'will continue to develop its businesses in
Hong Kong, with increasing emphasis on expansion of those businesses in
China'. Yesterday, however, Mr Fok said he would silence detractors of these
overseas businesses in the most fundamental way: by demonstrating strong
profits.
He has set a precedent. Star Television was dismissed by brokers as a black
hole, but Hutchison achieved a Dollars HK1.6bn exceptional profit last year
from selling a 64 per cent stake to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
So far, Hutchison has invested Pounds 500m (Dollars 752m) in the UK
business, according to Mr Fok, and a further Pounds 250m will be ploughed in
over the next few years. The business is not budgeted to contribute a cent
until 1997. Mr James Golub, analyst at Warburg Securities in London, said
the system would be handicapped by the high price of handsets and the lack
of consumer distinction between the analogue and digital services.
Standard Chartered Securities is expecting Orange to make losses of more
than HKDollars 500m per year for the next two years. Mr Fok said the
operating performance remained within budget, and he refuted the assumption
that the Orange system would be sold.
Mr Fok admits that Hutchison is not looking to develop new businesses
outside south-east Asia, but that Orange 'does not stick out like a sore
thumb' in the context of Hutchison's ambitious telecommunications strategy
in Hong Kong.
It is planning to invest Dollars HK3.5bn in building up a fixed line network
as Hongkong Telecommunication's monopoly position gradually fades. It is
bidding for a PCN licence in Hong Kong, where new entrants such as Wharf and
New World Development are making telecommunications a more competitive
business.
In the short-term, Hutchison's Asian property, container terminal and energy
businesses can more than smooth over UK losses. Standard Chartered forecasts
net profit to increase 22 per cent to HKDollars 7.7bn this year, in spite of
Orange.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Bayer rises 18% to DM755m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer yesterday became the second of Germany's big three chemicals groups to
report a robust increase in profits for the first quarter of this year.
The group said pre-tax profits rose by 18 per cent to DM755m (Dollars 444m)
in the three months ended March, reflecting the impact of extensive
cost-cutting measures and an increase in all business sectors.
The results follow Hoechst's 16 per cent increase in first-quarter pre-tax
profits, announced on Tuesday. Figures from BASF, due today, are likely to
reinforce the impression that recovery is firmly under way in the European
chemicals industry.
Bayer confirmed its earlier forecast that profits for 1994 would rise by 15
per cent to 20 per cent. Last year, pre-tax profits fell 12.6 per cent to
DM2.35bn.
Group sales in the first quarter rose by 6 per cent to DM11bn, mainly
because of a 5 per cent increase in volume sales.
Exchange rate movements contributed 3 per cent of the increase. Together
these factors offset a 2 per cent fall in selling prices.
Bayer explained that while sales were little changed in Germany, marked
growth in Italy, the UK and the Benelux countries offset the downward trend
in France and Spain. Sales in Europe rose 2 per cent to DM6.6bn and by 9 per
cent in the US to DM2.5bn.
There was a 22 per cent increase in sales in Asia, half of which was due to
the increase in the value of the yen.

<TEXT>
Orenstein and Koppel, the German construction equipment maker, plans to
raise DM144m (Dollars 85m) with a rights issue and expects a 'modest overall
profit' this year.
The company reported a 1993 loss of DM65m, compared with a DM116m loss the
year before.
Krupp Hoesch, the steel and engineering group which owns 75 per cent of O&amp;K,
is to take up any new capital not subscribed by minority shareholders. The
company said its shares would resume trading today in Frankfurt, following a
one-day suspension.
No dividend will be paid this year and the company is not expected to have
sufficient funds for a dividend in 1995.
Mr Manfred Link, chief executive, has ordered a 30 per cent pay cut for
members of the management board and a 15 per cent cut for senior executives.
Mr Link hopes this will save the group DM16m.
O&amp;K lost DM3m on ordinary activities last year, but has set aside a further
DM60m to finance ongoing redundancies.
The company said a further 750 jobs would be lost this year, leaving the
company with about 4,550 employees by the end of 1994.
Redundancy costs were high because the workers being made redundant had been
with the company on average for 14 years, it said.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica issue to reduce
state holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering and defence group, is
planning to raise about L1,700bn (Dollars 1bn) with a rights issue, which
should reduce the state's shareholding to 58 per cent from 85 per cent.
The company described the capital increase, announced yesterday, as a means
of privatising a large part of the group, which is the main industrial and
high-technology arm of IRI, the state holding company.
IRI will subscribe L493bn for new shares in Finmeccanica, and a further
L1,000bn will be provided by a consortium of Italian and international banks
and financial institutions. The balance will be raised directly from the
market.
Finmeccanica intends to issue 852m ordinary shares, at L2,100 each, on a
one-for-one basis for each ordinary or savings share already held.
Finmeccanica's shares closed before yesterday's announcement at L2,462 in
Milan.
Finmeccanica also announced a group net profit of L33.3bn for 1993, in spite
of a first half loss of L159.9bn. This compares with a L186bn net profit in
1992. Turnover was slightly down at L10,971bn against L11,126bn.
The rights issue is the latest step in a restructuring and privatisation of
Italy's state-owned industry. In March, the outgoing government gave the
go-ahead to reorganisation of the state-controlled defence industry with a
L4,068bn increase in capital for seven companies.
The formula allowed the companies, including helicopter manufacturer Agusta,
to pass from Efim, the state holding company now in liquidation, to
Finmeccanica without burdening the new owner with an estimated L7,000bn in
debts. Finmeccanica already controls the Alenia aerospace group.
Finmeccanica said yesterday that the capital increase would be used for the
acquisition of Agusta and its sister companies, and for the reduction of its
own debts, which stood at L5,097bn at the end of 1993, against L5,310bn in
1992.
During 1993, Finmeccanica sold minority stakes in Union Switch &amp; Signal and
Elsag Bailey Process Automation on the US stock market, and floated a 19 per
cent stake in its quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary.

FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Unions urge protection for bank
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian bank trade unions yesterday called on a new government to protect
small shareholders against the influence of institutional investors on the
boards of Italy's newly privatised banks.
In the last 10 days, the outcome of shareholder meetings at Banca
Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano has led to claims that the state
sell-off has concentrated power in the hands of a few institutions, led by
Mediobanca, the secretive Milan merchant bank.
On Tuesday, BCI's new board named Mr Lionello Adler as chairman, following
the unexpected departure of his predecessor at Saturday's shareholder
meeting.
Mr Adler is chairman of Cartiere Burgo, a quoted Italian paper manufacturer
which owns just over 1 per cent of BCI and has strong links with Mediobanca.
The merchant bank is said to have been behind a last-minute decision to
remove BCI's former chairman, Mr Sergio Siglienti, from a list of 14 BCI
directors proposed at the group's shareholder assembly on Saturday.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in EniChem Augusta, the Italian manufacturer of intermediate
chemicals for detergents, rose sharply on the Milan stock market yesterday
after its parent company announced it would sell its majority stake.
About 84.25 per cent of EniChem Augusta belongs, directly or indirectly, to
EniChem, the loss-making petrochemicals subsidiary of the state-owned Eni
energy and chemicals company.
EniChem announced on Tuesday that it had appointed Swiss Bank Corporation's
mergers and acquisitions arm to seek a buyer or buyers for its EniChem
Augusta stake.
Yesterday, there was lively activity in the few shares of EniChem Augusta
quoted in Milan, with the price rising from L2,820 to L3,178 at the close.
At that price, the sale could raise more than L300bn (Dollars 177m) for the
parent company, which is trying to cut debts of about L10,000bn.
Last week, EniChem Augusta reported a net profit of L24.9bn for 1993,
against L19.4bn in 1992, on turnover of L793bn, up 15 per cent.

Tesco is to become the first UK grocery retailer to operate roadside petrol
stations - with convenience stores attached - in an attempt to increase its
share of the petrol market.
The UK's second biggest superstore group has sold petrol for 18 years and
already operates almost 200 stations selling its own-label petrol alongside
its grocery superstores.
It has now acquired its first two stand-alone stations, at Barnes and
Thornton Heath in south-east London.
These trial stations will be relaunched under the Tesco Express name next
month. As well as selling petrol, the stations will include 2,000 sq ft
shops selling a range of everyday items including fresh and frozen foods.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition for Northumbrian Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted food manufacturer, is taking a
further step in its expansion plan with the acquisition of Jesse Oldfield, a
Manchester-based cake manufacturer, for a maximum Pounds 2.56m.
An initial Pounds 1.26m will be paid via 11.68m ordinary shares, of which
6.68m have been conditionally placed on behalf of the vendors at 10p each,
subject to a 1-for-7.146 clawback under an open offer to shareholders.
In addition, 2m shares have been conditionally placed to raise about Pounds
200,000 for the company, which will meet the expenses of the acquisition,
the placing and the open offer.
Shareholders will be able to acquire these on a 1-for-23.632 basis.
A further consideration may be payable, of up to Pounds 1.3m, in unsecured
loan notes and is dependent on Oldfield's results for the year to December
31 1994.
The vendors have undertaken not to dispose of the retained 5m shares until
12 months after completion of the acquisition.
Oldfield was acquired by its present management in a buy-out from Mount
Charlotte Investments. It makes slab cake and Christmas cakes with about 60
per cent of sales effected through multiple retailers.
For 1993 its pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 235,000,
after a Pounds 100,000 bad debt provision, on turnover of Pounds 8.4m,
against Pounds 8.74m.
Mr Henry Roberts, chief executive, said that although operating in a
difficult and competitive market, NFF was maintaining its sales at
acceptable margins.
He said that the acquisition of Oldfield would prove a 'big enhancement' to
full-year profits. He expected group sales for 1994-95 to be in the Pounds
24m to Pounds 25m range.
Mr Roberts said that Oldfield had strong lines for Christmas, a season in
which NFF sales have traditionally been weak.
The acquisition provides opportunities for the enlarged group to increase
sales to a broad range of leading food retailing customers.

<TEXT>
The new man at the head of Low &amp; Bonar received 21 per cent more in pay than
his predecessor for helping the Dundee-based paper and packaging group to
show pre-tax profits almost quadrupled in the year to November 30.
Mr Jim Leng, group chief executive, received a total of Pounds 178,263
compared with Pounds 146,813 for Mr Roland Jarvis. Mr Leng's basic
emoluments were lower at Pounds 137,672, against Pounds 145,733, with a
performance related Pounds 40,691, compared with Pounds 1,080, making up the
difference.
However, Mr Leng was not the company's highest paid director. That honour
went to Mr Jim Heilig, chief executive of Bonar Inc, the North American
offshoot, who joined the board at the beginning of 1993.
He received Pounds 307,089 of which Pounds 59,286 was performance related.

Rossmont, which came to the market in December, reported pre-tax profits
down 20 per cent to Pounds 60,000 in the half year to December 31, against
Pounds 75,000 last time.
Rossmont is the holding company for Santric, which supplies washroom and
hygiene equipment. Mr Robert Burns, chairman, said Santric was enjoying a
good year, though volume comparisons with the previous 12 months were
affected by a large project at Twickenham rugby stadium in the summer of
1992.
Earnings per share came to 0.4p (0.52p) and an interim dividend of 0.2p is
declared.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 892,000, but Mr Burns said the
value of order intake was showing the predicted second half improvement,
following the normal pattern.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury converts three stores to test
format for town centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, is launching a new
town-centre format called Sainsbury's Central, designed to provide for the
convenience and 'top-up' shopping market.
The move follows the success of the Metro format launched by Tesco,
Sainsbury's biggest rival, now trading in five locations.
Sainsbury is converting three existing town-centre stores in Chelmsford,
Exeter and Epsom to the new format, and if these are successful will start
converting others. The company said it would decide later this year whether
to build new outlets in the format.
'Although firmly retaining Sainsbury's tradition of quality, convenience and
value for money, the new-style shop will provide a service more geared to
the needs of town-centre shoppers,' the company said.
The stores would serve three needs:
'Pop-in' shopping, for items such as newspapers, confectionery and snacks.
'Top-up' shopping, for customers making last-minute or forgotten purchases.
Main shopping trips.
The shops will be refitted, and the product range slimmed down and tailored
to meet these needs, as well as to make space for new delicatessen, fresh
hot foods and meat counters.
The refitted Chelmsford store - which, at just over 12,000 sq ft, is about
half the size of an out-of-town superstore - will reopen on June 14. Exeter
will follow in mid-July and Epsom in early August.
Conversion time to the new format will be about four weeks, but Sainsbury
refused to reveal the expected cost.
Since the early 1980s Sainsbury, like Tesco, has been closing smaller
town-centre stores and opening new out-of-town superstores. But it said
yesterday more than 100 of its 340 stores were still small high-street
outlets.
The big grocery retailers have been forced to rethink their expansion
programmes by increasing market saturation, tougher planning restrictions on
out-of-town stores, and competition from discount stores.
Tesco opened its first Metro in London's Covent Garden last year, and
followed it with stores in Hammersmith, Oxford Street, Bristol and
Liverpool.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent up 37% as bad debts fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Permanent Building Society yesterday reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 123.7m for the six months to March 31, up 37 per cent from the
comparable Pounds 90.2m.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts at Leeds, the UK's fifth largest
society, dropped from Pounds 84.1m to Pounds 51.9m.
Adding further, separate, charges for irrecoverable interest on mortgage
accounts in arrears and repossessions, the total charge for loss provisions
came to Pounds 62.4m (Pounds 101.7m).
The September year-end at Leeds is different from almost all other building
societies.
This means that its full-year results, announced in November, did not
reflect the fall in provisions which have already helped its competitors to
report sharply increased profits for 1993.
Leeds' full-year results for 1992-93 included a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 186.2m, but provisions rose from Pounds 105.2m to Pounds
131.1m.
Yesterday's announcement included increased net interest receivable of
Pounds 231.3m (Pounds 225.3m). In the last full-year interest received rose
from Pounds 342.1m to Pounds 428m.
Administrative expenses in the first half rose to Pounds 108.8m (Pounds
103.5m), much of the rise being attributable to investment in the life
company which is due to become operational in the summer.
The society, whose merger talks with National &amp; Provincial fell through last
autumn, is still looking for a chief executive.
Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, said that in terms of the day-to-day
management of the society the lack of a chief executive was a 'non-issue',
but he admitted that the absence of one for a long time was not a healthy
position.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate net asset value rise below
estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brixton Estate yesterday announced a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 30.5m.
The UK's seventh largest property company also revealed that it has invested
the entire Pounds 100m proceeds of its May rights issue in UK properties,
and is planning to invest a further Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m in the current
year.
Net asset value per share rose 14 per cent to 192p (168p), which was below
analysts' expectations, and the shares fell 6p to 224p.
The value of Brixton's portfolio, excluding last year's acquisitions,
increased by only 6.5 per cent (7.4 per cent, excluding the impact of
currency). This reflected the weak performance of the 17 per cent of its
portfolio outside the UK.
Mr Terence Nagle, managing director, said demand for space in the UK had
increased over the past few months. Brixton achieved new lettings and
relettings of 800,000 sq ft last year, leaving a vacancy rate of 7.4 per
cent.
Net rental income rose 9 per cent to Pounds 60.2m, while interest on
developed properties increased 3 per cent to Pounds 27.2m. There was a
further Pounds 7.4m of interest charged to the cost of ongoing property
developments, equal to the rental value of its unlet property.
The effect of recovering property values together with the cash from the
rights issue, helped reduce gearing from 114 per cent to 72 per cent.
Last year, the company invested Pounds 75m of the rights issue proceeds in
new properties, and it has invested a further Pounds 25m since the year end.
These properties are yielding 11 per cent, significantly above the cost of
long-term money.
A proposed final dividend of 5.175p makes a total of 8p for the year.
Earnings per share, adjusted for the rights, fell 8 per cent to 11.66p.
COMMENT
Brixton achieved consistent profits growth through the downturn in the
property market, but is looking unexciting in the upswing. For a company
with few development projects, Pounds 7.4m capitalised interest is high, and
its further reduction will hurt future earnings. Analysts expect net asset
value per share to rise to 225p at the end of 1994, and the company is
likely to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m, given few rental reversions
this year. With no premium to year-end net asset value and little earnings
growth to come, the shares look pricey.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: City sets sights on a less exciting future
 -Andrew Baxter examines the three-year plan which will give Babcock a new
look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Salmon had a special reason to feel relieved last week when Babcock
International announced a three-year plan which will give a new look to the
engineering contracting and materials handling group.
Mr Salmon, Babcock's managing director, had spent the last few days before
Thursday's announcement on a punishing schedule of 37 meetings with
institutions. Enthusiastic though he is for the plan, he was clearly looking
forward to running through the presentation for the last time.
Winning the City's approval is crucial, however, for a plan which hinges on
a larger than expected Pounds 78.6m rights issue, and a restructuring of the
company's energy division that - along with the division's losses - will
produce an estimated group pre-tax loss of Pounds 41.2m in the year ended
March 31.
Mr Salmon and Mr John Parker, chief executive, joined Babcock on October 4
and have been preparing the new strategy since then. They knew the City was
looking for a sign that the financial shocks and management upheaval of the
past year would not be repeated.
Also, they knew that the City believed Babcock did not have enough capital
to cope with the risks involved in sizeable contracts such as its Pounds
400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax power
station in North Yorkshire.
Analysts worried that, in an era where 'performance bonds' on substantial
contracts are the norm and advanced payments are not, Babcock was too
exposed to risk.
A sizeable rights issue seemed inevitable once the new team was fully
installed, but it is now clear that Mr Parker and Mr Salmon shared the
City's worries. Not only are they moving Babcock away from the kind of large
contracts which could individually break the company, but they are also
providing a platform for growth in the businesses that hitherto have been
overshadowed by Drax and other mishaps.
The vision of a less exciting future for Babcock, building bulk handling
installations, hydrochloric acid plants and sticking to medium-sized power
plant contracts up to about Pounds 150m - unless it is sharing the risk with
others - seems to be what the City is looking for.
'They have made it quite clear they will not be bidding for Pounds 450m
contracts a la Drax,' says Mr Jonathan Getz of Robert Fleming Securities. On
top of that, he says, pro forma shareholders' funds of Pounds 125m after the
rights issue does give Babcock sufficient capital to go forward with its new
strategy.
Mr Parker and Mr Salmon have clearly left no stone unturned in the past six
months. 'It's been pretty hectic, that's for sure, for us and for the
divisions' says Mr Parker.
With the help of the LEK Partnership, management consultants, the five
divisions were benchmarked against competitors and market prospects studied.
Divisional management has been strengthened, and all contracts and claims
risks that might undermine the recovery of future profits have been
assessed.
'We've said to managers, 'Don't surprise us,' says Mr Parker. 'If there is a
problem, get it out in the open.'
Now, with the problem-strewn energy division to be restructured and overall
risks reduced, the question is how much money Babcock can make from its new
strategy.
The remaining four divisions are profitable and cash generative, and Mr Erik
Porter, finance director, points out that materials handling, process,
facilities management and Africa have consistently produced a 'hard core' of
Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m a year in pre-tax profits. But growth prospects in
these divisions look to be more solid than spectacular.
According to the estimated results for fiscal 1994 the biggest profits
contribution - up from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 10.6m - came from the
facilities management division, which is based around the Rosyth Royal
Dockyard in Scotland.
Babcock Thorn's contract for the management of the dockyard expires in April
1996 at the latest, and Babcock is talking to Thorn EMI about acquiring its
35 per cent stake in the joint company to maximise its options in pursuing
the privatisation of Rosyth.
Babcock says the division is well placed for either a contract extension or
a purchase of the yards. But given the uncertainty over how the Royal
Dockyards will be privatised, the group is probably wisely putting most
emphasis on developing its materials handling and process divisions.
Profits in materials handling fell to Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 12.1m) in fiscal
1994, due to reorganisation costs and lower than expected orders in the
first half.
But worldwide reorganisation, along with recent acquisitions, has
transformed 16 national product-based companies into 10 broadly-based
regional companies and orders have picked up strongly, reaching a record
Pounds 153m for the year.
Babcock wants to expand the division significantly, both organically and
through complementary acquisitions, to complete the transition to a
multinational supplier of material handling systems for cement, energy,
steel, pulp and paper and marine terminal markets.
In the process division, a leading supplier of process plant to the oil, gas
and petrochemical industries, profits jumped from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 4.4m
last year, and the year-end order books jumped from Pounds 75m to more than
Pounds 120m.
Babcock now wants to build on the success achieved by the 1992 acquisition
of King Wilkinson through developing its strong relationships with customers
in the Middle East and Asia, continuing to develop new product areas such as
pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, and making modest acquisitions or joint
ventures to expand the technology base.
Mr Getz believes that, if Babcock can fulfil the potential of its three-year
plan, turnover in fiscal 1997 could reach Pounds 950m, compared with Pounds
748m in fiscal 1993. Pre-tax profits could be 'something north of Pounds
45m' by fiscal 1997, he says.
That compares with profits of Pounds 21.3m in fiscal 1993, which included a
Pounds 13m provision for reorganisation. But, he says, there must be no more
'funnies' - provisions and other financial shocks. 'We just want turnover
and profits before tax - let's keep it simple.'

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sage up 32p to 600p after US improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sage Group yesterday gained 32p to close at 600p after the
Newcastle-based accounting software company reported interim figures
indicating that problems at two US subsidiaries had been overcome.
The shares are now within 3 per cent of their peak of 619p a year ago; they
have been recovering from a sharp fall in July which followed a profits
warning relating to the US companies.
Profits before tax in the half year to March 31 rose 28 per cent to Pounds
6.86m (Pounds 5.38m), on turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 25.4m (Pounds
21m).
Sage supplies packaged accounting software, chiefly aimed at small and
medium-sized companies, and sold through a network of resellers.
Mr David Goldman, chairman, said that software sales in the UK, which
advanced 26 per cent, had been helped by a new emphasis on making it
attractive for resellers to add value to the company's products.
This had been helped by the close relationship with Microsoft, the world's
largest software supplier.
All subsidiaries were now trading profitably. DacEasy, the principal US
offshoot, made an operating profit of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 6.9m,
an improvement of 32 per cent, in a highly competitive environment.
TeleMagic, formerly Remote Control International, turned a first half loss
last year of Pounds 370,000 into a Pounds 47,000 profit on sales of Pounds
1.5m.
The latest acquisitions, Ciel in France and Dataform in the UK, continued to
make satisfactory profits.
Sage has launched a low cost accounting system for the domestic market and
intends to launch products in all its business areas which exploit the
success of Windows, Microsoft's market-leading operating system.
The company has net cash of Pounds 9m, up from Pounds 4.2m at September 30.
Mr Goldman said expansion would continue to be sought through acquisition.
The interim dividend goes up to 3.65p (3.32p), payable from earnings per
share of 22.25p (17.68p).

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Trinity Holdings up 50% to Pounds 10.6m -
UK markets for core business of buses and refuse vehicles show further
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trinity Holdings, the UK's leading specialist vehicle manufacturer,
yesterday reported a 50 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in its first
full year as a publicly quoted company.
Pre-tax profits at the group increased to Pounds 10.6m in the 12 months to
January 31, against Pounds 7.08m last time. Turnover increased by 24 per
cent to Pounds 136m (Pounds 109.9m) with all subsidiaries reporting growth
in sales, particularly exports, which overall rose 70 per cent to Pounds
59m.
Earnings per share increased by 29 per cent to 13.8p (10.7p) and a 4.2p
final dividend is recommended, making a total of 6.2p (1.5p) for the year.
The shares closed 18p higher at 308p.
Commenting on the results, Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman, said, 'The UK
markets for our core business of buses and refuse vehicles showed growth for
the second consecutive year.' But although group vehicle output rose from
2,458 to 3,439 units, the year-end order book level was still ahead of the
previous year.
At the trading level margins were broadly in line with the previous year,
but volume growth lifted operating profits to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 8.5m).
Dennis Specialist Vehicles, the market leader in both the bus and fire
markets, and Dennis Eagle, which manufactures refuse chassis, both saw sales
grow in response to the overall market recovery and new product launches.
Reliance Mercury Vehicles' markets are beginning to improve. Mr Hollyhead
said trading in the first quarter of the current year was 'substantially
ahead'.
COMMENT
The sharp dividend increase announced yesterday underlines the confidence
Trinity's management has in the group's future performance. Domestic sales
should continue to benefit from the general market recovery as well as
special factors such as the second round of tendering for refuse collection
services and the progressive bus replacement policies of private sector
operators. Overseas, meanwhile, the group's Malaysian bus manufacturing
joint venture is going ahead despite recent problems between the two
countries and should provide an important entry into the fast-growing Asian
market. Profits of about Pounds 12.5m look possible this year producing
earnings of 16.3p. The shares are trading on a well deserved prospective p/e
of 18.8.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: S Jerome helped by textiles turnround
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A turnround in its continuing textiles business helped S Jerome &amp; Sons
(Holdings) report sharply lower pre-tax losses of Pounds 404,000 for 1993,
compared with Pounds 1.56m previously.
The West Yorkshire-based spinner and weaver suffered a Pounds 750,000 charge
related to the resolution of the dispute over the sale of its electronics
subsidiary.
Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, said that for the continuing business the
operating profit before interest had risen from Pounds 82,000 to Pounds
704,000 and net interest paid had fallen to Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 468,000).
The continuing textiles business turned its pre-tax loss of Pounds 386,000
into a Pounds 346,000 profit. Sales rose 18 per cent to Pounds 25.3m (Pounds
21.4m).
A final dividend of 0.3p makes a total of 0.5p (nil) for the year. Losses
per share worked through at 4.7p (21p).
A Pounds 750,000 capital expenditure programme is planned this year, to be
spread across all activities.
Mr Jerome said the higher levels of activity seen in 1993 had continued in
the first quarter of the current year. He was cautiously optimistic that
further improvements in performance would be achieved this year.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bett Brothers shows all-round growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth across its range of activities helped Bett Brothers record a
substantial increase in profits before tax in the six months to February 28.
On turnover ahead 39 per cent to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 9.17m) the profit line
at this Dundee-based housebuilding and property group jumped from Pounds
551,000 to Pounds 3.1m.
The housebuilding side completed 84 units, up from 66 last time.
The company expects to sell more than 200 units in the full year despite the
market remaining 'challenging'.
Commercial property development contributed Pounds 1.7m to operating profit
while Bett Inns, the hotels, public houses and catering operation, delivered
improved results 'in circumstances where the trade both nationally and
locally is down'.
Interest charges dipped to Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 406,000). Gearing at
end-February was 42 per cent, down from 52 per cent at the company's August
year-end.
Earnings per share leapt to 13.85p (3.67p). The interim dividend is raised
from 0.5p to 1.25p in anticipation of a satisfactory result for the full
year'.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: DFS 'bang on target' with jump to Pounds
9.99m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DFS Furniture, the specialist upholstery retailer, yesterday reported maiden
interim pre-tax profits 47 per cent higher at Pounds 9.99m, a figure 'bang
on target' according to Mr Graham Kirkham, chairman.
The group floated last November at 260p; the shares closed yesterday at
299p, down 1p.
Mr Kirkham said that with the third quarter almost complete and taking eight
week lead times in the business into account, he was confident of predicting
'a successful outcome to the year'.
During the half year to January 31, sales rose 28 per cent to Pounds 66.6m,
with the 23 comparable upholstery stores producing sales gains of 8.7 per
cent, reflecting increased volumes and no price increases. Two stores were
opened in the half year; the group also operates three dining furniture
shops.
Operating profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 9.55m), with
margins down from 18.4 to 16.5 per cent. However, Mr Chris Ferris, finance
director, said margins had been distorted by extra promotional spending and
store openings and compared to 16.3 per cent for the whole of 1992-93. At
the time of the float DFS said operating margins for the current year would
be similar to last year's.
Pre-tax profits were affected by non-recurring items, including the Pounds
1.49m cost of the float in the latest period and the Pounds 4.14m package
paid to Mr Kirkham prior to the float in the comparable figures, which was
partially offset by a Pounds 840,000 property profit.
Interest receivable was Pounds 482,000 (Pounds 554,000). Mr Ferris said net
cash at the half year end was Pounds 16.5m, which gave the group the
flexibility to take up opportunities. The group recently paid Pounds 2m for
a freehold site for a store in Birmingham. Capital spending for the year is
forecast at Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.1m).
Excluding the non-recurring items, earnings per share rose 11.2 per cent to
7.44p. The interim dividend is set at 2.3p (notional 2.1p) and Mr Kirkham
stressed the aim was for dividends to show real growth. The notional full
year dividend last year was 6.4p.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Losses increase to Pounds 1.1m at Haemocell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Haemocell, the USM-traded medical equipment maker, increased from
Pounds 868,000 to Pounds 1.1m in the six months to February 28.
Mr Andrew Priestley, chairman, said that as anticipated, the initiative to
re-establish direct control of sales and marketing arrangements for its
System 350 range had a substantial impact on the outcome.
This reflected a period of enforced sales inactivity as the process of
selection, appointment and training of new distributors continued.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 74,000, against Pounds 542,000 previously,
reflecting the company's inability to recommence sales initiatives until
very late in the period.
Product refurbishment and repackaging, together with expenses associated
with the re-establishment of an international distribution network kept
costs high. This was despite some temporary reduction in manufacturing
capacity facilitated by higher stock levels.
Losses per share deepened from 4.3p to 5.1p.

Shares in Colorvision, the Liverpool-based television and video retailer,
fell 15p to 48p yesterday, as directors forecast a drop in year-end pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.78m to about Pounds 200,000.
An improving sales trend, which had been noted during the third quarter of
the year to March 31, did not continue beyond January, they explained. Sales
in the last two months of the period 'fell below expectations'.
The directors added that 'it would not be appropriate to pay a final

Govett Strategic Investment Trust, which aims for capital and income growth
through a portfolio of small and medium-sized UK companies, reported a net
asset value, taking prior charges at par, of 310.3p as at March 31.
The figure compared with values of 298.07p at September 30 and 270.7p at

Available revenue for the six month period was virtually unchanged at Pounds
3.52m, for earnings of 3.59p (3.58p) per share. The interim dividend is
maintained at 2.65p.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: GRT is valued at Pounds 57.2m via 160p
placing price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in GRT, the bus and coach operator which is coming to market through
a placing with institutional investors, were priced yesterday at 160p,
valuing the Aberdeen-based group at Pounds 57.2m.
A total of 13.7m shares, representing just over 38 per cent of the expanded
capital, are being placed by James Capel, of which 11.25m will be placed on
behalf of the company.
The management and employees are expected to retain about 56.3 per cent of
the enlarged equity.
The placing will raise Pounds 17m net of expenses for the company. Of this
Pounds 10.6m will be used to repay bank borrowings, and the balance will
help finance future investments and acquisitions.
GRT, which runs local bus and coach services mainly in the north-east and
central belt of Scotland, as well as Leicester and Northampton, is one of
the the fastest growing operators in the industry.
In the five years since its formation through a management buy-out of
Grampian Regional Council's bus and coach undertakings, the business has
grown from 242 buses in Aberdeen to 723 buses operating in four main areas
in the UK.
The prospectus, which was issued yesterday, also includes an estimate that
operating profits in the 52 weeks to March 26 increased from Pounds 3.8m to
Pounds 5m, on turnover of Pounds 39.7m (Pounds 32m).
The latest figures include initial contributions from Northampton Transport,
which was acquired in October and Leicester CityBus, acquired in November.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Data and Research Services coming to market
at Pounds 39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Data and Research Services is coming to the market by way of a placing which
values the automated data capture specialist at Pounds 39.2m.
Some 13.64m ordinary shares are being placed at 110p each, representing 38
per cent of the enlarged share capital.
Some Pounds 15m is being raised before expenses. About 50 per cent of the
proceeds are expected to be available to exploit possible acquisitions in
the data capture industry. They will also be used to fund market research
and technology development necessary for DRS to explore new areas for
automated data capture.
The placing is sponsored by MacArthur, the company's financial adviser, and
underwritten by Beeson Gregory, its brokers.
DRS has been involved in data capture - ways of getting information into a
computer system without the use of keyboards - since 1969.
The company started as a data capture bureau, but its turnover and
profitability grew rapidly after 1990 when it began to make and distribute
its own design of opticalmark readers and dataloggers.
In 1993, it turned over Pounds 11.6m and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m.
In the past three years, profits before tax and non-recurring operating
expenses have amounted to 22, 22 and 26 per cent of turnover respectively.
At the placing price, earnings per share in 1993 of 6.76p give a p/e
multiple of 16.3.
The company's chief market is education, where it sells equipment to capture
and analyse handwritten 'ticks' on multiple choice examination forms.
Dealings are expected to begin on May 5.

1.8bn bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society were yesterday barred
from asking its directors questions about LLoyds Bank's proposed Pounds
1.8bn cash bid to take over the society at its annual general meeting.
The 200 members attending the society's annual meeting in Barnwood, near
Gloucester, were told that it was against building societies regulations to
be give additional information before all members were informed.
Mr John Bays, the chairman, told members who attempted to raise questions
about the Lloyds bid that the society intended to hold a special meeting in
November after full details were published, at which all issues could be
discussed.
Mr Peter Nicholson, a member, asked Mr Andrew Longhurst, the society's chief
executive, why the society could not convert to a limited company and offer
members the chance of equity stakes rather than being wholly acquired.
However, Mr Longhurst was advised by Mr Chris Jones, the society's
secretary, not to answer the question.
Mr Longhurst told the meeting that the proposals were 'not a fait accompli'
and members would be able to vote freely on them.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Indian raises Pounds 59m in placing
stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fleming Indian Investment Trust, the first UK-listed investment trust to
specialise in India, has raised about Pounds 59m in the placing stage of its
launch.
A further 90.8m shares at 100p each - with warrants attached on a 1-for-5
basis - are available through a public offer, closing on May 18.
The trust's target is to raise about Pounds 100m. However, recent investment
trust launches have tended to receive a fairly small proportion of their
total from private investors.
The fund will be managed from Hong Kong by the team already responsible for
the JF India unit trust, a Hong Kong-listed fund run by Jardine Fleming, the
sister company of Fleming Investment Management. Jardine Fleming also has 18
analysts in Bombay.
The UK fund will be invested via Mauritius, to take advantage of the tax
treaty between Mauritius and India.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Compass seeks funds for US purchase -
Rights issue launched towards Dollars 450m Canteen Corporation acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compass Group, the catering and healthcare concern, yesterday launched a
rights issue to raise almost Pounds 146m towards the cost of buying the
third biggest caterer in the US for Dollars 450m (Pounds 308m).
The purchase is Canteen Corporation, based in South Carolina, which for 1993
produced an operating income of Dollars 38m on turnover of Dollars 1bn.
The balance of the payment will come from new bank facilities of Dollars
175m from NationsBank of North Carolina, and Pounds 47.5m from National
Westminster Bank.
The acquisition will leave the group with pro forma negative net assets of
Pounds 92.3m.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, said yesterday that the acquisition was
'a one-off opportunity to buy into the world's biggest food market at a
price that is sensible'.
Compass also announced a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six
months from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 23.3m on turnover ahead 65 per cent at
Pounds 345.2m (Pounds 209.4m).
Mr Mackay said that all the group's acquisitions had performed 'extremely
well and we haven't lost a single contract'.
Earnings per share rose from 8.6p to 8.8p.
The interim dividend is increased from 2.115p to 2.31p, and the group is
forecasting a final of 4.5p on the enlarged capital following the rights
issue.
The shares yesterday fell a further 6p to 310p following a fall of 13p on
Tuesday when news of the impending US deal emerged.
Last July Compass, which has grown from a Pounds 167m management buy-out
from Grand Metropolitan in 1987 to a market capitalisation of Pounds 570m,
bought the airport restaurant and contract catering business of SAS Service
Partner, a subsidiary of the Scandinavian airline.
The Pounds 71.9m acquisition was financed through a 6-for-19 rights issue at
420p.
The latest cash call, also on a 6-for-19 basis, is priced at 270p and is
underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The issue of 57.4m new ordinary shares will
raise Pounds 145.9m net of expenses. The directors will be taking up their
rights, amounting to 1.51m shares.
Canteen is being sold by Flagstar, owner of several restaurant chains,
including the Denny's breakfast bars. Flagstar, listed on Nasdaq, incurred
losses in 1993 of Dollars 1.68bn after a Dollars 1.4bn goodwill write-off,
on turnover of Dollars 4bn.
The group, which has Dollars 2.4bn of debt, is 67 per cent owned by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street buy-out specialist.
Mr Mackay said that the disposal of Canteen, which has more than 12,000
accounts and net assets of Dollars 23.8m, was essentially a forced sale. Its
acquisition would immediately enhance earnings per share.
He was confident that Compass would be able to lift margins from last year's
3.3 per cent to above 5 per cent, the level achieved in 1990 and 1991.
Canteen had suffered from lack of management, including one contract that
had notched up a loss of Dollars 500,000. It had also suffered from
over-dependency on business and industry accounts, and needed to be directed
more towards the growing, college, hospital and prison market.
Following the acquisition Compass will have more than 50,000 employees,
double the current number.
It will retain the relatively new US management of Canteen, under the
supervision of Mr Mike Bailey, who joined Compass 12 months ago as managing
director of the brand management arm.
Compass and Flagstar have made a US tax election under which both parties
have agreed to capitalise goodwill over 15 years. This was worth Dollars
150m to Compass, or Dollars 10m a year, and would leave it with an effective
US tax charge of 12 per cent.
Mr Mackay said the high leverage incurred under the deal was appropriate as
Canteen was cash generative. Interest cover, 12 times at the end of the
half-year, would fall to 5.8 times but would start to recover quickly.
The City, which had thought Compass would concentrate on expansion in
Europe, was surprised at the sudden switch of the group's sights to the US.
Mr Mackay said the group would continue to expand in Europe organically. 'We
are determined to grow a sizeable business in Europe in the next three or
four years', he said, adding that the US deal was a one-off opportunity to
enter 'a great market place without paying a premium'.
The EGM to approve the rights issue will be on May 13. Compass expects to
complete the acquisition on June 17.

FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Interconnect purchase boosts Securicor
communications side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securicor, the security, parcels and communications group, has further
strengthened its communications division through the acquisition of
Interconnect, a small supplier of advanced telecommunications equipment.
Securicor declined to reveal the purchase price. But Mr Ed Hough, Securicor
Communications's chief executive, said the acquisition was 'a key move in
our strategic plan to become a leading supplier in the international
business communications sector'.
Interconnect, which is being merged with the Securicor Telecoms subsidiary,
is a recognised leader in the field of open telephone systems which allow
the easier integration of personal computer Local Area Networks and
telephone systems.
Unlike proprietary systems, open systems equipment is designed to
international standards.
Open systems telephony is expected to be one of the fastest growing
telecommunications equipment markets in the 1990s.
Interconnect's 3000 Digital Hybrid switch is Europe's first open system
Private Automatic Branch Exchange and the acquisition will significantly
strengthen Securicor Telecom's position in the emerging market.

FT  28 APR 94 / Williams' cash call prompts share fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings shares fell 9p to 379p as the industrial conglomerate
called on shareholders for Pounds 267m to carry it through the next raft of
acquisitions.
The rights issue confirmed months of speculation over how Williams would
fund its strategy to build up its three core divisions - fire protection,
security and building products.
The group has spent Pounds 205m on acquisitions in the past 16 months and
was perceived to be constrained by a balance sheet weakened through goodwill
write-offs and increasing debt. Analysts feared that without a rights issue
Williams would be forced into a series of vendor placings to fund
acquisitions.
'Even a small acquisition could have resulted in a substantial increase in
gearing,' said Mr Ian Hilliker of brokers NatWest Securities. 'They now have
flexibility and . . . can utilise the cash flow which will be coming through
from recovery.' After the issue, debt as a percentage of shareholders' funds
will fall from 75 per cent to 7 per cent.
Proceeds from the call, a one-for-seven issue of 82.9m shares at 330p, will
fund the Pounds 64m purchase of a building products business in Europe. Mr
Nigel Rudd, Williams' chairman, said the balance would be used for bolt-on
acquisitions particularly in continental Europe.
The acquisition of the woodcare and adhesive businesses of the Belgian
chemicals group, Solvay, marks Williams' first major purchase on the
continent and is its third in four months. Williams last month paid Dollars
50m (Pounds 34m) for a burner management systems company in the US.
The businesses returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.9m, before a series of
one-off items such as pension costs which will not be incurred by Williams.
Sales for the combined businesses were about Pounds 90m.
The Pounds 64m price, which represents about 13 times after-tax earnings,
could be adjusted to between Pounds 54m and Pounds 74m, depending on due
diligence. The UK group is expected to take a goodwill hit of about Pounds
44m.
Analysts said the acquisition was likely to dilute earnings this year, after
restructuring costs of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m.
The rights issue is underwritten by Schroders. Brokers to the issue are de
Zoete &amp; Bevan and S G Warburg Securities.

FT  28 APR 94 / Analysts fear the errors of over-ambition: David Lascelles
and Peggy Hollinger report on moves in the independent oil sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although they started out as the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of the UK oil
industry, the fortunes of Enterprise Oil and Lasmo could hardly have turned
out more differently.
Both are medium sized independent oil companies with a strong North Sea base
and smaller operations elsewhere, mainly south-east Asia. Both are closely
geared to exploration and production, and both have avoided diversifying too
far downstream.
But whereas Enterprise, under its chairman and chief executive Mr Graham
Hearne, has built a reputation for strong management and far-sightedness,
Lasmo has been battered by disasters and disgruntled investors.
Much of its tarnished reputation stems from the Pounds 1bn acquisition of
Ultramar in 1991. Although Lasmo subsequently sold off many of Ultramar's
assets, the view remains that it greatly overpaid.
The strain of the acquisition came on top of a high cost structure, and an
investment cycle which left Lasmo having to make its heaviest outlays at a
time when the oil price was close to a 20-year low. One of its biggest
projects is Liverpool Bay, a large natural gas development off north-east
England which does not start up until 1996.
These strains culminated in the departure of Mr Chris Greentree, its chief
executive, last year and the subsequent decision to pass its dividend. This
month Lasmo also appointed a new chairman, Mr Rudolph Agnew, and went to
shareholders with a Pounds 219m rights issue.
Enterprise has managed to cultivate a much higher reputation in the market.
It has traditionally been seen as the better managed and financially
stronger of the two companies. But even Enterprise has not been immune to
the weak oil price.
Recently its financial performance has deteriorated: its 1993 profits were
only up because of exceptional tax items, and the dividend was left
unchanged. It has been slower than Lasmo in replacing production with new
reserves. However, with big new fields coming on stream, such as Nelson in
the North Sea, cashflow is strong, and Enterprise needs to find a home for
its financial resources.
The logic in bidding for Lasmo is twofold. First, Enterprise could acquire a
substantial amount of new production, probably more cheaply than drilling
for it itself. Second, it would virtually double its size, and emerge as a
much more formidable force in the oil business.
Although the two companies overlap geographically, Lasmo's strength in gas
complements Enterprise's bias towards oil. If the oil price continues the
recent run which has taken it from Dollars 12 a barrel to over Dollars 15,
Enterprise could therefore get itself on to a profitable escalator.
But having said that, there was very little enthusiasm for a bid in the
market yesterday. 'We think it would be the wrong thing to do,' said Mr
Mehdi Varzi, oil industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson. He points out that
Enterprise would have to find 170m barrels of oil a year to top up the
combined companies' reserves. 'That's a tall order,' he says. He believes
Enterprise would do better to expand by buying up oil and gas assets
selectively rather than 'the whole baggage'.
Most analysts also consider Lasmo to be 'fully valued' as an investment. Now
that the worst seems to have passed at Lasmo, the share price has recovered
strongly from its low last December, partly on the strength of US buying.
But Mr Lars Reierson, at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, said
yesterday he doubted that any US companies would make a bid much above the
present price level. If Enterprise was going to make a bid, it should have
done so six months ago.
The fear is that Enterprise could end up making precisely the same mistake
that got Lasmo into its present predicament. By taking on an over-ambitious
acquisition which could double his company's size on paper, Mr Hearne might
end up finding, as Mr Greentree did, that one plus one equals no more than
one.
And if Enterprise did go ahead, it could face quite a battle. As Lasmo made
clear yesterday, it would not welcome a bid. Its new chairman, Mr Agnew, is
a hardened take-over warrior. As chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, he
led one of the great takeover defences of the 1980s when he fought off a
sustained attack by Minorco in 1988.
With so little going for a bid, there was some speculation in the market
yesterday that Enterprise was more interested in flushing out another bidder
than in making a strike of its own. Lasmo's fate is of vital interest to
Enterprise because the two companies compete so directly. If so, the next
few days could be quite eventful.

FT  28 APR 94 / Airtours to buy Scandinavian leisure group from SAS
</HEADLINE>

Airtours, the holiday group, said yesterday that it is close to agreement to
buy SAS Leisure, Scandinavia's leading tour operator, from Scandinavian
Airline System for SKr870m (Pounds 79m).
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) said it was also about to begin detailed
discussions with Swissair over the sale of its Service Partner airline
catering unit. This unit has been valued at up to SKr2.5bn.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, has long wanted to expand into
continental Europe. Airtours, the second biggest UK tour operator after
Thomson, said it is also close to agreement to buy a cruise ship for Dollars
24m (Pounds 16.4m). The vendor is believed to be Kloster Cruise of Norway.
SAS Leisure's operations include two tour operators, Ving and Always, a 50
per cent stake in Premiair, the charter airline, and a 49 per cent stake in
Spanair, another charter operator. It also owns 14 hotels, mainly around the
Mediterranean.
Last year, SAS Leisure made a SKr199m pre-tax loss on sales of SKr4.44bn.
The performance followed a SKr209m profit in 1992 and reflected depressed
travel industry conditions, recession in the Nordic region and the weakness
of the Swedish krona.
The deal, which could be finalised today, received a cool welcome from the
City, which marked Airtours' shares down 18p to 448p. Airtours has been
criticised in recent weeks for its acquisition record.
After failing last year in a bid to take over its rival Owners Abroad,
Airtours acquired Aspro Travel of Cardiff for Pounds 20.1m. Earlier this
year, Airtours announced it was suing the former owners of Aspro, saying it
had been the victim of fraudulent misrepresentation at the time of the
takeover.
SAS wants to concentrate on core flying operations after four consecutive
years in the red and last year's failed attempt to merge with Swissair,
Austrian Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in the Alcazar project.
SAS said Service Partner would be combined with Swissair's catering
division, Gate Gourmet, if talks with the Swiss airline were successful.
Last year SAS sold the airport restaurant and contract catering businesses
within Service Partner to Compass Group, the UK healthcare and catering
company, for Pounds 71.9m.

FT  28 APR 94 / IBM to sell its crown jewels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to sell its 'crown jewels', the
microprocessor chips that are at the core of its future mainframe and
parallel computer products, to Hitachi of Japan, its long and bitter rival
in the mainframe computer market.
The move is an extraordinary alliance of former enemies. For years, IBM
feuded with Hitachi and other Japanese computer makers over allegations of
stolen trade secrets. Instead of fighting to protect its technology, IBM is
now willing to sell it, even to one of its largest competitors.
Mr John Thompson, IBM senior vice president, explained the move saying:
'There is, quite simply, a very strong business case for us to do this.
'We will make more money by licensing our technology, than we would by not
doing so.' The benefits to IBM include better use of its semiconductor
manufacturing capacity, and the potential to expand the market for large
scale systems, he said.
The agreement also means IBM has effectively neutralised the threat of
competition from Hitachi. 'Each Hitachi sale will mean revenue and profit
for IBM,' said Mr Thompson. 'IBM will gain access to Hitachi's customer
base, especially in Japan.'
IBM will supply Hitachi with future versions of its System 390
microprocessors. These chips represent the core technology of a new
generation of IBM mainframe computers that will not require the elaborate
cooling systems of today's mainframe computers.
The chips will be modified to include Hitachi's specifications, IBM said,
and will be used in computers being developed by Hitachi for introduction in
1996.
IBM will also supply Hitachi with its latest Powerparallel computers, to be
resold by the Japanese company. These computers were introduced only a few
weeks ago and represent a new generation of large scale computers which IBM
believes will play a central role in computing in the next decade.
Hitachi plans to develop its own products for this sector of the market,
based on IBM's PowerPC microprocessors.

FT  28 APR 94 / Lasmo set to rebuff Enterprise bid: David Lascelles and
Peggy Hollinger report on moves in the independent oil sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil is expected to move on rival oil explorer Lasmo this week
following yesterday's statement that it was considering an offer for the
company.
Any approach is expected to be heartily rebuffed by Lasmo which yesterday
said a bid would be 'entirely unwelcome'. The group just two weeks ago took
steps to bolster its weak balance sheet with a Pounds 219m rights issue at
105p.
Enterprise was forced into its initial statement by the Takeover Panel,
which is believed to have asked several companies to state their interests
following recent heavy trading in Lasmo.
The high volumes sparked speculation that a predator was building a stake in
advance of a possible bid. However, it is believed that Enterprise has not
been buying Lasmo shares, leaving open the possibility of an alternative
bid.
A number of potential bidders have been mentioned, from British Gas to Arco
of the US. Since the beginning of the month Lasmo's shares have risen from
114p to last night's close of 162 1/2 p. Enterprise shares closed 6p lower
at 445p.
Enterprise said yesterday that if an offer were made, it was likely to be
pitched at less than Tuesday's 153p closing price. At that level, Lasmo
would be valued at Pounds 930m.
However, the company stressed that it was considering a number of options
regarding Lasmo and had not yet decided on a bid.
Analysts greeted the news of Enterprise's interest and the timing following
Lasmo's rights issue with some puzzlement. 'The question is whether
investors want to swap their Lasmo shares for another oil and gas play,'
said one. 'Enterprise would probably have to offer shares with a reasonable
cash alternative.'
The group is thought to have held back from launching a full bid earlier due
to the stringent requirements of the New York Stock Exchange where both
companies are quoted.
Enterprise is thought to be attracted by Lasmo's production profile.
Enterprise's production is set to flatten out by the mid- 1990s and the
acquisition of Lasmo would maintain production growth to the turn of the
century.
There is also the added impetus of the recent increase in the oil price.
'Banks might be more willing to fund a cash alternative given the fact that
sentiment in the sector is improving,' said Mr Graeme Gilchrist of brokers
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

FT  28 APR 94 / Brussels urges freedom in mobile phone market: Bid to make
European system global standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday called for the full liberalisation of EU
mobile telecommunications, in a move aimed at overcoming fragmentation
within the Union market and consolidating Europe's place in the world
market.
The Brussels appeal is the first step towards the EU goal of total
telecommunications liberalisation by 1998. It is contained in a 228-page
green paper adopted by the Commission yesterday after two years of research.
The paper is unusually prescriptive for a consultative document, and takes
clear aim at the barriers holding back the potential of what the Commission
and market research forecast will be the fastest growing area in
telecommunications.
The paper states the pan-European GSM (Global System for Mobile
communications) is establishing itself as a main reference technology for
digital mobile systems, and could become the global standard.
Europe's mobile telephony infrastructure suppliers have an international
comparative advantage, it says. But nationally orientated and
technology-based licensing has resulted in parallel national systems, with
no consistent approach to provision of compatible, cross-border services.
This 'failure to adjust to market requirements could jeopardise Europe's
current strong position,' the green paper warns.
Mobile communications experts point out, however, that both the US and Japan
are likely to use different technology from the GSM standard which the
Commission is endorsing.
By 1995 the US will have 20m cellular telephones but the move from existing
analogue systems to digital ones is being complicated by a Federal
Communications Commission requirement that new digital technologies like GSM
must be compatible with existing analogue services.
The Brussels green paper advocates five main changes:
Abolition of all remaining exclusive or special licensing rights in the
sector.
Removal of all restrictions on the provision of mobile services across the
EU.
Full freedom for mobile operators to develop their own infrastructure
networks, whether by providing their own or sharing another company's
infrastructure.
Full freedom to offer combined services via both fixed and mobile networks,
which implies the right of independent operators to bid for licences on the
fixed networks.
Mutual recognition of standards and equipment type approval, coordination of
licensing and award procedures, to boost trans-European mobile networks.
The Commission predicts there will be 40m mobile communications users in the
EU by 2000, and eventually more than 200m.

FT  28 APR 94 / PM backs Kohl over EU links to eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major signalled the start of a British drive to improve relations
with Germany yesterday based on a joint commitment to forge closer links
between the European Union and central and eastern Europe.
The two countries repaired strains caused by last month's disagreements on
EU voting rights, and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, damped
expectations of a quick enlargement of the EU.
Both men emphasised the warmth of their personal relationship, with Mr Kohl
at pains to address Mr Major by the familiar 'Du' during a closing joint
press conference yesterday.
Mr Major's emphasis on the two countries' common interest in links with the
former communist bloc marked the opening moves in Britain's campaign to
shape the agenda for the EU's 1996 intergovernmental conference.
In a note of caution about enlargement plans, Mr Kohl said extending the EU
to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia would take longer than
generally expected. He said his government had not yet come up with firm
plans on restructuring of the common agricultural policy and the EU's
funding for poorer regions to accompany eastward enlargement.
Underlining a joint commitment to reduce red tape in Brussels, the two
governments will set up a panel of business leaders to examine whether EU
legislation burdens companies with unnecessary regulations.
The idea, discussed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade secretary, and Mr
Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, appears to be in its early
stages.
In an effort to improve knowledge of the two countries' economic policies,
the UK Treasury and the Bonn finance ministry are to exchange officials for
three to six-month secondments.
The UK government sees another round of enlargement as the key to shifting
the emphasis of change in the EU from the 'centralising' impulses, which led
to the Maastricht Treaty, to a looser confederation.
Senior British ministers are deeply concerned that the approach of the 1996
conference will open an irreparable split in the Conservative party unless
they set a decentralising agenda.
They took heart from Mr Kohl's public commitment to put competitiveness,
employment and deregulation at the centre of the six-month German presidency
of the EU which starts in July. Mr Kohl said he, too, opposed a
'centralised' Europe.

FT  28 APR 94 / France ordered to open up routes from Orly airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday ordered the French government to open Orly
airport in Paris to Air France's rivals on routes to London, Toulouse and
Marseilles.
The demand is a serious test of Brussels' will to enforce the EU's 'open
skies' policy. France said it would immediately appeal against the ruling to
the European Court of Justice.
'The decision taken in Brussels has serious consequences in opening, without
a period of transition, France's internal network,' said Mr Bernard Bosson,
transport minister.
The Commission found that Air France and its subsidiary Air Inter, which
also plans to appeal, were in breach of the rules in the so-called Third
Aviation Package of liberalisation measures which came into force last year.
This was designed to promote greater competition. The Commission's decision
follows complaints brought last September by TAT, the French airline 49.9
per cent owned by British Airways, that it was the victim of a monopoly at
Orly.
French authorities were told to open up the Orly-London route immediately,
and given a six-month breathing space to open up the lucrative routes to
Toulouse and Marseilles, the EU's third and fourth busiest routes.
The controversial decision has been held up through fear of upsetting
delicate French government negotiations with Air France unions over
restructuring the state-owned airline.
The sensitivity of the decision was underlined yesterday when Mr Jacques
Delors, Commission president, abstained and the other French commissioner,
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, voted against the action.
Yesterday's move presents a dilemma for the French government, which is
seeking European Commission approval for a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.34bn) capital
injection for Air France. Liberalisation of the French airline market could
be a condition for approval of the state aid.
Paris has a month to appeal to the Council of Ministers, which could
overturn the order with a qualified majority. The solid bloc of airline
liberals led by the UK makes this recourse unlikely, leaving France the
possibility of action through the European Court of Justice.

FT  28 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Compass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Compass shareholders of a nervous disposition will fear their company has
lost its bearings by buying Canteen. The likely rewards seem out of all
proportion to the certain risks. Corporate UK's record of buying US people
businesses is atrocious. There must be a real danger Compass will only
extend that run.
Compass argues it was able to negotiate exclusively with Canteen's parent,
Flagstar, and is buying it at a firesale price. If so, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, Flagstar's 67 per cent shareholder, should string up its managers
by the thumbs. Canteen would surely be worth more to a US rival, which could
have rationalised the merged business. They may also have paid a premium to
keep a better-capitalised competitor at bay. But the exit multiple of 19.5
times is hardly cheap; even though tax benefits effectively reduces it to
15.1 times. There must be doubts about how quickly Compass can turn Canteen
around given its poor trading history. Its margins have fallen from 5.5 per
cent to 3.3 per cent since 1990 on static turnover. As a subsidiary of such
a highly-indebted parent, Canteen is unlikely to be carrying excessive
costs. Additional investment will be needed to expand.
Compass shareholders may be tempted to back the company's adventurous leap,
considering the rights issue price is at a 28 per cent discount to last
month's peak price. The shame is that Compass had been doing perfectly well
expanding its UK business at a fair lick and minimal risk.

FT  28 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rights issue from Williams Holdings is an admission that the company
does not expect to generate sufficient cash internally to fund its bolt-on
acquisition programme. But then the recent pace of spending has been such
that it would have been hard to imagine anything else. At least the issue
secures the funds to carry on for a couple of years without constant
pressure on gearing. And the purchase of Solvay's woodcare and tile adhesive
businesses looks sensible. The products have a strong market presence, there
is room for margin improvement and the acquisition should help European
distribution of Cuprinol.
That said, Williams must actually come up reasonably soon with yet more
acquisitions at prices which will enhance its earnings. Otherwise it would
not only stand accused of simply raising capital for purchases already made.
Lack of gearing would also dilute earnings at a time when tight cover is
likely to hold back dividend growth compared with other manufacturing
companies.
Williams obviously believes it can clinch the necessary deals. Yesterday's
share price fall just below the ex-rights price suggests the market errs
marginally on the side of scepticism. A policy of focused acquisitions looks
a sensible strategy for the sober 1990s. It would be comforting to think
that, when the rights money is spent, the pace will have slowed to one that
could be reasonably financed by internally-generated funds - and that the
cash will be flowing to support it.

The Bundesbank has been miserly with interest rates for so long that
yesterday's generous cut in the repurchase rate comes as something of a
shock. The quarter-point reduction in the discount rate a fortnight ago has
already been reflected in money market rates. This is especially surprising
given the improving economic outlook. There are still risks, but German
government forecasts of 1.5 per cent growth this year no longer look
over-optimistic.
Still, the Bundesbank has a record of cutting interest rates after the
economy has turned, as it did in 1982-83. Inflation is widely expected to
fall this year, so real rates would rise without further action. Most
independent growth forecasts have been nudged higher in anticipation of a
strong export performance, which should not rekindle inflation while output
remains well below trend. With M3 growth running at 15 per cent in March,
money supply poses the only credible inflationary threat. This gives the
Bundesbank a strong argument for caution on the pace of interest rate
reductions.
The explanation for its recent spurt may lie with the foreign exchange
markets. The weakness of the dollar this year has meant an effective
tightening for Germany, especially if exporters are expected to drive
recovery. The Bundesbank may also be trying to relieve pressure on the
French franc. Even allowing for its delight in wrong-footing financial
markets, though, an official rate cut following today's council meeting
looks unlikely.

Enterprise Oil has lost the first round in the battle for Lasmo. Its opening
shot, a statement extracted from it by the Takeover Panel against its will,
failed to make clear whether it was going to bid or not. Reading between the
lines, there is little doubt that chairman Mr Graham Hearne's ambition is to
acquire Lasmo. But yesterday's indecisive statement will have done nothing
to deter rival bidders, whether British Gas or some international group,
from entering the fray. It also failed to provide any rationale for putting
the groups together.
The industrial logic of merging the two companies looks pretty thin. There
may be cost savings from cutting overheads in a larger group. But a bigger
organisation could also lack the dynamism needed to discover new oil and gas
reserves - a task at which neither company has excelled recently. Nor is it
as though Mr Hearne can plausibly sell himself as the man to put Lasmo's
house in order following the Ultramar fiasco. Under chief executive Mr Joe
Darby, Lasmo has already done much of the stable cleaning for itself.
The financial logic also seems lacking. Given that Lasmo's Pounds 219m
rights issue is now irreversible, Enterprise can no longer argue that its
smaller rival is desperate for cash to shore up its balance sheet. Moreover,
at current oil prices, a merger would dilute Enterprise's earnings per
share. The suspicion is that Mr Hearne simply enjoys the idea of running an
even larger empire. Enterprise will presumably think up some clever
arguments for combining the groups if and when it bids. But it is now
starting from behind.

FT  28 APR 94 / A problem aired . . .: Bruce Clark previews a portrait of
the UK Foreign Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As western politicians work themselves into a moral frenzy over Bosnia,
there is something refreshing about a senior western diplomat who is dubious
about the role of ethics in foreign policy.
The diplomat is Mr David Gore-Booth, British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and
former head of the Middle East department at the Foreign Office. His
world-weary musings on the rights and wrongs of arms sales provide one of
many startling vignettes in a documentary series on the British diplomatic
service entitled True Brits, to be screened on BBC2 over the next six weeks,
starting tonight.
'You have to factor in the morality because that is what British public
opinion and the British value system demands,' believes the ambassador. 'But
it cannot be the overriding factor because Britain has to survive by
exporting.'
Mr Gore-Booth is talking about the Scott inquiry, which is considering
allegations that Britain avoidably abetted Saddam Hussein by selling him
weapons and components. He sees no case to answer. 'I'm not embarrassed or
ashamed of British policy at that time; it was in fact as close to being
honourable as international circumstances permitted.'
The series is billed by its producer Stephen Lambert as the closest British
television has come to the heart of government. It provides hilarious
insights into the horse-trading before a European summit; follows a consul
into a Thai prison; depicts the opening of lonely outposts in ex-Soviet
cities; and follows the dreaded cost-cutting inspectors to Washington.
It is the existence of the latter which explains the sudden onset of
glasnost at the Foreign Office. Like everybody else, the diplomats want to
show that they provide value for taxpayers' money. But in throwing open
their doors, the diplomats have been remarkably bold.
In one episode, we see the pragmatic Mr Gore-Booth, who speaks for British
policy at its most hard-boiled and mercantilist. In another, we meet two
women diplomats who are blazing idealists.
There is the formidable, elegant Ms Gwynne Evans, head of the UN department,
who is unmarried, a self-confessed workaholic, who has devoted her working
life to what she calls 'public service'. We see her visiting Sarajevo, where
she sits stoically through an artillery battle, makes some proposals about
how to defend aid convoys and attends Mass in a local church. She is too
clever to think there are easy answers in Bosnia, and that makes her all the
more likeable.
That said, most viewers will relate more easily to the engaging, vulnerable
personality of Ms Frances Guy, a young Scotswoman who deals with Iraq. One
moment she is saying goodbye to her husband and baby daughter in a modest
London home; the next she is helping the Kurds of northern Iraq rebuild
their villages under cover of the 'no-fly' zone.
The two women seem at times to live on a different planet from Mr
Gore-Booth. On reflection, however, the worlds of all three are closely
intertwined. Ms Guy may represent a gentler school of diplomacy than Mr
Gore-Booth, but she too has realpolitik to consider. With disarming
frankness, she explains the reason why she cannot be too zealous in
promoting self-government among the Kurds or in any other part of Iraq:
neighbouring countries would see it as a bad precedent.
'You have the Iranians who are scared of democracy, you have the Saudis who
are scared of democracy . . . and they control a lot of the British
economy.'
Which brings us back to Mr Gore-Booth. The Saudis may not like western
political systems, but they do care about their co-religionists in Bosnia
and they expect Britain to care about them too. We see Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, telling his man in Riyadh: 'We have to show also that
we're not just sitting back being careless of Moslem lives.'
On the subject of Moslem lives: one of the 'international circumstances' to
which Mr Gore-Booth refers is the fact that five years ago, most of Iraq's
partners did not see the use of poison gas against the Kurds as grounds for
cutting off arms sales. So a unilateral UK boycott would arguably have hurt
Britain more than Iraq.
This 'circumstance' was certainly regrettable, for it was soon apparent that
Saddam was capable of much 'worse' acts than poisoning his citizens - such
as invading Kuwait. If the west had 'factored in the morality' a little
earlier, perhaps the Gulf war, and the human tragedy of the Iraqi Kurds
which Ms Guy is trying to alleviate, could have been avoided.
Nor is Mr Gore-Booth a mercantilist all the time. Confronting a delegation
of British businessmen who want better relations with Iran, he tells them
bluntly: 'We believe the Iranians are trying to acquire a nuclear bomb.'
So there are, it seems, some circumstances when countries need to be kept at
arm's length, even when business opportunities beckon. Defining those
circumstances has never been easy for professional diplomats, and it is not
easy for the ordinary tax-paying citizen either.
Even allowing for the interest of the Foreign Office in self-promotion, it
is still extraordinary that it has allowed the viewer quite such a candid
glimpse of its own dilemmas and the differing ways in which its staff
respond.
The Foreign Office apparently wants its dilemmas to become the public's
dilemmas too; and that is a worthy aspiration. It also makes for gripping
television.

FT  28 APR 94 / Leading Article: Germany's Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major said he would put the UK at the heart of Europe. That intention
was geographically absurd and proved politically vainglorious. The leader
whose country is indeed the geographic, economic and political heart of
Europe was his visitor of yesterday, Mr Helmut Kohl. Europe is failing to
prosper, either politically or economically, largely because Germany is not
leading. Germany's accession to the presidency of the European Union, next
July, is the occasion for it to start doing so once more.
The agenda Germany confronts is simultaneously its own and Europe's: how to
extend the zone of western stability to its eastern neighbours; how to
deepen its integration with its western neighbours, particularly with
France; and how to engender new vigour in the European economy.
Mr Kohl's signal virtue is that he understands the nature of the task he,
his country and Europe confront. It is to resolve Germany's historic
dilemma: the choice between east and west. Germany's strategic solution is
to seek stability in the east, while being safely embedded in a prosperous
west. So long as it is deprived of capacity for independent action, the
problem posed by an over-mighty, sovereign Germany might at last be
resolved. The failure of British politicians is their inability to recognise
that the nightmare Germany's leaders wish to avoid is the 19th century
balance-of-power politics that the British deem normal.
Starting point
The German strategy is right. The difficulties arise with the tactics. The
starting point must be to Germany's east, where shaken electorates may yet
turn their backs on an EU that is often seen to have turned its back on
them. The Europe Agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Romania and Slovakia were a start. But the EU remains far too
protectionist, notably over agriculture. These agreements provide for free
trade in industrial goods between the EU and the countries of eastern
Europe, but not among the east Europeans. There is, more important still, no
ladder leading them to the EU membership that they seek and the EU promised,
conditionally, at the Copenhagen European summit in 1993.
What is to be done? First, the decision must be taken that, whatever it
costs, Poland will become the east of the west, not the west of the east.
Second, the EU's barriers to the industrial exports of central and eastern
Europe must be eliminated and agricultural access also expanded. Third,
existing trade agreements need to be made multilateral, embracing the whole
region. Fourth, central and eastern Europe should be absorbed into the
European single market, perhaps by modifying the still-born European
Economic Area for that purpose.
Last but not least, the issue of EU membership, which the countries
concerned think crucial for the credibility of their engagement with Europe,
must be broached. But membership would be feasible before 2010 only if the
common agricultural policy, the budget and probably voting weights were
reformed. This is an agenda that Germany, pivotal on all three questions,
must address.
Europe's plight
Enlargement to the north is, pace the European parliament, decided.
Enlargement to the east must be started. But what then of deepening? To the
extent that a larger Europe must be bureaucratically streamlined,
institutional reform is inescapable. This issue will be the heart of the
agenda for the next intergovernmental conference, due in 1996. Ideas must be
floated now if that conference is to be less messy than the political side
of the last one.
Realistically, however, rapid further deepening of the soon-to-be Europe of
16, still more of the Europe of 20 or so that should emerge within the next
decade, is unfeasible. The solution must be deepening among fewer countries.
This is already implicit in the Maastricht treaty's approach to economic and
monetary union. Some version of Emu must occur this century, if the EU is to
retain credibility. But it will then exclude several members. Germany will
have to be tough with its partners about whom it is necessary to exclude and
whom it is necessary to include.
Perhaps the most fruitful way for Germany to secure early deepening to the
west is by strengthening its foreign and security policy co-operation with
France. With the US disengaging, the UK equivocating and Russia looking more
threatening, it is difficult to envisage a basis for European security other
than Franco-German integration. But Germany must first commit itself to
participation in envisaged security action. If it has power, without bearing
responsibility, as happened in the former Yugoslavia, European security
policy becomes internally divisive and externally ineffective.
Germany's presidency starts a run of large countries - France, Spain and
Italy - with an integrationist outlook. But it is primus inter pares. It
alone can set the agenda for a revitalised Europe. Its forthcoming elections
will make it difficult. But Europe's plight makes it essential. Germany must
be bold and imaginative. As for the UK, it may be on the margins of
Germany's Europe, but cannot afford to turn its back.

While its dealers may relax with heavy metal, Lehman Brothers as a company
is apparently more in tune with heavy paper.
Its forthcoming survey of the world's pharmaceutical industry, called
PharmaPipelines, weighs in at 1.8 kg, only fractionally less than the
mammoth 2.2 kg Yellow Pages telephone directory for London.
The result of the efforts of 11 stockmarket analysts and some powerful
computer software, it is somewhat lacking in the narrative drive department.
But it's got to be a best-seller for investors in the pulp and paper

Swiss Reinsurance and Swiss Bank Corporation have long been paired in the
minds of Zurich businessmen as being a little susceptible to the
blandishments of management consultants; they seemed to troop in regularly
to advise on grand restructurings - which, to the untrained eye, never
seemed to amount to a row of beans.
Now the consultants have talked their way into the boardroom on a more
permanent basis. Last November, SBC poached Peter Wuffli, a partner in
McKinsey &amp; Co, Switzerland, to be its chief financial officer.
Yesterday, Swiss Re capped that by hiring Lukas Muhlemann, McKinsey's Swiss
managing director, as its next chief executive. With such professional
reorganisers in-house, how ever will they find time for the business?

Instead of twisting themselves in knots over the D-day celebrations, the
Brits and the French might as well surrender gracefully and decamp en masse
to Chicago for positively the biggest ever re-enactment of the Normandy
landings.
On June 4 - two days early, but who cares, it's a Saturday and the
organisers are hoping to pull in a crowd of about 200,000 - some 500 US
second world war buffs will storm Montrose beach on Lake Michigan.
Clad in American, British, and Canadian uniforms, their 14 period landing
craft will be backed up by a dozen vintage aircraft, while an allied missile
frigate will fire at the bathing centre doing service as a well-manned
German bunker.
Nearly Dollars 125,000 has been spent at the firework shop for the 'bombs'
for the four-hour re-enactment.
Unfortunately, the organisers failed to advise Chicago city alderman Helen
Shiller of their manoeuvres; when alerted late in the day, she was minded to
block such gallivanting on a crowded family beach, but has apparently been
brought round.
Retired colonel Kenneth Plummer, chairman of the extravaganza, meanwhile,
says it is a serious commemorative act. 'It's not our intention to turn this
into a circus,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Emilio Ybarra, the coolly collected chairman of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, is
angry. On Monday night he lost out to Spanish banking's other Emilio  -
Banco Santander's Emilio Botin - in the takeover race for Banesto. Now Botin
has recruited BBV's brightest and best to manage the bauble.
Alfredo Saenz, whom Botin has appointed Banesto's chief executive, was a BBV
vice-chairman until seconded by Ybarra to rebuild Banesto, after the Bank of
Spain recently sacked the board of the ailing bank. So what does a grateful
Bank of Spain do? Hand Banesto to BBV on a plate?
Not likely. We are witnessing commercial Spain's hard new realism; Santander
outgunned BBV.
Unsurprisingly, Ybarra wanted Saenz back; tough tapas. Botin's promise to
distribute 1 per cent of Banesto's stock among its senior directors clearly
concentrated Saenz's mind.
We may now see a steady haemorrhaging of Saenz-picked BBV talent into the
Santander-Banesto cup.
How history repeats itself. Three years ago the government chose Francisco
Luzon, another BBV high-flier, to run the partially-privatised Argentaria.
Since then, Luzon has poached some 70 clever managers from his former
employers.

After less than two years in his highly lucrative post, Hong Kong governor
Chris Patten is showing distinct signs of itchy feet. Surely he's not pining
for the grey skies of Britain already?
One cannot blame him for being a bit browned off. Chinese government
officials more or less refuse to have anything to do with him these days;
when Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, comes to town next
week, he won't even be seeing Patten.
No wonder, then, that the wily Brit has been saying for the past month or so
that, as 1997 approaches, he will be adopting more of a ceremonial role -
letting his top officials make the running in promoting government policy.
Ahem.
The truth is Patten never really lost his love of Westminster. He stays
remarkably well-informed about the progress of friend and foe alike, and
takes every opportunity to return to Britain for increasingly leisurely
sojourns. Next month, as well as addressing the Manchester Philosophical
Society, he has made sure to take in a performance at renovated Glyndebourne
opera house.
He has also given up disclaiming any interest in a return to the British
political scene. Nowadays he just throws the question back, asking under
what circumstances he might make a comeback. Glumly, he says he does not
believe a credible scenario exists.
Why he should be upset by that, given the government's manifold troubles, is
another question.

FT  28 APR 94 / Leading Article: Venezuela shoots a messenger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's government took office in February facing a host of political,
economic and social problems for which it bore no responsibility. Now, the
administration of President Rafael Caldera is adding a few of its own
making.
The resignation this week of the head of the country's nominally independent
central bank is a blow to the credibility of monetary policy and a setback
to attempts to right the economy.
As central bank president, Ruth de Krivoy could not alone have solved
Venezuela's economic difficulties. But, while there, she was viewed as a
guarantor that at least monetary policy was on course. However well
respected, her eventual replacement will find it difficult to shake off the
perception that he or she is in the government's pocket.
The dispute that brought about her departure arose over the government's
desire to see lower interest rates to stimulate an economy now facing a
second year of recession. With little leeway in fiscal policy - according to
Consensus Economics, the average expectation of private economists is for a
public sector deficit equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP this year - the
government alighted on interest rates.
Banking crisis
One part of the government plan was to persuade banks to reduce the generous
lending spreads being charged on loans. However, many banks are attempting
to rebuild balance sheets to comply with a new banking law. This in the wake
of January's banking crisis, which led the government to take over the
country's second largest bank and shore up at least eight others.
The other element was apparently an attempt to reduce interest rates in
Venezuela's money markets. Mrs de Krivoy told the government that attempting
this would probably backfire. Venezuela's high interest rates were not a
cause of Venezuela's economic difficulties but a symptom of them: the money
markets were merely the message bearers.
The risk of artificially depressing interest rates is clear: more capital
flight into the dollar, which will accelerate the depreciation of the
bolivar and thereby fuel inflation.
Wider lessons
The Venezuelan experience holds wider lessons about the limitations of
central bank autonomy. It suggests that a strong central bank needs the type
of institutional backing that is lacking in many states in Latin America and
elsewhere. Legislation alone is no guarantor of independence, especially in
those places where the executive is unaccustomed to restrictions on its
exercise of power.
It also shows that unless there is a broad national consensus over the
importance of low inflation and over the means of achieving it, even a
nominally independent central bank will be relatively weak. Achieving that
national consensus takes either a long time or an economic crisis, such as
the hyperinflation which overtook Argentina in 1989.
Mrs de Krivoy understood this. In an interview last year, she described an
important part of her mission as 'having to explain that it's not just a
matter of forcing interest rates to come down in a way that doesn't reflect
the true situation of the country'. It is to be regretted that she failed to
convince those who most needed to be convinced: Mr Caldera and his
ministers.

FT  28 APR 94 / Risky manoeuvres in the fast lane: John Burton and Kevin
Done examine the global ambitions of a rapidly expanding Korean car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Korean vehicle makers are appearing at uncomfortable speed in the rear-view
mirrors of their rivals from North America, Europe and Japan.
With stunning disregard for warnings from western carmakers about
overcapacity in the world auto industry, the leading Korean producers are
expanding assembly capacity at a rate that recalls the startling growth of
the Japanese industry in earlier decades.
The announcement by Kia, the second-largest Korean carmaker, that it plans
to start assembly of four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles in Germany -
the vehicles will be assembled by Karmann, the German automotive engineering
group - is the latest move to mark Korea's rapid advance into world auto
markets.
Supported by a rapidly growing, and until now highly protected, domestic
market, Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo are determined to break into the industry's
front ranks. Exports, both to developing countries and to the established
regions of North America and Europe, are growing, as is the scope of plans
for foreign assembly plants.
Hyundai Motor, the leading South Korean carmaker, plans to increase vehicle
production capacity by 60 per cent to 2m units by 2000 from 1.25m at
present, according to Mr Se Yung Chung, group chairman. It is planning to
build more foreign production sites to reinforce its presence in overseas
markets, he says.
'We envisage manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, south-east
Asia and in the Middle East.'
Individually Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo are all voicing the ambition of
becoming one of the world's top 10 producers, an aim that would mean
shouldering aside the likes of Mitsubishi, Mazda, Chrysler or Fiat.
The threat of a growing tide of Korean exports allied to the high barriers
to foreign car imports in the domestic market, where imports accounted for
well below 1 per cent last year, are rapidly forcing the issue of Korean
expansion towards the top of European carmakers' agenda.
'South Korea, one of east Asia's 'tigers' has been pursuing an aggressive
export policy, which seems set to disrupt markets, not only for the
Europeans and Americans, but also for the Japanese themselves, who are being
hurt by the high yen, and from whom the Koreans have learned a great deal,'
the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Acea) warned this week.
Kia has just launched its cars into the US for the first time under its own
brand name. Mr Greg Warner, executive vice-president of Kia Motors America,
states openly that the key to the company's launch strategy will be
'disruption', as it seeks to under-price its rivals by a significant margin.
'Our greatest impact will be on Japanese makes,' says Mr Warner. Kia's first
US television advertising campaign has featured clips from a 1960s science
fiction film Gorgo, with a gigantic monster trampling across the buildings
of a city centre to the accompaniment of screams. 'There's only one thing
more frightening to Japan,' says the text, 'A well-built car for under
Dollars 8,500.'
The Korean government is playing a key role in the auto industry's
expansion. In a glittering ceremony Hyundai Motor recently unveiled the
Accent, the successor to the country's most popular car model, the Excel
small family car.
As the first Korean car to be based entirely on domestic technology, the
Accent represents a significant success for the government-sponsored X-5
programme. Started in 1991, X-5's goal is to transform Korea into the
world's fifth-biggest vehicle producer, after Japan, the US, Germany and
France, by 2000.
The government estimates that it will cost Dollars 36bn, financed by soft
state loans, to achieve this. Sixty per cent of these funds are going into
doubling production capacity to 4.65m vehicles by the end of the decade. The
rest is earmarked for research projects, such as the development of electric
cars.
Korea is well ahead of schedule: it may become the fifth-largest producer
this year by overtaking Canada. It will produce 2.4m cars and commercial
vehicles versus Canada's 2.35m, according to forecasts by the the Hyundai
Automobile Research Institute. It predicts that Korea will exceed French
vehicle production by 2000.
The increase reflects buoyant exports, which reached a record 640,000
vehicles last year, as Korean producers gained a price advantage over their
Japanese rivals, thanks to a 20 per cent fall in the value of the Korean won
against the yen. The continued weakness of the Korean currency means exports
may reach 800,000 vehicles this year.
Despite the undoubted alarm among western carmakers, some industry observers
believe that the fears are exaggerated. They predict that the Korean car
industry is racing towards problems of its own, which could leave it with
excess production capacity and force consolidation. 'The Koreans are betting
on a lot of positive factors that may prove false,' says Mr David Bloom,
manager of the Seoul office of Hawtal Whiting, the UK automotive engineering
consultants.
One cause of concern is the increasingly cut-throat competition in the
domestic market, which accounts for 70 per cent of total sales by Korean car
companies. The offer of low-interest consumer financing by car companies to
boost demand has depressed profit growth.
In addition, productivity improvement has been made difficult by industrial
action, which shut down Hyundai plants for almost two months last spring.
Domestic competition is expected to become more intense in the next few
years. Ssangyong, which produces commercial and four-wheel-drive vehicles,
will enter the passenger car market in 1996, with a range of cars that it
will produce in co-operation with Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Samsung, one of
the nation's biggest industrial groups, is also seeking to move into car
manufacturing. It is negotiating with Toyota and Nissan of Japan on
technical support for the project, which it is estimated would cost at least
Dollars 6bn.
The optimistic Korean vehicle makers argue that there is still plenty of
room for growth. Only 35 per cent of Korean families own a car and some
companies believe they can double this number.
There are signs that domestic demand is weakening, however. The rate of
growth in sales in Korea has slowed from 40 per cent a year in the late
1980s to 18 per cent last year.
Adding to domestic pressures are the growing demands from Korea's trading
partners for barriers to imports to be dismantled. Korea held foreign car
sales last year to about 4,000 vehicles - only 0.2 per cent of total
domestic sales - through special taxes on imported 'luxury' models and by
making intimidating tax audits of foreign car buyers.
While imports make no inroads at home, exports already account for half of
production, with Korean vehicle makers gaining ground fast in the developing
world. Half of Korea's car exports go to the Third World, up from only 7 per
cent five years ago. All three leading companies are erecting assembly
plants in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and eastern Europe.
Korean cars can compete better in the developing world, where price is more
important than quality. Complaints in the US about the quality of Korean
cars blunted an export boom in the late 1980s.
But the Big Three are not neglecting the US and west Europe, and are
expanding their sales and marketing operations in these markets. Hyundai has
been established for several years in these regions, but it has now been
joined by Kia, and Daewoo plans to enter west Europe in 1995 and the US a
year later.
'The strategy of the Koreans is clear. They hope to use the Third World as
their main market for the next decade, giving them time to improve the
quality of their cars and finish preparations for a bigger marketing
presence in the US and Europe,' says Mr Don Lee, motor industry analyst for
BZW Securities in Seoul.
Korea has previously taken great risks in rapidly expanding such industries
as shipbuilding and semiconductors in spite of warnings that it was creating
a production glut. The gloomy predictions proved false and these industries
now enjoy growing prosperity. Korean carmakers are betting that their gamble
may prove as successful.

FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No reason why savings should not be
delivered (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN J JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The conclusions of the Cabinet Office report on the apparent lack of
value delivered by external consultancies to government departments are
disturbing. However, many of the pitfalls in the procurement of consultancy
services can easily be avoided if the purchaser and supplier mutually agree,
prior to commencement of the project, the scope, risks, dependencies and
measureable benefits to be delivered. Value for money is a prime concern,
and fee structures based on the financial savings achieved are being offered
by the more progressive consultancies.
It is also sound practice for the client to work in partnership with the
consultancy through to implementation in order to ensure fast delivery of
agreed benefits rather than have the client struggle with implementation
after the consultancy has withdrawn.
There is no reason why external intervention should not provide very
significant financial benefits if the consultancy chosen for the work has a
strong track record in achieving defined objectives. References should be
taken up wherever possible. Consultancies which cannot demonstrate such
expertise are best avoided.

<TEXT>
Sir, A report has highlighted that government agencies have spent more than
Pounds 500m on consultancies without checking whether they were receiving
value for money ('Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked', April
26).
This is not surprising. This company reduces overhead costs on a basis that
no fee is charged unless and until the client has actually saved money. As
might be expected, private firms welcome this. In contrast, when we recently
discussed how we work with a government agency, we were advised that 'no
savings - no fee' would be against official policy and that our proposal
would have to be restructured to provide for payment, irrespective of
results achieved.
How can government hope to improve its efficiency if it refuses to adopt the
management strategies of the private sector?

FT  28 APR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: It's time to put UK policy in neutral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British economic performance has this month received an accolade from an
unexpected source, the European Commission in Brussels. In its 1994 Annual
Economic Report it remarks: 'The UK enters 1994 with better short-term
prospects than most of the other member states; continued growth in output
is expected, with inflation remaining under control.' At the same time there
has been 'a turnaround in unemployment which was both earlier and sharper
than expected'.
These real improvements have been combined with a closer fulfilment of the
Maastricht fiscal criteria than that of most member countries. For instance
the UK general government deficit is expected to come down to the Maastricht
reference value of 3 per cent by the financial year 1996-97.
The Commission does, of course, put in some qualifiers and cautions. The
combination of the debt overhang and the weight of tax increases could still
depress consumption growth. It was this fear that caused the chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, to argue for a cut in interest rates - against the
scepticism of the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George - according
to the published version of their February meeting. The Commission urges,
instead, that exports and investment 'contribute increasingly' - a virtuous
exhortation we know by heart.
Meanwhile, it would be folly to take risks with interest rates to ward off a
threat which may not occur - especially as the yield on long-term gilts is
continuing to rise and sterling to slip. Neither development is alarming so
far, but both need to be taken into account. The CBI itself has stopped
pressing for base rate cuts. The most disappointing answers in its April
Trends Survey from businessmen relate to confidence and expectations. The
harder evidence of output and orders remains firm. Goldman Sachs points to a
similar discrepancy on the consumer side, where there is a quite unusual
contrast between low confidence and the actual trend of consumer spending.
One of the best recent innovations of the Central Statistical Office has
been the publication of an early flash indicator for gross domestic product.
This saves a great deal of work in putting together a vast amount of
scattered data from all parts of the economy. Much of this can now be
discarded, except for forward-looking indicators. These flash GDP estimates
are no more inaccurate than the more comprehensive estimates that appear
about a month later. The latest flash shows total real GDP in the first
quarter of 1994 some 2 1/2 to 3 per cent above both the same quarter a year
ago and the previous quarter when expressed at an annualised rate.
In most circumstances I would go by a somewhat lower figure which excludes
the volatile oil and gas sector and which has been rising more modestly.
But, on this occasion, any upward bias from the inclusion of the North Sea
sector is probably at least offset by a downward bias due to the
understatement of exports.
I have previously alluded to the remarkable increase in sterling export
prices since the UK left the ERM in 1992. While some upward movement was
likely, the recorded rise has been too large to be convincing; and it is
affected by the uncertainties in the new European Union trade statistics.
These are quite likely to overstate export prices and understate export
volume. They may understate import volumes too, but that would not affect
GDP. The net result is that UK output is not only rising, but probably
rising somewhat faster than the growth of productive capacity. Some of the
paradoxes about the fall in unemployment are being resolved by upward
revisions to estimates of the numbers of jobs, which unfortunately suggests
that productivity, even in manufacturing, is not now rising quite as fast as
it seemed to be a little while ago.
If the UK economy is doing so well, how come government popularity is so
low? There need not always be an economic explanation for everything,
especially in view of the vitriolic attacks made on John Major by sections
of the so-called Conservative media. In this case, however, it is not
difficult to find at least a contributory economic factor. Real personal
disposable income has increase by only 1 per cent a year over the past three
years, compared with 3 1/2 per cent over the previous five. Consumer
spending has itself only just regained its 1990 level; and future increases
will depend for a while on reductions in the personal savings ratio.
The pressure on personal incomes comes in large part from the need to raise
government revenues to reduce the budget deficit. But a rising share of
profits - ultimately beneficial to economic growth - is also making a
contribution. As the recovery proceeds and tax increases become a thing of
the past, personal prosperity should recover with it - although whether this
will be sufficient to save the Conservatives at the next election is far
more doubtful and not a matter about which non-partisan economic analysts
should fret too much.
The adjoining chart shows the relative positions of the main western
economies in a more interesting way than usual straight up-and-down
measures. It plots the estimated difference between actual and potential
output, as estimated by the IMF. Ideal stable growth would not be an upward
line, but a horizontal line coincident with the thick zero line on the
chart. For on this line output is growing at trend rates; and there is
neither a gap nor an excess compared with potential. Although the exact
position of each country relative to the thick line contains a large element
of guesswork, the broad trends are correct.
What they indicate in the bottom section is that France, Germany and Japan
have large amounts of slack in their economies which they show little sign
of eliminating, irrespective of whether their economies grow very slightly
or continue to decline. The largest amount of slack, and the prospect of
slightly worsening of recession, is evident in the case of Japan, which some
opponents of individualistic capitalism still want us to take as a model.
The German finance minister, Theo Waigel, has offered to bet the managing
director of the IMF, Michael Camdessus, that the projection of slow or no
growth for his country is wrong.
The US has had, on the other hand, the shallowest recession of the whole
group, and has now more than eliminated the output gap - so much so that the
Fed has begun to tighten to forestall inflationary pressures. The UK is
again in a different position: it has quite a lot of slack left in the
economy, but slack which may be eroding more quickly than the chart shows.
My own policy advice has, boringly, been the same for a good many months:
namely, leave well alone. What is, however, badly lacking in the UK - as in
other countries - is not fresh government measures but a criterion for
policy neutrality. What should base rates be if the Treasury and Bank are
trying neither to squeeze nor to stimulate the economy? Ultimately, we
should go by the growth of the national income in money terms. But, for an
immediate policy indicator, the Bank of England might take a leaf out of the
Fed's book and aim at a modest positive real rate of interest.
As underlying inflation is now around 2 1/2 per cent a year and base rates 5
1/4 per cent, we have a short-term real rate of around 2 3/4 per cent - and
obviously somewhat more for most businesses that borrow at above base rate.
This is a shade above average. Against this, evidence from gilts yields
suggest that over the next decade financial markets expect an inflation rate
of 4 to 4 1/2 per cent - clearly above the government's target range. Thus,
weighing up all the considerations, I come back yet again to: leave well
alone.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM R MACKENZIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Bryn Jones' letter (April 26) on the costs of EU proposals for
company consultative bodies is beguiling; Pounds 33,000 per multinational is
not the cost of this proposal. Dr Jones would know this were he to look at
the latest Commission proposal.
The EC publication European Participation Monitor stated that 'overall,
there seemed to be little difference in the transmission of strategic and
financial information between countries whether or not they have legislative
frameworks for worker participation'. Commission-funded research shows that
there is no benefit to be obtained from requiring multinational corporations
to introduce consultative committees.
The latest Commission proposal allows unlimited numbers of meetings of the
'European committee' and its 'attendant advisers', all of which must be paid
for by the company. The costs of such meetings, based on the Commission's
own assessment of their impact, is 'less than 10 Ecus per employee in a
business employing several thousands'. For each multinational with, say,
100,000 employees, the cost will be at least Pounds 750,000 per company per
year.
EEF research leads us to believe that these costs are significantly
understated. We estimate each meeting involving employee representatives and
advisers - with travel, accommodation, meeting facilities, translation
facilities, support staff and pay - will cost more than Pounds 100,000 per
occasion. The involvement of management from each member state will double
this cost. With employee pre-meetings and debriefings the cost escalates
even further, so Pounds 250,000 per meeting is foreseeable. The number of
meetings, which are at the employees' request, is unlimited.
Dr Jones should think again. With unemployment and competition on the agenda
throughout the EU, any suggestion that European business should increase its
operating cost simply to give trade unions an 'institutional significance',
but with no benefit to employees or to the business itself, is not in the
real world.

MASTER OF THE GAME
By Connie Bruck
Simon &amp; Schuster, Dollars 25, 395 pages
Steve Ross, whose deal-making genius created Time Warner, the world's
largest media conglomerate, used to say he learnt the art of handling people
when he ran the Riverside Chapel, a Manhattan funeral business owned by the
father of his first wife, at the start of his extraordinary career.
'It's a service business,' Ross would explain. 'You service people in an
emotional time - you learn about their needs, their feelings . . . If you
say to people who are grieving, 'Can I help you?' they will say, 'No one can
help me'. So I would say, 'Can I be of service to you?' ' It is a telling
anecdote. For as Connie Bruck points out in this fine biography, Ross's
almost visceral ability to cultivate people, and win their favour, was a key
ingredient in the transformation of that modest funeral business into Time
Warner, with interests ranging from Hollywood's Warner Brothers film studios
to the Time magazine publishing empire.
In attending to the needs of Hollywood stars - the ultimate service industry
 -'the professional empathiser par excellence of Riverside Chapel had found
his rarefied home'.
Yet the handsome, charming Ross, who died of cancer two years ago, also
stirred up immense controversy, most notably over a succession of shady
business deals and the lavish lifestyle he and his top executives enjoyed at
the company's expense. His attorney, Arthur Liman, once described him as
'the last great pasha of American business'.
Having created the company himself, Ross found it hard to draw the line
between what was his and what belonged to his shareholders. He thought
nothing of despatching a jet from the Caribbean to New York to collect some
genuine Nathan's hot dogs. An epigram framed in his office said: 'More is
not an illusion.'
Ms Bruck, a writer for New Yorker magazine, is clearly drawn to such
maverick, larger-than-life risk-takers. She made her name in the 1980s with
The Predators Ball, one of the best books on the rise of Michael Milken, the
junk bond king of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
Ross sprang from the kind of impoverished lower middle- class background
which has propelled upwards many a workaholic high-achiever. He was the son
of a Brooklyn builder who had lost his money and a socially ambitious,
doting mother. From an early age he displayed great skills in mental
arithmetic and an entrepreneurial drive, rising at 4am to sweep the snow
from neighbours' drives.
He started his business career at the Riverside Chapel, which he merged with
Kinney System, a New York car park company with underworld links, and took
the new entity on an acquisition binge which culminated in the 1969 takeover
of Warner Brothers-Seven Artists, the film and record company.
That company, much enlarged and renamed Warner Communications (WCI), merged
in turn with Time Inc in 1989. And while Time, a blue-blooded member of the
US business establishment, ostensibly took over the raffish Warner, Ross
emerged on top of the combined group. It was his finest negotiating hour.
Bruck may not reveal any great secrets about Ross's career, but her book
fleshes his life out with a mass of fascinating new detail, held together by
a strong narrative line and a crisp, lucid prose style.
The tale drags only once, when she presents the tortuous evidence in the
Westchester Premier scandal, where Warner was accused of making illegal
investments in a Mafia-run theatre. Ross escaped prosecution, leaving his
best friend and company colleague, Jay Emmett, to plead guilty.
The lesson of the book is that great - if flawed - individuals make great
companies. One of Ross's great strengths - apart from a gambler's bravado -
was strategic vision. He was one of the first US businessmen to appreciate
the importance of cable television and the increasingly global nature of the
entertainment industry.
Another was his deal-making prowess. He prepared carefully for every
negotiating session, memorising personal details about his opponents, which
he could throw into the conversation and catch them off-guard.
But he was no manager. Instead, he devolved power to his divisional heads
and bound what he called the 'Warner family' together by acting as a kind of
father figure, showering his favourites with lavish gifts and acts of
personal kindness. His favourite question was: 'Are you having fun?'
Yet this paid dividends too. Says Bruck: 'His apparent psychological need
(to be the provider of good news, good fortune, good food, good times)
meshed almost sublimely with business strategy. For by engendering such
unusually strong loyalty within WCI, Ross was able to protect his company
from the rapid turnover that was so endemic and destructive in other
entertainment companies.'
However, luck seemed to desert him after the Time Warner deal. The merger
has been marked by squabbling between the two corporate cultures and over
the strategy, pursued by Ross and his successor, Gerald Levin, of selling
off minority stakes in the 'crown jewel' entertainment business to pay down
the heavy debt burden resulting from the takeover.
Bruck suggests that Levin, while being a persuasive and far-sighted manager,
cannot adequately fill Ross's shoes and she concludes that the Time Warner
merger was probably not worth while, given its legacy of debt and
personality clashes, and the lack of genuine synergy between most of the
businesses.
It may yet be undone. Seagram, the large Canadian drinks company, has built
up a 14 per cent stake in the group and could be preparing to launch a bid,
though it denies this.
Perhaps Steve Ross is smiling from the grave: after all, he was Time Warner.
How can it possibly survive without him?

FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong trade unions not a misplaced
objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LUIS ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Latin America' (April 18), argues that income inequality
in Latin America would best be tackled by reducing inflation and implies
that the call by Mr Lawrence Summers, US Treasury under-secretary, for
strong trade unions is misplaced.
On the contrary, there is a close link between reducing income inequality
and encouraging trade unions, since only strong trade unions will be able to
raise incomes for the low paid and so reduce income inequality which, as you
will be aware, is higher in Latin America than in any other region of the
world.
As you correctly observe, at present labour laws in this region are very
unevenly applied - indeed, it would be more correct to say that they are
seriously violated in many countries, such as Colombia, where more than 100
trade unionists were murdered last year in the course of their union
activity.
Mr Summers is, therefore, quite right to argue for strengthening of trade
unions as a basis for social progress in this region.
I must add that the experience of countries which have proceeded to
privatise their health and education systems, which your editorial appears
to advocate, has been a serious decline in the quality and availability of
services and the introduction of user fees.
According to the International Labour Organisation, this has had negligible
effects on efficiency but has caused a substantial worsening of available
indicators of the health and education standards of the poor.
This is hardly the best way to address social problems.

FT  28 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Subsidiarity should be for the birds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN TRENCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Leolin Price QC (Letters, April 25) thinks that the issue of the
Cardiff Bay barrage raises serious concerns about the European Union and the
principle of subsidiarity. However, he does not seem to understand what
subsidiarity requires in the form implemented by the Maastricht treaty (and,
for environmental matters, by the Single European Act).
Subsidiarity means not only that the EU should not act when it is
inappropriate for it to do so, but, conversely, that it should act when it
is appropriate.
In the case of the Cardiff Bay barrage, the principle of subsidiarity
positively requires action at Union level, because habitats such as this are
used by birds which travel across Europe. Only when birds can be made to
stay within national boundaries will the situation be otherwise. The real
cause for concern is that the Commission has left it so late in the day to
show interest in a scheme which will have such a far-reaching effect.

FT  28 APR 94 / Arts: The Proms plan a nostalgic centenary season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 100th season of the BBC Proms opens on July 15 and yesterday director
John Drummond announced a programme wallowing in nostalgia and fascinating
oddities. This is not a time for ambitious new works (they will come in
1995, for which pieces have been commissioned from 18 composers including
Berio, Birtwistle, Elliott Carter, Steve Reich, Maxwell Davies, and Henze):
the only major premiere is John Tavener's 'The Apocalypse' on August 14, an
ambitious two hour work.
Instead the heroes and heroines of Proms Past are honoured. Among the more
interesting concerts is the re-creation, on July 16, of a typical Prom of
the turn of the century: the programme of September 6 1900, consisting of 17
works including patriotic Boer War songs such as 'When the Boys come Home'.
Eight concerts pay tribute to Proms personalities, including the founder Sir
Henry Wood; Basil Cameron; Constant Lambert; Malcolm Sargent and more. There
will also be 68 performances of works which received their British premieres
at the Proms, an extraordinary list including Mahler symphonies;
Tchaikovsky's First Symphony; Sibelius' 'Karelia Suite'; and Rakhmaninov's
Piano Concerto No 1.
Old traditions have been revived, such as a Wagner night; a Viennese night;
and the Beethoven symphonies played in chronological order. Heather Harper
comes out of retirement to sing on July 19; Ida Haendel, who made her Prom
debut in 1937, plays Britten's violin concerto on July 18 in front of the
Queen, who is making her first appearance at a Prom; and on July 22 Bernard
Haitink recreates the programme which marked his Proms debut in 1966.
As well as the biggest music festival in the world the Proms is the most
successful, with 83 per cent audience capacity last year. Yesterday John
Drummond paraded the amazing statistics: 42,000 works performed in 5,400
concerts over the century, with Wagner receiving almost 4,500 performances,
2,000 more than Beethoven. Sir Henry Wood conducted on almost 27,500
occasions, a long way ahead of Sir Malcolm Sargent with 2,400 Proms. And
Wagner's overture to 'Tannhauser' is the most performed work: it has been
played 280 times.

FT  28 APR 94 / Arts: Lively new cast for Figaro revival - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden Johannes Schaaf has again revived
his 1987 production of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, this time with a largely
new cast. It makes a rewarding evening: as a whole, a creditable Figaro
rather than a red-letter one, but with enough very good things to give
substantial pleasure.
Among those things are most of the comic and expressive touches that Schaaf
has lavished upon the action, with eager compliance from his actors. He
began his career as a straight theatre director, and it shows. The Act 2
bedroom-scene is stuffed with bright, characterful detail; some might think
that lily-gilding, but it is a long time since I saw this act so
sympathetically milked for its comic potential.
Schaaf does however succumb to an illusion rife among modern producers,
which is that you can stretch Mozart's rapid-fire recitatives indefinitely,
and even leave silent gaps in them to accommodate funny stage business. That
is wrong, as Schaaf's Act 1 proves; he leaves so many holes in the musical
texture that the 'real' music begins to sound like interpolations. There is
no reason to doubt that Mozart expected most of his recitative passages to
run fast, and to inflate them is to spoil his music-theatre proportions.
This four-hour evening would gain greatly by losing 10 or 15 minutes,
compressing Schaaf's clever trouvailles into Mozart's real-time score.
A vulgar reason for hastening to this Figaro - vulgar in the sense that it
is a bit stupid to go to Figaro, an ensemble-piece par excellence, for the
sake of one star performance - is that in the name-part young Bryn Terfel is
memorably good. Though he looks like a friendly, dishevelled bear, in the
style of Gerard Depardieu, his reactions and furies are quickly transparent:
venomous relish in 'Se vuol ballare', fine comic timing, his full-blooded
romantic baritone cannily reserved for the right places later.
Plenty of feeling too, and vital diction, and he is nifty on his pins
(Romayne Grigorova's choreography is a model of pretty tact). But sociable
Figaro cannot exist in a void; fortunately, Terfel has a sharp match in
Jeffrey Black's first-rate Count - lots of sexy panache and preening style,
underpinned by a healthy vein of loutishness.
The women are trickier. The best Susannas seem to control the action from
start to finish, but Sylvia McNair's is too cultivated and shy to do that;
crucially she lacks Susanna's spirit, though she sings a melting 'Deh
vieni'. Similarly, Monica Bacelli - whose youthful reputation has preceded
her first appearance here - is a Cherubino whose fetching 'Voi che sapete'
comes too late to compensate for her watery, over-subtle 'Non so piu': we
miss the honestly wracked adolescent.
As the unhappy Countess, McNair's younger American colleague Christine
Brewer cuts a maternal figure and delivers her arias in diva-style. Schaaf
gives her a nasty hangover for her first appearance, and a continuing
alcoholic thirst. In principle, his emphasis upon her guilty attraction to
young Cherubino - which Mozart's librettist da Ponte chose to play down,
against the original Beaumarchais text - is plausibly right, but with Miss
Bacelli's bantam-sized, sexless Cherubino stretched upon Miss Brewer's ample
nightgowned rack it becomes too inappropriately Freudian for belief.
Della Jones is a sparky Marcellina who justifies her extraneous Act 4 aria,
unlike Philip Doghan's Don Basilio with his, though elsewhere his slimy,
whey-faced blandness is irreproachable. Gwynne Howell, John Dobson, Deborah
York and the veteran Federico Davia (as a very crusty son-of-the-soil
gardener, Antonio) are fine. Conductor Hartmut Haenchen keeps sound tempi,
points up Mozart's cleverest orchestral details and is generously attentive
to his singers, stopping just short of full, long-sighted authority.
Xenia Hausner's surprising sets - everything happens under a painted,
symbolical Baroque canopy-ceiling - are handsome. The surtitles are mingy,
and seem to suppose that every opera-goer has enough ground-level Italian to
do without any translations at all in some places: not true, of course. Yet
none of those failings matters much; this Figaro will serve very well as a
first-draft introduction to a miraculous, inexhaustible opera, or as a fresh
reading for older hands. Mozart was 30 when he wrote it.

FT  28 APR 94 / Arts: Phoenix Dance Company - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phoenix Dance Company has so much in its favour - splendid dancers;
enthusiasm; a devoted public - that it is sad to find these advantages less
than well used. The fault, I suspect, lies in the choreographic material
that the company choses, and also in a doctrinaire attitude to the fact of
being a black dance troupe.
The ensemble is one of the most triumphant justifications for dance in
secondary education. In the early 1980s, Harehills School in Leeds offered
dance as part of its curriculum. Three Harehills boys decided to make dance
their career, and Phoenix resulted, growing in skill, in size, in public
acclaim, and acquiring women members as the years passed. Success and
attainment have been real and thrilling. But over the years I have noted
that the choreography, in the main, has lagged behind the dancers'
abilities.
Even half-way decent choreography is now at a premium, and the programme
which Phoenix offers this week at Sadler's Wells is testimony to this. As
always with indifferent dances, the dancers are minimised, trapped in
stereotypical attitudes, blinkered as performers. They are vastly better
than their material, and the identities their choreography imposes on them -
notably in a dire piece by Donald Byrd - show them as cliches rather than
the artists they so proudly should be. They are best challenged by Darshan
Singh Bhuller's Heart of Chaos, which deals with the emotionally and
physically brutalising effects of boxing and allows three of the men to
create positive characters.
I venture to suggest that instead of always staging new and sometimes
ill-conceived work, Phoenix acquire established or unjustly neglected
repertory pieces from the greatest names of modern dance. They have the
skills needed to tackle Graham or Taylor or Tharp, and might acknowledge
British dance's debt by presenting work by Robert Cohan. The image of
Phoenix proposed by Donald Byrd's Fatal Strategy is so blatant, and
ultimately so vulgar in its admixture of bad ballet and strutting, that we
ought not to leave the theatre with this as our final view of the ensemble.
(Its score, by Mio Morales, is also a nasty assault on the ear-drums).
Pamela Johnson's Face our own Face, which opens the programme, comes
burdened with a note about blackness, but the dance neither identifies nor
comments upon this in any cogent fashion. We merely see admirable dancers
posing on handsome metallic screens (by Christiane Ewing) and indulging in
predictable 'modern' activity.
I admire Phoenix and respect its attainments too much to want anything but
the best for its dancers. The troupe's identity should not depend on
leopard-skin knickers and gimcrack sexuality but on the grandest matters of
modern dance, which are the company's rightful heritage.
Sadler's Wells until April 30.

Insights into two famous, but obscure, British traditions are the highlights
of tonight's viewing. Taking Liberties (BBC 2, 8pm) investigates the arcane
world of the coroner. Apparently, once appointed this is a job for life and
only one coroner has been removed since the second world war. But are all
inquests conducted with due attention to legal practice and the delicate
emotions of the bereaved? The emphasis here is on what can go wrong.
It is followed at 9.30 by True Brits, which for the first time goes inside
the Foreign Office. We follow the junior minister, Tristan Garel-Jones,
around Europe during the period of the UK's EC presidency, and watch
diplomatic discussions between our Civil Service elite and foreigners.
Outside Edge, Richard Harris's stage comedy, has transferred happily to
television and to extension. This affectionate tale of the tribulations
(mainly sexual) of a local cricket team is a civilised delight on the ITV
schedule (8.30). The players all hit it off so well that you can see a
follow-up series in the imaginations of the programmers. Not a bad idea.

FT  28 APR 94 / Arts: Buddha from Seattle - Cinema

<TEXT>
LITTLE BUDDHA (12) Bernardo Bertolucci
DEADLY ADVICE (15) Mandie Fletcher
ROMEO IS BLEEDING (18) Peter Medak
MOTHER'S BOYS (15) Yves Simoneau
ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE (12) Tom Shadyac
Bernardo Bertolucci has always been fascinated by tensions arising when West
meets East, whether it be the fate of an anglicised Chinese Emperor or
American expats adrift in the Moroccan desert. Now, with his sumptuous
Little Buddha, this thematic concern becomes even more explicit as the
Italian director abandons the tragic slant of his recent work to depict an
attempted merger of the two cultures.
The film concerns a nine-year old American boy (Alex Wiesnedanger) who is
suspected by Buddhist monks of being the reincarnation of a recently
deceased saint. An ageing lama (Ying Ruocheng) travels from Bhutan to
Seattle in order to convince his parents (Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak)
that he should be allowed to return to the monastery to see if he truly does
possess the blessed soul. Not surprisingly, the wealthy yuppies resist the
idea at first, though after suffering personal loss they agree to take the
boy East for the spiritual examination.
Bertolucci's story contains the germ of what might have been an intriguing
film. After all, what would you do if four charming, saffron-robed monks
showed up on your doorstep claiming your child was a minor deity? Send them
packing? Demand proof? See the possibility of saving money on boarding
school? Believe them?
The dramatic possibilities are rich, and the film comes to life when
Bertolucci explores them. Unfortunately, he then proceeds to add long,
digressive sequences dramatising the life of Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves), the
young prince who became the Buddha. While these lyrical passages are often
spectacularly filmed, their schools programme tone saps the film of its
dramatic strength. By the end, when the true nature of the boy's soul is
revealed and the old lama is tossed into the cosmic recycling bin, it is
hard to feel any emotional connection with either of them. That is the
problem with tackling the universal - you lose the personal. And while
abandoning the personal may be what Buddhism is about, there is little room
for it in screen storytelling.
Deadly Advice calls itself a black comedy, though a more appropriate colour
would be drab gray. Former Blackadder director Mandie Fletcher's first
feature deals with a bookish wallflower (Jane Horrocks) who decides to kill
her domineering mother (Brenda Fricker) on the strength of advice given to
her by the ghosts of notorious murderers such as Dr Crippen and Jack the
Ripper. The body count escalates as the locals become suspicious, until the
once retiring Horrocks stands ready to join the company of serial killers
who have been haunting her.
Although the film's premise is ripe for dark laughter, Fletcher and writer
Glenn Chandler have trouble raising even the lightest chuckle. Instead of
the delirious unpredictability and cheery nihilism of previous British black
comedies such as Kind Hearts and Coronets, we are instead left with a cosily
inoffensive little picture that refuses to challenge either itself or the
audience.
There is nothing cosy or inoffensive about Romeo is Bleeding, Peter Medak's
woefully misguided attempt to venture into the mean streets that belong to
Martin Scorsese and Abel Ferrara. Gary Oldman plays a corrupt New York
policeman in the pay of the mob. When they order him to murder a renegade
hitwoman (Lena Olin), he unwisely falls in love with her instead, putting
his job, marriage and life in dire jeopardy. By the time the smoke clears
there are countless victims, none in worse shape than our credulity.
Hilary Henkin's absurd and pretentious screenplay was once chosen by a
leading magazine as one of the 'Ten Best Unproduced Scripts in Hollywood',
which makes you think that, until recently anyway, Tinseltown knew what it
was doing. For his part, Medak seems to believe that if he throws enough
pace and blood at us we will not notice the mess. None of the actors fares
very well, although commiseration must be extended to the usually fine Olin,
who spends the entire film wearing Wonder Bras and little else. Even after
losing her arm she still has to play the bimbo.
For its first half hour, Mother's Boys promises to be the sort of serious
family drama Hollywood is reluctant to make these days. It concerns a
feckless woman (Jamie Lee Curtis) who comes back to her family after having
abandoned them without explanation three years earlier. Her husband (Peter
Gallagher) is none too happy about her return, especially when she announces
that she wants to resume mothering their three sons. But there is little he
can legally do to stop her, even after she shows herself intent on wrecking
his relationship with his new girlfriend.
Early on the director, Yves Simoneau, sketches this uneasy tangle of
relationships with care, particularly in the scene where Curtis performs a
mock-innocent striptease to win back the affections of her estranged
12-year-old boy. But the film soon becomes a preposterous thriller,
culminating in a final scene in which half the cast dangles on the edge of a
Californian cliff in a Volvo.
I am not sure what it says about the state of modern cinema when the most
accomplished film on offer in a week is Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, but it
cannot be good. This is the sort of shaggy dog film that some people love,
while the rest will be left slack-jawed in wonder that such daftness ever
got made. The convoluted plot of dolphin-napping is little more than an
excuse for the antics of the American comedian Jim Carrey, undoubtedly one
of the more original talents to hit the screen of late. With his rubbery
face and cartoonish voice, Carrey is like a manic blend of Pee Wee Herman
and Lassie. His Ace Ventura only takes on cases involving animals, drives
with his head out the side window and keeps a flap on his freezer door so
his pet penguins can get in and out. When his admiring girlfriend says that
he must really love animals, he answers: 'If it gets cold enough.' A must
for pet owners everywhere.

FT  28 APR 94 / Technology: The personal touch - Italian industry and
universities are coming together as the state loosens its grip on research
planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tourist authorities at Massa, on the coast of Tuscany, and the port of
Marina di Carrara a few miles north, suffer from different aspects of the
same problem. The currents are denuding Massa's beach of sand while filling
Carrara's harbour with deposits.
When Massa heard the port had to be dredged, it expressed an interest in
having some sand back. But was it polluted? A study by the Pisa Research
Consortium concluded that at 3m down the sand was perfectly suitable for
sunbathing.
The consortium is one of nine attached to universities set up in the 1980s
to help meet a need not fully catered for in Italy's highly centralised and
bureaucratic research system: to transfer innovative technology from
universities to industry. Francesco Archetti, general director of the Milan
Research Consortium, describes them as 'merchant banks for research, setting
up design projects which people in universities carry out'.
His consortium is, however, directly involved in a project called Improd,
which has Ecu5.5m (Pounds 4.3m) of funding and comes under the European
Union's Esprit information technology research initiative. In collaboration
with research bodies and companies including SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian
group which is the world leader in integrated circuits, the consortium's
computer scientists are developing a tool to provide built-in quality. The
consortium believes it improves on existing programs in that it forecasts
out-of-control situations and diagnoses where the manufacturing process is
going wrong.
The Improd approach has involved applied research, with consortium staff
working on shifts at the Milan plant of SGS-Thomson, which is sufficiently
pleased with the project to have introduced the second version of the
technique at its factories worldwide. The tool is being refined a third time
and could eventually be introduced at all European semiconductor plants.
The Pisa and Milan consortiums each have an annual budget of L5bn (Pounds
2.1m) and were set up by IRI, the industrial state holding company, and the
National Research Council (CNR) which is the biggest of the public-sector
research bodies with more than 250 units, about 100 of which are inside
universities.
The state plays a bigger role in research planning than in most OECD
countries and the most common complaint is about excessive bureaucracy.
'Italian researchers are very aware of the legal framework within which they
operate and can quote the reference numbers of a wide range of laws,' notes
a recent British Council study.
But in the same way that the country's dominant state-controlled industry is
being unwound by privatisation, a little freedom is filtering into the
academic system. This year, in line with reforms set in motion by Antonio
Ruberti, former universities and research minister and now EU education
commissioner, universities will be handed control over their own budgets,
which will force them to face tough spending choices.
Moreover, a university's base-line funding could be affected by the
ministry's view of its efficiency, including its research performance. This
implies a departure from the traditional a pioggia approach to research
funding in which resources are distributed like a shower of rain, evenly but
thinly, with insufficient attention paid to the respective merits of
projects and sparse evaluation of results.
The reforms should encourage stronger ties between universities and
industry, which are weak compared with the rest of northern Europe, at a
time when Italy is trying to tackle its budget deficit. 'This should produce
an electric effect but I don't think it has sunk in yet,' says a foreign
observer.
One university rector who is aware of the challenge is Luciano Modica, at
Pisa. 'We can't hope any longer that the money will just arrive. We must
contact industry and offer our services.' Research contracts at Pisa,
including the consortium, amount to only 3 per cent of the university's
budget. 'This is too little,' says Modica. 'It ought eventually to be 15 per
cent.'
The irony is that Pisa is overflowing with researchers - there are 2,400 in
a town with a population of 100,000. Besides the university and consortium,
there is a cluster of CNR units and the elite college of Scuola Normale
Superiore founded by Napoleon. One three-year course at the college for
science graduates is sponsored by the chemicals group Montedison and ENI,
the state energy group.
Within the consortium, besides the environmental technology centre which
conducted the Marina di Carrara study, there is a space technology centre
which, together with the aerospace company BPD, is developing advanced
thrusters for space propulsion.
'Because of its futuristic character, this project could not have been
undertaken in strictly industrial surroundings,' says Mariano Andrenucci,
head of Pisa Research Consortium.
One approach Pisa university intends to follow is to compete for big
contracts attracting public funds, such as the Mediterranean basin
environmental programme. Also, it will offer its laboratories as incubators
to small companies developing products. On another front, at the request of
the Fiat motor group, the university is setting up a training course for
using supercomputers in simulation tests.
One reason why university research has had a largely academic orientation,
says Modica, is because contact with industry was felt to be the domain of
CNR. Indeed, the five-year progetti finalizzati - targeted projects - chosen
by CNR remain a main point of contact between researchers and industry.
But CNR operates within a bureaucratic straitjacket typical of a
public-sector research system which benefits big companies familiar with red
tape. Small enterprises rely more on the constant dynamic of Italian
business - personal contact. This throws up centres of excellence and, as
one professor put it, makes the Italian research picture maculata, or
non-uniform.
The personal touch is likely to remain the main lubricator, even given
reforms. 'Our visiting cards are our graduates,' says Modica. 'They often
return to Pisa and say: 'Our company needs this.''

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proteus International, a UK biotechnology company that uses computers to
design drugs, has appointed Jurek Sikorski as business development and
marketing director.
Biotechnology companies usually spend many years developing products before
they can be sold, and Sikorski's appointment reflects Proteus' confidence
that some of its 30 development programmes will come to fruition shortly.
Ten products are scheduled to be in clinical trials or the veterinary
equivalent by the end of the year. The first product, an anti-diarrhoea
treatment for cattle, should be on sale later this year, says Proteus.
Sikorski, 42, comes from healthcare group Smith and Nephew, where he was
international marketing director. Previously, he worked in marketing for
Wellcome Diagnostics and UK biotechnology company Celltech, where he was
chief executive of a US subsidiary called Boots- Celltech Diagnostics.

Retired Vice-Admiral Sir Neville Purvis has been appointed chief executive
of the British Standards Institution.
Sir Neville served until February as Chief of Fleet Support in the Royal
Navy. BSI says Sir Neville has 'extensive experience at senior management
level in a complex and diverse organisation like BSI'.
The BSI has been without a chief executive at the bridge since last year
when Michael Sanderson stepped down after 18 months over what the BSI called
a 'deep disagreement on important matters of policy and management'. The BSI
will not expand on the disagreement.
BSI's problems came to a head last November when a row with its members
turned down plans to strengthen the powers of the directors and to double
directors' fees.
Sir Neville said yesterday that the BSI had faced 'problems of communication
rather than substance'. He said the BSI was an important conduit between
industry and the international organisations where many standards are now
agreed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AEA Technology, the newly created arm of the Atomic Energy Authority which
is to be privatised later this year, has its first chief executive.
He is to be Peter Watson, the British Rail main board director for
engineering. Before joining BR in 1991, Watson spent most of his career at
GKN, the engineering group, where he rose to be head of research and
development, and ran two operating divisions.
Watson, 50, was selected because of his combined experience of science and
business, as well as his knowledge of both public and private sector
companies.
According to Sir Anthony Cleaver, AEA chairman, 'We have a unique
opportunity to create for Britain a flagship science and engineering
services company, and we needed someone with the right credentials to help
realise that vision.' Meanwhile, Watson believes that AEA is capable of
'being a leader in the world' as a provider of high technology services.
Though the sale of AEA Technology is expected to realise about Pounds 200m,
decisions have still to be taken on the form of its privatisation.

FT  28 APR 94 / Technology: Digital dream come true - Xerox is hoping for a
document 'highway'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Documents are going digital. Electronic printing 'on demand' is likely to
become as common in offices, factories, universities and libraries as
voluminous files of paper and shelves of books are today. Some companies
already save time and money by storing, sending and printing their
information digitally.
Xerox, the US document processing company, has even invented a new term for
this. Just as people are getting to grips with the information superhighway,
it has come up with the notion of the document superhighway. There are even
'on ramps' and 'off ramps', in the form of equipment such as document
scanners and printers, to link users to the new digital communications
networks (the data highways) being set up worldwide, notably in the US.
As with many announcements in the computer and electronics world, the
message Xerox sought to put across in New York last week was somewhat
overwhelmed by the breathless show business nature of its presentation. It
mixed in news about improved equipment, software to integrate the stages in
the life of a document from creation to printing, and alliances with other
companies to help develop the
manufacturing and operating standards for future products and services.
Beneath the hype, though, Xerox's basic message was simple: that the
worldwide users of the many billions of business, government, educational
and other documents would increasingly be able to collect, store, distribute
and print them electronically where, when and in what form and volume they
pleased - 'the ability to plug in and publish anywhere and everywhere,' as
Peter van Cuylenberg, Xerox executive vice-president, puts it. This would
mean big savings on logistical and transport costs, which RR Donnelley, the
US commercial printer, says can account for more than half the cost of a
document.
'Today,' adds van Cuylenberg, 'you can pick up and telephone anywhere and
call anywhere else. It should be the same with documents and publications.'
But there is a long way to go before this digital dream is realised and the
offset printing industry loses large chunks of business to electronic
techniques. Current digital technology allows only black and white printing
with colour highlights, though Xerox says colour is on the way; full offset
quality (using plates and ink) will still be demanded by many document
users.
Xerox recognises this. 'They're not going to roll over and play dead,' says
Paul Allaire, the group's chairman, about the offset printers. 'We
understand that.' Even so, it intends to capture as large a slice as
possible of the section of the offset market which could eventually go
digital. This amounts to some Dollars 93bn (Pounds 64bn) worldwide,
according to a study by the US Department of Commerce and Gartner Group, a
consultancy.
While commercial book printing could also become digital eventually - some
educational publications are already printed this way, especially in the US
 -the main switch from offset is expected to occur in the more mundane area
of business forms, training manuals, brochures and newsletters. Offset
printers will still compete for this business, as will other companies in
the digital document business such as Hewlett-Packard and Kodak.
Document users who have started taking the digital route have achieved
significant savings. Tektronix, the Oregon-based computer graphics, video
system and measurement company, can now print its complicated product
manuals electronically at a day's notice compared with up to 28 days by
conventional methods. It can insert changes more easily and its whole
printing operation runs in line with the product manufacturing process.
At the Los Angeles county health department, responsible for six hospitals
and 50 clinics, annual savings of some Dollars 220,000 have been made by
moving to digital methods. Massachusetts-based Technical Documentation
Publishing saved 26 per cent of the cost of one job for a client wanting
bulky files sent to Europe; it sent them electronically to the UK for
digital printing.
The industry buzzword for all this is 'connectivity'. John Seely Brown,
Xerox's chief scientist, describes it as 'taking the sides off the boxes
(the high-speed document scanners, storage devices and printers) and making
the machines truly modular'. Towards the end of 1994, it will sell new
software called DocuSP (document services platform) to integrate the boxes
and link them with personal computer-based desktop publishing operations.
Looking to the future, Xerox is entering into alliances with more than 50
information technology concerns to speed the development of new open systems
which can be used by all equipment and software suppliers.
It also announced a link-up with AT&amp;T in the US to enable document data to
be sent along telecommunications lines. Similar deals are being made with
Belgacom, the Belgian telecommunications operator, and PTT Telecom
Netherlands.
Yet all the digital expertise in the world will not help if document users
cannot keep a close eye on the growing mass of information bombarding them.
Xerox has thus evolved new ways of viewing large amounts of data so that
items of varying importance and relevance can be seen together without
cluttering up the screen.
Its Information Visualizer, based on scientific and psychological research,
will enable users to call up files and keep them in context. One method
already in use is the 'cone tree' on which file names can be identified as
this is rotated, then pulled out to examine data. Another is to put file
names on a computerised wall which can be moved to view items of both
central and peripheral interest.
Seely Brown, who also heads the group's Xerox Parc research unit, believes
such technological changes will help take the growing chaos out of office
work by making complex equipment easier to use. 'I have the feeling that
technology is finally getting powerful enough to get the hell out of the
way.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shiraz Malik-Noor yesterday completed his victorious return to power at
troubled royal jelly company Regina by being appointed chief executive;
Monday's extraordinary general meeting had put him back on the board.
Paul Geoghegan, the chairman who fought valiantly to keep Malik-Noor away
from the company at which he (Malik-Noor) is major shareholder, has stood
down.
He has been replaced by Guy Neely, a former finance director at Glaxo and
treasurer of the Mercers Company, who was voted onto the board at the
tumultuous EGM.
Malik-Noor had called another EGM in order to propose the removal of
Geoghegan and finance director Tony Shakesby from the board, but this has
been cancelled and Shakesby will remain.

FT  28 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan's brands feel
the pinch, too - Competition laws and recession are helping retailers'
own-label goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Daiei, Japan's biggest supermarket chain, has for years posed a challenge to
the country's old-fashioned retailing industry, as it strove to remove long
distribution lines and networks of wholesalers and allow more flexible
retail prices.
Although it has toned down its revolutionary stance since Isao Nakauchi, its
chairman, joined the Keidanren league of business leaders, the retailer has
been the catalyst of the recent 'own label' brand boom.
As in the west, retailer brands, which are not only cheaper than national
brands but now also of high quality, are known as private label or no-name,
and their pricing, shelf space and promotion are entirely in the hands of
the retailer.
Although the concept was adopted by many Japanese supermarket chains during
the late 1970s, the number of items was limited, and they were never a
threat to national brands. During the consumer boom of the 1980s, Japanese
shoppers became even more brand conscious than ever, forcing many retailers
to scale down their private-label lines.
However, Daiei says private brands are entering a new age. Partly this
reflects the recession but also supermarkets have gained purchasing and
distribution power by expanding. The Daiei group has more than 6,000 retail
outlets and holds 3 to 4 per cent market share of most products. Other big
supermarket chains such as Jusco and Ito-Yokado are also seeing increasing
private-brand sales.
The yen's recent appreciation has also helped, allowing retailers to buy
cheaper imports for their private-label lines.
This growing trend hurts national brands which are already feeling the
squeeze due to the tightening of the laws promoting competition. In the past
manufacturers would threaten to stop supplies if a retailer failed to apply
the retail price 'suggested' by the manufacturer. However, US pressure to
give more power to Japan's Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly
watchdog, helped clamp down on such practices.
Recently, Daiei's private label video tapes, sourced from a Korean
manufacturer, have forced TDK, the leading video tape maker, to abandon the
low end of the domestic market.
Meanwhile, national-brand orange juice makers were compelled to discount
their products after Daiei's orange juice, imported from Brazil, was sold at
half the price of the leading labels.
The private brand boom is also opening the door to overseas manufacturers
which lack the ability to set up distribution networks in Japan. Agfa, the
German-Belgium photo film maker which recently agreed to supply Daiei with
its private brand photo film, says the market has been impenetrable. Since
the brand is virtually unknown in Japan, the company says supplying Daiei
will be good exposure.
Similar changes have also been seen in the higher end of the retail market,
where leading department stores are creating lower-priced goods. The recent
decline in consumer spending has hit high street retailers the hardest, and
to bring back shoppers they feel the need to differentiate themselves from
their peers.
Isetan, which has recently opened a store in London's Piccadilly, offers
shoppers its 'Only I' brand in its Tokyo outlets, covering a range from
fashion items to food, developed originally or together with famous
designers. The retailer says its 'Only I' brand totals 8 per cent of total
sales, and it hopes to bring the figure up to 20 per cent in the near
future.
But while the penetration of private brands is growing, analysts estimate
that retailer labels still account for less than 10 per cent of the retail
market.
'We've nurtured our brand, putting in money for research and development and
marketing, and consumers want to pay for the certificate of quality,' says
Fuji Photo Film, which holds 70 per cent of the Japanese market. Kao, a
leading household goods producer, says marketing costs account for about 10
per cent of its retail price, but plays an important part in providing
shoppers with information about the product.
One major problem, say the retailers, is the decline in choice due to the
spread of private-brand items on the shelves. Takanobu Seko, chief of foods
merchandising at Daiei, says its private-label orange juice accounts for 80
per cent of its total orange juice sales, and it has to cut down on the
shelf space of national brands. But retailer Jusco says its own label's
current level of 6 per cent of total sales is just the right balance.
Nevertheless, manufacturers are aware of the shift in power to retailers.
Some are rushing to form alliances with large-scale retailers to remain in
favour and secure shelf space.
Kao formed a marketing alliance with Jusco last year in which they connected
their computers to eliminate order and sales slips, and agreed to co-operate
on marketing.
But Japanese manufacturers are also seeing their influence weakening due to
international retail alliances. Retailer Ito-Yokado recently announced it
had agreed a tie-up with Wal-Mart, the leading US discount retailer, to buy
Wal-Mart's own-brand products.
And while until now most private brands have been products such as foods,
household goods and clothing, retailers say they want to expand their range.
'It would be nice to have our own consumer electronics line,' says Atsushi
Yamashiro at Jusco.

FT  28 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): After the dust has
settled - Roland Adburgham and Diane Summers look at the impact of Hoover's
ill-fated free-flights promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For well over half a century Hoover has been the generic term for a vacuum
cleaner. However, after more than 18 months of being linked constantly to
the phrase 'free-flights fiasco', the name may now be as readily associated
in some minds with a disastrous sales promotion.
Last week Maytag, Hoover's US parent company, disclosed that the ill-fated
promotion had cost the company more than Pounds 48m - more than double the
sum originally feared when Maytag took stock of the damage early last year.
The promotion which caused all the trouble closes this week. In reality,
Hoover will feel the reverberations of its free-flights offer for some time
to come. There are also signs that consumer attitudes have hardened towards
'free offers' in general, with companies more cautious in their approach to
sales promotions of every kind.
The problem for Hoover started in autumn 1992 when it promised customers who
spent at least Pounds 100 on a Hoover product two free air tickets to
continental Europe or the US. From the customers' point of view, it seemed
the bargain of the decade. Demand was such that Hoover, which employs 3,500
people in the UK, had to step up production of vacuum cleaners which were
just over the Pounds 100 threshold.
It rapidly became clear that Hoover had grotesquely underestimated the
take-up of the offer. Thousands of customers were infuriated by delays in
obtaining flights. Maytag intervened. Three senior executives lost their
jobs and a taskforce, at its peak employing 250 people, was set up.
Peter le Conte, chairman of the Institute of Sales Promotion (ISP), says
that Hoover could have done 'a lot more a lot earlier' when it became clear
the promotion was going awry.
'Perhaps instead of wriggling, it would have been better to have come clean
and try and do something else,' he says. Le Conte suggests, for example,
that the company might have been able to fulfil its obligations on flights
over a period of years.
The offer itself was flawed, from the first, he adds: 'In my book it doesn't
stack up to be able to buy a product for Pounds 100-Pounds 200 and fly to
America for significantly more than the cost of the product you purchased.'
The sheer scale of the take-up of the promotion has been breathtaking:
Hoover says 220,000 people have now flown or are booked on flights up to
June. The taskforce is now winding down.
'By the end of this month, or by the end of June, Hoover will have fulfilled
its commitments and obligations,' says Hoover spokeswoman, Caroline Knight.
Not so, claims a group of dissatisfied consumers which has organised itself
as the Hoover Holiday Pressure Group. Last week three leaders of the group
flew to Maytag's headquarters in Iowa accompanied by boxes containing what
the group said were 7,000 letters of complaint, and on Tuesday the group's
representatives spoke at the company's annual general meeting.
The group has yet to decide whether it will pursue legal action in the High
Court in London. Hoover has already faced about 70 cases in small claims
courts, all of which it has defended, and about one in five of which it has
lost.
The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the advertising watchdog, is
currently investigating seven consumer complaints and the ISP has also asked
the ASA to examine whether the promotions industry's voluntary code of
practice has been breached.
The code sets out, in general terms, promoters' responsibilities not to
disappoint consumers and to make realistic calculations of the likely
response to a promotion. However, according to Keith Richards, a barrister
at the Consumers' Association, the code lacks teeth. The association, which
is still dealing with complaints from dissatisfied Hoover customers, would
like to see the ASA, or a similar body, having the power to fine companies
which breach the code.
'I'm sure consumers are now shaken and will not be so readily willing to be
taken in by sales promotions,' says Richards.
Le Conte agrees that the Hoover case has 'caused people to be more cynical,
which is extremely unfortunate'. But he says the ISP has seen a big upturn
in companies seeking legal and copy advice before they go ahead with
promotions. 'Everybody is super-aware that promotions that go wrong can
seriously damage your health,' he says.
Hoover denies that any long-term damage has been done either to sales or to
the company's image. Says Knight: 'Customers are able to differentiate
between a quality product and, regrettably, a flawed promotion. Our sales
figures indicate that the brand has not suffered and we have maintained
market share.'
There does not appear to be any evidence that Hoover sales have been
damaged. Scottish Power, one of Scotland's largest electrical retailers,
says there was a temporary dip in Hoover sales after the offer, which was
promoted particularly hard in its territory and provoked a great deal of
adverse publicity.
It may be, though, that this dip was caused by a glut of second-hand vacuum
cleaners on the market, as people disposed of machines purchased only to
fulfill the conditions of the promotion. Whatever the reason, sales soon
recovered, says the retailer.
Hoover even had enough confidence last year to offer a new travel promotion
and could do so again in the future. Says Knight: 'Travel remains a very key
motivator in sales promotions.'
Although the company must be assuming the worst is over, it looks likely
that the consequences of the offer will drag on for months, if not years. In
the longer term it can only hope the 'free-flights fiasco' will be a
relatively short-lived association and that Hoover will mean vacuum cleaners
for at least another 50 years.

FT  28 APR 94 / Accountancy Column: Companies yet to give the green light -
Roger Adams, Tessa Tennant and Lucy Varcoe look at the growing interest in
environmental reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER ADAMS, TESSA TENNANT and LUCY VARCOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last four years have seen an explosion of activity and interest in
environmental reporting. A genuinely committed movement has emerged, but one
with no definite direction and therefore no destination.
Since Norsk Hydro first came out of the closet with an environmental report
in 1990, more than 30 UK companies have begun to make extensive disclosures
in stand-alone reports, and many hundreds more are putting statements into
their accounts. In other countries, Dow Chemicals, Danish Steelworks, Kunert
and BSO Origin are among those that have experimented with green reporting.
In a market economy, ways must be found to convey the financial and economic
consequences of corporate environmental practice as well as the bald details
of the performance itself. Reporting progress towards sustainability -
virtuous and admirable though it is - may be insufficient.
For better or worse, financial reporting has long had the accounting
profession as its guide and shaper, and the Stock Exchange as its
destination. The environmental reporting movement has no such single
channel, largely because the audience has remained resolutely elusive and
obstinately unresponsive.
Such research as exists seems to indicate that the provision of
environmental data is hardly ever demand-led. In principle, potential users
are similar to those for financial reporting, except the order of priority
is different. Financial reports are normally assumed to be for the benefit
of shareholders first and the financial markets second, with others, like
employees and business contacts, lagging behind.
By contrast, most companies producing environmental reports claim to be
doing so primarily for their employees. It seems unlikely that they are
doing it for shareholders, since little attempt is made to communicate the
issues through the traditional channels of the annual report or summary
statement.
Bringing up the rear are the fund managers and investment analysts. Few,
when questioned, admit to having much interest in environmental information
being reported in increasing quantities. They are not told if or why it is
important and they are given no financial clues on the costs and benefits of
being green. Equally, they are not apparently bothering to ask.
There are some exceptions. In the UK, there are now about 40 investment
products bound by ecological or ethical criteria with a combined value of
over Pounds 650m. But these funds are the exception, and their operations
are hampered by the lack of financial detail in current environmental
reports.
A recent survey of the environmental reporting practices of the European
chemical industry by Andrea Spencer-Cooke suggested that in the near-total
absence of such information, analysts could do little more than act by
exception: downgrading companies that were not publishing such reports.
They only sat up and took notice when companies started including provisions
in their financial statements for land remediation costs (like ICI), or
disclosing contingent liabilities in the small print (like BP).
When specifically asked what they want from corporate environmental
statements, analysts suggest a mixture of items that are deliverable, that
would prove useful if only accountants could deliver them, and that because
of commercial sensitivity are unlikely ever to be delivered.
Among the deliverable items are clean-up provisions and contingent
liabilities, green accounting policies, statements of corporate
environmental policy, the results of internal environmental audits and a
statement of assurance from management of compliance with standards across
the company.
Among those items dependent on the accountants are disclosures of historical
and prospective environmentally-related capital and revenue expenditures,
ideally broken down by business segment. Rhone-Poulenc is one of the few
European companies providing this information, although the figures are
highly subjective because an increasing proportion represents unavoidable
rather than discretionary expenditure.
Value for money measures also come into this category. Given the extent to
which these techniques are in place in local and central government, it
seems barely credible that private sector companies have not yet adapted
them to monitoring their environmental activities to determine the net cost
or benefit.
The third category of information to which analysts would wish to be privy
but is likely to stay beyond their grasp includes cash flow and market share
projections as a result of environmentally-related expenditure. It also
includes the financial consequences of sustainability: how future planned
actions would have to be changed if the company was to claim it was
operating on a sustainable basis. BT and BP are among the British businesses
that discuss sustainability, but do not attempt to quantify the cost.
In the absence of a regulatory framework like that covering financial
reporting, we believe preparers should investigate the scope for including
more disclosures of the items in the first two categories of information. If
it is auditable, it should be contained in the financial statements subject
to audit. If it is subjective, it should be included in the financial
statement but remain outside the scope of the audit report.
We suggest as a minimum that companies should disclose provisions for clean
up costs, the basis for their calculation, data on contingent liabilities, a
summary of any environmental audits along with external verifiers' reports,
a corporate environmental policy statement, a statement of compliance with
all external standards, and a reference to where more detailed disclosures
can be obtained.
We would also like to see disclosure of the historical and prospective
annual spending driven by environmental needs, disaggregated historical
environmental performance measured against established indicators, value for
money data, and a statement in which management summarises its views on how
the company stands regarding foreseeable changes in environmental
legislation.
At present, even companies with the best environmental reports spend little
time discussing the financial and economic consequences of the frenzy of
environmental activity they have undertaken. It may be they discuss
sustainability in all good faith, or it may be they use such earnest
discussions to camouflage their short-comings in quantifying their
activities.
A concerted strategy is needed to narrow the gap between what the investment
community wants from companies and what companies feel under an obligation
to provide. The accountancy profession, the investment community and
companies need to work together to identify and deliver on improved,
consistent environmental reporting.

FT  28 APR 94 / Country blows life into Windmill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Windmill Theatre, remembered for its wartime boast 'We Never
Closed', is to reopen this summer as a venue for live country and western
music after a Pounds 500,000 redevelopment.
The intimate theatre in Soho, which once showed motionless tableaux of
semi-nude Windmill Girls in deference to the law of the day, is being gutted
to hold 400 people with room to dance.
A 25-year leasehold for the Windmill has been bought from Mr Paul Raymond by
Mr Oscar Owide, who is to open the building in July as Big Country. It will
be billed as the UK's first permanent live music venue totally devoted to
country and western music.
'This will be a modern blues and country venue and I'm sure we've got it
right - this music is a very popular commodity today,' said Mr Owide.
'New Country' music, with stars such Garth Brooks who recently filled the
Wembley Arena, blends traditional country and western with more mainstream
rock and roll. It is already a big success in the US and Ireland.
'It has not really pushed over here yet,' said Mr Ross Fortune of Time Out
magazine. 'But they are pushing very hard. It's a different culture but its
definitely a musical style on the up.
'Now it is attracting people from the middle-of-the-road mainstream - people
who would go and see Bryan Adams or Paul McCartney.'
For the Windmill, New Country has arrived just in time. The theatre started
life as a small cinema, the Palais de Luxe, built in 1910 on the site of an
18th century windmill. It was converted into a theatre in 1931 and held an
audience of 326 on two levels.
Under its enterprising manager Mr Vivian Van Damm, and later his daughter
Sheila, the Windmill achieved success by adopting a French innovation of
non-stop variety which ran every day from 2.30pm to 11.00pm.
'Revuedeville', as it was called, lasted until 1964, during which time the
theatre launched the careers of a number of comedians, including Harry
Secombe, Jimmy Edwards and Tony Hancock.
It was the only London theatre to remain open throughout hostilities during
the second world war except for compulsory closure for 12 days in September
1939.
More recently the building has been a cinema, theatre, restaurant, and
television studio.

FT  28 APR 94 / Condoms replace corsets in cost index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mutton, candles, tram fares, trolleybus fares and back-lacing corsets have
gone. Satellite dishes, camcorders and condoms have arrived.
These are just some of the changes since the retail prices index started
life as a cost-of-living index 80 years ago, a birthday to be celebrated by
the Central Statistical Office today.
In 1914 the index was an estimate of the effect of price rises on the
welfare of working-class people, so food, rent, clothing, fuel and light
made up the largest part of the basket of goods used.
Since then it has become more sophisticated as the way the British live and
spend their money has changed.
Eighty years ago clerks using pens and inkwells compiled the index of only
80 prices. Women could not vote, Asquith was prime minister, Lloyd George
his chancellor, and Blackburn Rovers won the English first division
championship.
Today about 400 civil servants using computers collect 150,000 prices each
month in 180 areas.
'The RPI is about real people and real spending habits,' said the CSO. 'It
can tell us a lot about what life and prices were like 80 years ago and how
society has changed.'
The index underwent its first facelift in 1947, becoming more a measure of
what the average family was actually buying rather than what the government
thought working-class people should spend their wages on - alcohol was not
included.
So in came radios, cycles, prams, iron bedsteads, galvanised buckets,
custard powder, cinema and football match tickets, a pint of beer and a nip
of whisky.
The update in 1956 saw brown bread, pet food, televisions and washing
machines join the index. But out went candles, rabbits and distemper.
In 1962 sherry and refrigerators were added, and roasting chicken replaced
boiling fowl.
After that the index was revised annually. The 1970s saw the addition of
continental quilts, MOT test fees, canteen meals, yoghurt and mortgage
interest payments. In the 1980s, frozen ready meals, video tapes, CDs and
low-alcohol lager were added.
The latest changes have seen lard, tinned rice pudding, kippers, the St
Christopher pendant, men's vests and the seven-inch single record dropped,
while in have come microwave ovens and videotapes.
In 1914, 60 per cent of people's spending was on food. Now it is 14 per
cent, rivalled in importance by motoring and leisure.

FT  28 APR 94 / Malaysia welcomes new media stance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government believes the British press has stopped writing
negative stories about Malaysia. This emerged yesterday in comments made by
deputy foreign minister Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan and reported in Bernama, the
country's national news agency.
In the strongest suggestion yet that Malaysia will eventually lift a
two-month-old ban on public contracts for British companies, he said the
lack of recent critical reports in the British media was 'a good beginning'.
'If the British media continues to be responsible in their reporting (about
Malaysia), there may come a time when we will consider lifting the ban,' he
was quoted as saying.
'If they (the British media) choose to do the thing we expect them to do, we
would reciprocate with the right things. We are sensible, practical and
pragmatic people.'
But he said the government would decide to lift the ban only when it was
sure the British media had stopped writing offending articles. 'It would be
pointless if the government lifts the ban now, and then the same thing
happens again,' he added.
Defence minister Najib Abdul Razak also said last week that Malaysia's bad
press from the UK appeared to be on the wane.
On Monday, the British high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Duncan Slater,
said he hoped 'things would get back to normal soon' now that Malaysia was
no longer in the headlines.

FT  28 APR 94 / MPs urge tough minicab rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough regulation of the unlicensed minicab trade was called for yesterday by
MPs in response to last October's green paper on taxis and private-hire
vehicles.
The MPs reject any form of de-regulation of the industry and demand strict
safety rules for taxis and minicabs under a new national two-tier system.
In a report on the industry, the Commons transport committee says it has
received alarming evidence of attacks by drivers on passengers, accidents
involving uninsured vehicles and poor vehicle safety standards.
The MPs say passengers should be able to tell whether a vehicle is licensed
before getting into it. All minicabs should be required to display a
prominent badge showing they are licensed and an easily legible certificate
of insurance.
Under the proposed new system for both mini-cabs and taxis:
Anyone with a criminal record for sex offences or serious crimes of violence
would be banned for life from working as a driver.
Applicants for licences would have to pass a medical test similar to that
required for bus and coach drivers.
Drivers would have to be aged over 21 with at least three years' driving
experience and a clean licence.
They would also have to have first aid qualifications, be able to speak
English to a standard enabling good communication with the public, and be
trained in disability awareness.
The MPs want a new law to raise minicab standards throughout the country
while safeguarding the right of taxis alone to ply for hire.

FT  28 APR 94 / Boardrooms retain old school ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence that the old-school-tie approach to the selection of non-executive
directors still persists among many of Britain's biggest companies emerged
yesterday in a survey by a leading firm of accountants.
The report by KPMG Peat Marwick into the role of non-executive directors
also found that many non-executives were not receiving vital information in
spite of the recommendations of the Cadbury report into corporate
governance.
Chairmen's appointments have traditionally drawn from the old-boy network
whereas the Cadbury report suggested that non-executive appointments should
be made via a nomination committee.
Evidence also emerged that the number of individuals with multiple
directorships remained high even though the changing role of the job is
creating greater demands on time and expertise.
The report, compiled from 235 responses to questionnaires sent to 430 of
Britain's biggest companies, found that more than half of all non-executive
appointments of directors surveyed were made by the chairman alone.
'It will be interesting to see if, in the future, the chairman's influence
wins in this respect,' said Mr Gerry Acher, KPMG's head of audit and
accounting.
The report found that while companies were good at providing financial
information to non-executives they often failed to provide other business
details.
This was most evident in some of the newer, yet strategically important,
non-financial areas such as customer satisfaction, quality and management
performance.
More than half the directors said they did not receive information on senior
management appraisals, quality indicators or comparisons with companies
recognised as best-practice leaders. Most of those questioned rated all
three as important in fulfilling their roles.
'There are clearly areas where matters of strategic importance and the
receipt of vital, pertinent information need to be brought into line,' said
Mr Acher. 'The non-execs' role should be to add to shareholder value rather
than just protect shareholder value.'
More than 60 per cent of respondents held more than three non-executive
posts, 18 per cent holding more than five. Only 18 per cent held just one
post. The highest number of directorships recorded among the replies was 13.
On average respondents were spending 20 days a year on the role and a third
of this time was spent in preparation.
The survey indicated that women still have little impact on boardrooms.
Compilers said female non-executives comprised less than 10 per cent of the
named replies.

FT  28 APR 94 / Ban on GCHQ unions maintained
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Demands by opposition MPs that workers at the government's secret
communications headquarters at Cheltenham should be allowed to join a union
were rejected by a government majority of 61 (283-222) in the Commons last
night.
Mr David Davis, public service minister, said the national interest required
the ban on union membership, imposed in 1984, to be maintained.
He reaffirmed the government's willingness to allow workers to join a staff
federation. Mr Allan Rogers, Labour foreign affairs spokesman, likened the
staff federation to a 'Stalinist trade union'.

FT  28 APR 94 / 300 jobs to go at GM joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 300 jobs - 13 per cent of the workforce - are to go at IBC Vehicles
joint venture between General Motors and Isuzu of Japan which makes the
Vauxhall/Opel Frontera four-wheel-drive leisure vehicle and Midi panel vans,
John Griffiths writes.
The job losses, intended to be voluntary, reflect falling demand for the
Midi van and what the company yesterday said was a continuing need for
productivity improvements.
They will mean that IBC's workforce, based at Luton, Bedfordshire, will have
fallen by about 500 since early last year. The plant employs 2,250.
However, rising demand for the Frontera means that plans to move to
single-shift working from the double day shift system have been dropped.
About 80 per cent of IBC's output is exported and the Midi, in particular,
has been hit by one of the worst slumps in Continental Europe's commercial
vehicles market since the second world war.
The company said the job reductions were also being caused in part by plans
to produce a greater proportion of Frontera Sports, the 'small' version of
the Frontera which requires less manpower than larger, five-door versions.

FT  28 APR 94 / Recycling target seen as a load of rubbish: Scepticism on
saving waste is widespread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government targets for recycling household waste are unrealistic, according
to waste companies which will soon face new targets on recycling packaging.
They argue that recycling household waste is expensive and may use up more
resources than it saves.
Consultation on an industry paper about financing the recycling of packaging
ended yesterday. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has called on the
packaging industry to find ways of recycling between 50 per cent and 75 per
cent of packaging waste by the year 2000.
He also wants a quarter of household waste to be recycled by 2000 compared
with 7 per cent at present. The targets are connected, as about a fifth of
rubbish in the household dustbin is made up of packaging.
The industry has criticised politicians' emphasis on recycling household
waste. Mr Steve Webb of the National Association of Waste Disposal
Contractors (NAWDC) said: 'People love being told to recycle - it makes them
feel good. But it doesn't make environmental or economic sense to recycle
quite a bit of what is in people's dustbins.
'A target of 25 per cent for household waste is the wrong figure applied to
the wrong type of waste.'
Only a handful of local authorities - notably Milton Keynes Borough Council
in Buckinghamshire and Adur District Council in West Sussex - have made
significant progress towards the household recycling target.
Milton Keynes, which opened Britain's largest recycling plant in November at
a cost of Pounds 6m, is adamant that the process is worthwhile, but it
agrees that it is difficult to say just how much the environment has been
helped.
Whether recycling makes financial sense is only slightly easier to judge.
Mr Keith Ely, assistant director of technical services, said: 'If you can
tell me what the environment is worth I can tell you whether recycling is
worth it.'
A government report in November concluded that until economists
systematically put values on natural resources and the costs of pollution,
it will remain difficult to weigh up the environmental merits of different
waste-disposal methods.
Milton Keynes spends Pounds 100,000 a year on running its recycling plant.
The costs of collecting the waste, at Pounds 60 to Pounds 100 a tonne, add a
further Pounds 800,000 a year. However, according to Mr Ely, most of that is
recovered by selling the waste to manufacturers. He estimates that Milton
Keynes makes a profit on metals and plastics, and is at 'nearly break-even'
on paper and glass.
Most local authorities could not make that claim. The main obstacles are the
high costs of collecting, sorting and cleaning household rubbish and the
lack of customers for the waste.
Metals are the easiest to recycle, as they can be easily extracted from
rubbish tips with magnets. Industry estimates suggest that producing new
aluminium drink cans out of recycled ones uses only 5 per cent of the
resources used in making a can from raw materials.
However, despite the popularity of bottle banks, NAWDC describes many
schemes as 'struggling'. Prices per tonne for recycled glass are low
compared with collection costs partly because clear glass is preferred to
green and brown glass which is more commonly found in Britain, usually
having been imported in the form of wine and beer bottles.
While newspaper collection schemes have also spread, the paper industry
argues that de-inking newsprint is polluting, and that paper can be recycled
only three times before the fibres become too short. Moreover, Germany's
mandatory recycling scheme has generated huge volumes of waste paper and
pushed down prices across Europe.
Plastics present some of the toughest problems but Milton Keynes has had
some success with a contract to supply manufacturers.
But if more local authorities overcome these hurdles, they could undermine
the pioneers' success. Milton Keynes says the market will be flooded if more
waste is recycled.
Companies and local authorities want more emphasis on commercial recycling
and on burning waste to generate energy.
Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth also suggest that
packaging be designed to make recycling easier and that less waste be
produced in the first place.

FT  28 APR 94 / Two TV groups face ITC censure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Television, the London independent television licence holder, and
GMTV, the commercial breakfast television company, are both likely to be
criticised in the Independent Television Commission's review of their first
year on air, but to different degrees.
GMTV, in which Carlton has a 20 per cent stake, will be generally criticised
for the quality of its programme. Although its licence is not under threat
the implication is that more will be expected this year now that the
financial prospects of the company are improving.
GMTV, whose other shareholders are Granada, Scottish Television, Guardian
Media Group and the Walt Disney Company, is expecting commission criticism,
but believes it will refer to the station's early months on air.
GMTV executives clearly hope the commission will recognise that in a
difficult competitive position standards have been rising.
Carlton, the largest ITV company, which took over the London weekday
franchise from Thames, will get a relatively clean bill of health.
The commission, which has not yet completed the review process, is expected
to find that Carlton has fulfilled its licence obligations.
But it is believed that the quality of some of Carlton's productions for the
national ITV network will be criticised. The criticisms will also be
addressed to the ITV Network Centre for not demanding higher standards.
Carlton Television, it is being suggested, should also pay more attention to
the quality of national programmes produced under its name by independent
producers.
The Independent Television Commission yesterday blocked any chance of the
two largest ITV advertising sales houses, The Time Exchange and Laser Sales,
continuing to represent their present range of ITV companies.
Both sales houses are owned by Granada Group following its takeover of
London Weekend Television.
The Department of Trade and Industry decided in February not to send the
Granada-LWT deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission providing the
combined company did not control more than 25 per cent of total UK
television advertising by August 1995.
But the two sales houses represent Granada, Border, Scottish, LWT and
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and account for around 28 per cent of the market.
The ITC said last month that it was prepared to look at the possibility of
being flexible to ensure that the interests of smaller ITV companies were
looked after.
But the commission said yesterday that a single sales house combining both
Time Exchange and Laser would exceed the 25 per cent threshold and could not
be accepted.
The ITC said it would judge other pleas for flexibility by small companies
on a case-by-case basis.
The commission also ruled that 'rate hardening', withholding some airtime to
harden advertising rates, would not be allowed.

FT  28 APR 94 / Role for universities urged in urban renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Universities should lobby the new government regional offices to make
themselves a main vehicle for urban regeneration, a report from the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said yesterday.
Higher education is already taking a broader role in local business and
community development, moving away from the traditional ideal of a sheltered
academic environment, it said.
Universities should also aim to assert their role as large local employers,
according to the report. For example Newcastle upon Tyne's two universities
are the area's third and fifth-largest employers, accounting for more than
5,000 jobs between them.
But the University of Newcastle's Centre for Urban and Regional Development
Studies, which compiled the report, also warned that universities had
complex and differing management structures which impeded links with local
businesses and councils.
It made several detailed recommendations:
Universities should provide clear 'sockets' into which other local agencies
 -such as industry, planners or local government - could plug without
difficulty;
New housing developments needed to accommodate the recent sharp increase in
enrolment should be built in inner-city areas rather than 'greenfield'
sites. For example, Coventry University has built a 600-bed 'student
village' on the site of a former factory, while the University of Humberside
is converting a disused warehouse into a library;
Technology transfer to local companies should also be increased.
Universities' research funding is dominated by government funding councils
and by large companies. However, research contracts with local industry 'for
most institutions are relatively small-scale and few in number'.
Higher education is urged to expand this by publicising research-related
services. Rather than carrying out research for companies, universities
should allow small companies access to specific research equipment that they
would not otherwise be able to afford.
More than half of final-year students at Oxford and Cambridge universities
are so pessimistic about employment prospects that they have not applied for
any jobs.
The survey of 1,500 final-year students at the two universities found that
only 46 per cent of Cambridge final-year students, and 53 per cent of those
at Oxford, had applied to employers. Almost a quarter had decided to 'take a
year off' after graduating.
'Milk round' presentations to undergraduates, still held by more than 100
employers at the two universities, appeared to be ineffective, with fewer
than 40 per cent of students attending any events.
Management consultancy and merchant banking remained the most popular
careers, each attracting 17 per cent of the year's job-seekers.

FT  28 APR 94 / Pounds 50bn deposits 'lost to banks'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British banks are losing between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 2.5bn of profits each
year because they have failed to compete properly with building societies
and the life and pensions industry for personal savings, a study says.
UBS Global Research says that the loss of cheap deposits from the banking
system over the past 20 years is so marked that banks would now have Pounds
50bn higher retail deposit balances if they had maintained their market
share.
The study argues that banks have been forced to cut branch networks because
they have failed to use branches to gather deposits. It says that they may
face further competition for deposits from new competitors such as telephone
banks.
According to the analysis of deposits since 1975, only a quarter of the
eightfold increase in banks' personal deposits is due to new money. The rest
comes from accrual of interest and the change of Abbey National's status
from a building society to a bank.
Study authors Mr John Aitken and Mr Nick Gough, say banks will find it hard
to replace profits from the loss of deposits without significant new
acquisitions such as Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid to buy Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society.
They say there is 'no scope for optimism' about the future of the banking
sector because the new forms of income with which banks have tried to
replace cheap deposits - such as trading in securities - are much less
stable.
Banks' share of personal sector assets has halved to 8 per cent between 1975
and 1993 - excluding the effect of Abbey National and TSB Group. At the same
time, the life and pensions industry has doubled its market share to 52 per
cent.
Banks would have attracted aggregate new deposits of Pounds 170bn if they
had maintained their share. This is nearly Pounds 60bn above the actual
figure, equivalent to a loss of deposits of between Pounds 45bn and Pounds
50bn for the big high street banks.
The study says that the clearing banks have suffered from a narrowing of
interest margins and loss of volume as a result.
The 'opportunity cost' of this is between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 2.5bn, or
about a third of the sector's forecast profits this year.

FT  28 APR 94 / Political Notebook: Counting pounds not pennies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest round of defence cuts is making the headlines. Behind the scenes
in Whitehall, concerns about public spending run much deeper.
First though, defence. Ministers are annoyed that the drive for savings in
procurement, bureaucratic and support services has been portrayed as a fresh
batch of swingeing cuts.
In fact Mr Malcolm Rifkind's Front Line First exercise is designed to meet
the stringent spending targets set last autumn. There has been no further
reduction in the armed forces' Pounds 23bn annual budget.
There are powerful arguments for a rationalisation of military support
services, for market testing and for a clear-out of bureaucrats-in-uniform.
The armed forces have been largely immune to the pressures for increased
efficiency applied elsewhere in the public sector.
Forces chiefs typically have responded to the Treasury axe by economising on
equipment and manpower rather than by redeploying resources more
effectively. Tanks have been mothballed for lack of fuel and soldiers left
without ammunition to test their weaponry.
Admirals, generals and air marshals must recognise that the nation's
strategic interests no longer demand that each service maintains a separate
denture-manufacturing plant.
There is considerable enthusiasm in the middle ranks of the services for the
ideas. Devolution of authority and financial responsibility holds
attractions for soldiers as well as for health service managers.
The government's vulnerability over defence stems not from a sensible search
for efficiency gains but in its refusal to conduct a fundamental
re-assessment of Britain's ambitions and capabilities.
Defence spending has fallen 15 per cent in real terms since its peak in
1984-85. It is back to the levels inherited by Margaret Thatcher in 1979. No
one can pretend that such a shift does not merit a hard look at whether
resources still match requirements. The government knows it. But Mr John
Major is unwilling to take the political risk.
The defence budget, though, must be kept in perspective. It accounts for
less than 10 per cent of public expenditure. The Treasury pays out almost as
much in debt interest.
As the cabinet begins its ritual summer battle over public spending, the
focus of attention in Whitehall has returned to the welfare state.
The spending squeeze unveiled by Mr Kenneth Clarke last autumn is under
strain. It is hardly surprising. During the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94,
overall expenditure as measured by the Treasury's control total jumped 11
per cent in real terms. The plans for 1994-95 to 1996-97 allow for an
increase of only 1 per cent.
Together the social security, health and social services, and education
budgets account for about 60 per cent of all spending. They are already
threatening Mr Clarke's straitjacket.
Senior ministers have been told that curbs on invalidity, sickness and
unemployment benefits will not be enough to check the inexorable growth of
the Pounds 85bn social security budget.
On current trends, spending on benefits will continue to outpace the growth
rate of the economy. In spite of a brighter outlook for public borrowing,
the prospect is that social security will crowd out pre-election tax cuts or
discretionary spending increases elsewhere.
Meanwhile the (laudable) surge in the number of young people going into
further and higher education is threatening once again to bust the Pounds
33bn education budget.
The financial pressures faced by trust hospitals and the broader political
sensitivity of the health service have begun to undercut the freeze in the
NHS budget.
So ministers are already talking about a third year of tough pay restraint
for nurses, policemen and the rest. Without another standstill in the public
sector pay bill there is no chance of the overall spending sums adding up.
But incomes policies have a nasty habit of going wrong.
Economic growth and low inflation should help. So too for a time will
off-balance sheet financing through the private-sector finance initiative.
But it will take more than that. Mr Portillo's fundamental reviews of the
underlying trends in public spending have so far yielded far more in the way
of analysis than action.
Sooner rather than later the government will have to exchange short-term
political expediency for a credible long-term strategy on public spending.
It will not be easy. But until they start thinking about it ministers can
have no complaints about alarmist headlines.

Digital Equipment plans to move its personal computer manufacturing
operations in Scotland to a separate facility near its plant in Ayr.
Digital said the move would have no impact on jobs but would create room for
possible future expansion. Its Ayr payroll has increased from 1,200 to 2,000
in the past year. It would not comment on reports that the new plant would
be at Irvine, 14 miles from Ayr.

FT  28 APR 94 / Pilot junior market planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pilot scheme to develop a new mechanism for trading in the shares of small
companies could become a reality in Scotland later this year as part of the
plan launched on Tuesday by the London Stock Exchange.
The exchange has accepted an offer from Scottish Enterprise, the official
economic development body, and Scottish Financial Enterprise, which
represents the Scottish financial sector, to try to create a junior market
for smaller companies in Scotland to meet shortfalls in its treatment of
small companies. The involvement of Scottish Enterprise means the exchange
can tap public-sector funds.
The two bodies believe the Scottish financial community can provide
institutional finance for companies quoted on the new market, and has the
lawyers, accountants and stockbrokers to service it.
The first step will be the setting up of a working group. Mr John Laydon, an
executive with Scottish Financial Enterprise, said yesterday he hoped
trading on the new market could begin this year. It would need to promote
itself to attract companies outside Scotland as well as within.
Initially, matched bargain trades could be displayed on screen, with brokers
making deals by telephone. Later the market would move to on-screen
dealmaking.
Critics of the initiative question whether new trading mechanisms, wherever
based, can overcome the fact that there is a shortage in liquidity in
trading in small companies.

FT  28 APR 94 / Guns dispute may delay tunnel further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Full passenger services on the Channel tunnel could face further delays
because of a continuing dispute between Britain and France over armed
police.
Home Office and French Ministry of the Interior officials have failed to
reach agreement over whether French police will be allowed to carry their
guns without restrictions throughout the tunnel link.
The cross-border powers of British and French police are part of a long
protocol agreement initialled by the governments at Sangatte in November
1991. Technically, it became legal last year.
The protocol gives extra-territorial powers of investigation, search and
arrest to police officers of both sides in 'control' zones at the
international terminals in London and Paris and in the shuttle terminals at
Cheriton and Coquelles.
The British agreed that French police may carry weapons when stationed at
the fixed control zones at Cheriton. But they are resisting demands that
these powers be extended to officers moving between tourist and freight
terminals at Cheriton, as well as on the passenger through-trains arriving
and departing at Waterloo.
Under a draft operational plan drawn up by Home Office officials, French
police officers would deposit their guns in containers and travel unarmed
with their UK counterparts.
British officials fear the unrestricted movement of armed French police
could lead to situations in which weapons are used, with potential for
complex legal wrangles.
British police sources say there is also concern that to give way would fuel
demands by some members of the British police that they too be permanently
armed.
The French argue that because of tradition and training their police should
be allowed to be armed. The British plan is seen as against the spirit of
the protocol.
An aide to Mr Charles Pasqua, the French interior minister, yesterday played
down British reservations about accepting armed French police controlling
trains on UK soil as 'essentially a cultural problem', David Buchan in Paris
writes.
But he was sure the police forces of both countries would find 'a practical
solution'. He noted that Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had not raised
the issue when he met Mr Pasqua in Paris last month.

FT  28 APR 94 / Row over saving energy intensifies: Funding shortfall could
reach Pounds 300m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing row over the lack of funding for the government's Energy Saving
Trust was further inflamed yesterday when government officials told the
Commons energy committee that the shortfall might reach Pounds 300m a year
by the end of the decade.
Senior civil servants said Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas,
the gas regulator, had acted within her powers by refusing to allow the
costs of the trust's projects to be passed on to gas customers.
The trust, a Conservative pledge in the 1992 general election, was set up to
help gas and electricity companies identify ways for their customers to save
money. The government intended that the trust be financed by customers
through their bills.
Ms Spottiswoode has upset the government's plans by saying a regulator
should not impose levies on customers which are 'tantamount to regressive
taxes' because they fall proportionately more on less well-off families.
Ms Spottiswoode's concern is that the trust, which invested some Pounds 4m
in pilot schemes last year, will need to spend about Pounds 400m a year by
the end of the decade to reach government energy conservation targets. This
could add a significant sum to household fuel bills, on top of the value
added tax imposed from this year. Of the total, Pounds 300m is expected to
be spent on gas projects and Pounds 100m on electricity projects.
The trust, headed by Lord Moore, the former cabinet minister, is one of the
main planks of the government's plans for tackling the threat of global
warming. At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the UK committed itself to
stabilising carbon emissions - produced largely by energy generation - at
1990 levels by 2000.
Mr John Michell, head of the oil and gas division of the Department of Trade
and Industry, told the committee that Ofgas's director-general was allowed
to pass costs on to customers which did not cause a significant rise in gas
prices. The definition of 'significant' was 'a matter for her (Ms
Spottiswoode's) discretion'.
He said Ms Spottiswoode was acting within her rights in deciding that, in
the case of the schemes presented to her so far by the trust - notably a
scheme to encourage fuel-efficient boilers - she would not allow any costs
to be passed on.
Ms Spottiswoode's stance has caused consternation in government departments
because it marks an abrupt change from the views of her predecessor, Sir
James McKinnon.
Mr Michell added that Ms Spottiswoode's views on the trust were not explored
at her interview for the five-year post. The utility regulators were
independent of the government, and the DTI had no powers to make her change
her position or to dismiss her over a difference of opinion, he said.
Mr John Hobson, director-general of the energy efficiency office within the
Department of the Environment, told the committee that the government was
considering introducing legislation to overcome the hurdle. It could form
part of the legislation expected next year, which is intended to introduce
more domestic gas competition by spring 1996.
Departments are looking at other funding sources for the trust, including
the utilities' profits. 'One possibility would be public expenditure
although it would be hard to find a mechanism,' said Mr Hobson.
He also suggested that estimates of how much emissions needed to be curbed
might be reduced if they were reviewed in the light of recession and the
switch from coal to gas in energy generation.

FT  28 APR 94 / MPs set to end feud on procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs are to resume talks on how to organise their working day more
rationally, under a deal put together to end Labour's four-month-long
procedural war against the government.
Under a package of measures unveiled at Westminster last night, fresh
attempts will also be made to agree more humane arrangements for enabling
critically-ill MPs to vote, and the possibility of raising Labour's quota of
committee chairmanships is to be discussed.
The deal clears the way for normal parliamentary relations to resume. Under
the protest, even non-contentious legislation was opposed and the practice
of 'pairing' - allowing MPs to miss a vote by being linked to a member in an
opposing party who agrees to be absent as well - was discontinued.
Labour claimed victory last night, saying the government had accepted it was
wrong on the issue which triggered the dispute: its decision to curtail
debate on bills implementing changes to statutory sick pay and National
Insurance contributions.
But government business managers argued that they had 'given nothing away'.
Meanwhile, Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, condemned the
move as a 'sad and sorry capitulation' and said Labour had 'thrown in the
towel'.
Under last night's agreement, MPs will resume discussion of a report, tabled
two years ago by an all-party committee of MPs, which proposed a number of
changes to Westminster arrangements designed to reduce the number of
late-night sittings.
Some Conservatives have since accused Labour of 'going cold' on the report.
Labour was at pains to emphasise last night that the talks would include
discussion of its call for MPs to be given two weeks' notice of what
business is to be debated in the Commons.

FT  28 APR 94 / Labour completes Euro-manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday put the finishing touches to a manifesto for the European
elections which endorses its commitment to a minimum wage but leaves working
hours to employers and unions.
Labour hopes the manifesto will destroy Tory claims that it is committed to
a 35-hour, four-day week and scrapping Britain's veto on legislation.
Officials said it was designed 'to put Britain at the heart of Europe, where
we can fight effectively for our interests instead of abandoning them as the
Tories have'.
The manifesto, drawn up by a committee led by Mr Neil Kinnock, the former
Labour leader, will be published at the beginning of the party's official
campaign, three weeks before the June 9 election.
Mr John Smith, the party leader, said much work had to be done to make the
case for a minimum wage, indicating that the manifesto would not bow to
leftwing demands for a precise figure.
The manifesto sets out Labour's commitment to the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty on European Union, and repeats the party's support for
economic and monetary union, including a single currency.
It says that limits on working hours - proposed by the manifesto of the
European Socialist party, to which Labour is also committed - will be 'an
option' for negotiation between unions and employers.
A Labour government would insist on retaining Britain's veto on taxation,
budget, security and defence proposals, although it would allow majority
voting in the Council of Ministers on other matters, including social,
environmental and health issues.

FT  28 APR 94 / BCCI finances 'obscured'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An accounts officer with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International withheld from auditors details of guarantees given to cover
loans to a Middle Eastern businessman, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
The actions of Mr Imran Imam made BCCI appear in better financial health
than it really was, Mr Antony Evans QC, prosecuting, told the jury.
Mr Imam denies six charges including conspiring to conceal documents,
furnishing false information and conspiring to falsify records.
Mr Evans said that between 1986 and 1990, loans totalling Dollars 105m were
made by the National Commercial Bank, ostensibly to Dr Ghaith Pharaon, a
wealthy Middle East entrepreneur.
BCCI handled the loans for Dr Pharaon and gave guarantees to the Saudi
National Commercial Bank to repay the full amount in case of any default.
However, Mr Imam did not tell auditors Price Waterhouse about these
guarantees despite knowing of of their existence, Mr Evans said.
Price Waterhouse was deceived and signed accounts which gave a false picture
of BCCI's profitability, he said.
The trial continues today.
The jury in the trial of Mr Nazmu Virani, the former head of Control
Securities, a property and leisure group, was sent out yesterday to consider
its verdict. It will resume its deliberations today.
Mr Virani denies 11 counts of furnishing false information, one of theft and
one of false accounting.

FT  28 APR 94 / Invisible Britons win accolades in Brussels: The image
problem of British MEPs is not reflected in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's 32 Conservative and 45 Labour members of the European parliament
have an image problem. Few electors can name their MEP, and few bother to
vote: the turnout at the last election in 1989 was the lowest in the
European Union.
On current indications, that dubious honour will fall to Britain again on
June 9, when voters will elect 84 MEPs to an expanded parliament. Barring an
unexpected turnround, MEPs will continue to be the invisible men (and women)
of British politics.
Cross the channel to Brussels and Strasbourg, the twin seats of the
parliament, and the picture changes. There, Britain's MEPs are widely
respected for their skills in exploiting the parliament's great and growing
power. MEPs from both parties have been appointed to chair committees, or to
help run the parliament as vice-presidents. No national delegation has a
higher profile.
The contrast irritates MEPs. Most say they work at least as hard as MPs,
commuting to parliamentary and committee sittings for 46 weeks a year and
handling around 50 constituents' inquiries a week. 'I work far harder than I
did as a businessman and for far less reward,' says a disgruntled
Conservative. 'The so-called European gravy train is a myth. '
The contrast also surprises continental MEPs such as Mr Klaus Hansche,
leader of the German socialists, who credits the British with a unique
combination of aggression, wit and procedural dexterity. Mr Claude Cheysson,
a French MEP who is a former cabinet minister and European Commissioner,
says the British delegation is 'by far the most effective' in the
parliament.
Behind the contrast lies a paradox: Britain's MEPs may be ignored at home,
but they take the parliament more seriously than almost any other
delegation.
Drawn from the mainstream of their parties - Labour academics and trade
unionists, Conservative professionals and businessmen - they have built on
the traditions of Westminster to exploit the parliament's rules.
Their influence can be seen clearly during the parliament's monthly plenary
sessions in Strasbourg. Superficially, the parliament makes a sharp contrast
to the overcrowded, claustrophobic chamber at Westminster. MEPs sit in a
spacious semi-circular chamber, equipped with a desk and a microphone. They
speak in their own languages, translated simultaneously through headsets.
There is no drama and very little passion. Voting, electronic and
instantaneous, rarely follows debates, underlining the point that the two
are only loosely connected.
Yet the British have shown that there are opportunities for spontaneity.
Many continental MEPs were surprised by their use of time set aside for
questions to the commission to make detailed points rather than broad
statements. Many now follow suit.
The British are also assiduous attenders. Britain's unique single-member
constituency system means prolonged absences would be quickly exploited by
political opponents. Continental MEPs elected under the list system can
afford to spend more time on domestic politics.
But there is more to it than just turning up. Most MEPs say the influence of
both Tory and Labour MEPs has increased as the number of Euro-sceptics has
fallen. Labour now fields less than half a dozen sceptics, isolated within
an overwhelmingly pro-European party. 'These are yesterday's battles,' says
Mrs Pauline Green, the British Labour leader.
The issue is more controversial for the Conservatives, who have formed a
parliamentary alliance with the European People's party of continental
Christian democrats. Publicly, Conservative leaders distance themselves from
the EPP's determined federalism. Privately, Conservative MEPs admit that the
delegation is overwhelmingly integrationist.
Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, Conservative MEP for East Sussex since 1979 and a
vice-president of the parliament, says the party is being 'held to ransom'
by a handful of Westminster Euro-sceptics.
Asked whether he is a federalist, he says: 'If anybody came to me and said I
had gone native I would say they need their heads examined.' He pauses for
thought before adding: 'If we want to be a coherent unit, we have got to be
more unified.'
Once, many of Britain's MEPs saw the job as a training ground for
Westminster. Few now do so. Many, like Mr David Martin, member for Lothian,
say the parliament offers them the chance to play a crucial role in
scrutinising Europe's institutions. 'This is not a rubber stamp parliament,'
he says. 'We change and influence the progress of legislation in way that
the average Westminster backbencher could not hope to do.'

FT  28 APR 94 / Funding of school repairs is attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's schools are crumbling because of a Pounds 4bn backlog of repairs,
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said yesterday.
Mrs Taylor claimed that local authorities would be allocated only 23 per
cent of the capital funds required next year for essential repairs.
Launching the party's education campaign, Mrs Taylor focused on
Labour-controlled Birmingham, which is a Conservative target in the May 5
local elections.
She demanded a public apology from Mr John Patten, education secretary, over
criticism of a Birmingham school in a Conservative leaflet.
The leaflet showed a photograph of graffiti-covered walls in the Four
Dwellings School above the slogan 'Surely our children deserve better than
this]'
Mrs Taylor said the school had been given a positive report by Ofsted, the
government's education watchdog.
She also released a letter from the chairman of Four Dwellings governors to
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, which claimed the leaflet
was 'inaccurate' and 'offensive to governors, parents and pupils'.
Four Dwellings is in the Quinton ward, where Labour won a by-election last
month. Labour strategists say the election has undermined Conservative
claims that they could capture the city.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said the condition of school
buildings was the responsibility of education authorities and school
governors. Support for capital and repair work would be more than Pounds
600m in 1994-95.

FT  28 APR 94 / Lilley defends tax incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, yesterday defended the
government's administration of the personal pensions programme which has
cost taxpayers billions of pounds more than expected.
He said that his predecessors were right to offer tax incentives to
individuals to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme.
'This was intended to get the scheme off the ground,' he told the Commons
social security committee. 'Figures suggest that most of those (who have
contracted out) have been wise to do so.'
DSS figures show that about Pounds 10.5bn in tax rebates has been paid to
personal pension holders since 1987.
Last December, the DSS published figures showing that more than 300,000
people were too old to benefit from having contracted out of Serps while
nearly 40 per cent of personal pension holders had incomes so low that the
rebates would be significantly reduced by life insurers' levies for
expenses.

FT  28 APR 94 / Treasury chief admits flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Terence Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, last night set out
his vision of the department's future and admitted that improvement was
needed in three areas.
Speaking at Durham University, Sir Terence said the Treasury needed to take
a more strategic role rather than become involved in day-to-day government
decisions; improve the morale of staff and have greater contact with the
outside world.
The key change involved 'rewriting' relationships with other departments. He
envisaged 'more emphasis on setting the agenda, on getting the framework for
policy right'. The Treasury should be 'less involved in detail and
second-guessing and more in setting the overall framework, objectives and
budget'.
According to a senior Whitehall official, the Treasury is to consider
abolishing its practice of individual sections shadowing other ministries as
part of its decision to stop monitoring and second-guessing the spending
programmes of other departments.
Sir Terence said the Treasury was often criticised for mismanaging the
economy, having an anti-industry culture and being penny-pinching,
short-termist and dictatorial.
However, speaking of one controversial former policy, he remarked: 'During
the 1980s it was difficult to leave the Treasury without being challenged
for failing to take advantage of the (exchange rate mechanism) when
evidently it could save the UK from all its problems; only to be later
accused of having stubbornly and perversely forced membership down the
throat of an unwilling business community.'
Staff morale had suffered because of recent criticism, Sir Terence said. He
admitted that a staff survey had shown that 'we are bad at avoiding
bureaucracy and having an open style of management'.
Sir Terence said the department was responding by improving the management
structure, budgeting, personnel systems and training.

Production in the forging industry has started to increase after four years
of decline, but profitability is still poor, the British Forging Industry
Association said yesterday.
Demand started to grow last October but Mr Brian Benton, association
president, warned that exports are unlikely to rise significantly until
there is a German economic recovery.
The industry last year produced 152,751 tonnes of forgings, 3.8 per cent
less than in 1992, reported the association. But production in 1989, before
the recession took hold, was 271,452 tonnes.

The general council also decided to switch the date of the annual conference

FT  28 APR 94 / Trial of Lloyd's brokers dropped
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prosecution of two brokers at the Lloyd's of London insurance market
charged with conspiring to defraud their own insurance company was abandoned
yesterday, seven days into their trial.
Mr Michael Crotaz and Mr Victor Chapman, both former directors of Walter F.
Smith and Co, were formally acquitted of charges of conspiracy to defraud
and conspiring to falsify accounts by the jury at Inner London Crown Court.
The prosecution had alleged that the two men - arrested last March - had
falsely credited about Pounds 100,000 to the company's brokerage accounts
when it should have been paid to others. It alleged they had diverted money
from their company's account to their personal accounts.
The Crown Prosecution Service abandoned its case after defence lawyers had
cross-examined the second of 19 scheduled witnesses.
Mr John Mitchell their solicitor, said afterwards: 'This prosecution should
never have been brought - as the outcome shows.'

FT  28 APR 94 / Mineworkers win assurances on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two mineworkers' pension schemes have reached agreement with the government
about pension entitlements for past service after British Coal's expected
privatisation later this year.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said members would be able to leave their
entitlements in the schemes after British Coal is sold.
Trustees of the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, which has 468,000 members, and
the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme, which has 96,000 members,
welcomed the new package.
'The trustees are now satisfied they have a deal which adequately safeguards
the interests of members now and in the future,' said Mr Paul Trickett,
joint secretary of the mineworkers' scheme, which has assets of about Pounds
7.5bn.
Members of the MPS have been targeted by life insurance sales agents who
have convinced them to take a personal pension on the grounds that the
government was unlikely to guarantee their pensions after privatisation.
Ms Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the staff scheme, whose assets have a
market value of Pounds 8bn, said the new package 'substantially met the
outstanding concerns of the trustees.
'Although post-privatisation improvements are not unconditionally guaranteed
in the same way as the basic pension and index-linked increases, the
likelihood of their not being continued is now very limited,' she said.
British Coal, which last year expressed concern about safeguards for
pensioners' interests, also welcomed the announcement. 'This is a very
important matter for all our people and I am pleased that our concerns have
now been substantially met,' said Mr Neil Clarke, chairman.
The proposals include a government 'solvency guarantee' which will ensure
that, after privatisation, pensions and deferred pensions - those due to
non-contributing members of the scheme who have not yet reached retirement
age - are increased annually in line with inflation.
The government will not guarantee any scheme surpluses declared after the
end of last month, but it will ensure that the value of pensions will not
fall in cash terms. Deficiencies here will be made good by payments from an
'investment reserve' comprising British Coal's unused shares from the
mineworkers' scheme surplus from September 1993 and the staff scheme surplus
from April 1992.
The government has also answered concerns about the future management and
control of both schemes.
Government-appointed trustees to the modified schemes will be appointed only
after consultation with existing trustees, and the minister's power to
introduce further changes will be restricted to two years.

FT  28 APR 94 / PIA chairman pressed by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the Personal Investment Authority, yesterday came
under renewed pressure from Labour MPs about his fitness to lead the new
regulating body intended to protect the private investor.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour member of the cross-party Commons Treasury
committee, pressed Mr Palmer on the record of insurance company Legal &amp;
General, of which he was previously chief executive.
Last month, failures to meet standards set by the existing regulator cost
Legal &amp; General some Pounds 400,000 in a then-record fine and in costs. Mr
Palmer pointed out that his time as chief executive - until autumn 1991 -
had represented only a slight portion of the period in which the breaches of
regulatory rules had occurred.
But Mr Sedgemore also raised with Mr Palmer an internal L&amp;G memorandum from
1990 suggesting that there were widespread breaches of the rules by sales
consultants.
Mr Palmer insisted that the L&amp;G paper related largely to one instance. He
argued that he did not condone the abuse suggested in the internal
memorandum, but that one 'isolated case' did not amount to sufficient
grounds for challenging his integrity and suitability to be chairman of the
PIA.
During the course of the inquiry into financial regulation, MPs have clearly
been concerned to ensure that the PIA should command public confidence.
The committee itself seemed reassured yesterday by the PIA's statement that
it would consider moving to a system of directly registering employees of
life companies in a way that would enable the PIA to discipline individuals
as well as companies.
The MPs are set to decide early next month whether to publish an interim
report dealing with the PIA, as the full report is very unlikely to be ready
much before the end of this year - some months after the organisation is due
to become operational.

FT  28 APR 94 / Lautro imposes record fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lautro, the regulator for the life insurance industry, yesterday set a
record for the fines it imposes on life insurers for failing to meet its
standards - ordering Premium Life to pay a Pounds 300,000 fine.
The ruling follows a second routine inspection carried out by the regulator
last spring, at which Lautro's enforcement staff found that Premium had not
acted to correct problems identified on a first visit the previous year.
Particular concerns were failure to monitor effectively both the direct
sales agents and a number of the firms of appointed representatives through
which Premium sells its products; as well as a failure to check that its
direct sales staff were competent and of good character.
Premium also failed to supervise new entrants properly and to provide proper
training to supervisory staff, the regulator said.
Some 22 investors have been compensated by Premium as a result of losses
having been identified. Mr Colvin Rae, chief executive since December last
year, said the total paid out in compensation was between Pounds 10,000 and
Pounds 15,000. Only a couple of the payments were over Pounds 1,000.
Just last month, Lautro set a record for a fine at Pounds 225,000 levied on
Aegon life assurance for serious structural failures in its compliance
procedures.
That was the first imposed as a result of the second round of inspection
visits, which Lautro had warned life companies last year would lead to a
more severe range of penalties. Other life insurers are expected to be hit
by further significant fines shortly.
Mr Rae said substantial changes had been made and that Lautro was now
satisfied with Premium's compliance procedures.
The insurer had cut its links with a number of the firms of appointed
representatives through which it had previously carried out business; it now
had links with just 45 appointed representative firms comprising some 80
representatives.
He said the problems had related more to 'inadequate documentation than to
inappropriate advice' and emphasised that all the costs - including the need
to pay Lautro's expenses of Pounds 21,500 - had been fully taken into
account in Premium's 1993 results.
The regulator said that it would carry out a further, advisory visit before
the end of June to check Premium's training arrangements. Lautro is due to
be de-recognised as a regulator some time after the Personal Investment
Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor, is to become
operational in July this year.

FT  28 APR 94 / Bristol airport decision deferred: Councillors' opposition
centres on BAe plan for 20 flights a night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision on British Aerospace's proposals for a civil airport at Bristol
was deferred yesterday by the local authority, leaving one of the most
contentious planning issues in south-west England hanging in the balance.
If British Aerospace had any doubts about the local hostility to its plans
for a commercial airport at Filton, north Bristol, they were dispelled last
week.
Nearly 1,000 people packed a school hall for a public meeting called by the
planning authority, Northavon District Council. Outside, a public address
system was rigged up for 500 more. For two hours, residents slated BAe's
proposals on grounds of noise and pollution.
In recent years, several thousand houses have been built at nearby Stoke
Gifford and Bradley Stoke. An Avon county councillor was applauded when she
said: 'I've calculated at least 15,000 people live under the flightpath.'
Only one person, a BAe worker, spoke in favour of the plans.
Since BAe lodged an application a year ago to convert its airfield at Filton
into an airport with scheduled European services, Northavon council has had
4,200 letters - 69 per cent opposing the plan.
Yesterday, in deciding to have more talks with BAe, councillors agreed that
the airport was unacceptable unless BAe abandoned plans for up to 20 air
traffic movements a night.
Yet the airport is strongly supported by the business community, which sees
it as vital to stimulate the regional economy. Unlike Bristol Airport at
Lulsgate, south of the city, it has excellent connections, being close to
the M4 and M5 motorways and railway. Much of Bristol's recent commercial
development has taken place in the area.
Mr John Savage, chief executive of Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative, said: 'The perception of Bristol as being on the travel map
would be increased dramatically by a Filton airport.'
The south-west Confederation of British Industry has told the Department of
the Environment: 'To fail to establish a principal regional airport in the
Bristol area would be to place the whole region into a second division
within Europe.' More backing comes from Rolls-Royce, with 5,500 workers at
its adjacent Patchway works.
Mr Chris Geoghegan, managing director of BAe Airbus, which employs 5,000 at
Filton, said: 'Once it gets going, it will be a real economic catalyst for
the region.' A new airline, Air Bristol, is running company flights for BAe
in anticipation of scheduled services.
The airfield is used for aircraft maintenance but the main contract, for
USAF F1-11s, has recently ended.
Mr Geoghegan said the airfield cost Pounds 2m a year to run. 'We have
started the transition from military to civilian contracts, but that is a
very competitive business. Scheduled flights can make the airfield viable in
its own right.' "
BAe believes the combination of aircraft maintenance and scheduled services
would help safeguard the Filton works. The workforce has been contracting,
with another 100 redundancies announced on Tuesday, but BAe claims the
airport could create 700 jobs.
The airport would be limited by BAe's planning application to 350,000
passengers a year.
Opposition to the airport is not only environmental. There is concern about
the impact on Cardiff-Wales airport, but the main threat is to Lulsgate,
owned by Bristol City Council. It made record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m
in the year to March 1993 but believes the city could not support two
airports.
Lulsgate, which is seeking private capital for expansion, carried 1.18m
passengers in the past year and wants a new terminal which could handle
twice as many. After a public inquiry, it is awaiting the environment
secretary's decision.
BAe's application itself may yet be called in by the Department of the
Environment for an inquiry - which Bristol City Council and Avon County
Council want. If not, and Northavon does reach a compromise with BAe, as now
seems likely, opponents suspect that BAe will seek to develop a full-scale
regional airport in the future.

FT  28 APR 94 / SIB orders fresh study of opt-out sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new survey into the selling of personal pensions to people opting out of
their employers' pension schemes has been commissioned by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
The study will be carried out by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, a firm of consulting
actuaries which specialises in pensions and insurance consulting. It will
form part of the work undertaken by the regulators in response to concern
about the widespread failure of sales agents to meet regulatory requirements
in the selling of pension transfers.
Pension transfers are cases where policies are sold to people investing a
lump sum from a pension scheme with a former employer.
While the number of 'opt-outs' is thought to be much smaller than the
500,000 or more pension transfers sold since 1988, the industry is broadly
agreed that in almost all cases it will have been bad advice to opt out of a
current occupational scheme.
Thus, assessing the scale of opt-outs is critical for determining the likely
overall compensation payable to people who have received poor advice.
'Opt-outs may be less than the number of pension transfers, but they will be
more serious,' one industry expert said. 'In transfers even where the
decision was based on bad advice, the difference is perhaps fairly
marginal.' In almost all opt-outs, customers will have given up the
contributions their employers make to the occupational scheme.
The SIB is committed to producing by the end of July a report setting out a
framework for compensation arrangements.
The tight timetable this implies for the survey was made even more difficult
by the delay in appointing Bacon &amp; Woodrow.
The earlier survey of pension transfer cases undertaken by accountancy firm
KPMG Peat Marwick met some opposition within the life insurance industry,
partly because it was based on looking at files.
The Bacon &amp; Woodrow study will involve going back to sales staff and
clients. It is likely that it will involve thousands of policies sold
through around 100 life offices to try to identify the opt-out pension
sales.

<TEXT>
Labour last night called off its four-month-long procedural war against the
government, clearing the way for normal parliamentary relations to resume
between the two sides, David Owen writes.
Proclaiming victory, the party said that detailed negotiations had produced
a substantial package of government concessions that addressed a number of
Labour grievances.
But government business managers said last night they had 'given nothing
away'.
Under the protest, even non-contentious legislation was opposed and the
practice of pairing was discontinued.

FT  28 APR 94 / Reynolds calls for peace push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments must push the Northern Ireland peace
process forward on a bilateral basis in the absence of political
developments in the province, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
said yesterday.
Addressing backbenchers from the British and Irish parliaments at a meeting
of the interparliamentary body in Dublin, Mr Reynolds said he remained
hopeful that last December's joint declaration would produce results - but
added that he was disappointed with progress to date.
There had been 'little new evidence' that the two communities in the
province were likely to reach agreement if 'left to themselves'. The two
governments would have to play a role 'in encouraging, and maybe to some
degree formulating an outline of an agreement between them', he said. The
joint declaration made both governments 'effectively persuaders for an
agreement'.
Earlier this month Mr Reynolds revealed that the two governments had begun
drafting a 'framework document' around which a future political settlement
might be built.
But in his clearest acknowledgement yet that the peace process has in effect
stalled, Mr Reynolds cast doubt on whether Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, has the coherence and unity to deliver on its stated desire for a
peace deal, and called for a more 'enlightened' leadership from the unionist
parties.
He added that both governments 'would be anxious and willing to break the
present impasse' if Sinn Fein made clear what issues it still wanted
clarified.
His remarks came as Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary,
urged Sinn Fein to specify in what respects they believed the document to be
unclear.
The government had had to conclude that what 'clarification' really meant
was 'renegotiation', Sir Patrick said. 'We are not getting into that,' he
said. 'Nor are the Irish government.'
Sir Patrick said that the declaration's non-partisan approach meant nobody
needed to fear that their position would be 'ignored or excluded'. The
ending of violence in Northern Ireland was 'a prize that threatens no one'.
He added: 'It should relegate confrontation to the past.'

FT  28 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Mandela fulfils dream - Patti Waldmeir
witnesses dawn at Inanda, Natal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela's long walk to freedom ended yesterday on the concrete
verandah of a small rural secondary school in Natal, where he cast the first
national vote of his 75 years, and fulfilled the dream of a lifetime.
In an emotional ceremony held just after dawn at the Ohlange High School in
the black township of Inanda outside Durban, Mr Mandela repeated the
eloquent words with which he addressed the court which in 1964 sentenced him
to what were to be 27 years in prison: 'I have fought very firmly throughout
my life against white domination and I have fought very firmly against black
domination . . . I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all South
Africans are equal and where all South Africans work together to bring about
security, peace and democracy.'
The stately Mr Mandela, dressed in a simple beige shirt buttoned tight at
the neck and casual trousers, flashed his radiant smile for the cameras as
he held his ballot poised above the polling box for several seconds before
dropping it in with the cry, 'Going, going, gone.'
Nonetheless, the grey-haired African National Congress leader appeared
visibly strained by the three-month election campaign. Surrounded by at
least 20 security guards, he looked tired and drained, and every bit his
age.
'This is for all South Africans an unforgettable occasion. It is the
realisation of the hopes and dreams we have cherished over the decades: the
dream of a South Africa that represents all South Africans. It is the
beginning of a new era,' he said afterwards.
Speaking outside in the school yard, Mr Mandela repeated the message he
stressed incessantly in the final days of campaigning. 'We are very
concerned about minorities, especially about the white minority,' he said,
adding in a radio interview only seconds after his vote: 'We would like the
white community to realise that we cannot build this country without them.
We are appealing to them to regard themselves as an essential part of the
transition' to democracy.
It was a good start towards the goal of a non-racial nation. There is a hard
road ahead.

FT  28 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Civil servants cling to the last
barricades - White bureaucracy remains a bastion of the old South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A lot of things are going to change, but everything will remain the same.'
That might, in general, be the motto for the new South Africa. But in this
particular case, it is the reflection of a senior minister in the outgoing
government on the future of the country's 1.7m strong public service:
administrator of apartheid, employer of the last resort for poor Afrikaners,
and bastion of the old South Africa.
The public service is about to get a new boss, almost certain to be Mr
Nelson Mandela. And he knows that the real power in South Africa lies not in
the parliament in Cape Town, which his African National Congress will
dominate, but in the civil service and the security services, which remain
the preserve of white Afrikaners, many of them conservatives.
Mr Mandela's ANC has made big sacrifices to ensure the loyalty of the public
service - which includes employees of central government, 'homeland'
bureaucrats and the staff of public corporations.
Indeed, one of the main reasons for agreeing to share power with the
long-ruling National party in a government of national unity was to ensure
that the white-dominated public service did not sabotage a new black
government from within.
To that end, the ANC and the National party struck a deal in the last days
of constitutional negotiations in November last year to protect the pension
rights of (white) civil servants while providing for affirmative action in
the highest echelons of the service. National party negotiators were
ecstatic: they had made it too costly to sack large numbers of top white
civil servants by guaranteeing they would receive full pension payouts.
In return, black South Africans are to be brought into director-general
level positions; but the process of black advancement will be gradual and
continuity in the civil service will be guaranteed.
Only the taxpayer will lose. The only conceivable way in which whites can be
retained and blacks advanced will be by adding to the already bloated civil
service payroll. Several forces are likely to swell the payroll in the near
term: affirmative action, the creation of nine new provincial bureaucracies,
and the demands of the ANC's 'reconstruction and development programme',
with its education, health care and service provisions demanding more
teachers, nurses and other government employees.
Any rise will reverse a recent trend toward containing the size of the civil
service. From 1980 to 1992, public service employment rose by 31 per cent,
nearly four times the rate of the private sector. But between 1991 and 1992,
the rise slowed to only 0.05 per cent.
The ANC's reconstruction programme says that by 1999 the civil service must
reflect the racial composition of South Africa: Black Africans 76 per cent;
whites 13 per cent; indians 2 per cent and coloureds 9 per cent according to
the latest census.
Overall, the composition is not too far from that now. Although the
government no longer publishes a racial breakdown of the service, 1992
figures show half the service was already black African. That figure is
estimated to have risen to 60 per cent and only a quarter of the service is
now estimated to be white.
However, almost all power within the service lies in white male Afrikaner
hands. Figures from the South African Institute of Race Relations show that
in 1992, only 0.6 per cent of the top 3,200 positions were held by black
Africans. The situation has improved since then, but not dramatically.
Changing the balance radically will be a slow process, because apartheid has
deprived Africans of the experience they need to be appointed to senior
levels.
Few ANC officials are qualified to run government departments - except in
foreign affairs, where their years in exile will help - though some have
recently been trained at British government expense. And the large pool of
bureaucrats from black homelands provide few technically competent
individuals - and far too many who rely on nepotism and corruption to
survive.
With an estimated 15 per cent of South Africa's economically active
population - and nearly one quarter of economically active whites - employed
in the public service, its fate is central to the country's future.

FT  28 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Hard road for Natal's rural voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MTENGWANE, NATAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'No, no, no, no, no. I'm not allowed to go there.' Shaking his head and
speaking with resignation, Induna Cele, headman of the Mtengwane settlement
in southern Natal, explains why he did not cast his vote at the local
polling station, only a spear's throw away across an intervening hill.
Asked why, Mr Philip Mavundla, a fellow villager, has a simple reply.
'Because they are ANC and we are IFP,' he says, referring to the area's two
rival parties, the Inkatha Freedom party and the African National Congress.
The polling station, at Nkonka school, is located in an ANC area. The
Mtengwane villagers and the hundreds of people in the voting queue at the
school agree that no IFP member would dare come there to vote. Everyone
would know them, said the voters at Nkonka school, and they would not come
out alive.
Unfortunately for Inkatha, there is no polling station in Mtengwane, or in
any nearby IFP area. So the people of the village have had to travel at
least 10km to vote in the white town of Port Shepstone and other white
areas.
It is not clear why this is so: perhaps Inkatha's late entry into the
electoral process prevented the Independent Electoral Commission from
setting up a polling station in time. Perhaps the IEC was naive enough to
think the nearby Nkonka school would do for both warring communities.
Neither reason explains why the IEC could not have brought one of its mobile
polling stations to Mtengwane.
But if Inkatha was disadvantaged by this omission, the kwaZulu 'homeland'
government headed by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, did all it
could to overcome this handicap: the government sent buses to collect the
residents of Mtengwane and other Inkatha areas - ignoring ANC areas where
transport was also needed - to take them to vote in white areas. And it
would be a brave villager who declined to go with them.
On the other side of the hill at Nkonka school Mr Cedric Sokhulu, deputy
presiding officer and former principal of the school, insists all are
welcome at the polling station, which is protected by a handful of police.
But he acknowledges most voters are ANC supporters - except for one elderly
woman who insisted she was prepared to vote for only one man: Jesus (and
proceeded to insist that Mr Sokhulu point out his picture on the ballot
paper).
Other elderly voters showed up with folded pictures of the ANC's Mr Nelson
Mandela pressed into their hands by anxious children fearful that granny or
grandad would otherwise vote for the wrong party. They, too, demanded that
Mr Sokhulu show them their leader's picture on the ballot paper.
Far below, in the white town of Hibberdene, the polling queue reflected  -
even more than at Nkonka school and in Mtengwane - a picture of the new
South Africa. Thousands of black voters queued for hours in a 2km string
which wrapped around the local library, and there were only 12 rather lonely
looking whites in the queue. They said they were sure more whites would turn
up later: but the prospect of sharing one long queue with blacks may have
put them off.

FT  28 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Election judge prepares for not proven
verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Shortly before South Africa went to the polls, the man responsible for the
administration of the elections and for giving a verdict on their
acceptability made a quip that could become prophetic.
What, Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, head of the Independent Electoral
Commission, was asked, were his hopes and fears about the historic ballot?
'I hope that it will go well,' he shot back, 'and I fear that it won't' -
prompting laughter in which he joined.
Last night, the 62-year-old judge, a highly regarded and long-serving member
of South Africa's appellate division, was at the heart of a crisis which, if
unresolved, could see that fear realised.
It was not surprising that organisational problems would accompany the
massive exercise, which involves more than 200,000 officials and 9,000
polling stations. But the critical issue, which will not readily be
resolved, involves the validity of ballots which failed to have stickers
attached carrying the name and logo of the Inkatha Freedom party, a late
convert to the poll, and photograph of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, its
leader.
The contradictions and confusion surrounding the acceptability of votes cast
using such ballots must to a great extent be laid at the feet of a man whose
legal skills at times appear to have deserted him.
Yet his credentials for the task are impressive. No observer doubts his
impartiality, having acted during a distinguished career at the bar for
clients across the political spectrum, from the Rev Beyers Naude, the
radical cleric who was in the forefront of Afrikaner resistance to
apartheid, to the extreme right-wing AWB.
He took up the position of head of the country's Independent Electoral
Commission last December, bringing to press conferences the persona of a
slightly tetchy judge dealing with impertinent young barristers. But above
all he has projected what seems to be an overriding determination to
conclude that the election will be substantially free and fair.
Speaking in Brussels earlier this year he said: 'Should we come, heaven
forbid, to the conclusion that we cannot so certify (the elections
substantially free and fair) our country will be plunged into disaster.
Self-evidently that is the result we will strain to avoid with all we can
muster.'
Yesterday his suggestion that disputed papers could have what he called a
'lesser value' in comparison to accepted votes produced widespread
confusion. Determining this value, was, he said by way of explanation, 'a
quantity thing, a distribution thing, a percentage thing, a general pattern
thing . . . one will have to look at the thing from various angles to see
what it does add up to.'
In addition to sorting out the problems in balloting, Judge Kriegler will
have to say whether the final outcome is free and fair.
If, as still seemed likely yesterday, he decides it is, some political
parties may use his own convoluted words to dispute his pronouncement.

Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, arrived in Cairo early today to help
give a final push to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, flew in to the Egyptian capital
last night.
Mr Shimon Peres and Mr Yossi Sarid, Israel's foreign and environment
ministers, are expected to join Mr Christopher, Mr Arafat and Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak for talks this morning aimed at wrapping up the
agreement next week.
Palestinian negotiators said they hoped Mr Christopher would put pressure on
Israel to ease some of its security demands and grant more authority to the
incoming Palestinian National Authority.
'We hope (Christopher) can do something as representative of one of the
sponsors of this peace process, and do whatever is needed to persuade the
Israelis to change some of their polices,' said Mr Faisal al-Husseini, PLO
boss in the occupied territories. 'If our control is incomplete and our
authority is incomplete, then security will be incomplete. We hope the
Israelis understand this.'
After he flew in from Saudi Arabia, Mr Christopher inspected some of the 200
vehicles being donated by the US to the new Palestinian police force. A
batch of vehicles rolled off a C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft at Cairo
airport.
More than 20 of the vehicles so far have been flown to Cairo and the rest of
the vehicles will arrive by ship at Egypt's Port Said in days.
Israel and the PLO said yesterday they still hoped to conclude self-rule
talks within days to prepare for a signing ceremony between Mr Arafat and Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, in Cairo next week.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the talks were 'going fast.
Everybody is working day and night'.
The negotiations were at the 'stage of final drafting and redrafting', he
said, but had still not resolved the serious obstacle - the legal
jurisdiction of Palestinian law and courts in Gaza-Jericho. Mr Shaath said
both sides were aiming to resolve all issues except the size of the Jericho
enclave and the stationing of a Palestinian policemen on the Allenby bridge
border-crossing before a Rabin-Arafat meeting. These include sensitive
matters that touch on sovereignty, such as the ability of the Palestinians
to issue their own stamps, passports and currency and to have their own
international dialling code.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday confirmed that Mr Lu Ping, its top official in charge of
Hong Kong policy, will visit the colony next week for the first time in more
than two years.
But in a snub, underlining the sensitivity of the visit which comes just
months after the collapse in Sino-British co-operation on the colony's
political development, Mr Lu has written to Governor Chris Patten that he
has no time to see him.
The governor said yesterday that Hong Kong would be disappointed by their
failure to meet.
There were 'serious questions that we need to discuss' and that he had
written to Mr Lu earlier this month on the issue of property prices and the
civil service, he said.
Mr Lu's week-long visit - his first since January 1992 - will be taken up
mainly with meetings of a committee set up to plan China's takeover of Hong
Kong after 1997.
In spite of the snub to Mr Patten, the visit may be a step towards finding a
way of dealing with Britain on Hong Kong matters, excluding politics.
It may reinforce recent signs of a willingness to deal with 'non-political'
issues, such as airport financing and technical matters of sovereignty
handled by the Joint Liaison Group.
Mr Lu's visit will not be an easy one. He will face questioning about why he
is not meeting Mr Patten in spite of overwhelming public support for such a
meeting. He will also have to explain why a mainland journalist working for
a Hong Kong newspaper was recently jailed for 12 years.

FT  28 APR 94 / Nigerian row worsens over fuel crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's military government has passed the blame for Nigeria's chronic
shortages of domestic fuel onto the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC), as the crisis in the nation's oil industry worsens.
An ultimatum, late on Tuesday night, from Lt-Gen Oladipo Diya, chief of
general staff, threatened 'very drastic measures to redress the situation'
if the NNPC failed to ease the scarcity within a week. It is unclear what
the regime is threatening. What is more, the corporation is a parastatal
monopoly supplier under the direct control of the government since it
dismissed the NNPC board last year.
The government says that a tanker of fuel is expected to unload at Apapa
dock this week, but this is described by industry experts as 'a sticking
plaster not a cure'.
Queues for fuel in Lagos are up to a quarter of a mile long and some
motorists have become used to sleeping overnight while they wait. All of
Nigeria's refineries, which had been working well below capacity for some
time, stopped producing last month.
The black market price has reached about N12 a litre (about 25 US cents) for
petrol. Fuel at the official price of N3.25 a litre is almost unobtainable.
When tankers reach filling stations, the often violent scramble and the
increasing use of jerry cans to buy and hoard fuel are making them extremely
dangerous. Several people have been reported killed this week in fires at
petrol stations in the area around Lagos.
NNPC has oil refineries in Kaduna; it has been producing almost no fuel
since a fire last June; Warri, which is closed for long overdue maintenance
until at least July; and Port Harcourt, which has just returned to service
after being sabotaged by striking workers in February. Experts believe Port
Harcourt is still well below capacity and cannot meet domestic demand.
NNPC has been criticised by the private sector and international donors as
corrupt and inefficient. Smuggling of Nigerian fuel is common, encouraged by
the large price differential in neighbouring francophone Africa.
International oil companies say that the shortage has been caused by NNPC
offering unrealistic terms to supply imports.
But the root of the corporation's problems is under-funding.
'For years the government has plundered NNPC's funds and it is now turning
round and blaming the company because it has no money,' according to a
banker in Lagos.
The government faces acute problems in the upstream oil industry as well.
Last week Shell Nigeria, which produces half of the country's nearly 2m
barrels of oil a day, warned that the government's failure to pay its share
of the joint venture costs was sending the industry, which accounts for 95
per cent of all export earnings, into a downward spiral. The government's
arrears to the oil companies have been more than Dollars 500m (Pounds
342.4m) since last year and the industry has stopped all drilling and
development work, leading to a gradual decline in capacity and a probably
cut in the Opec quota.
Shell has also detailed a growing problem of lost production due to
community unrest in the oil producing areas leading to violent attacks on
company staff and plant.
These 'shut-ins' have caused deferred or lost production of 150,000 barrels
a day of oil in Shell' s operations alone during the past week.
The unrest is fanned by the government's failure to provide even basic
infrastructure in the area which produces nearly all of its revenue. The oil
companies are bearing the brunt of the attacks from increasingly militant
youth leaders who back up growing demands for compensation and facilities
with violence.

FT  28 APR 94 / Japan moves on digital TV plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications aims to standardise digital
television technology for satellite, terrestrial and cable broadcasting by
1996, the ministry said.
The plan, the first concrete indication of its firm intention to move
towards digital broadcasting, is based on a report by an advisory panel,
made public yesterday, which recommends the early development of digital
broadcasting technology in line with international trends.
The report, which will form the basis of policy at the ministry, points to
the enormous progress in the west towards digitalisation of broadcasting and
calls for the Japanese to speed up their move to digital television.
'The standardisation of ATV (next generation TV) broadcasting in the US and
satellite digital TV broadcasting in Europe is expected to progress strongly
in the next year or two, while international standardisation through the ITU
(International Telecommunications Union) is also planned in the future,' the
report notes.
The publication of the report comes just months after an official caused
uproar by indicating that the ministry was keen to promote digital
television, even at the expense of Japan's home-grown high definition
system, known as Hi-Vision, which is an analogue system.
The electronics industry at the time protested vigorously against the
ministry's expressed stance on the grounds that Hi-Vision was a technology
which the ministry itself has promoted avidly and on which the industry, as
well as Japan's public broadcaster NHK, has spent vast R&amp;D funds.
However, the advisory panel's final recommendations put Japan firmly on the
digital route.
The country already is seen to be behind in the technology race against the
US and Europe, which have significantly more advanced plans for introducing
satellite digital TV than Japan does.

FT  28 APR 94 / Japanese PM searches for a political lifeline: Hata's
minority government faces difficult future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, last night met the remaining
partners in his depleted coalition to prepare the weakest minority cabinet
in post-war history.
The cabinet, to be announced today according to a coalition official, has
scant chance of surviving for more than a few months, since it is 56 seats
short of a majority.
It is assured of opposition support for the current year's long overdue
budget, agreement on which could be reached by early June. After that, it
could fall to a vote of no confidence at any moment, unless Mr Hata decided
to resign first.
Mr Hata lost his majority when the Social Democratic party, formerly the
coalition's largest member, left the coalition on Tuesday. It split over the
centre-right alliance members' secretive formation of a new grouping,
Kaishin (Innovation). The Hata administration's chances of long-term
survival grew even poorer yesterday when the SDP and opposition Liberal
Democratic party agreed in principle to co-operate in parliament.
On the surface, the SDP-LDP link-up looks strange in that they are supposed
to be arch-rivals. The socialists were the main opposition party to 38 years
of conservative LDP government until the SDP joined the new ruling coalition
last year.
Yet the LDP and socialists did in practice co-operate on legislation in
parliamentary committees during the LDP's reign.
'They have been in bed with each other since 1955,' said Mr Dan Harada, a
political lobbyist. Officials from the two parties will meet this morning to
discuss details of their co-operation.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, hinted yesterday that his party might
submit a no-confidence motion against the new government, depending on
'future developments'. The SDP would, however, support the government on the
budget, he said.
The SDP has no plans to rejoin the government coalition, even if Kaishin
disbanded itself, said Mr Murayama. Mr Hata has asked him to a meeting this
morning, in a belatedly courteous gesture, before announcing the planned new
cabinet line-up.
Mr Hata needs to fill eight seats in the 21-seat cabinet, including the six
vacated by the SDP by its decision to leave the coalition, the foreign
ministership which he used to hold and the post of chief cabinet secretary,
or government spokesman.
That post was previously held by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of the
New Harbinger party, which left the coalition in protest against the growing
influence of the centre-right.

FT  28 APR 94 / Thai police charged over Saudi gem theft
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's former national police chief, General Sawat Amornwiwat, and six
other senior policemen have been charged with negligence and malfeasance in
connection with the extraordinary theft of millions of dollars worth of gems
from a Saudi prince in 1989.
The police's dilatory and incompetent investigation into the theft, and
series of unexplained murders of Saudi diplomats and a businessman in
Bangkok, annoyed the Saudis so much they came close to severing diplomatic
relations.
They stopped issuing work permits to Thai nationals which cost Thailand up
to Dollars 1bn a year in lost remittances; 250,000 Thais were working in
Saudi Arabia in 1989, only some 30,000 work there now.
'I have been waiting for four years and nothing has happened. But I believe
General Pratin (Santiprapop, the current police chief) is an honest man and
he wants to make everything clear to the world,' said Mr Mohammed Said
Khoja, Saudi Arabia's charge d'affaires, yesterday:
A police lieutenant general, who headed the original investigation into the
theft, and seven others, were charged with embezzlement last year.
The scandal dates back to 1989 when a Thai cleaner stole 90kg of jewellery -
including a family heirloom: a diamond the size of a pigeon's egg - from the
palace of Prince Faisal Abdul Aziz al Saud in Riyadh.
The thief, Kriangkrai Techamong, was arrested with exemplary speed after his
return and many of the jewels recovered. However, Saudi pleasure quickly
faded when it was discovered that most of the gems returned were fakes.
Relations between the two countries plummeted when gunmen shot dead four
Saudi diplomats in broad daylight between 1989 and 1990 in the streets of
Bangkok.
The Thai police's lacklustre investigations threw up a bizarre parade of
murder suspects, including religious zealots, drug dealers, business rivals,
Pakistani gangsters and international terrorists.
Saudi unhappiness reached its acme when it was revealed that a prominent
Saudi businessman, Mohammed al-Ruwaily, who disappeared around the time of
the murders, had probably been abducted and killed by a group of Thai
policemen.

Australia's consumer price index rose by 0.4 per cent in the March quarter,
putting the country's annual inflation rate at 1.4 per cent, writes Nikki
Tait. This represents a dip from the December quarter, when the CPI
increased by 0.2 per cent, to give an annual rate of 1.9 per cent.
Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, took advantage of the news to
stress that there was no reason for interest rates to rise in the
'foreseeable future', and to criticise dealers who have driven money market
rates higher, largely in response to interest rates rises in the US.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, added that he believed the bond markets -
where yields have also been rising - had lost credibility as a guide to
inflationary expectations.

<TEXT>
Mr Brian Quinn, chief executive of Coles Myer, Australia's largest retailer,
until 1992 and a former member of the Reserve Bank of Australia's board,
appeared in Melbourne magistrate's court yesterday, charged with 49 counts
of theft amounting to ADollars 4.8m (Pounds 2.3m).
Mr Quinn, aged 58, was also charged with conspiracy to defraud Coles Myer,
by falsely representing expenditure at his private residence as spending for
various stores, warehouses and other residences owned by the company.
Commander Allen Bowles, from the Victoria police's fraud squad, told the
court that Mr Quinn had spent some ADollars 6.1m on his house at County
Terrace, in Melbourne's north-eastern suburb of Templestowe. He said
ADollars 4.8m of this was falsely recorded against various Coles Myer
locations to disguise the total spending.
The Victorian police have been investigating allegations of corruption at
Coles for three years, and have filed a variety of charges against about a
dozen people who were either once employed by the company or suppliers to
it. These charges have included allegations that secret commissions were
paid to contractors, for example, and that quotations were falsified for
work done on Coles properties.
Mr Quinn was bailed to appear at a committal hearing on June 24.

FT  28 APR 94 / Clinton is served with a Chinese recipe: Alexander Nicoll
reviews suggestions for a long-term, pragmatic trading partnership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Washington's annual agony over policy towards China should be ended,
according to a paper published yesterday by a US think-tank.
President Clinton must decide by June 3 whether, on human rights grounds, to
deny renewal of most-favoured nation trading status to Beijing. To do so
would increase prices for many goods in the US and seriously damage export
and investment prospects for US companies. But to renew MFN without
qualification would plunge him into deep water with Congress.
The paper, published by the Institute for International Economics, says the
US should drop this repeated self-torture. Instead, the US should work
towards bringing China into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this
year and then grant permanent MFN status - as do all other large countries -
but make it conditional on Beijing's compliance with its Gatt protocol.
These steps would be part of a large-scale revision of US policy to cease
treating China as a communist pariah with a closed economy and instead
recognise its growing role in the world and its relative openness, the paper
says.
'US objectives in Asia are most likely to be accomplished by treating China
as a strategic partner rather than a backlash state, as President Clinton's
national security adviser labelled it,' writes Mr Nicholas Lardy, author of
the paper, China in the World Economy.
Mr Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy, bases his argument partly on
refuting what he says are false US beliefs about China.
According to some western fears, China is about to become the world's
largest economy, will build ever larger-trade surpluses especially with the
US, and will do so while keeping its domestic economy closed.
How big is China? Mr Lardy puts China's per capita gross domestic product at
about Dollars 1,000, about three times the traditional World Bank measure
based on exchange rates, but well below some recent estimates based on
purchasing power parity.
Though Mr Lardy can see GDP growth averaging 9 per cent per year until the
year 2000 - barring political disruption - he forecasts that the dramatic
increase in Chinese productivity will slow and that the absolute size of the
economy will not match that of the US until 2040.
Even if the per capita growth rate were twice that of the US, income per
head would not catch up with that of the US for approximately 150 years.
China is still a poor country, but a big one whose role in the world economy
is growing rapidly.
It accounts for 2.5 per cent of world trade and is the tenth largest
exporter, compared with 0.6 per cent and 30th respectively in 1977, the year
before Deng Xiaoping's reforms began. It has probably absorbed more direct
foreign investment than any other developing country, is the biggest
borrower from the World Bank and raises significant capital on international
debt and equity markets.
That it should acquire such a prominent economic position while still run by
the Communist party raises particular problems for US policymakers. They
look at US trade figures and instinctively demand that China's market be
opened to US goods.
But this is based on misconceptions, argues Mr Lardy, as well as statistical
aberrations. The figures over-state the US deficit by several billion
dollars annually, he says, though not by as much as China claims. (The
differences result from treatment of goods passing through Hong Kong).
China has global trade and current account deficits, and the recipient of
substantial foreign capital - hardly supporting the contention that the
economy is closed. Mr Lardy believes the economy is more open than more
other regional countries, such as South Korea, which are at the same stage
of development.
Beijing's anomalous surplus with the US is partly the fault of the US itself
for deliberately limiting exports and restricting export credits and aid
programmes - policies which should be reversed, he argues.
Mr Lardy notes that the US, despite its desire to promote in Asian economic
co-operation, 'is the only country in the region that uses unilateral
economic sanctions rather than regional co-operation to promote human rights
and achieve other objectives'.
The US, he says, should rely as much as possible on multilateral sanctions,
including those which could be implied within Gatt, when China's behaviour
falls short of international accepted standards. Having China on the inside
is more effective than keeping it out.
Mr Lardy argues that revoking MFN without improving the human rights
situation would damage US interests as well as the prospects for further
market reforms which, he believes, offer the best hope for political
liberalisation.
His call for a change in the US mindset on China will be welcomed by those
in the US government who have already brought about a broadening in the
Sino-US relationship, evidenced by more frequent, wide-ranging and senior
bilateral discussions in the past few months. But it will be anathema to
those who argue that MFN is the only real lever which the US has over China
to prevent abuses of human rights.

<TEXT>
Measures to allow US banks to open branches freely outside their home states
could become law as early as next month after the easy passage of an
interstate banking law by the Senate on Tuesday.
Similar legislation has already passed the House of Representatives, and,
since neither chamber even required a voice vote on the once controversial
issue, a final bill is expected to be ready for President Bill Clinton to
sign before Congress breaks for the Memorial Day holiday at the end of May.
The patchwork of US banking legislation has frayed at the edges over the
years, and many restrictions on activity across state lines have already
lost meaning. All states except Hawaii already allow out-of-state holding
companies to own a bank within their borders, but groups have to establish a
separate subsidiary in each state, rather than simply opening a branch.
Automated teller machines already allow bank customers to draw money outside
the state in which they have an account, but the new law would also enable
them to make deposits or cash a cheque inside the bank.
'The lives of bank customers nationwide will improve considerably as a
result,' said Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who now supports the
bill, though for years his insistence on attaching an amendment restricting
banks' insurance activities blocked it.
Although the Senate and House versions are similar, some differences remain
to be reconciled before the bill can become law. One critical issue is the
extent foreign banks will be allowed to open branches.
Current law allows a foreign bank which chooses not to set up a full US
subsidiary to open a branch in one state only. The House version would allow
it to open branches in more than one state, but this is firmly resisted by
the Democratic majority in the Senate. Bankers in Kentucky are particularly
agitated about the issue, and opposition is led by their Senator Wendell
Ford, who is the majority whip.
The Treasury has urged Congress to allow broader foreign branching, arguing
that US banks essentially have this right in the European Union under the
'single passport rules', which allow a bank established in one EU country to
open branches in all others.
The principal bone of contention, however, is expected to be applicability
of state laws on matters such as consumer protection and fair lending
practices to national banks that set up a branch within the state.
The House version says such a branch should be treated essentially as though
it were a branch of a state chartered bank, which would mean state law could
be overridden only by Congress.
But the Senate would treat it the same way as a national bank which had its
headquarters in the state, which would give federal bank regulators the
power to pre-empt state law.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US State Department's top adviser on Haiti is stepping down following a
prolonged conflict with exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide over how to
return democratic rule to Haiti, AP reports from Washington.
Mr Lawrence Pezzullo decided to resign after meeting US secretary of state
Warren Christopher on Saturday, according to the State Department.
Mr Pezzullo is a former foreign service officer who was called out of
retirement last year to become special adviser on Haiti. Almost from the
outset, his relations with Mr Aristide were strained by tactical
differences.
Mr Pezzullo urged Mr Aristide to reach out to opposition forces in Haiti as
a means of broadening his base with the aim of leaving the Haitian military
increasingly isolated.
But Mr Aristide rejected such an approach. He believed the US should take
the lead in arranging for his return to power. He has been a strong
proponent of tighter economic sanctions against Haiti.
Several members of Congress' black caucus sided with Mr Aristide and urged
that Mr Pezzullo resign, holding him responsible for the continuing impasse.
Mr Pezzullo is a former ambassador to Nicaragua.

banks pushed to centre stage

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The administration of Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera is facing serious
questions about the credibility of its monetary policy following the abrupt
resignation on Tuesday of the president of the central bank, Mrs Ruth de
Krivoy. Three members of the six-strong board of directors also quit.
The resignations have raised doubts about the future independence of
Venezuela's central bank, which achieved a high degree of autonomy under a
law promulgated only 16 months ago.
The reaction from bankers and economists yesterday was generally negative.
'A lot of investors were sceptical about the Caldera government's economic
programme even before this happened. Ruth de Krivoy's resignation under
pressure is a serious blow to investor confidence,' said an economist at a
large investment bank in New York.
Mrs de Krivoy, a widely respected economist, was appointed to a five-year
term as the central bank's chief executive by President Carlos Andres Perez
in April 1992. She took over in the midst of a political crisis and left as
the Venezuelan economy, now in the second year of a recession, faces a host
of problems.
Mrs de Krivoy and the other board members resigned because they felt the
administration was trying to deprive the bank of its independent status. In
her letter of resignation to President Caldera, the outgoing bank head said
she believed 'the autonomy of a central bank is indispensable for monetary
stability, economic development and the welfare of the population.'
The executive has pressed the central bank to participate in an agreement
which included the obligatory reduction of interest rates on commercial
loans every two weeks, and to eliminate high-yield zero coupon bonds which
set the ceiling for commercial bank interest rates on loans. These moves are
part of the administration's efforts to reduce inflation, which was 46 per
cent in 1993.
But since taking over as the central bank's chief two years ago, Mrs de
Krivoy allowed real interest rates to remain high to protect hard currency
reserves. She argued that while high interest rates were painful for the
domestic economy, they were necessary to avoid capital flight.
Venezuela's gross international reserves fell by 14 per cent during the
first quarter of this year, compared to a decline of only 4 per cent for
full-year 1993. The failure of Banco Latino, the country's second largest
bank, last January and an ensuing crisis in the financial system have
contributed to Venezuelans' rush to buy dollars.
Mrs de Krivoy's departure halted, at least temporarily, an agreement
announced last Sunday night by the executive branch to reduce commercial
bank interest rates.
President Caldera, who began a five-year term last February, was highly
critical of the central bank's policy on interest rates and its 'crawling
peg' devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, during the 1993
presidential campaign. While he publicly supported the idea of an
independent central bank, he apparently considered that the institution
should work with the executive and that its policies on interest rates and
devaluation should change.
The bolivar, which has been falling steadily against the dollar for several
years, depreciated by 25 per cent in 1993, and has fallen by 9 per cent thus
far this year.
Following the announcement of Mrs de Krivoy's resignation, officials of the
Caldera administration tried to reassure investors and citizens in general
by saying neither exchange controls nor a major devaluation were planned.
Taking over as head of the central bank, at least temporarily, is Mr Omar
Bello, the bank's first vice-president.
Mrs de Krivoy's departure places Mr Caldera in a quandary. If his
appointment to replace her as central bank president is perceived as a
personality willing to follow the executive line on monetary policy,
investor confidence will fall once again. If he appoints someone viewed as
independent to restore confidence in the bank's autonomy, the government may
find it difficult to influence policy in areas it considers crucial.
Ironically it was a respected executive from the private sector and a strong
advocate of free-market policies, Mr Gustavo Roosen, who was chosen by
President Caldera to pressure central bank officials on a host of delicate
issues such as interest rates and devaluation.

FT  28 APR 94 / Mexico weathers market storms: Damian Fraser on the role of
the newly independent central bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Miguel Mancera, head of Mexico's newly independent central bank, has had
a testing month. In the four weeks since the bank won autonomy, he has
confronted exceptional volatility in Mexico's financial markets and has
defended the peso from devaluation.
The peso's survival is in part due to the management skills of Mr Mancera
and his colleagues. Working closely with the finance ministry, he let
domestic interest rates rise sharply to 18 per cent last week, convincing
investors of the government's commitment to a stable exchange rate and
drawing in money from those who calculated rates had reached their peak.
This role is not new to Mr Mancera, who ran Mexico's central bank for over
11 years before it was made independent. While Mexico has periodically
suffered political or economic turmoil, Mr Mancera's advocacy of low
inflation, and fiscal and monetary prudence has been unwavering, and much
criticised by those who have argued for policies more conducive to economic
growth.
A generation older then the rest of Mexico's economic cabinet, the
61-year-old Yale-trained economist was working in Mexico's central bank when
the rest of the economic cabinet were just beginning primary school. He is
known for personal frugality, dislike of appearing in public, and methodical
working habits.
He says policy during April would have been the same without independence
since he enjoys a 'perfect understanding' with the finance ministry. Over
the past month he has tried to calm the jittery financial markets after the
rise in US bond yields and political turmoil sparked by assassination of
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.
Measures included permitting the peso to weaken against the dollar to the
limit of its pre-set band, spending central bank reserves, and raising
interest rates.
Despite praise from the financial community, many businessmen complain the
policy of high rates is hurting economic growth, and believe a devaluation
and lower rates may be in the economy's interests. The economy grew by just
0.4 per cent last year, in part because the government kept interest rates
high to defend the currency from speculators, while the current account
deficit reached 7 per cent of GDP.
Mr Mancera defends government policy as having brought inflation down to an
annual rate of 7 per cent from nearly 160 per cent six years ago. He is
convinced low inflation is vital for stable economic growth and in the best
interests of the poor. He believes central bank independence will
institutionalise a commitment to low inflation.
Under the constitution, the central bank is required to procure price
stability as best it can, and is not obliged to lend money to the government
at below market interest rates, thereby ensuring that an increase in public
spending need not lead to an expansion in the money supply.
The terms of the governor and four deputy governors are fixed for 6-8 years
and staggered so as not to coincide with the president's.
But by the fourth year of a president's office the president will have named
three of the five bank officials, giving his nominees effective control of
the bank. In Mexico, where the president rules almost like an absolute
monarch, many are sceptical that the bank could withstand presidential
pressure to soften monetary policy.
The central bank's main weakness is that the finance ministry keeps control
of exchange rate policy. The central bank therefore has to set interest
rates so that the government can meet its exchange rate target.
Mr Mancera says a potential conflict between exchange rate and interest
policy exists in most countries with an independent central bank.
Nevertheless, if the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party wins
August's presidential election, as seems probable, the possibility of a
conflict with the executive branch is slight. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's
presidential candidate, began his professional life working under Mr
Mancera.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and Argentina are to hold talks in July on joint oil exploration in
waters surrounding the Falkland Islands, two years after a previous round of
oil talks collapsed.
A British official said negotiators would focus on the next phase of
exploration. The Falklands' government plans a second licensing round for
seismic explorations beginning in July and running until March 1995.
The Falklands selected two companies to carry out initial seismic surveys
shortly after the 1992 negotiations failed. Argentina broke off talks after
failing to agree on demarcation of Falkland waters bordering its territorial
waters.
International oil companies say co-operation with Argentina is important,
given the need for heavy investments in a disputed zone.
A UK official said successful joint management of fish stocks showed the
sovereignty dispute could be put aside while both sides pursued practical
interests, but Argentina's foreign ministry argues oil is different because
it is a non-renewable resource, with important legal and tax ramifications.
Both sides fear concessions over oil would imply recognition of the other's
sovereignty claim.
The Falklands remain a fixation in Argentina, which still claims the
islands, despite defeat in the 1982 conflict with Britain. President Carlos
Menem says Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000.
Argentine security forces have raided a secret training camp in thick forest
close to Buenos Aires used by paramilitaries linked to right-wing army
rebels who have led four mutinies since 1987.

Introduction of income tax and a reduction in state funding for a range of
economic enterprises are among measures to be debated by Cuba's national
assembly on Sunday. The special session, called in response to the
deteriorating economy, will also review the effect of economic changes over
the past eight months.
Increasingly concerned about its budget deficit, the government announced a
50 per cent cut in the budget for the armed forces last month, saying the
military should 'cost the country as little as possible'.
Given the central role of the armed forces in Cuban politics, the reduction
is a telling indicator of the nature of the economic problems facing the
country, diplomats in Havana said.
Introduction of income tax is intended to recapture billions of pesos in
circulation which government officials say are being used by Cubans to
purchase hard currency. The government announced last year that Cubans were
free to hold foreign currency.
The assembly debate will effectively be a continuation of the regular
session which was held last December. That reviewed the government's more
liberal attitude to foreign currency, foreign investment and increasing
private and co-operative ownership of farms and a range of small businesses.
Since then, however, there have been signs that the island's economy is

Since then, however, there have been signs that the island's economy is
buckling. Economic problems have worsened over the past three years
following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main trading partner, and
the failure last year of the sugar harvest which caused a shortfall in
foreign earnings.
The assembly session comes a week after the government reorganised the
administration of the economy, creating new ministries and suggesting a move
away from central planning on which decisions have been based since the
revolution 35 years ago.
The government has also adopted a more liberal attitude to exiles. A meeting
in Havana last week attended by 200 leaders of exile communities concluded
with a decision by the government allow all exiles to return to the island
whenever they want.
However, Cuban-American leaders in Florida said yesterday they could not
accept the invitation because they would be punished by the US government
for violating Washington's economic embargo on the island.

BMW is considering seeking a local partner with which to develop a planned
assembly facility in Mexico and will make a decision by June, writes John
Griffiths.
The German carmaker said it was 'too early' to pre-dict likely production
vol-umes or employment levels, but confirmed Mexican re-ports that it
intended to have the facility operational, assembling cars from kits, by
mid-1995.
Its own projections of the investment involved in the plant and setting up a
distribution network are understood to be much smaller than indicated by
Mexican government sources, at around DM300m (Pounds 120m).
The company said the cars would be sold only in the Mexican market.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt acts to sweep up old disputes

Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday adopted a controversial disputes
panel report on Norwegian salmon only after the chairman said it did not set
a legal precedent for future disputes.
The move reflects a drive by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
clear old disputes before the new tougher disputes settlement procedure
under the World Trade Organisation comes into effect next year.
The panel report in question ruled in late-1992 that the US had not complied
with Gatt's anti-dumping code in putting duties of up to 32 per cent on
imports of Norwegian salmon.
However, several signatories of the voluntary code, including paradoxically
Norway itself, were unhappy about some aspects of the report's analysis.
They agreed to adopt the report only after assurances from Mr Jose Graca
Lima of Brazil, chairman of the anti-dumping committee, that it did not
apply to countries not involved in the specific dispute 'nor does it
represent binding legal precedents applicable to other disputes'.
Gatt officials admit that the present disputes procedure has conflicting
objectives in trying to settle trade rows by mutual agreement and developing
Gatt case-law.
The WTO's semi-juridical disputes system will, by contrast, focus almost
exclus-ively on securing conformity with strengthened fair trade rules.
Separately, the members of the anti-dumping committee agreed to set up a
panel, under current procedures, to investigate a complaint by Brazil that
US duties on imports of cotton yarn from Brazil violate Gatt rules.

The Indian government is offering incentives to private foreign and domestic
companies to invest Dollars 4.7bn in 27 projects to construct bypass roads,
bridges and expressways in 16 Indian states. This is the first time
construction of India's national highways has been opened to the private
sector, as part of India's liberalisation efforts.
Foreign private investors will be permitted to hold 100 per cent equity and
regardless of the size of the project, would be exempted from special
clearances usually required from the government's Public Investment Board
and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
The Ministry of Surface Transport, which is offering the projects on a
build, operate and transfer basis, says the government guarantees 'a minimum
reasonable rate of return' to investors, without specifying what rate would
be considered reasonable.
The ministry has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with
Infrastructure, Leasing and Financial Services, a Bombay-based construction
company partly owned by ORIX Corporation of Japan, and the International
Finance Corporation, Washington, to build a four-lane 10.14km
asphalt-concrete road bypassing Panvel town on the Bombay-Pune national
highway.
Toll rates applicable for each project would be decided in consultation with
the government and the builder would be expected to operate the expressway
for a period of 20 to 25 years.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Wellcome 'price cut' in Aids drug war
</HEADLINE>

Wellcome has cut the price of its Aids treatment AZT by 56 per cent in
Portugal, after losing a hospital con-tract to a Portuguese com-pany
marketing a cheaper version in a challenge to Wellcome's worldwide patents,
the Portuguese company said yesterday.
Mr Augusto Paiva dos Santos, director-general of Farma APS, said his company
had been awarded a contract to supply the Sao Joao Hospital in Oporto with
6,000 250mg capsules of Apo-Zidovudine, a form of AZT manufactured by Apotex
of Canada, at 33 per cent below Wellcome's previous price.
He said that Wellcome had since lowered the price of Retrovir, the UK
com-pany's version of AZT and its second biggest selling drug, by 50 per
cent and 56 per cent respectively in tenders to supply two other Portuguese
hospitals.
Decisions on the contracts to supply the Joaquim Urbano Hospital in Oporto
with 6,000 250mg capsules and the Sao Jose Hospital in Lisbon with 5,000
100mg capsules have not yet been made.
But Farma APS said its prices were lower than those tendered by Wellcome.
'The fact that Wellcome has lowered its prices to less than half of what its
is charging in the rest of Europe shows that it must be making a fabulous
profit on AZT,' Mr Paiva dos Santos said.
His company was investigating the possibility of registering Apo-Zidovudine
for sale in other European Union countries and in eastern Europe.
The Portuguese government has authorised the sale of Apo-Zidovudine on the
grounds that AZT is a drug in the public domain and that Wellcome's
application of Retrovir to treat Aids did not give it the right to prohibit
the sale of other versions.
Wellcome has said it will challenge the authorisation as a breach of its
patents.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: End of an eastern love affair - Kieran
Cooke detects Malaysian disenchantment with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the mid-80's Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, declared his
country's 'Look East' policy. If Malaysia was to reach its goal of being
fully industrialised by the year 2020, said Dr Mahathir, it must learn from
Japan. In particular it should make use of Japanese technology.
There are signs now that the Malaysian love affair with the Japanese way is
ending. The main issue is technology transfer - or the lack of it - with
attention focused on Malaysia's national car industry, one of Dr Mahathir's
pet projects.
At the end of last week Proton, the country's car manufacturer, announced
that by the middle of the year it would begin casting its own engine blocks.
The move is seen as an important step towards more self-sufficiency at
Proton.
More than 120,000 Protons are produced each year in co-operation with
Mitsubishi of Japan. The first Proton rolled off the assembly line at the
company's factory outside Kuala Lumpur in 1985.
Proton says domestic content of its cars is well over 70 per cent. However,
the core technology and high-value items, including much of the transmission
system, is still imported from Japan. Proton has been working with
Mitsubishi for 10 years. Proton feels the Japanese have been too slow to
transfer technology.
Mr Nadzmi Mohamed Salleh, a Malaysian who last year replaced a Mitsubishi
executive as Proton's managing director, says that Proton does not have
sufficient economies of scale to make 100 per cent local content a realistic
proposition. 'The costs involved would be too high,' says Mr Nadzmi.
'Instead Proton may well opt for global sourcing.'
Next month Dr Mahathir will be making a private trip to France. It is
believed the prime minister's main host will be Peugeot Citroen. The French
car manufacturer has been cultivating contacts in Malaysia for several
years.
For Proton the recent rise of the yen - and the depreciation of the ringgit,
the Malaysian dollar - has given new urgency to the question of high-value
Japanese imports.
Proton has been one of the success stories of modern Malaysia. More than 70
per cent of the cars on Malaysia's roads are now Protons. Production is
being increased to 150,000 per year. Last year more than 17,000 Protons were
exported, most of them to the UK where it is among the best selling cars at
the lower end of the market. The success of Proton exports has been a cause
of friction with Mitsubishi, as the Japanese car maker is concerned that the
Malaysian car is eating into its own export markets.
After a decade in the fast lane Proton is facing a number of problems.
Though the Wira, Proton's new model launched in the middle of last year, has
given a boost to sales, the highly protected home market is at
near-saturation point. This year a second car project, undertaken in
co-operation with Daihatsu of Japan, is due to come on stream.
Late last year Proton announced it was expanding its sales in Europe. But
those plans received a setback last month with the death of Mr David Brown,
the British businessman who engineered the highly successful launch of the
Proton in the UK. Mr Brown was to have taken a 55 per cent stake in a new
Anglo-Malaysian joint venture company which would market the Proton in
continental Europe.
'The ringgit has fallen by more than 6 per cent against a basket of
currencies this year,' says a Kuala Lumpur motor industry specialist. 'That
has helped Proton's exports. But its yen imports have become more expensive
 -that's why its vital that more technology is transferred from Japan.
Either that or Proton has to find cheaper suppliers elsewhere.'
The increasingly difficult relationship between Proton and the Japanese is
part of a more general disenchantment between Malaysia and its powerful
regional neighbour. The Japanese have been less than enthusiastic about Dr
Mahathir's plans for the formation of a new trading body, the East Asia
Economic Caucus
Japanese companies like to maintain tight control over local ventures, and
rarely opt for overseas stock market listings. Malaysian investors have been
frustrated that they have not been given more chance to take equity in often
highly profitable local ventures controlled by Japanese companies.
Malaysians also say that Japanese companies frequently fail to promote
locals to senior positions of responsibility.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: US to fund flat panel displays - Dollars
1bn government package for development and manufacture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The US government is expected to announce today a Dollars 1bn package to
fund the development and manufacture of flat panel displays, such as those
used in portable computers. This will represent the largest ever US
government-funded programme for commercial technology.
Currently, Japanese companies dominate the Dollars 4bn flat panel display
market. This has long been a concern for the US Defence Department, which
increasingly uses flat panel displays in military systems, as well as for
the US computer industry, which is dependent upon foreign suppliers.
Industry groups have been urging the US government to provide funding to
help establish flat panel display manufacturing in the US for several years.
Previous Republican administrations balked at their proposals to inject
government money in commercial ventures.
The Clinton administration, however, has increased technology development
funding and is expected to announce matching funds of up to Dollars 500m for
companies that are willing to establish flat panel display manufacturing in
the US.
The goal of this part of the programme is to establish four large-scale
manufacturing sites in the US that eventually would supply about one-sixth
of world demand for flat panel displays.
US companies, and groups of companies, have previously come up with similar
proposals. Until now, however, such ideas have floundered because US
companies have been unwilling to invest in such a highly capital intensive
venture.
To date, US government funding has focused largely on research and
development. The Defence Department's Advanced Research Program Agency has
provided funds to companies developing equipment for the manufacture of flat
panel displays. The Pentagon is also subsidising the construction of a pilot
production line.
These efforts will now be expanded, with the Defence and Energy Departments
expected to provide a total of Dollars 450m, over the next five years, in
grants to companies that invest in flat panel display research.
Flat panel displays are considered to be one of the few critical
technologies in which the US has failed to keep pace with foreign
competitors. Sharp of Japan, the world's largest producer by far, is
estimated to have a 50 per cent market share of the market. NEC, which has
about 14 per cent of the market, aims to raise that to 30 per cent by next
year.
In order to stay ahead in the race to dominate the expanding flat panel
display market, Japanese companies have been aggressively building up
capacity. Sharp, which already has 2 plants and produces about 100,000
ten-inch display panels a month, is adding a third one that is planned to
come on stream next year. It also plans to expand its US subsidiaries'
capacity.
NEC, which opened a second plant earlier this month, estimates production
will reach 250,000 and expects its LCD sales to more than double to Y100bn
as a result.
Hitachi is also investing in a new LCD plant to raise capacity to 30,000
ten-inch panels a month while Toshiba is also planning to increase capital
investment in LCD facilities.
In addition, IBM and Toshiba have a joint venture for manufacturing flat
panel displays in Japan, formed in 1991, which provide the diplays used in
IBM portable computers.
South Korean manufacturers including Samsung and Goldstar Electronics have
also recently entered the market.

FT  28 APR 94 / World Trade News: Fresh push to curb aid for shipbuilders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's leading shipbuilding nations plan a final attempt in Paris next
month to conclude an agreement curbing inter-national subsidies after more
than four years of neg-otiations.
The talks, which broke off acrimoniously in late March, will resume in the
week of May 23 on the basis of a draft text prepared by the chairman, Mr
Staffan Sohlman, Sweden's ambassador to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
The negotiations have been given renewed impetus by the possibility that
failure to agree would prompt the Clinton administration to back bills in
Congress which would authorise US retaliation against ships built in
subsidised foreign yards.
Retaliation, in the form of a ban on such vessels entering US ports, would
severely disrupt maritime transport and could trigger an international trade
war.
The seven delegations involved in the talks insist any agreement must be a
comprehensive package deal. But though they have agreed some of its proposed
elements - including an end to direct budgetary subsidies  - they remain
divided on several important issues.
One of the biggest breakthroughs to date has been acceptance by Japan and
South Korea of western demands for an anti-dumping code, providing for
penalties on shipbuilders which pursued 'injurious pricing' strategies.
However, negotiators say a complex wrangle has developed over the procedures
for settling disputes over alleged violations of the proposed subsidies
rules.
The US, which exports few ships, wants strict procedures administered by an
independent panel of judges. But its demand is opposed by other countries,
which fear it could make it harder to sell vessels to US shipowners. A
further stumbling block in the talks is the Jones Act, the long-standing US
legislation which requires a fixed proportion of cargo passing through
American ports to be carried in vessels built in US yards.
Though other delegations have pressed for repeal of the Jones Act, most
accept this is politically unlikely and that, in any case, the legislation
affects only a small fraction of the world's shipping fleet.
Several delegations say they are ready to settle for a US undertaking that
tonnages covered by the Jones Act will not exceed recent levels. However,
the European Union, under pressure from France, is calling on the US to
improve its offer.
Some delegations suspect France of using the Jones Act as a pretext to try
to torpedo the negotiations. They say that, without subsidies, most French
shipbuilders could not compete with more efficient lower-cost yards,
particularly in Asia.
The third difficulty is over a US demand for a provision in the proposed
agreement to allow governments to require vessels financed by 'home credit'
schemes, which benefit their national shipping fleets, to be built in
national yards.
Though other delegations blamed the breakdown of the negotiations in March
on the last-minute tabling of this demand, most now seem less strongly
opposed to it.
However, some say they are still concerned that its real objective is to
enable the US to expand its merchant shipbuilding capacity by assisting the
conversion of military yards to commercial purposes.
The negotiations, held under the auspices of the OECD, also involve Finland,
Norway and Sweden.

Hopes of a breakthrough on Cyprus appeared to recede yesterday with Turkey's
parliament postponing today's debate on United Nations' confidence building
measures to end the 20-year division of the island. The rescheduling of the
debate to Tuesday is a snub to prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller, who has
urged the Turkish Cypriots to agree the package, warning that Cyprus was an
increasing handicap for Turkey. She was openly attacked by Turkish
politicians, and less explicitly, by Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot
leader. A UN special envoy has been in an intense diplomatic shuttle between
Turkey and the island this week in a bid to sell plans to re-open Nicosia
airport for use by both communities, and to allow Greeks to return to the
resort of Varosha, under a UN administration.

Russia's parliament, which has not passed a single law since its election
last December, yesterday devoted its energy to a furious debate over the
contract-killing of an MP and former banker. The shooting of Mr Andrei
Ayzderdis at his home on Tuesday night prompted a pledge of swift
retribution from President Boris Yeltsin, who has been trying to persuade
parliamentary parties to sign an agreement today committing them to
political consensus. Mr Ayzderdis was chairman of a little-known bank called
MDK before he was elected to parliament. Conservative deputies, led by Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky (left), called for the sacking of Mr Victor Yerin, the
interior minister, claiming that the killing of Mr Ayzderdis, who last week
published a list of 266 alleged mafia bosses, proved the present government
was incapable of fighting crime.

Gaullist Euro-MPs are to join their French UDF allies in allying themselves
with the Christian Democrat European Peoples Party (EPP) in the Strasbourg
Parliament, as a consequence of the two parties' decision to present a
single list of candidates and policies in the June Euro-elections. This is
an historic switch for the RPR Gaullists, who up to now in Strasbourg have
sat with a ragbag of other conservative nationalists, mainly Irish Fianna
Fail deputies. But at the UDF's urging, the RPR has now followed the British
Conservatives in overcoming their dislike of the religious and federalist
overtones of the Christian Democrat grouping.
An RPR spokesman yesterday denied his party's switch in Strasbourg signalled
any move towards an eventual merger between Gaullists and the centre-right
UDF in domestic politics. Nevertheless, their Euro-unity appears to be
paying off. An opinion poll published yesterday put support for the RPR-UDF
list at 38 per cent, well ahead of the Socialists at 18.5 per cent.

<TEXT>
The European Commission has drawn up plans for Ecu100m (Pounds 76.7m)
emergency food aid to Ukraine. The move is in response to a crisis in farm
production and distribution which has turned Ukraine, the former breadbasket
to Russia, into a net food importer. The Commission warned yesterday that
shortages of seeds, fertiliser, fuel and investment in farm equipment have
caused chaos in the Ukrainian food supply and increased the threat of social
unrest.
The food aid plan is part of a new European 'action plan' for the Ukraine
which requires approval from the 12 EU member states. The Commission plan
also attempts to tackle the crisis in Ukraine's energy sector. One idea is
that the EU, backed by international donors, should help to complete two new
nuclear reactors at Rovno and Khemelnitzky, conditional on the Kiev
government dropping opposition to shut down the Chernobyl plant. The
Commission made clear that it views the proposals as a test of the EU's
nascent common security and foreign policy. Other plans include closer
political contacts to consolidate democracy and human rights, improving
strained relations between Ukraine and Russia, and strengthening Ukraine's
'independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.'

FT  28 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Germany sees DM13.7bn outflow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany suffered a net outflow of long-term capital in February of DM13.7bn,
(Pounds 5.43bn) compared with an inflow of DM16.7bn the previous month,
underlining the recent turbulence in the bond market. Foreign investors sold
a net DM9.6bn worth of fixed interest bonds (after net purchases of DM26.6bn
in January), whereas domestic investors increased their purchases of foreign
bonds from DM4.6bn to DM10.6bn. As a result, the surplus on capital account
in the balance of payments shrank from DM28.5bn to just DM600m in February,
according to the Bundesbank. The figures reflect in part the flight of US
mutual funds from the German bond market because of rising interest rates,
and partly a correction after the massive inflow of money from Luxembourg in
December and January, when certain tax allowances were cancelled. The
current account of the German balance of payments showed an increasing
deficit, from DM2.6bn in January to DM4.8bn in February, after unusually
high deficits in service payments and net transfers. Quentin Peel, Bonn
Eastern Germany's manufacturing industry orders were 4.2 per cent higher in
February compared to January and up 23.9 per cent from a year earlier,
thanks largely to a surge in domestic demand, according to the German
economics ministry.
Swiss consumer prices rose 0.1 per cent in April after standing unchanged in
March to give annual inflation of 1.0 per cent, the Federal Statistics
Office said.
Bank of Greece governor Ioannis Boutos said in his annual review of the
economy that he expected year-on-year inflation to be steady at around 10
per cent in April.

FT  28 APR 94 / No delight at Turkish central bank plan: Few bankers give
much credence to the guidelines behind autonomy move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Turkish government has moved to restore confidence in the financial
system, implementing a new central bank law which strengthens the autonomy
of the bank.
The law also provides for a 'lifeboat' to help troubled banks through the
current money market turbulence, in the wake of the collapse of three small
private banks.
The moves come ahead of this week's mission from the International Monetary
Fund, to assess the austerity programme unveiled by the prime minister, Mrs
Tansu Ciller, on April 5. The Fund's approval would pave the way for
negotiations on a letter of intent and agreement on a standby facility which
would in turn open the way for Turkey to return to commercial debt markets.
Tension between the central bank and the Treasury has been at the root of
Turkey's economic malaise. Mrs Ciller's lax monetary policy and, in
particular, her use of central bank funds to finance the budget deficit has
helped fuel inflation by increasing money supply and has been the cause of
the resignations of two bank governors since she came to office last June.
The new law limits the extent to which the Treasury can tap the central bank
for short-term advances, reducing the amount from the current 15 per cent of
budget appropriations. However, given Mrs Ciller's record, few bankers are
giving much plausibility to the broader guidelines aimed at strengthening
the autonomy of the bank.
Bankers say the law also fails to address the more awkward issue of the lack
of effective supervision of the banking sector, which has been sharply
exposed by the current crisis.
The collapses this month of the Tourism and Investment bank (TYT), Marmara
Bank and the most recent casualty Impexbank - the small Istanbul trade
finance concern formerly owned by Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive tycoon -
shocked the financial community, both in Turkey and abroad in the wake of a
four-month currency crisis which has seen a 50 per cent depreciation of the
lira against the dollar.
Bankers are asking how the government could have approved, last July, the
Dollars 213m (Pounds 142m) purchase by TYT's parent company Lapis Holding of
an 89 per cent stake in Disbank, the reputable trade finance concern in what
was then the largest ever Turkish bank takeover. The deal has now been
cancelled.
In a further indication of the inadequacy of accounting procedures, brokers
point to the anomaly that Marmara Bank reported a 700 per cent nominal rise
in profits for the first quarter, according to figures lodged with the
Capital Markets Board, the government stock exchange watchdog.
The lifeboat system envisaged under the new law will allow the treasury to
provide up to twice a bank's equity to help overcome a sudden run on
deposits. The move symbolically draws an official line under the crisis.
However, it also underscores concern to see it does not precipitate the
failure of one of the larger family-owned banks which, given the exposure to
industrial affiliates, could have widespread fallout for the economy.
It comes amid bitter recriminations between Turkey's state banks and the
Treasury, after revelations of the exposure of the state sector to the three
failed private banks.
Mr Ozal Baysal, head of the Turkish Development Bank (TKB), openly
criticised the Treasury for not forewarning about the health of TYT, where
TKB is said to have had Dollars 30m in foreign currency deposits.

FT  28 APR 94 / Solidarity strike shakes Poland's coalition
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, BELCHATOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's centre-left coalition government yesterday faced its most serious
political threat since it was elected last autumn, as the Solidarity trade
union prepared a day of nationwide strikes today demanding an end to wage
controls in state industries.
Solidarity supporters at four open-cast lignite mines which supply one third
of Poland's power stations have been on strike since last Thursday.
Yesterday a quarter of the hard coal mines were on strike too.
Workers at Belchatow, an open-cast mine 150km south of Warsaw where
opposition to privatisation plans was the trigger for the current wave of
strikes, held a bellicose rally yesterday which underscored how much
Solidarity has changed since the 1980s, when the union led a united nation
in its struggle to overthrow the communist regime.
'This government is worse than the old communists were,' said a middle-aged
miner, wearing his dirt-streaked navy overalls and a red and white
Solidarity arm-band. 'The only improvement today is that at least they no
longer send riot police to break up our strikes.'
Angry speakers at the rally at Belchatow - which, like the other lignite
mines, poses a particularly acute threat to the government because the power
stations it supplies do not maintain large stocks of lignite coal - voiced
the grievances of a working class which fears it will lose out in the
radical political and economic reforms which the workers themselves made
possible.
'A very specific group of individuals is benefiting from privatisation,
while the workers get nothing,' a Solidarity official told a cheering crowd
of more than 5,000 miners.
Paradoxically, it is now - after Poland's radical shock therapy reforms gave
the nation the highest growth rate in Europe in 1993 and have produced
evident prosperity - that workers' fears that they will lose their jobs
threaten to derail the country's macro-economic stability and its plans to
restructure and privatise inefficient state-owned heavy industries.
Solidarity, which has under 2m members, wants the government to produce a
plan for dropping the wage controls by this evening as a condition for
ending the protest. Solidarity is also asking for the controls to be
replaced by a system of collective wage bargaining within guidelines agreed
annually by a tripartite commission composed of unions, government and the
employers.
More generally, the union wants a commitment from the government of policies
ensuring real wages growth this year at half the rate of GDP growth for 1994
which is predicted at 4.5 per cent.
This formula was promised to Solidarity by the previous government led by Ms
Hanna Suchocka and the present coalition promised the removal of wage
controls in its election campaign last autumn. The wage controls, dating
from the 1980s, have also been criticised by right-wing economists who argue
that companies which pay their employees too much should be allowed to go
bankrupt.
However, non-communist governments have in the past four years kept them in
place for fear that Poland's still prevalent state owned monopoly producers
would raise prices to pay for wage increases if the controls were lifted.
Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister and Peasant Party (PSL) leader,
recently said that he didn't see the sense of keeping the controls, even
though his ministers, led by Mr Henryk Chmielak, the acting finance
minister, are arguing that the move would fuel inflation. Mr Pawlak did,
however, consent last week to having the coalition's deputies in parliament
propose a new wage control law to replace earlier regulations which expired
on March 31.
The government's mishandling of the crisis was on display at Belchatow,
where a minister, his voice booming over the speaker telephone for nearly an
hour, sought in vain to negotiate with union officials. They told him to
come to their mine if he wanted to talk and warned that 'this is not just
some party.'
President Lech Walesa - founder of Solidarity and no friend of the present
government, which contains former communists in the Left Democratic Alliance
 -weakened the government's bargaining position late yesterday.
Referring to the wage control law, he said: 'I would not sign it today. I
have my doubts. I will listen to the nation.'
Just before Mr Walesa went on a two-day state visit to Lithuania on Tuesday
he said he would 'resolve the situation' on his return.
Indeed he has recently lost no opportunity of saying that he thought Mr
Pawlak, who is 33 years old, didn't have the experience to handle the
present crisis.
Yesterday Mr Miroslaw Pietrewicz, the head of the government's planning
commission (CUP) warned of the inflationary dangers of removing the
controls.
President Walesa and Poland's prime minister yesterday agreed on a candidate
for finance minister. The job, vacant for nearly three months, is expected
to be taken by Grzegorz Kolodko, an economics professor and an advocate of
austere financial policy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night ended a delay in forming Italy's
53rd post-war government by summoning Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media
magnate-turned politician, to visit him today.
The expected call to Mr Berlusconi to head the administration follows a
24-hour delay prompted by fears of a conflict of interest over Mr
Berlusconi's Fininvest empire and a row over allocating ministerial posts,
especially the key interior ministry.
President Scalfaro had originally been expected to ask Mr Berlusconi to form
the government yesterday, a month after he led the four-party Freedom
Alliance to victory in general elections.
But it became clear Mr Berlusconi was not yet ready with his cabinet.
Moreover, several politicians were unhappy about the suggested formulas for
distancing his political responsibilities from ownership of Fininvest, the
second largest media group in Europe.
The president proposed on Tuesday that he himself act, in his role as
guardian of the constitution, as guarantor against any conflict of interest.
But this vague proposal left many perplexed.
The Northern League, a main component of the future government along with Mr
Berlusconi's Forza Italia, has threatened to press for President Scalfaro's
resignation once the new government is formed, and several members regarded
the president's proposal as a disguised means of ensuring he remained in
office. The view was shared by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance,
another member of the would-be coalition.
Others pointed out that President Scalfaro lacked the authority to take an
active role in monitoring any conflict of interest - especially where it
concerned Fininvest's three television channels.
However, it appears President Scalfaro only stepped forward because it had
been impossible to agree an independent watchdog to monitor any conflict of
interest. The opposition parties on the left were reluctant to see such a
role conferred on parliament because the Freedom Alliance had an absolute
majority.
Mr Berlusconi has not detailed how he believes he can act as prime minister
and retain ownership of the second largest private group in Italy.
Mr Mario Segni, leader of the centrist Italian Pact, told President Scalfaro
during formal consultations on the formation of the next government this
week that Mr Berlusconi's business interests were an insuperable obstacle to
the media magnate assuming the premiership.
Mr Segni said: 'There is a clear incompatability between the functioning of
government and those of an entrepreneur involved in a series of activities
that impinge heavily on public life.'
This was the sole public veto for Mr Berlusconi. However, the conflict of
interest was raised in varying degrees by everyone consulted by President
Scalfaro - not least by the Northern League leader, Mr Umberto Bossi.
Hurdles yesterday also remained over ministerial appointments. The League
has been fighting a tough rear-guard action to secure the interior ministry.
This portfolio has always been in Christian Democrat hands and traditionally
has been a source of enormous power. This internecine battle underlined the
difficulties faced by Mr Berlusconi in putting together a cohesive team from
a largely inexperienced and unlikely group of partners.
The new government is expected to be slimmer than previous ones but will
balance the respective weights of Forza Italia against the League, the
MSI/National Alliance and the small rump of the old Christian Democrats, the
Christian Democratic Centre.

FT  28 APR 94 / Russia warms to Nato peace partnership

<TEXT>
A senior Russian general will visit the military headquarters of Nato today
amid mounting speculation that his country is about to soften its attitude
to co-operation with the alliance.
General Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy head of the Russian general staff, will
be among the top brass from 15 former Communist countries who visit the
headquarters at Mons, near Brussels.
Gen Zhurbenko pointedly declined to disclose his country's intentions at a
discussion in Brussels yesterday between chiefs of staff from the former
Warsaw Pact and their opposite numbers in Nato.
However, Field Marshall Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military
committee, said the Russian visitor had played an 'entirely constructive'
role in discussions about joint east-west exercises within the Partnership
for Peace.
Nato has invited all its former adversaries in the eastern bloc to join
Partnership for Peace, a programme of military co-operation which could pave
the way for full membership of the Atlantic alliance for some of them.
Some 15 former communist countries have joined the programme or are in the
process of doing so.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, was expected to sign up to
the programme during the visit to Brussels on April 21, but the trip was
cancelled after a plunge in Moscow's relations with Nato following the first
air strikes in Bosnia.
In the last few days, co-operation betweens Russia and the west over Bosnia
has again improved and the Serb withdrawal, which averted the possibility of
fresh air strikes by Nato, also lightened the atmosphere.
Another sign of improving relations between Russia and the main western
countries is the renewed interest in some western capitals in upgrading
Russia's ties with the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Officials close to President Boris Yeltsin have said that Russian
participation in the Partnership for Peace could hinge on Moscow's full
acceptance into the G7 club. The G7's Italian presidency has indicated
willingness to accept Russia as a full partner in the group's political
consultations, although not in its discussions on the world economy.
A senior Russian diplomat is understood to have telephoned Nato headquarters
on Tuesday night with what western officials viewed as a helpful message
from Moscow.
The message was to the effect that Russia had strongly pressed the Serbs to
withdraw from Goradze, and the pull-out was now broadly complete. However
the diplomat said Russia accepted the inevitability of air strikes in the
event of backsliding by the Serbs.
General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister is due to visit Brussels on
May 24, providing an opportunity for Moscow to sign up to Partnership for
Peace.

FT  28 APR 94 / Opel plan 'strikingly similar' to VW idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plant X, the root of all the trouble between Volkswagen and General Motors,
has re-emerged at the centre of a criminal investigation into suspicions
that the US group's former global purchasing chief stole GM secrets before
his move to the German company just over a year ago.
As German prosecutors announced yesterday, there were striking similarities
between GM's secret Plant X - a shelved project to build a super-efficient
car factory in Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's native Basque country -
and VW's 'own' version, Plant B.
The similarities were detected during the painstaking sifting of data seized
last August in a search of Volkswagen's headquarters and the homes of Mr
Lopez and seven colleagues who fled with him from GM to VW. Data on plant B
was found in Mr Lopez's office, prosecutors said.
Neither the find nor its location is really surprising. While still employed
by GM, Mr Lopez worked as project leader on Plant X. He personally
negotiated a deal with a Basque consortium. He had a site all ready for the
revolutionary new works, 'my dream,' as he liked to call it.
It was the shattering of this dream, with the discovery that the project was
not to go ahead - at least not in Mr Lopez's home town - which led to his
bitter and controversial desertion. Shortly after his move, as charges and
counter-charges flew about his head, Mr Lopez was to learn that VW was not
to go ahead either.
But while the plant represented Mr Lopez's 'dream', it could in no way be
considered his property. Investigations will continue, details will be
checked and cross-checked to discover how closely the two projects match one
another. The aim will be to determine if VW's project was copied from GM
data - essential if industrial espionage is to be proved.
The likelihood of more than passing similarities being found appeared to be
increased by other discoveries announced by the prosecutors' office
yesterday. These included diskettes and other material which were suspected
of being sourced or copied from documents belonging to Adam Opel, GM's
German subsidiary.
Another important find was a diskette in Mr Lopez's 'personal environment'
crammed with data on cost-saving programmes for GM cars.
Although a seemingly meagre harvest from almost eight months gleaning
through the 2m-plus sheets of paper seized in last August's raids, the
discoveries clearly nullify recent speculation that the chief investigator,
Ms Dorothea Holland, has reached the end of her tether and is about to fold
the whole investigation.
It will last for several months yet, according to her spokesman, and there
is no sign yet of whether it will result in charges either in Germany or the
US, where a federal grand jury is investigating. In the interests of
preparedness, VW appears to have a defence ready and based on the claim that
GM has an exagerated sense of what is secret. KPMG consultants, called in
after the VW raid last year, found some GM and Opel data, and declared the
lot non-confidential.
Yesterday's revelations followed last year's find of secret data on Opel's
sub-compact O-car in a house previously occupied by two of Mr Lopez's
closest lieutenants, and admissions from VW that large quantities of
'possibly sensitive' data was shredded on its premises.

FT  28 APR 94 / Moscow tries to regulate chaotic share markets: Leyla
Boulton looks at efforts to boost confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unique for having the largest number of stock exchanges in the world and the
smallest number of shares traded on them, Russia is finally trying to impose
some order upon the chaos.
Held up by squabbling among officials and the vested interests of some
market participants, the development of a functioning Russian stock market
has taken on a new urgency with the appearance of thousands of newly
privatised and investment-starved companies desperate to raise capital.
Although an ambitious privatisation programme has created a record number of
small investors over the past year, the country has yet to develop a
secondary market for share trading.
Last weekend, however, President Boris Yeltsin's Securities Commission
gathered dealers, brokers and stock exchanges to request their help in
drafting standards and organising self-regulating bodies. Mr Ruslan Orekhov,
who chairs the presidential commission, expects the consultations to produce
decrees setting those standards by June.
More than half of Russian industry has been privatised in a mass sell-off
which ends on July 1. Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister responsible
for privatisation, is keen to protect his legacy and help companies survive
in a market economy. 'It is a race against time to stop them from going
bankrupt and discrediting the whole idea of market reforms,' says one
western banker.
With many plants on the verge of closure and mass lay-offs, new share issues
are the only hope for helping the better managed companies restructure and
re-tool.
The lack of trading is typical of the 65 self-proclaimed exchanges around
Russia. Stocks in newly privatised companies are traded only, if at all, at
2pm every day after clerks match paper bids for them, and are mostly in
locally based companies.
The bulk of exchange trading is in shares in new commercial banks, currency
options, and issues by a few new companies whose only disclosure of
information is contained in television advertisements promising rich returns
to investors anxious to protect their savings from savage inflation.
But even much of this trading is artificial, says Mr Jonathan Hay, an
adviser to the privatisation ministry, who cites the example of AVVA, an
industrial consortium which is trying to raise Dollars 3bn for Avtovaz, the
Russian carmaker.
Authorisation from the finance ministry to launch a share offering with an
unprecedented four-year take-up period means investors may be left in the
dark until 1998 about whether the project is viable.
Most of the trade in the privatised companies is within the emerging
over-the-counter market. The privatisation ministry hopes this will evolve
into a self-regulating market modelled on Nasdaq in New York. But here, too,
vested interests are at play, with directors of some privatised companies
still preferring a closed market to enable them to buy up shares in their
companies in order to acquire a controlling stake.
Nevertheless, the main brake on growth has been the state's inability to
co-ordinate aspects which cannot be left to market forces.
These include setting standards for company disclosure, fair advertising and
a national settlements system. Although companies are supposed to hire
independent registrars, many transactions go through only if brokers fly
directly to aluminium smelters in Siberia or tractor plants in southern
Russia to secure changes in company-held registers.
The danger now is that while the central bank and various ministries argue
over regulation, scandals generated by companies which have already rushed
to tap the market will undermine confidence.
Although Russians have large reserves of cash to invest, many potential
investors are extraordinarily credulous, perceiving what they see on
television as fact rather than advertising.
One of the most traded securities in Russia is in an obscure financial
company called MMM, which runs television advertisements every night showing
old ladies buying its certificates of deposit, changing their minds, and
getting the paper redeemed with a big profit three days later.
But earlier this month, the day after a bank of the same name folded,
Izvestia newspaper reported that hundreds of MMM shareholders had been
unable to redeem their certificates at MMM offices.
In its attempts to get hold of MMM's management, Izvestia found that all the
MMM telephone numbers held by the central bank or the finance ministry were
no longer valid.

FT  28 APR 94 / S African polling system strained as millions vote:
Buthelezi accepts compromise - Organisers accused of poor planning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Widespread organisational problems yesterday threatened the credibility of
South Africa's elections as millions turned out to vote for the first time.
Some designated polling stations never opened, and many of those that did
soon ran out of equipment, including ballot papers and the invisible ink
supposed to be stamped on to voters' hands to prevent fraud.
However, early today fears that the Inkatha Freedom party might pull out of
the election receded when its leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said he
was satisfied with a compromise over the unavailability at a number of
stations of stickers with the IFP's name. Electoral officers were to have
affixed these to ballot papers, printed before the party decided barely a
week ago to take part.
Chief Buthelezi said he had accepted an undertaking by the Independent
Electoral Commission to provide additional specially-printed ballot papers
which would include Inkatha's name and additional voter help for the Zulu
heartland in kwaZulu. 'I believe the issue of the ballots has solved the
crisis I saw looming before us,' said Chief Buthelezi.
Earlier President F. W. de Klerk appealed for patience and understanding and
said that he did not believe the problems would interfere with the free and
fair nature of the election.
After consultations with Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress
leader who voted for the first time in his life yesterday, Mr de Klerk
announced that today would be a public holiday, as yesterday had been, to
allow extra time to vote.
Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, chairman of the IEC, acknowledged
'difficulties', but described the process so far as '80 per cent'
successful.
Amid widespread confusion over how to deal with the absence of Inkatha from
some ballot papers, the IEC at one stage gave permission for Inkatha
supporters, many of whom are illiterate, to write the party's name on to the
ballot after having initially said this would constitute a spoiled paper. It
then later announced that such ballots would be counted only at an
unspecified 'lesser value'. The number of affected votes is not yet known.
The turnout far exceeded expectations and in many voting stations queues
stretched for over 2km as people had to wait for up to eight hours to vote.
The IEC was criticised for poor planning, inefficiency and even impropriety.
Mr Clarence Makwetu, president of the Pan Africanist Congress, charged that
the IEC was rigging the election.
The voter response belied fears that recent bomb blasts, which have killed
at least 21 people since Sunday, would deter voters. Another car bomb
exploded at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts airport yesterday morning, injuring 18
people. Police later announced they had arrested 31 suspects, including one
police officer and one reservist, many of whom were allegedly associated
with the neo-fascist Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB).
At stations round the country, which were remarkably free of violence, many
voters were without water or access to toilet facilities, and there were
reports of heatstroke, faintings and one death. Overall, though, the mood
was cheerful, with most voters content to wait it out.

FT  28 APR 94 / Watchdog warns DTI on gas document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regulator of the gas industry yesterday warned the Department of Trade
and Industry that she was ready to publish an important consultation
document on the future of the UK gas market if the government continued to
hold it up unnecessarily.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general, said she would rather rewrite
the document than see the delay continue beyond the local elections on May
5.
The document will lay out the structure of the liberalised gas market in the
wake of last year's monopoly inquiry into British Gas, and pave the way for
a new bill regulating the industry. Ofgas has already sent the DTI detailed
proposals on which the document will be based.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, originally promised
publication early this year, but it has been delayed for several months for
reasons which have not been disclosed.
One theory is that the document is so sensitive politically the government
wants to postpone it until after the May 5 poll.
The gas industry says the delay is jeopardising investment plans. One of the
gas industry's main concerns is that lengthy delay could throw into question
the entire gas industry reform because it would prevent the new bill being
passed before the next general election.
At a conference yesterday on the future of the gas industry at the Institute
of Economic Affairs, Ms Spottiswoode said: 'If the gas consultation document
is delayed beyond that time (of the local elections) then I would prefer to
rewrite it myself and send it out as an Ofgas document.'
Ms Spottiswoode stressed there was no dispute with the DTI.
Ofgas believes it could rewrite and publish the document 'within days'. The
text would have to be redrafted because the document is Crown copyright.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday he hoped the document would be
published 'soon'. He told the same conference: 'It has taken us some time,
but I make no apology for this. The issues are complex. We want to find the
best way forward. This is not to say that we are going to have solved every
problem and found all the right answers when we issue the document. If we
thought that, we would not need to consult at all. But we do want to get as
close as we can.'
Among the issues in the document are whether prices will rise in a
liberalised market, and how the poor and elderly will be assured continuing
gas supplies.

FT  28 APR 94 / Tory support 'at 15 year low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a fresh blow for the Conservatives last night when a Mori opinion
poll put Tory support at its lowest level for at least 15 years, writes
David Owen.
The poll, published in today's Times, gave Labour - with 47 per cent - a 21
percentage-point lead over the Conservatives on 26. Support for both parties
was two percentage points lower than a month ago. The Liberal Democrats were
up 3 percentage points on 23 per cent.

Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, bitter rivals in the Pounds 6bn a year
European detergent market, yesterday resorted - almost literally - to
washing their dirty linen in public.
Unilever executives brandished ladies' underwear in evidence as they
fervently denied claims by P&amp;G that a new concentrated washing powder rotted
clothes.
The row reached boil-wash temperature when an unnamed P&amp;G executive was
quoted in a front page article in the Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad
as saying that fabric showed damage after 24 washes in Unilever's new
powder.
Stung by the allegation - all the more painful because Rotterdam is its
headquarters in continental Europe - Unilever rapidly called a press
conference. One of its scientists held up a cloth which had been washed 380
times in the product and asked: 'Can you see any holes?'
Unilever, whose position in the market has fallen behind P&amp;G's in the last
five years, is attempting to catch up with the pan-European launch of a new
concentrated powder.
Billed as the most significant new product launch in the market for 20
years, Unilever claims the powder is genuinely innovative, better at
removing stains and more environmentally friendly.
The company plans to spend nearly Pounds 200m to promote the product across
Europe and has already invested Pounds 100m in three new factories to
produce it. Unilever's sales of concentrated powders total Pounds 500m
across Europe.
Advertising will stress environmental benefits as the product is launched
under local brands such as Persil Power in the UK and Omo Power in the
Netherlands and Switzerland.
Dutch consumers have been able to buy the powder for the last two weeks,
although it has been test marketed in the Netherlands since last autumn. It
will begin to appear on the shelves of UK supermarkets next week.
While Unilever expected P&amp;G to retaliate to protect its Ariel brand,
executives at the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate appeared shocked by its US-owned
rival's attack.
Unilever said the allegations were 'absolutely unfounded' and it was
consulting lawyers over what action it might take.
The vital ingredient in the Unilever powder is a new molecule which it
claims accelerates the bleaching process, shortening washing times and
allowing lower temperatures. As well as using 80 per cent less energy to
make the powder, the ingredient also reduces the consumer's energy bills.
But a P&amp;G executive, quoted in Algemeen Dagblad, said his company had known
for 20 years about the technology Unilever is using. Unilever has patented
the molecule, and searches of patents show none of its competitors had
claimed ownership of anything like it.

FT  28 APR 94 / Major retreats over press ban on Smith hospital visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, was embroiled in an election row
last night after Mr John Major, prime minister, was forced to apologise for
a health department ban on media coverage of a hospital visit by Mr John
Smith, Labour leader.
The row broke out after Mr Smith was told that reporters would be banned
from a planned visit today to St Bartholomew's, a leading central London
teaching hospital which is being run down under the government's NHS
reforms.
In a letter to Mr Major, Mr Smith said the health department had ruled that
no reporters could accompany him because political activity was not allowed
on NHS premises in the run up to the local elections on May 5.
Mr Smith said that under the Representation of the People Act, the
pre-election period began on March 25. But Mr Major had visited a maternity
unit in Basildon, Essex 'in a blaze of publicity' on April 5.
'This is, in my view, a gross abuse of government power,' Mr Smith said. 'I
consider this discrimination between a visit made by the prime minister and
one made by the leader of the opposition to be totally unacceptable.'
Mr Smith said the government appeared to be afraid of 'damaging publicity
about your systematic destruction of London's health service'.
The government's plans to close the accident and emergency unit at Bart's
were opposed 'not just by staff and patients at the hospital, but by people
throughout the capital', he said.
In a response, dictated immediately after the end of his summit meeting with
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr Major said the Representation of
the People Act did not apply to his Basildon visit.
But he said the ban on coverage of Mr Smith's visit to Bart's was based on
'over-scrupulous reading' by the health department of guidance on political
activities from Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service.
'In these circumstances, I would be content for your visit to be covered by
the media,' he said. The row was seen at Westminster as a substantial own
goal for Mrs Bottomley who appeared to have succeeded merely in drawing
attention to Mr Smith's visit.
The episode will also draw unwelcome attention to a Commons debate on the
health reforms called by Labour today to highlight growing public concern
over the government's plans for large-scale closures of London hospitals.
Several Conservative MPs have already expressed concern about the plans for
London.

FT  28 APR 94 / Major backs Kohl over EU links with eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major signalled the start of a British drive to improve its alliance
with Germany yesterday based on a joint commitment to forge closer links
between the European Union and central and eastern Europe.
The two countries repaired strains caused by last month's disagreements on
EU voting rights, and Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, damped
expectations of a quick enlargement of the EU.
Both men emphasised the warmth of their personal relationship, with Mr Kohl
at pains to address Mr Major by the familiar 'Du' during a closing joint
press conference yesterday.
Mr Major's emphasis on the two countries' common interest in links with the
former communist bloc marked the opening moves in Britain's campaign to
shape the agenda for the EU's 1996 intergovernmental conference.
In a note of caution about enlargement plans, Mr Kohl said extending the EU
to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia would take longer than
generally expected.
He said his government had not yet come up with firm plans on restructuring
of the common agricultural policy and the EU's funding for poorer regions to
accompany eastwards enlargement.
Underlining a joint commitment to reduce red tape in Brussels, the two
governments will set up a panel of business leaders to examine whether EU
legislation burdens companies with unnecessary regulations.
The idea, discussed by Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK trade secretary, and Mr
Gunther Rexrodt, the German economics minister, appears to be in its early
stages, as there is no agreement yet on who will take part in the panel.
In an effort to improve knowledge of the two countries' economic policies,
the UK Treasury and the Bonn finance ministry are to start exchanges of
senior officials for three to six-month secondments.
The UK government sees another round of enlargement as the key to shifting
the emphasis of change in the EU from the 'centralising' impulses, which led
to the Maastricht Treaty, to a looser confederation.
Senior British ministers are deeply concerned that the approach of the 1996
conference will open up an irreparable split in the Conservative party
unless they can be shown to be setting a decentralising agenda.
They took heart from Mr Kohl's public commitment to put competitiveness,
employment and deregulation at the centre of the six-month German presidency
of the EU which starts in July. Mr Kohl said he, too, opposed a
'centralised' Europe.
The chancellor denied that his interest in widening Europe to the east meant
he wanted to hold up plans for European monetary union.
Meanwhile, Mr Kohl said he had made no firm decision on who the Bonn
government would back for the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president
of the European Commission. He refused to rule out the possibility that
Germany will back Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the avowedly federalist Belgian prime
minister.
German support for Mr Dehaene would probably sink the chances of Sir Leon
Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator and senior British commissioner.
Mr Kohl sought to rebut any suggestion that his absence from next month's
D-day celebrations was seen in Bonn as a slight.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: UCB held back by downturn in
chemical sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The downturn in chemicals and currency turmoil in Europe led to a 17 per
cent profits fall last year at UCB, the Belgian chemical and pharmaceutical
group.
Group pre-tax profits fell to BFr2.03bn (Dollars 56.4m) from BFr2.4bn in
1992. However, an exceptional gain of BFr880m, due mainly to the sale of
Vel, the group's Belgian chemicals subsidiary, helped lift after-tax profits
in 1993 by 7 per cent to BFr2.4bn.
Mr Georges Jacobs, chief executive, expressed optimism about prospects for
1994. Economic recovery in Europe was under way and profits would be 'at a
good level', he said.
UCB specialises in plastics, pharmaceuticals, films and packaging. In spite
of a 3 per cent fall in net sales in 1993 to BFr45.9bn, against BFr 47.31bn,
the company created 199 jobs. The workforce at the end of 1993 totalled
8,104.
UCB's profits were helped by the success of Zyrtec, its anti-allergic drug.
Mr Jacobs hoped the drug would win approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration for marketing in the US before the end of the year.
Mr Jacobs said UCB was looking for acquisitions in its core businesses, but
declined to speculate on the timing. UCB wanted to expand sales outside
Europe in fast-growing markets in Thailand and Malaysia, in addition to
Japan and Korea.
'We can't just sell, we must produce locally,' he said.
UCB is recommending a total net dividend of BFr430 per ordinary share,
against the BFr420 paid for 1992.

FT  27 APR 94 / Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars increase by 30%: Chairman says
deliveries of new model beat forecasts and reach 200,000 - Turnover up 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars rose more than 30 per cent in the first quarter
of this year in all the marque's most important markets, Mr Helmut Werner,
its chairman, said yesterday.
Deliveries of the new bottom-of-the-range C-Class model had exceeded
expectations by reaching almost 200,000 since the launch last summer, he
said.
Total turnover at Mercedes, which is the vehicles arm of Daimler-Benz group,
rose 28 per cent to DM16.1bn (Dollars 9.4bn) in the three months, with
passenger vehicles contributing DM9.5bn.
Sales for the full year were likely to rise 7 per cent to exceed DM69bn, and
the company was now confident of returning a positive result for 1994.
Losses in 1993 totalled DM1.2bn.
Claiming that Mercedes' performance was running counter to the continuing
down-trend in the rest of the car industry, Mr Werner said that even the
loss-making commercial vehicles business was gaining market share in some
sectors.
Car registrations in Germany had risen 41 per cent to 67,300 in the three
months ended March, pushing up market share 2.2 points to 8.2 per cent. Full
year registrations were expected to top 200,000.
Elsewhere in western Europe numbers rose 46 per cent to 45,000 vehicles.
Japan and the US showed increases of more than 30 per cent, he added.
Mr Werner said factory capacity utilisation had been stepped up to 70 per
cent from 65 per cent last year, and boasted that the gap between Mercedes'
and Japanese manufacturers' productivity was closing rapidly. The so-called
'productivity gap' of 35 per cent in 1992, would be down to 15 per cent by
the end of this year.
The company expected to boost 1994 car sales to more than 570,000 units
after 508,000 last year and planned to be making 850,000 in 1998, Mr Werner
said.
Meanwhile, the truck, van and bus business was still 'somewhat strained' by
large numbers of relatively new vehicles taken off the road and mothballed
by their owners during the recession.
However, while the German van market fell 7 per cent in the first quarter,
Mercedes registrations in this sector dropped only 1 per cent, Mr Werner
said. Sales in other west European countries rose 4 per cent while the
overall market fell 10 per cent.
Foreign heavy truck operations, notably Freightliner in the US and Mercedes
of Brazil, increased output 17 per cent to 26,500 units.
Mercedes' commercial vehicle operations are undergoing restructuring, and
are not expected to break even until next year.
Mr Werner confirmed a further 8,000 jobs were to be cut this year followed
by 4,000 next year.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: GE, Skoda in power co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric of the US and Skoda, the Czech Republic's leading
industrial company, have announced a 10-year agreement of 'co-operation and
strategic association' in power generation projects.
The deal, signed at Plzen, is a coup for GE, which has negotiated the
agreement in the past few weeks in spite of long, intermittent talks between
the Czech company and Siemens of Germany.
Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems Europe, said Skoda
would be supplying mainly steam turbine components to GE.
The US company expects to place about Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m (Pounds
3.35m-Pounds 6.7m) in orders with Skoda in the next two years, with
commitments expected to increase after that.
GE will supply gas turbines and combined-cycle engineering for
Skoda-designed power plants in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the
Middle East and Vietnam.
Both companies have also agreed to explore opportunities for co-operation in
individual power plant construction projects elsewhere.
Skoda has been wooed by westerners since the opening of the old Comecon in
the early 1990s. GE had also talked with the company at that stage, said Mr
Pressman. Skoda reached agreement in principle on a broad co-operation in
power with Siemens in 1991.
Talks on a final agreement ended in November 1992 but they were resumed in
March last year, focussing only on turbine manufacturing.
A preliminary contract by Siemens and Skoda was signed in July but final
agreement has not been reached. Siemens said yesterday that talks continued,
but the implications of the GE deal remained to be seen.
Western companies have been keen to marry their strengths in gas turbines to
Skoda's expertise in steam turbines.
Skoda's low-cost manufacturing base has also been attractive.

FT  27 APR 94 / Dhaka business halted by strike: Bangladeshi PM under
pressure

<TEXT>
Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, was brought to a halt yesterday by the
second general strike in a month called by opposition parties in an effort
to put pressure on the government of Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister.
The parties are calling for an early general election under a caretaker
government well before Mrs Zia's term expires in 1996. They want to take
advantage of what they see as waning support for the ruling Bangladesh
National party, which fared badly in municipal elections last month in Dhaka
and Chittagong, the second city.
Mrs Zia, widow of the murdered former president, General Zia ur Rahman,
shows no sign of acceding to demands of the opposition - the Awami League,
headed by Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujib ur Rahman, Bangladesh's
independence leader, and the Jatiya party of the former president and
military dictator, General Hossain Ershad, who was overthrown in 1990 and is
now in jail on corruption charges.
Diplomats say much Bangladeshi politics consists of feuds between Mrs Zia,
Sheikh Hasina and Gen Ershad's followers in which policy differences are
unimportant.
Nevertheless, the recent council elections showed some voter opposition to
Mrs Zia's economic policies - especially a World Bank-endorsed
liberalisation programme which includes plans for cuts in state-owned
industries.
Opposition parties claim that, because the government was defeated in the
council polls, the Bangladesh National party will try to rig the general
election. They argue that the fact that the 1990 poll won by Mrs Zia was
fought under a caretaker government is a useful precedent. A senior aide of
Sheikh Hasina argues that caretaker governments are a good way of ensuring
fairness and stability in a young democracy.
Businessmen fear that the strikes are already disrupting trade and
undermining efforts to promote the country among foreign investors. While
Bangladesh receives large amounts of foreign aid - commitments of about
Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.5bn) a year - it gets very little private
investment.
Mr Mahbub Jamil, president of the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, says: 'We are still concerned about basic things such as law and
order and government stability, so how can we hope to attract investment?'
Unfortunately for the government, the recent spate of unrest has coincided
with two events which might have generated positive international publicity
 -Mrs Zia's economic mission to Japan, the largest aid donor, in late March,
and the laying of the foundation stone in early April for a Dollars 700m
bridge across the Jamuna river in central Bangladesh, the country's largest
ever investment.

Premier Li Peng of China experienced the first open protest of his tour of
Central Asia yesterday, when activists in Kazakhstan attacked China's
nuclear tests near the region's border, Reuter reports from Alma Ata.
Earlier, Mr Li had signed an historic accord delineating the 1,700km border
between China and Kazakhstan. He also granted the former Soviet republic a
Yn50m (Dollars 5.75m) credit.
In another development, a Chinese spokesman said that Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev had agreed to curb the activities of groups in
Kazakhstan working for the independence for China's north-western Xinjiang
region.
About 150 anti-nuclear activists voted to send an open letter to Mr Li
saying nuclear tests since 1963 in Xinjiang had 'tortured' the earth and
were affecting people in Kazakhstan. Xinjiang's Lop Nur, where the last
nuclear blast was in 1993, is a few hundred kilometres from the Kazakh
border.

<TEXT>
The discovery of fresh evidence and the investigation of new suspects in the
long-running Volkswagen/General Motors industrial espionage case are
expected to be announced by German state prosecutors today. Mr Volkmar
Kallenbach, spokesman for Darmstadt criminal investigators, said today's
report on the case would deal with 'new findings' and the scope of the
investigation. However, Mr Kallenbach yesterday denied reports that Mr Jose
Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's production director, would soon face
charges. Furthermore, he would neither confirm nor deny German media reports
that plans for a revolutionary new VW car factory had been found to be
virtually identical to a similar secret project on which Mr Lopez worked
while at GM.
The probe which started last spring into allegations that Mr Lopez and three
former colleagues from the US group took industrial secrets with them when
they abruptly joined VW last March is still far from complete and legal
experts said today's statement was unlikely to contain many details since
the prosecutors had to be careful to avoid prejudice in the event of future
charges and trial.

FT  27 APR 94 / EMI chief drops call for narrow currency bands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute,
yesterday told the European Parliament he had changed his mind about the
need to revive the exchange rate mechanism's narrow fluctuation bands.
Currency stability was the fundamental objective, he said.
Mr Lamfalussy's remarks on the future of the ERM reflect a new consensus
among central bankers, the European Commission and the Bundesbank that the
15 per cent fluctuation bands - introduced as a crisis measure last August -
have helped not only to deter speculators but to reinforce currency
stability.
The EMI president said he favoured keeping the wide bands for as long as
possible. 'A forced return (to the old ERM) which fails would be the worst
possible outcome.'
The unexpected success of the crisis measures still leaves ministers with a
dilemma: how to reconcile the 15 per cent bands with the Maastricht treaty's
provision that a currency must be a member of the 'normal' ERM bands for at
least two years in order to qualify to join a future single European
currency.
Mr Lamfalussy suggested that ministers would probably decide by the end of
the year whether to describe 15 per cent as normal. This would keep alive
hopes of moving to a single currency by the first target date of January 1
1997. 'With wide bands, 1997 becomes more feasible,' he said.
But in his testimony to the parliament's monetary affairs committee, Mr
Lamfalussy spelt out formidable technical obstacles to European Monetary
Union. These included planning for a single monetary policy; harmonising
accounting rules and practices among national central banks; creating a
proper statistical base; the printing and issuing of a European banknote;
and a payments systems in the final stage of Emu.
Mr Lamfalussy expressed cautious optimism about exchange rate stability,
tempered by a warning to member states to reduce their budget deficits which
reached a record high last year.
Failure to do so risked an increase in long-term rates which could choke off
the incipient recovery in Europe.

FT  27 APR 94 / Councils attack EU funds plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities across England have banded together to contest government
plans to administer Pounds 1.19bn of European Union structural funds through
a new chain of regional offices controlled by a cabinet committee.
The local authorities fear that government policy flies in the face of
subsidiarity - the EU principle of taking decisions at the lowest possible
level.
They are worried that the commission in Brussels will delay the money
because the government's plans for spending it are not sufficiently
detailed. Their protests could lead to a new round of disputes between
Brussels and London over the funds used to help European regions arrest
economic and industrial decline.
'There is a broad structural issue of where the power of decision-making
should lie,' said Mr Mike Tappin, chairman of the West Midlands Regional
Forum of Local Authorities.
The commission has already criticised the government over structural funds
for the poorest areas that have Objective One status. Last month it rejected
the government programme for Merseyside, drawing attention to lack of local
authority input and the small involvement of the private sector.
The local authorities fear a repetition with Objective Two funds for
industrial and urban areas such as the West Midlands and East London.
Since 1988, these development programmes have been arranged and administered
locally. But West Midlands Forum officials said Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, no longer sees the need for a large number of
committees with influence over the management of structural funds.
'The regional offices will co-ordinate local authorities, the trade and
industry department said yesterday. 'We don't think that this will delay
funds - it will cut out bureaucracy.'
Mr Tappin said he had written to Mr Bruce Millan, the European commissioner
for regional affairs, expressing the anger of the local authorities. Nine
areas would be affected in 1994-96 by the decision to administer the
Objective Two funds through regional offices. The West Midlands will receive
Pounds 287m, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire Pounds 255m,
Yorkshire and Humberside Pounds 243m, north-east England Pounds 239m, East
Midlands Pounds 62m, East London and Lee Valley Pounds 57m, Plymouth Pounds
22m, West Cumbria and Furness Pounds 19m and Thanet Pounds 11m.
The government has applied for Pounds 381m of European Union structural
funds for the development of six rural areas in England. The funds come from
the European Regional Development Fund.
The six regions are: East Anglia (Pounds 46m over five years), south-west
(Pounds 170m), Northern Uplands (Pounds 84m), the Marches (Pounds 31m),
Lincolnshire (Pounds 41m), and Midlands Uplands - Derbyshire/Staffordshire
(Pounds 9m).

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (13): A tool for altering
risk profile - A look at the growing acceptance of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension funds - or, more precisely, their trustees - are gradually yielding
to years of lobbying by bankers on the attractions of derivatives. While
trustees continue to exercise caution, there is a growing acceptance that
derivatives now constitute one of the day-to-day management tools needed by
fund managers. The most common use of derivatives is for asset allocation
purposes.
'Asset allocation is normally the first stage,' says Mr Tony Whalley,
investment director at Scottish Widows. 'It is easy to understand and most
people can see the benefits. Very few trustees will turn around and refuse
permission to use derivatives for this purpose.'
As fund managers have become more sharply focused on picking the right
market, rather than picking the right stock, the importance of efficient
asset allocation has increased. For example, if a fund manager has a heavy
weighting in UK stocks, but decides there are better opportunities in the US
market, he can shift his exposure immediately by using stock index futures.
In contrast, liquidating a portfolio of actual stocks and selecting new
stocks can be a time-consuming and expensive process.
Futures can also be used effectively by fund managers when they are
expecting a large inflow of cash. They can use futures to take advantage of
an immediate market opportunity, ahead of the cash inflow. Fresh impetus was
given to the use of derivatives by pension fund managers in the UK by the
clarification of the tax position in the 1990 Finance Act.
A year later, the Securities and Investments Board produced rules on
''efficient portfolio management'', outlining when the use of futures and
options was an acceptable practice.
Perhaps the most important boost for derivatives came from the publication
two years ago of guidelines on performance measurement developed by the
London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (LIFFE). These
guidelines, in suggesting how to report derivatives trades so that trustees
could more easily assess how and why derivatives were being used, greatly
increased the level of comfort among trustees. The fact that these standards
were approved by the National Association of Pension Funds gave further
weight to the argument.
However, most trustees keep a tight rein over the use of derivatives by
imposing a limit of 5-10 per cent on the proportion of the fund which can be
invested in derivatives at any given time.
'You really have to talk through the reasons for using derivatives with
trustees,' said one specialist. 'If they say they are not happy with 5 per
cent (as a limit), we say what about 2 1/2 per cent.'
However, there are some within the pension fund industry who believe that
the industry's own performance measurement criteria are inappropriate, and
that this is restricting greater use of derivatives.
'Pension fund managers tend to think that if the market is down 10 per cent
and they are only down 8 per cent they have done well,' argues one
derivatives expert. 'There is too much incentive to become a median
performer, and too little to show a bit of flair.'
Certainly, while anyone with money in a pension fund is probably mainly
interested in absolute performance, pension fund managers do often seem
obsessed with relative performance. This is the result of the way they are
assessed - most are measured against indices, and also against competitors.
The potential growth in derivatives' use by pension funds remains
substantial, both in the UK and elsewhere. In the UK, for example, most fund
managers do not tend to hedge their foreign currency exposure.
Since the amount of pension fund assets in the UK totals more than Pounds
400bn, and the typical asset allocation is around 25 per cent in overseas
equities and 5 per cent in overseas bonds, it can be assumed that there is
significant exposure to foreign currency risk.
But the fact is that many fund managers are doing very little about their
currency exposure, arguing in some cases that they are not clever enough to
separate the currency component from, say, a US equity investment.
However, because most managers do not hedge foreign exchange risk, to do so
can be perceived as risky. 'For a UK pension fund manager to hedge currency
risk is to take a huge bet against a performance benchmark, since that is
usually unhedged,' explains Mr Patrick Lee of pension fund consultants R
Watson &amp; Sons.
US fund managers, who usually have a smaller proportion of their assets
overseas, nevertheless tend to be more concerned about currency risk and are
more likely to hedge.
More US fund managers are starting to use currency overlay programmes, to
separate their bond and stock exposure from currency exposure. The idea is
that good value in a bond or stock market does not necessarily mean good
value in its currency. An overlay strategy can be used to separate these
decisions.
Despite some nasty experiences in the first quarter of 1994, when financial
markets around the world slid rapidly, the broad trend is for fund managers
around the world to continue to diversify their investments. As a result,
the need to use derivatives for asset allocation and for hedging is set to
increase substantially, as more managers and trustees grasp their
complexities, and put in place the necessary systems to use these financial
instruments.
But trustees are right to be cautious. They have only to look at some of the
disaster stories at companies - most recently Procter &amp; Gamble's loss of
Dollars 100m after tax on swap positions in the first quarter - to see what
can go wrong.
'At the end of the day, derivatives are ostensibly a tool for altering risk
profile. They do not change the basic rule that if you get it right you make
money, and if you get it wrong you lose, they merely alter the amounts
involved, and certainly don't provide a free lunch or conjure up an extra 2
per cent in performance,' warns Mr Whalley of Scottish Widows, 'Their main
benefit lies in the additional flexibility they afford the fund manager.'

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (14): Helping to oil the
market's wheels - Stock lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock lending has seemingly become inextricably linked with the antics of Mr
Robert Maxwell. The press magnate's infamous habit of borrowing stock from
one part of his empire to prop up loans in another has brought the concept
into disrepute in many minds.
But as respectable fund mangers never tire of pointing out, Mr Maxwell was
not involved in stock lending or borrowing so much as stock stealing.
There is general agreement that the legitimate practice of stock lending -
whereby big fund managers lend bonds or equities to brokers for a few days
or weeks to cover short positions - is highly desirable. It helps oil the
market's wheels by making it easier for brokers to buy and sell stocks. 'It
is ultimately in our interests and those of our clients to have a liquid
market. That is why we lend our stocks,' says Mr Michael Robarts, director
of Fleming Investment Management.
London has become the centre of lending for many European and far east
stocks while New York controls the US market. The UK market is regulated by
the Bank of England, which has drawn up a code of guidance for those wanting
to borrow and lend, and the Inland Revenue, which must give prior approval
to all participants. It also keeps a close eye on who lends what to whom to
ensure it takes its slice of the profits in tax.
Mr Richard Weir, director-general of the Institutional Fund Managers'
Association, says: 'The Bank of England, together with the Inland Revenue,
has done a fantastic job in establishing a regulatory scheme for stock
lending. And if that scheme is applied as it must be then the procedures are
wholly safe.'
The big institutional owners of stocks are normally quite willing for their
fund managers to lend stock so long as the trustees are kept informed and
are assured of the quality of the collateral against which it is lent.
Investment trusts, for example, are often knowledgeable and happy
participants. Unit trusts are normally less so because of potential problems
of redemption. In many cases, the commission earned for lending the stock
helps offset the administration fees of running the fund.
But there is a developing trend among big institutional funds to lend their
stocks directly to brokers themselves rather than conducting it through
their custodians. CIN Management, the British Gas pension fund and PosTel
are all active in lending stocks direct.
Mr Peter Harris, of the marketable securities division of CIN, which owns
more than Pounds 8bn of UK securities and Pounds 4bn of international
assets, says: 'We started lending UK securities in the 1970s and when we
started to build up our international portfolio it seemed natural to lend
that too. We had been approached by our custodian to lend our stock but they
were offering to take 50 per cent of our revenue. We knew the people we were
lending to and thought there was no reason why we should not do it
ourselves.
'We work on a percentage fee basis but it can be highly variable. In the UK
it is anything from  1/4 per cent to up to 1 per cent of the value of the
stock lent. But on the international side it can be as low as  1/4 per cent
up to a maximum of 2 1/2 per cent,' he says.
Others attest that the UK stock lending market has become highly competitive
deterring many fund managers. Mr Robarts, of Fleming, says: 'Because
institutional investors in the UK are so dominant there is an excess supply
of UK equities so rates of lending are very low. It is a borrowers' market
and they can be choosy about what they offer as collateral. There are more
lucrative opportunities to make a turn in lending out the stock of rarer
European companies.' More than 90 per cent of the stocks that FIM lends are
overseas securities.
But the balance of power may swing back towards the lender in the UK because
of the proposed changes to the settlement systems. The reduction in the
settlement period from 10 days to five and the eventual introduction of the
Crest trading system should ensure stock lending becomes ever more important
to ensure adequate liquidity. There are fears that otherwise stock will be
immobilised with the registrars and there could be some panic in the market.
Some fund managers, however, do not participate in the UK market because of
the nature of the collateral offered. Receiving cash as collateral can
create problems because lenders are taxed on the interest earned. Bank
guarantees or highly rated bonds provide a more acceptable alternative. But
it is becoming more common in the UK to offer equities in the form of
short-term Talisman certificates (STCs). Some fund managers worry that such
collateral is inherently risky. Any lurch in the stock market could
seriously undermine the security of that collateral resulting in equities
being sold at uncertain prices to replace existing stock.
For that reason, Mr John Lambert, operations director at Schroders
Investment Management, advises his clients not to lend stock in the UK.
'Stock lending with bad collateral is not worth the hassle for people like
me. I would rather refuse a deal based on the wrong collateral than create
extra risks for my clients.
'I have always had problems with short-term Talisman certificates as
collateral because of their poor visibility. You cannot see the value of the
stock behind them,' he says. The broader worry is that if many others think
the same then liquidity will suffer.
Some large fund institutional investors, notably the insurance companies
such as Norwich Union and the Prudential, are happy to accept STCs. But
other institutional investors argue it is easier for insurance companies to
justify risk to distant policy-holders than it is for fund managers to do so
to immediate clients. Some insurance companies privately share the concerns
over the quality of collateral and suggest the Bank of England should
tighten up their guidelines.
But other insurance companies defend their actions by suggesting the risk is
only theoretical. 'I am not aware there has ever been a default in the stock
lending market,' says one manager. But, the doubters argue, that does not
mean there will never be one.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (11): Pace of investment
quickens - Fund managers are taking a far more serious interest in emerging
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many years ago, many pension fund managers regarded Mexico as a good
place for hats but certainly not as a serious investment prospect. Political
uncertainties, custodian and settlement problems and the lack of trading
liquidity associated with so-called emerging markets far outweighed brokers'
claims of the huge returns which could be made.
Yet the outstanding performance of emerging markets since the late 1980s and
the strong investment cult that has grown up have prompted a growing number
of pension fund managers to take a far more serious interest in these
fast-developing economies in Latin America and the Pacific Basin.
Ex-communist bloc countries in central and eastern Europe which are now
pursuing free market economics are also attracting their attention.
Mr Peter Jeffreys, managing director of Fund Research in London, says that
UK pension funds have been fairly slow to accept emerging markets as a
separate asset class, mainly because of the lack of liquidity. However, the
growing number of dedicated emerging market funds appears to have helped to
reduce their concerns.
He notes that the scale of institutional investment in emerging markets is
still very small. He estimates that just under 1 per cent of institutional
equity assets are in emerging markets which in turn account for around 6 1/2
per cent of the world's stock market capitalisation. 'There clearly is
massive scope for more of this kind of investment,' he says.
For the pension funds which invested in emerging markets before they became
fashionable, the rewards have been large. According to Lipper Analytical,
closed-end global equity funds in emerging markets made total net asset
value (NAV) returns in dollars of 382.6 per cent over five years to the end
of 1993. This compared with total NAV returns of 74.6 per cent in developed
markets.
Dutch pension funds have been among the first to spot the opportunities in
emerging markets, which, according to the World Bank, account for 80 per
cent of the world's population and 15 per cent of the world's economy.
Pensioenfonds PGGM, the second largest pension fund in Europe and the
largest private pension fund in the Netherlands, started investing in
emerging markets in 1986 and now has 5 per cent of its Fl 15bn (Dollars
7.8bn) equity assets in these markets. Mr Marinus Keyzer, PGGM's chief
economist, says that this percentage is expected to rise to 7 1/2 per cent
of the fund's equity assets in the near term.
Mr Keyzer gives both professional and altruistic reasons for PGGM's decision
to invest in these markets. First, he points to what he calls the
'demographic time bomb' in western Europe where the population is getting
older and the birth rate is declining. 'It is the opposite in emerging
markets, where the population is much younger,' Mr Keyzer says.
The demographic advantage of emerging markets is strengthened by their
fast-developing economies where the growth rates far exceed those in OECD
countries. 'We are investing in new and dynamic companies which will become
market leaders in those countries,' says Mr Keyzer.
He adds that as a pension fund, PGGM has a responsibility to make a social
investment in these countries and by investing in their stock markets, it is
contributing to the growth of their economies and the formation of their
capital markets.
Although PGGM takes the strategic investment decisions in-house, it uses
outside managers to manage its holdings. Of its investment of Fl 750m, Fl
600m is held in a growth fund established by the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), the private-sector arm of the World Bank, but managed by
Los Angeles-based Capital international.
The growing number of pension funds which have investments in emerging
markets also tend to use outside managers rather than invest directly in
these markets though there appears to be a trend towards building up
in-house expertise.
Postel Investment Management, for example, has been involved in emerging
markets for some years but until the arrival of Mr Allan Conway as head of
overseas equities in September 1992, the investments were handled by the Far
Eastern and US investment managers. 'The smaller markets tended to become a
side issue and therefore were neglected,' Mr Conway says. 'Also, the
investment minds are different. Somebody used to covering the US or Japan
has a different approach to someone looking at Indonesia or Peru.'
Postel now regards emerging markets as a separate asset class and has set up
a centralised team of investment managers to assess global emerging markets.
'This front-line decision has enabled us to significantly increase our
exposure,' Mr Conway says.
Postel has about 2 per cent of total assets of Pounds 28bn in emerging
markets, and Mr Conway expects this proportion to grow over the years. 'But
I'm not sure we will get to 30 per cent,' he says, referring to the level
which some modern portfolio theorists put forward as the optimum for
achieving minimum risk and maximum return in a diversified equity portfolio.
By contrast, some pension fund managers are unwilling to pay the premium
which is now inherent in emerging markets. Mr John Hemingway,
deputy-chairman of PDFM's investment committee, is distinctly unenthusiastic
about emerging markets at present. 'We are value investors and we don't like
overpaying for assets,' he says.
PDFM has virtually no exposure to emerging markets, apart from Hungary.
'Many investors say these markets won't go below the average world
price/earnings rating but we are not convinced by that,' he says.
For example, PDFM invested heavily in Hong Kong after the Tiananmen Square
massacre. 'Hong Kong was then on a p/e of eight and had eight years to run
before the handover to China,' says Mr Hemingway. PDFM sold out last year
when the market's p/e hit the high teens and there were just three years
left before the colony was returned to China.
Mr Hemingway, describing his investment approach as that of a vulture rather
than an eagle, points to various markets which have fallen out of favour due
to political or economic woes, such as Mexico or Turkey, which might become
interesting in the coming months. 'We look to buy at a discount to the
average world market rating in order to compensate for the political risk,'
he says.
Mr Hemingway adds that some clients have asked for explanations why PDFM has
not participated in the cult of the emerging market. He says they have
accepted his reasons against a background in which the fund has performed
well for them. 'An outperformance of 1 or 2 per cent on 50 per cent of the
fund's assets is better than a 10 per cent outperformance on 0.5 per cent of
the assets,' he says.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (12): The focus shifts to
boardroom pay - Corporate governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Cadbury Committee report on corporate governance was completed some
18 months ago the main public focus was on the issue of splitting the role
of chairman and chief executive to provide a proper system of checks and
balances in the boardroom.
With memories of the Maxwell scandal still strong, there was a preoccupation
with the need to prevent companies falling under the control of powerful
individuals who might abuse their position. Since then the number of
companies who combine the two roles has diminished. Barclays Bank, for
example, appointed Martin Taylor as its new chief executive last year. The
focus of debate has moved on to boardroom pay.
Part of the reason is the apparent sharp increase in directors' remuneration
at a time when wages are being restrained and shop floor jobs cut. Probably
more significant is the way some companies have paid large sums to directors
whose performance has fallen short.
Concern has focused on the Pounds 2.2m pay-off to Chris Greentree following
his departure as chief executive of Lasmo, the oil company. Other examples
include the large options and bonus package promised to Robert Montague,
founder of the troubled Tiphook container concern, to compensate him for a
cut in salary to Pounds 200,000 from Pounds 816,000. Though the fortunes of
British Aerospace turned round while he was chairman, John Cahill aroused
controversy as a result of the multi-million pound package he received on
his departure.
A large payment to Mr Cahill was inevitable given that he was leaving in the
middle of a five-year contract. Much of the apparent inequity of such
payments stems from the contracts which directors secured at the time of
their appointment.
'We're going to be seeing for some time the consequences of contracts that
were entered into in the 1980s. There are going to be very few of these
contracts in the 1990s,' says Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of
Postel.
Mr Ross Goobey last year launched a campaign to put an end to three-year
rolling contracts, which are not outlawed by the Cadbury report but which
make it hard to dislodge poorly-performing directors without large
compensatory payments. Since then, he says, there has been a definite trend
for the length of contracts to be reduced and for more discipline on
payments in lieu of notice.
Another reason for the concern about boardroom pay is that many options
schemes first launched in 1984 are coming up for renewal this year. This has
opened up a broad debate about how such schemes should be constructed.
M&amp;G Group, the UK's largest independent unit trust company, faced protests
over its new scheme which will allow executives to buy share options at
current market prices and exercise them after three years, providing the
share price rises. The move contravened recommendations from the National
Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) and the Association of British Insurers
who want to limit executives' freedom to benefit from options unless the
company has genuinely improved its performance.
Agreeing that something needs to be done, though, is one thing. Deciding on
an appropriate solution is another.
Institutions do not want to intervene too directly. 'Unless something's
egregious, the business of managing a company should be left to the
management,' says Mr Geoff Lindey of JP Morgan Investment Management and
vice-chairman of the NAPF investment committee. The structure of
remunerations schemes should, however, be within a given template, he says.
Similarly, Mr Ross Goobey believes it is not up to institutions to comment
about the absolute level of remuneration. 'But we do expect it not to be at
the expense of shareholders.'
There are several obstacles to a satisfactory solution. One is that board
remuneration committees tend to be made up of non-executive directors who
are also executives of other companies. The suspicion is that many are
unlikely to recommend anything that may come back to haunt them in their
main occupation. Some fund managers are also afraid to be too vociferous for
fear they may lose business or that they will end up showing remuneration
packages received by their own boards in a bad light.
Another problem is that institutions simply do not have the time to
scrutinise every single board contract. Directors' pay is increasingly in
the hands of consultants who are able to advise on how a particular package
compares with others in the industry. This process, however, can easily lead
to a system in which directors are paid a 'going-rate' which is itself
ratcheted continuously higher as pay packages leap-frog each other.
Institutions stress that the idea is not necessarily to limit the absolute
amount of remuneration. Where a board is delivering value to shareholders,
even the highest packages may be worth paying. The problem is to ensure that
bad performance is not rewarded in the process. A future revision of Cadbury
may have to address this point.
The right approach, many fund managers believe, is not necessarily to set
rigid rules on remunerations packages. The right approach may vary from
company to company, but Cadbury could have gone further in making disclosure
requirements which, for example, might make it harder for companies to
secure a higher pension for directors by paying them a large salary increase
in their final year.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (10): Cost the deciding
factor - Custody of stock and bond certificates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The finance director of a small textiles firm based in the north of England
recently surprised an independent consultant appointed to advise his pension
scheme. Asked about the scheme's arrangements for the custody of its stocks
and bonds, the finance director opened the door to the safe in his office.
There, on a shelf, were the share certificates belonging, ostensibly, to
scheme members.
'I suggested to him that this was not considered best practice in the
industry and he said 'Are you questioning my integrity?',' the consultant
recalled, no doubt mindful of the more conventional approach under which
securities are sent for safe-keeping to banks.
At the other end of the spectrum, lies a group of banks which has built
significant businesses acting as master 'global custodians' for the assets
of some of the UK's biggest pension funds. In the aftermath of the Maxwell
affair, in which Pounds 440m disappeared from pension schemes controlled by
Robert Maxwell, the group has sought rules requiring appointment of a
custodian separate from the fund manager.
It is alleged that hundreds of millions of pounds were spirited out of the
pension schemes because the fund managers also acted as custodians to the
scheme and handed over stock and bond certificates on the instructions of Mr
Maxwell.
The Goode Committee was asked to consider at some length whether pension
schemes should in fact be required to appoint a custodian independent of the
fund manager. Lobbying hard on the other side of the issue was a
well-organised group of leading fund managers all of which provide custody
services for their clients.
In the end, the Goode Committee stopped well short of recommending the
appointment of an independent custodian. The report goes to great lengths to
explain the group's thinking. 'The question we have to consider is whether
the additional protection which would be given by the appointment of an
independent custodian so outweighs the expense and possible administrative
problems that it should be made compulsory,' the report said. In a footnote,
the report referred to recent studies by the National Association of Pension
Funds and management consultants Booz Allen and Hamilton showing that
because of the charging structure of custodians, clients may be unaware of
exactly how much they are paying for the service.
'We are not satisfied that use of a custodian would necessarily prove a
significant obstacle to a determined wrongdoer unless custodians were to be
required to assume a considerably more active monitoring role than they now
perform,' the report said.
Instead, 'trustees should periodically review their custody arrangements and
satisfy themselves that these are satisfactory,' the report said.
Meanwhile, regulators have rejected the idea of tighter oversight of
custodians generally. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulatory watchdog, has considered whether it ought to regulate custodians
directly and concluded that, for now, it should not.
In the US, however, the 1974 Erisa legislation, setting out the rules under
which pension schemes are to be administered, specifically requires
independent custodians. Moreover, custodians are required to refuse to
honour any instructions which they have reason to believe are not in the
best interests of members.
Supporters of similar rules in the UK note that a theft on the scale of Mr
Maxwell's did not occur on the other side of the Atlantic.
However, there may be more to the Erisa legislation than simple recognition
that independent custodians offer greater safety. Unlike the UK, fund
managers operating around the time of the Erisa legislation typically were
unable to offer custody services. That had been left up to the largest US
commercial banks which had once been the chief providers of pension fund
management services but were no longer.
In effect, the Erisa legislation simply codified what was effectively best
practice already in the US, just as the Goode Committee suggests codifying
what is best practice in Britain. However, it may be market forces rather
than the effect of any legislation which forces changes in UK pension funds'
choice of custodian.
Mr Bruce Pullman, a director at Quantec, a consulting firm specialising in
advice on quantitative fund management, notes that the increased use of
'specialist' fund managers will force pension funds to seek independent
custodians. 'In the US, General Motors has about 40 fund managers for its
pension scheme. The thought of having 40 different custodians is absurd.'
Moreover, there is evidence that pension fund trustees, partly with the
guidance of their consultants, are taking a much harder look at costs.
Officially, most of the UK's larger fund managers say they do not charge
separately for custody services and a client who places the custody of his
funds with an independent firm will receive no reduction in charges.
Mr Gordon Lindsey, head of custody services at SG Warburg which owns 75 per
cent of Mercury Asset Management, said that the company uses a single data
base for its fund management operations and custodial activities. If it were
required to send instructions to an independent custodian, MAM would
actually incur greater costs and it would have to charge the client
accordingly.
However, many clients now realise that in addition to the headline fee
charged, custodians are often earning a turn off their portfolio in foreign
exchange, treasury management and stock lending. Increasingly, they are
calculating the all-in cost of their custody service and seeking to
'unbundle'.
'Unbundling is a trend driven by best practice,' said Mr Robert Binney,
business executive at Chase Manhattan's global securities services division.
Larger clients, he said, are now seeking competitive pricing from custodians
for all of these services, something that pension schemes relying on their
fund manager's custodian simply cannot do.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (9): Maturity requires
lower risks - Asset-liability studies: balance becomes more critical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading investment managers say that some 60 per cent of UK pension funds
are still setting peer group-related performance targets, such as beating
the median fund or staying in the second quartile of funds.
But trustees are becoming aware that, as their schemes become more mature,
it is increasingly less likely that an average or consensus strategy will be
entirely appropriate for their particular circumstances.
Last year, an industry-wide survey by the fund managers PDFM showed that 34
per cent of funds were being significantly influenced by asset-liability
modelling in setting their portfolio structure - up from 20 per cent in
1991.
Moreover the Goode committee's recommendation of a minimum solvency
standard, which is likely to be taken up and developed in a forthcoming
pensions white paper, with legislation to follow in 1995, has triggered a
furious debate within professional actuarial circles.
R. Watson, a leading firm of consulting actuaries, said last week that half
of its client schemes worth Pounds 100m or more would have failed to meet
the Goode 100 per cent standard in March 1993. At the most recent major
stock market trough in September 1990 two-thirds would have been below even
the critical 90 per cent level.
Mr Andrew Wilson, a Watson partner, says the figures illustrate 'the need
for schemes to consider increasing assets beyond the ongoing funding basis
established before the Goode Report, or change investment strategy to reduce
volatility.'
The recent decision of the British Rail pension scheme to allocate something
approaching Pounds 1bn to specialist bond portfolios is a sign of the change
of climate. Many big, well-established schemes, both in the public and
private sectors, are catering for much reduced current workforces, but still
have large numbers of pensioners - both in current payment and deferred - on
their books.
For such schemes, the liabilities to pay benefits are no longer primarily
stretched into the distant future but are bunched in the next 10 or 20
years; and indeed, in many cases there is a constant net cash outflow as
benefit payments already exceed contributions. The average NAPF member
scheme now has only 5,000 current members against 4,700 pensioners in
payment and 2,800 deferreds.
Although the biggest category of liability is therefore in respect of final
salary-linked pensions, for which an equity portfolio is generally
considered to provide an appropriate long-term match, schemes also have
large liabilities to pay current pensions and provide for deferred pensions.
These liabilities are different in nature as well as timing. Deferred
pensions, for instance, are statutorily subject to so-called limited price
indexation (LPI) - rises in line with the retail price index up to a ceiling
of 5 per cent.
As for pensions in payment, the picture is much more complex. Many schemes
raise pensions by something like 3 per cent a year, others apply the LPI
formula, and many public-sector schemes offer full indexation. Quite often
private-sector schemes raise pensions in line with prices in practice, but
do not guarantee it.
Matching these liabilities with equities, or with a standard pension fund
asset mix, is looking increasingly hazardous. The purpose of an
asset-liability study is to set out the profile of benefit payments, and
suggest an asset structure that could more safely generate the required
cash.
Last year, index-linked gilts, for instance, received Pounds 2bn of extra
investment from pension funds, according to WM, making this the most popular
asset category for new money. WM attributes this to the desire of some funds
to match liabilities more closely.
Conventional fixed-income gilts offer lower investment risk, but on the
other hand they do not provide a close match for most scheme liabilities,
except for fixed pensions. It has been argued that an LPI gilt might prove
an attractive innovation to many funds. The Goode committee itself suggested
that deferred income index-linked gilts would be a valuable introduction.
The proposal for a minimum solvency standard is critical here, and has set
the cat among the pigeons. Until now, actuaries have been able to absorb
most market price fluctuations of long-term assets within the reasonable
assumptions of their valuation basis. So long as there is no reason to
project a decline in long-term real dividend growth, for instance, a stock
market tumble can be ignored.
But this degree of flexibility is destroyed when a market value-based
solvency test is used. Already, some actuaries have become worried about the
results of the non-statutory discontinuance tests, which they apply to
schemes to check whether there would be enough to pay the current benefits
if the schemes were wound up tomorrow. The problem has arisen because of the
recent tumble in annuity rates.
Now this problem looms much larger, because of the Goode committee's
proposal to apply a statutory minimum solvency requirement. With schemes
holding a record 80 per cent in equities in their portfolios, they would be
exposed to the risk of being forced to top up their schemes after an equity
market crash.
The investment implications could be quite profound. In theory, for
instance, UK pension funds might be advised that, in due course, they should
reduce their equity exposure towards the levels seen in the US. There,
market value-based valuations are the rule, and the average equity exposure
of defined benefit schemes is only about 50 per cent.
Mr Robert Ross, of consultants Frank Russell, has argued that there would be
great risks in funds holding nearly 60 per cent of their assets in a single
asset class, UK equities, as they do now.
Alternatively, UK schemes might decide to retain a high exposure to
equities, but use portfolio insurance techniques through the derivatives
market, in order to protect them against the downside risk of a sharp fall
in share prices.
Since, in the long run, bonds, for instance, have returned 5 1/2 per cent a
year less than UK equities, a big switch to non-equity assets could force
actuaries to recommend significantly higher contribution levels. Using
derivatives would also involve a net reduction in returns.
There is a paradox here, in that weakly-funded schemes are precisely those
that need the highest returns, but in future circumstances they may be least
able to accept risks.
A vigorous debate is certain to take place on the proposed solvency laws
before they are introduced, but whatever happens consultants offering
asset/liability modelling are likely to have a busy time.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (17): Growth path may not be so smooth -
The stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong stock market, like Topsy, has growed and growed.
In the first quarter of this year 19 new companies were listed, including
Yizheng Chemical Fibre, the mainland polyester fibre maker which notched up
the third biggest share issue in the colony. These companies together raised
a total of HKDollars 4.5bn.
Today, with a capitalisation of HKDollars 2.33 trillion, the Hong Kong stock
market ranks as the world's seventh largest, just behind Canada and ahead of
Switzerland. The market has not only grown in dollars, it has developed in
terms of stature as well, underscoring its aim to secure international
recognition.
Over the past 18 months, listing rules have been overhauled to the benefit
of minority shareholders; clearing and settlement now take place on a
continuous net basis; automated order matching and execution is in place;
regulated short-selling has been given the green light; and a framework
paving the way for mainland China enterprises to be listed on the Hong Kong
stock exchange is on the statute book.
Starting with Tsingtao Brewery, China's best-known beer, seven state-owned
enterprises are now partially in the hands of Hong Kong and overseas
investors. Two more will follow in the next two months and a further 22 have
been selected for an overseas listing, all bar four of which are destined
for the Hong Kong market.
Clearly for the stock exchange - like vast majority of the companies it
regulates - China will continue to be the major focus of expansion. However,
as demonstrated by last month's release of its blueprint for development
over the years up to and through 1997, the exchange is maintaining a tight
grip on the domestic running of financial markets. On the agenda are a
greater reliance on self-vetting and disclosure, which will be improved to
meet the new demands incumbent upon it, and the development of a more active
debt market.
Equity issues made up 89 per cent of last year's turnover on the stock
market, with warrants accounting for the remainder: debt played a negligible
role. Of the USDollars 4bn of convertible securities issued in 1993, only
three were listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. 'Initiatives to
facilitate the listing and trading of more debt issues would appear to be a
top priority for the exchange,' says its March consultative paper, The Way
Forward.
A subsequent paper proposes putting greater information in the hands of
shareholders - not least directors' salaries and perks, and an end to the
practice of allowing banks to ferret away 'hidden' reserves - which will
serve to bring standards of disclosure more firmly in line with those in the
UK and elsewhere.
However, the exponential growth path mapped out in the boardrooms of the
stock exchange is unlikely to proceed as smoothly as it looks on paper.
Firstly, the volatility which has ripped into markets across the world has
triggered each-way daily swings of 3 or 4 per cent on the Hang Seng Index;
global securities houses have hacked back their Hong Kong weightings; and
the anticipated easing of property prices will rebound badly on the stock
market, reflecting companies' heavy exposure to property.
Last year, the Hang Seng Index rose 115 per cent on a tide of overseas cash
and strong corporate earnings. Securities houses vied with each other for
the most hyperbolic buy signals - culminating with Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan
Stanley's director of global strategy, who fell back on the words of LSD
guru Dr Timothy Leary to describe his elation: 'After eight days in China,
I'm tuned in, over-fed and maximum bullish' - and a new issue was deemed a
failure if it did not attract a hefty oversubscription.
The market capitalisation at the end of 1993 was, at 347 per cent of GDP,
the highest in the region. Daily turnover last year averaged HKDollars
4.9bn, up 70 per cent on the previous year, and reached a record HKDollars
17.2bn on January 7 of this year.
In 1994, however, liquidity and over-bullish statements have been more
notable by their absence. Initial public offerings, for their part, have
often performed poorly on their debut after modest take-ups. Performance for
the year to date has seen Hong Kong languish at the bottom of world league
tables, although latterly a tentative trickle of Japanese buying has helped
recoup some of the losses.
Secondly, investors are again focusing on the political and economic risks
attached to Hong Kong: power struggles, a potential hard landing for the
economy and poor trade relations in China all undermine Hong Kong ratings.
The China risk weighting on Hong Kong, especially as the sell-by date looms,
is unlikely to endear new candidates. Already two long-standing old hands -
Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic - have said they will quit the
exchange at the end of this year, thus extricating themselves from post-1997
jurisdiction under the Special Administrative Region government.
Thirdly, a small but growing band of market practitioners is unhappy at the
direction the stock exchange is taking. They regard its stance on regulatory
issues as over-zealous, and believe that on other proposals - such as the
introduction of a second board, a notion which has been quashed by the
exchange - it lacks flexibility.
These are not criticisms that stock exchange directors are likely to lose
sleep over - indeed, given the exchange's history, replete with corruption,
scandals and a jailed former chairman, such attacks must seem like praise -
but they show that the exchange will be unable to implement each and every
proposal in its latest blueprint for reform without a fight.
The exchange also faces a powerful adversary when it proposes doing away
with stamp duty, which now stands at 0.15 per cent to both the buyer and the
seller. This is a strong source of revenue for the government, but the
exchange - and members - argue that removing the duty would facilitate
technical and short-term trading strategies, so enhancing liquidity.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (16): The young ignore taboo - Life
assurance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The recent growth of Hong Kong's life insurance companies has been quiet and
unobtrusive, but this year the industry has faced the glare of publicity,
after allegations of a smear campaign and conspiracy.
National Mutual Asia, the industry's second largest company, in which
Australia's National Mutual owns a majority stake, has been at the centre of
the controversy, following the defection of its chief executive, Mr Andrew
Yang, several senior managers and some 500 of its salesmen.
The company accused the executives of 'conspiracy by combining together with
others with the intention to injure National Mutual' and has issued legal
proceedings.
Substantial damages are being claimed and National Mutual accepts that its
sales efforts have been disrupted.
Mr Yang spearheaded the company's growth in the 1980s, when it built up a
business to challenge the dominance of American International Assurance.
Labour shortages in the colony could make it difficult to replace the lost
sales force, especially at a time when competition is intensifying. Both
Chinese and overseas insurance companies view Hong Kong as a springboard for
entry into the Chinese market ahead of 1997.
In particular Top Glory, a Chinese company in which China National Cereals,
Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export, has a significant interest, took over
the business of NZI Life from the UK's General Accident in December last
year and is expected locally to build up a challenge to the existing market
leaders.
Along with AIA and National Mutual, these include ManuLife, a Canadian
company which has made expansion in south-east Asia a priority.
Each of the three dominant companies - which together control about
three-quarters of the life assurance market - have had to overcome initially
strong cultural resistance to the basic idea of life assurance.
'Traditionally, the Chinese didn't buy life assurance. There is a
deep-rooted superstitious fear of insuring against death and the extended
family has provided security for dependents,' explains Mr John Snelgrove,
general manager (employee benefits and corporate affairs) of National
Mutual.
'Traditionally, for a lot of people it was a taboo,' adds Mr Edward Lau,
agency vice president of ManuLife. However, geographical and social changes,
partially linked to Hong Kong's rapid economic growth, have led to a
cultural shift. National Mutual - and its rivals - have found the younger
generation of Hong Kong Chinese much more sympathetic to the idea of life
assurance.
It is 'gaining widespread acceptance, particularly from the younger
generation,' says Ms Janice Wallace, analyst with Goldman Sachs in Hong
Kong. Some 30 per cent of the Hong Kong population of 5.6m is in the 21-35
age group and 58 per cent under the age of 35 according to the 1991 census.
The sales forces, often in their 20s and 30s, have found it easy to sell a
relatively simple 'whole of life' policy denominated in US dollars, which
offers an element of life assurance protection, a guaranteed surrender value
and an annual cash dividend.
In a savings market where interest rates on bank deposits are negative in
real terms, the policy has offered an alternative to higher risk investments
in the property and stock markets.
'We are not judged on our investment yield, as we would be in the US or
Europe,' says Mr Snelgrove. 'People are looking for long-term guarantees.'
Additionally, fears about the political and economic future of Hong Kong
have increased the attractions of a savings vehicle which offers guaranteed
protection in hard currency, especially for the territory's socially and
geographically mobile middle classes.
The property boom has also generated some demand for life assurance.
'Chinese people like to acquire property. As soon as you do that you need
some protection against liability,' says Mr Lau.
Certainly, the evidence shows a sharp increase in life insurance sales since
1983. Premium income has risen from HKDollars 1.2bn in 1983 to HKDollars
13bn in 1992, with sales of individual policies rising from HKDollars 6.4bn
to HKDollars 8.2bn in 1992 alone, an increase of 28.2 per cent.
A total of 1,97m policies are now in force. The percentage of the population
insured has risen tenfold to about 20 per cent over the same period.
National Mutual's last annual report indicates that sales continued at a
similar pace in 1993, with premium income from individual policies rising by
24 per cent to HKDollars 2.5bn.
Industry executives believe the prospects for further growth are good. Mr
Snelgrove suggests that as younger people continue to buy whole of life and
endowment products, the generation who bought life policies in the 1980s
will buy a different range of products as they grow older, allowing the
industry to broaden its range to include annuities, for example.
Ms Wallace, of Goldman Sachs, says Hong Kong is still a relatively untapped
market. In 1991 life insurance premiums amounted to only 1 per cent of GDP
compared to 6.2 per cent in Japan and 9.3 per cent in South Korea.
'The large pool of uninsured population, much of which is experiencing rapid
gains in wealth and standards of living, is expected to provide sustainable
growth,' says Ms Wallace, in an assessment of National Mutual's prospects
which could equally apply to other big players.
Extra potential for the industry could be generated if the Hong Kong's
government adopts a compulsory pension savings scheme. Officials are
currently mulling various schemes to provide for an ageing population.
Above all, the territory's life companies have the additional attraction of
the world's largest - and as yet totally undeveloped market - just over the
border in China.
AIA is already off the mark in this respect, having acquired a licence to
trade from Shanghai in 1992. National Mutual has a representative office in
China. Mr Snelgrove says the company is particularly keen to win access to
the market of 63m people in Guangdong province.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): Property likely to be
the star - Now the froth has been blown off, the future of markets becomes
clearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant bankers and brokers were not the only ones to collect large bonuses
at the end of 1993. Fund managers also had a vintage year, with UK equities
offering returns of 27.9 per cent and UK bonds only slightly behind at 25.1
per cent.
The real star performance, however, came from overseas equities which,
assisted by currency gains, rose by 39.4 per cent. With that kind of
performance, there was plenty of Christmas cheer. Interest rates fell, bonds
boomed, mainstream equities soared and emerging markets disappeared into the
stratosphere.
Last year was one in which everything went right. Still, it did not look
quite that rosy halfway through the year: in UK equities, there was a 40 per
cent difference between the performance of the best and worst sectors in the
first six months of 1993. Correct stock selection was thus critical to
securing good performance.
It was only in the last quarter that markets really caught fire. Driven by
the last leg of the bond bull markets, equities were driven to ever lower
yields. In the UK, interest rate-sensitive equities did particularly well,
and the passion for multimedia, along with the relaxation of rules for
ownership of ITV companies, made media stocks star performers. Overseas,
emerging markets offered dramatic returns in the run up to Christmas.
After three years in which prices fell, UK property also did well: total
returns were 18.8 per cent. Again much of the rally came late in the year,
and property also suffered from the illiquid nature of the market. Many
funds were established to invest in the high returns available, but it was
difficult to get money into the market. Since property yields were higher
than gilt yields for most of the year, it was a natural investment for
anyone concerned about inflation.
Thus far at least, 1994 has been very different. UK gilts peaked right at
the end of last year, and equities topped out on February 2 after the US
Federal Reserve started to raise US interest rates. The change in policy had
been anticipated, but the psychological shock to the market was severe. Led
by Wall Street, equity markets have tumbled, with some of the best
performers in the run up to Christmas showing the sharpest falls.
To some extent the correction is a healthy reaction to markets which had
become severely overcooked. Long UK gilt yields of about 6 per cent were not
really justified by the heavy government borrowing requirement and the poor
UK inflation record.
The enthusiasm for all forms of assets, which came with continually falling
interest rates, blocked out reasoned assessment of which represented value.
A heavy inflow of private investors' money into savings bonds, unit trusts
and equities exacerbated the trend, as did the move by overseas investors
into the UK market. The notorious 'hedge funds' may not have been as active
in UK markets as legend by now tells, but they certainly helped fuel the
rise.
Now that the froth has been blown off the market - equities fell by almost
400 points and bond yields rose by almost 2 per cent - it is perhaps
possible to take a more sober view of what the rest of the year holds.
Short-term US interest rates are likely to continue to rise from the current
level around 3.75 per cent to around 5 per cent by early in 1995.
But that need not mean UK rates will have to follow slavishly. As the impact
of tax increases becomes clearer, there may still be small falls in UK
rates, and that may be supported by the continued decline of interest rates
on the continent.
Despite the concerns of many, the underlying inflation picture in the UK
remains good, and the balance of payments and public sector borrowing
deficits are not quite as horrendous as feared. It is also clear that the
chancellor wants interest rates to come down further.
Provided the inflation numbers remain comforting, that should offer some
succour to the gilts market. Yields of around 8 per cent look much more
attractive given the historical UK economic performance. While buyers may
remain nervous as the market stabilises, 8 per cent will probably start to
look like reasonable value. That confidence should help underpin the equity
market. The FT-SE 100 index seems to have found support around 3100, and
some selective buying has re-emerged. However, that selectivity will
probably remain the key to success. Cyclical recovery shares already
discount large earnings rises, but there may still be some potential for
those companies which can increase dividends above the market average.
Dividend increases in the reporting season just past were higher than
expected, and some companies are making haste slowly towards the aim of
higher dividend cover. Many utilities - notably the regional electricity
companies - still have substantial dividend cover and growth prospects. With
market dividend yields around 4 per cent and dividend growth around 5,
equities offer attractive 9 per cent returns before prices rise at all.
If the general mood in asset allocation is to be somewhat underweight in UK
bonds and selectively overweight in UK equities, there is also a strong urge
towards being overweight in property. The difficulty of getting money into
the market remains, but for anyone worried about potential inflation
problems, property yields only slightly below those of conventional gilts
look very interesting. Location is all important, but property is likely to
be a star performer in 1994.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (7): Solvency debate hots
up - The Goode report may be more radical than it seemed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fund management industry breathed a sigh of relief last September, when
the government's advisory panel on pension regulation produced only a modest
blueprint for reform.
The pension law review committee, chaired by professor Roy Goode, could well
have recommended a sweeping overhaul of pensions law so draconian that
employers en masse would have abandoned their commitment to the traditional
final-salary pension schemes.
Not only would that have left many workers bereft of retirement incomes, it
would have decimated the UK fund management industry which has grown up on
investing the assets of final salary schemes.
Instead, the Goode committee set itself the more modest goal of considering
reform which would do no more than ensure that any pension promise made in
respect of past service would be fully honoured.
The initial reaction, including that of the Confederation of British
Industry, the main UK employers' body, was overwhelmingly favourable.
The main recommendations called for a new pensions regulator; an
industry-wide compensation scheme, to cover fraud, theft or
misappropriation; a requirement that each scheme have at least one third of
its trustees appointed by the members; and a requirement that all schemes
meet minimum solvency standards. Schemes that did not meet at least 90 per
cent of the minimum standard would have three months to add cash to make up
the shortfall.
However, since then, there has been ample time for a re-think; and upon
closer examination, the Goode committee recommendations may be far more
radical than they at first appear. This is because there are employers who
make pension promises that they cannot say, with hand on heart, they will be
able to meet.
In particular, the outcry has been over the proposed minimum solvency
standard. The debate has left the actuarial profession sharply divided over
exactly what this will mean for schemes and their investment advisers.
The reasons for the outcry have to do with the way solvency is calculated. A
scheme would have to show that it had enough assets to purchase accrued
benefits for all members on a cash-equivalent basis, to be certified
annually by the scheme actuary.
However, while UK pension schemes on average hold 80 per cent of their
assets in equities, cash equivalents are calculated according to yields on
gilts, which historically have yielded less than equities. R. Watson, the
firm of consulting actuaries, warned that holding schemes to that rule would
require wholesale shifts out of equities and into bonds, forcing employers
to add cash particularly to mature schemes.
Other firms of consulting actuaries have firmly disagreed with the analysis.
At William M. Mercer, actuaries produced data showing that the average fund
would only have been required to add cash to meet minimum solvency
requirements immediately after the stock market crash of 1974, and that even
then, rises in share prices over a five-month period would have bailed out
most schemes.
In March, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, after studying the issue
for several months, recommended to the Department of Social Security some
changes in the way cash-equivalent yields are calculated, intended to
address some of these concerns. Under those proposals, scheme actuaries
would calculate cash-equivalent values for each individual member based on
age.
For the youngest members, cash-equivalent values would have a high equity
component, declining steadily as the individual neared retirement age. The
DSS has sent the proposals to the CBI and others in the industry for
comment.
It also suggested that, should the minimum solvency proposals find their way
into law, there should be a five-year phase-in period.
DSS sources have said that, of all the interest groups making
representations to government over the final form of any pension reform
bill, the CBI is the most significant. To date, the CBI has not made its
response known.
However, a CBI spokeswoman said the group was likely to say that, while it
views the proposals as a step in the right direction, 'the government should
go further'. Any effort requiring employers to add cash to schemes will
prompt the abandonment of final-salary schemes 'and that is not in anyone's
interest'.
The CBI has other objections to the Goode committee proposal on minimum
solvency. First, the three-month period given to a company to make good a
shortfall below 90 per cent solvency ought to be raised to three years;
while the three-year period which a company has to increase assets from 90
to 100 per cent of solvency ought to be increased to the average remaining
service life of the scheme.
However, the government runs the danger that, in its efforts to meet the
objections of the CBI, it may recommend a package of pension reforms which
leave a scheme members little better off than they are today.
'The report has to be seen as a single package,' warns Prof Goode. Unless
all of its elements are adopted, the others will be far less effective in
protecting pensioners and more expensive to administer than they would be
otherwise.'
Also, CBI members have yet to take on board the fact that many of them are
indeed too heavily invested in equities given their own maturity profile.
'It is the age of the scheme that dictates asset allocation and not the
minimum solvency standard,' said Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of
PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund and a member of the Goode committee.
Schemes with low cash flow from contributing members could well find that,
while equities outperform bonds over time, there may be years when slow
dividend growth does not deliver enough cash to meet liabilities. The
pensions promise would then have to be met by a cash contribution from the
employer.
Thus, even if the CBI persuades the government to further water down the
requirements for minimum solvency, employers will not have escaped their
problem.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Futures exchange shifts to new era
 -The colony is emerging as the Pacific Rim's biggest derivatives market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the end of this year the colony's Futures Exchange expects to see a
return to the volumes of business witnessed in the pre-crash era. It has
already - last October - paid off the special HKDollars 1.93bn 'lifeboat'
loan which saved it from bankruptcy in October 1987. It is making a profit.
Finally, and with a lot of hard work, it is shifting into a new era: one
where it will be defined, not by history, but by its future.
Mr Ivers Riley, who took over from Mr Gary Knight as chief executive of the
exchange on January 5 of this year, admits he timed his move to Hong Kong
perfectly. He has inherited a mechanism that is no longer vulnerable, and
can concentrate on enhancing the products offered and staking Hong Kong's
claim as the major derivatives market in the Pacific Rim.
Already traders have access to a raft of hedging tools introduced over the
past 18 months: Hang Seng Index options with 56 separate contracts for
trading, a welter of warrants which now command a total capitalisation of
HKDollars 60.6bn and - as of January - regulated short selling.
The field is heavily oriented towards equities. Daily turnover of HSI
futures last month surged through 30,928 lots - the highest post-crash level
 -in the face of massive volatility on both the cash market and the futures
market. The HSI Futures has stayed at a ratio of 2.5 to 3.5 times that of
the cash market in terms of dollars traded.
HSI options started trading in March 1993 and daily volumes a year later
were averaging around 2,255 lots. More market making power is still required
to handle liquidity: even so, in the four months since Mr Riley has been in
office the proportion of futures trade in options has risen to 13 per cent
from 10 per cent and the aim is to bring it closer to 25 per cent over the
next few months.
It is all a far cry from the disastrous handling of the 1987 crash, which
ensured the Hong Kong Futures Exchange a place in history and cost it dearly
in terms of international credibility.
Speculation in the HSI futures mounted in the 10-month run-up to the crash,
and the contract became the world's second most traded stock market future.
When the crash came, losses were huge and exacerbated by the closure of the
Hong Kong stock exchange for four days. Brokers defaulted to the tune of
HKDollars 1.8bn, but only HKDollars 22m was in the guarantee fund.
But now, with a return of confidence and liquidity - arguably two sides of
the same coin - the exchange is ready to move forward on plans for expansion
and development. As it does so, it is tapping into a major appetite for
derivative products in the region.
Mr Sunimal Goonetillake, head of derivatives marketing at Peregrine
Brokerage, attributes the demand for derivatives to the volatile nature of
the markets and the levels of foreign interest in Hong Kong and Asian
markets generally. Additionally, derivatives are being used by investors to
access markets which are otherwise semi-closed to foreigners, such as Korea,
the Philippines and India.
'Asia's markets are incredibly exciting. Most people believe there is strong
earnings potential for companies based in Asia and wherever there's an
exciting story, derivatives and the leverage they can give are attractive to
a whole host of investors, both domestic and foreign.
'In Hong Kong, all this is still true but you can double it. China is the
biggest emerging market, and Hong Kong is the way to it. Everything about
Asia applies in an extreme sense to Hong Kong,' he says.
The volatility which ripped through stocks and derivatives alike in the
early part of the year has slowed somewhat on the Futures Exchange, although
volatility on options remains high - encouraging investors to use options
contracts to hedge against losses on the stock market and in turn leading
companies to engage in index arbitrage.
Volatility is one of the biggest differences Mr Riley noted on taking up his
post in Hong Kong, after a career spent on US exchanges: 'I'm used to
implied volatility of 15-16 per cent at its highs, and here implied
volatilities are going north of 50 per cent,' he says.
Complementing futures and options, there are now some 300 warrants traded on
the Hong Kong stock exchange; this compares with 496 listed companies. A
recent flurry among securities houses saw a spate of issues earlier in the
year, mostly of blue chips.
Warrants remain highly popular with retail investors, despite soaring
premiums. Institutions, which tend to take up warrant issues for leverage or
cash extraction, gradually sell down into the hands of small investors who
view them as speculative tools and a cheaper entry into the underlying
stock.
After taking a severe battering when the market came down, warrants are
again looking expensive thanks to the retail investors' attitude of buying
for what Mr James Vinall, who handles equity derivative sales for SBC
Derivatives (Far East), calls 'pure and unadulterated speculation' with
scant regard to the technicals.
As an example, he says the Swiss Bank warrant on Hongkong Telecom was
trading at a 60 per cent premium at one stage, suggesting that the colony's
appetite for warrants owes less than it might to fundamentals.
Investment banks - especially the US houses - have been quick to take
advantage of the derivatives markets, initially on the Futures Exchange. As
of last year, many of these banks have been trading on the OTC market, too.
Mr Vinall says an early interest in indexes has now extended to OTCs on
individual stocks. This market remains the preserve of the institutions,
OTCs being private agreements between separate financial institutions.
The US and French houses - plus those banks which have staffed themselves up
with American options specialists - have tended to dominate this market to
date, largely because of the depth of their options technology. Big players
include Merrill Lynch, Salomons, Morgan Stanley, Bankers Trust, SBCI and
Credit Lyonnais.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (13): Dragon bonds in demand - The debt
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an economy which appears to have scant need of debt financing - the
government budget this year produced a HKDollars 15bn surplus and big
corporates maintain exceptionally conservative gearing levels - Hong Kong
made something of a splash on the debt markets scene last year, raising
USDollars 6.5bn in international issues, writes Louise Lucas.
These issues were largely opportunistic - money was cheap and overseas
investors were hungry for anything with an Asian flavour - but the
investment profile of Hong Kong companies means they are unlikely to prove
fairweather friends to the debt markets at home or overseas.
Investment in China, both on property development and big-ticket
infrastructure projects where earnings are slow to come in will ensure a
continued focus on debt raising, a trend underscored by the scramble among
the colony's key corporate players for credit agencies' ratings.
Last month Wharf Holdings became the first big company to receive a publicly
declared long-term debt rating, securing an implied senior rating of A from
Standard &amp; Poor's - the best possible as it matches that assigned to the
Hong Kong government. Swire Pacific is expected to follow suit shortly.
Wharf, whose interests span property, infrastructure and media, sought a
rating with an eye to future calls on the debt markets to fund expansion in
cable TV, telecommunications and China.
The stock exchange is also looking to carve a role for itself in the market.
Debt securities totalling HKDollars 191.75bn were listed on the Hong Kong
market in 1993, compared with just HKDollars 4.6bn the previous year, and a
working party is drafting plans for a more active debt market. Investment
banks such as Morgan Stanley are keen to promote a secondary market on bond
transactions.
The government, after a modest start only four years ago, plans to issue
five-year paper later this year. Its programme for exchange fund bills - the
equivalent of treasury bills - began in March 1990 with the issue of
HKDollars 300m of 91-day bills; it now issues a range of notes with maturity
terms of up to three years. The total of all bills, bonds and notes
outstanding is HKDollars 39bn.
This has helped promote a significant market for fixed rate paper
denominated in Hong Kong dollars, which last year was worth HKDollars
16.5bn. In the first 3 1/2 months of this year, issuers had already raised
some HKDollars 6bn, according to Oakreed Financial Services, a local bond
boutique.
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation, traditionally among the biggest
players on the local and foreign debt markets, earlier this month launched a
HKDollars 1.6bn revolving transferable loan facility, its biggest in five
years. The MTRC has commercial paper facilities in New York, London and
Tokyo as well as the colony, but proceeds are swapped into Hong Kong dollars
to avoid currency exposure.
Earlier this year, Hong Kong launched its first central clearing system for
locally denominated debt - the Central Moneymarkets Unit Service - and the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority secured Beijing's agreement to run exchange
fund debt programmes on a continuous basis where the repayment terms
straddle 1997.
Beyond the colony, the creation of dragon bonds - the suitably oriental name
for issues emanating from south-east Asia - has met demand among
institutional investors overseas by providing a final piece to the world's
debt jigsaw. A total USDollars 4.6bn has been raised through the instruments
since November 1991, according to Euromoney Bondware.
To Hong Kong's investment bankers the debt market represents an important
part of the corporate finance mix as well as a source of income. Peregrine
Investments, the pan-Asian corporate finance and securities house, last
month poached the fixed income team from Lehman Brothers in a bid to capture
a share of the Asian debt market.
Mr Francis Leung, the managing director, said the switch allowed Peregrine
to tap into the Lehman team's government contacts while introducing a fixed
income and distribution capability to its own customer bank. Peregrine has a
keen eye turned on the China market when it talks of the potential for debt
issuers.
'Although it's now relatively easy to raise equity for infrastructure
through a listing on the stock exchange, a lot of projects have to be
financed by debt. There is a limit to how much commercial banks can finance
these infrastructure projects, so you need to come up with a good solution,
and one is to securitise the debts.
'Though the bond market in China is not open to foreigners yet, when the
renminbi becomes fully convertible foreigners will be able to participate in
the China bond market and that may be as big as the US bond market. In
particular, China will rely more on the bond market to finance its budget
deficit, rather than print money,' says Mr Leung.
With the US Fed embarked on an era of tightening interest rates, the bond
market in Hong Kong has been hit in recent months - global concerns
exacerbated in the colony by its peg to the US dollar.
Mr Chris Nicholas, senior vice president with Lehman Brothers - the US house
which has been at the forefront of the dragon bond market - believes many
bankers are sitting with mandates to issue bonds in their desk drawers,
awaiting better times.
He says: 'We have hit a temporary pause, because there is no point in
surging ahead when you know investors are not buying.
'I see the market continuing to grow. It is a minor setback. The Eurobond
market is down, and the same is probably true for the dragon bond market.'

look at the prospects for the colony's insurers

Mr Michael Haynes, managing director of Swire Fraser Insurance Brokers, the
insurance broking arm of Swire Pacific, the low-profile British trading
company, is a familiar figure in the factories sprouting up around the
rapidly growing southern Chinese towns of Guangshou and Shenzhen.
Mr Haynes now spends at least one day a fortnight in China, fixing insurance
for local clients who are shifting their electronics, toy and watch plants
across the border to take advantage of wage rates that are less than a fifth
of those in Hong Kong.
'There is hardly a company that doesn't have a China relationship,' he
explains. 'You can even imagine the border moving back a little. Southern
China could all become like Hong Kong.'
By contrast, Mr George Miller, who headed Swire's Hong Kong brokerage
operation for more than 20 years until moving back to London in 1991, admits
that he barely ever visited the mainland. Nothing illustrates more clearly
how things have changed.
In recent years the Hong Kong market has been among the fastest growing in
the world. Overall gross non-life premium income in the territory grew by 20
to 30 per cent in 1993 to more than HKDollars 17bn, according to Mr Stephen
Ip, insurance commissioner. This followed a 26 per cent increase in 1992 to
HKDollars 14.2bn, and indicates that despite inflation of 8 to 10 per cent
over the last two years, the market is experiencing real growth of more than
10 per cent per year.
Directly or indirectly, China is the main reason. Investor interest in Hong
Kong from both China and overseas has spurred growth of the property market,
leading to plenty of work for local construction firms and a big increase in
demand for insurance covers.
The new Hong Kong airport is the biggest construction project in the world
and the contract to insure it was the subject of fierce competition. Swire,
together with Willis Corroon and Gilman Insurance Brokers, a subsidiary of
Inchcape Group, were the eventual winners of a deal which should generate
more than Dollars 200m in insurance premiums.
Premium income from property insurance for the market as a whole rose by 21
per cent in 1992, even though rebuilding costs rose at a somewhat slower
pace than property prices.
Only one overseas company, AIG of New York, is currently licensed to
underwrite in China, where it is geographically restricted to Shanghai. Yet
Hong Kong-based insurers can underwrite some mainland Chinese risks,
opportunities which have increased with seven out of 10 Hong Kong
manufacturers now based in China.
Businesses based in China can insure with overseas companies their
non-Chinese risks, such as product liability exposures which might emerge on
exports to the US. And local brokers, such as Swire, are allowed to handle
the insurance needs of Hong Kong companies operating in China.
One area of business in which interest is rising is the provision of cover
for privately financed billion dollar energy and transport projects. Nelson
Hurst, the UK insurance broker which was listed last year, has formed a
dedicated joint venture with Hopewell, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate which
has pioneered the development of the build-own-operate or
build-operate-and-transfer technique in the region.
So enticing have the prospects become that fresh capital seems certain to be
attracted to the sector. Several companies are apparently preparing to step
up commitments. Chinese-owned companies registered in Hong Kong, such as
Ming An Insurance Company (HK), have become more interested in underwriting
commercial risks business.
According to Mr Ip, Chinese companies doubled their overall market share in
1993 from 12 per cent to about 25 per cent of the total life and non-life
market. Ms Clare Kwok, deputy managing director of Nelson Hurst Insurance
Brokers (Hong Kong), says that the Chinese carriers have all become much
more aggressive 'mainly in price' over the past three years.
'They used only to do Chinese business. If the risk is small to medium
sized, the rate is very competitive.'
Ming An, which has an estimated market share of about 9 per cent, is
particularly aggressive according to its rivals, picking up CAR and cargo
business.
'We are losing business to Chinese companies as they get better known,' says
one UK underwriter.
A second source of competitive pressure is likely to stem from new overseas
companies licensed to underwrite from Hong Kong. The number of insurance
companies licensed in Hong Kong has fallen in recent years - from more than
300 to 229 at the last count, according to Mr Ip. Yet an increasing number
of overseas companies are interested in obtaining business licences. Most of
the newcomers see involvement in Hong Kong as 'a springboard to access the
Chinese market,' he says.
Last year, Mr Ip gave licences to two European companies, Groupe des
Assurances Nationales of Paris, and Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs of
Aachen. Six further applications are under consideration and several more
foreign companies have expressed interest.
One way or another, the local market looks set for a turbulent time.
Underwriting losses in 1992 fell to HKDollars 13.4m (loss of HKDollars
261.7m) and this positive trend appears to have continued last year.
However, there are signs of a return to fierce competition in the commercial
risks area. Underwriters accept that rates for commercial risks are
insufficient and pressures here could feed through to the rest of the
market, such as motor and personal accident.
